Facts.
P is the common parent of a consolidated group that includes subsidiaries S1, S2, and S3. P owns 100 percent of the stock of S1, S1 owns 100 percent of the stock of S2, and S2 owns 100 percent of the stock of S3. None of P, S1, S2, or S3 had a separate return limitation year prior to Year 1. In Year 1, the P group sustained a $150 consolidated net operating loss. Under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), of that amount, $50 was attributable to S2, and $100 was attributable to S3. In Year 2, the P group sustained a $50 consolidated net operating loss. Under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), of that amount, $40 was attributable to S1 and $10 was attributable to S2. In Year 3, S1 realized $170 of excluded COD income from the discharge of non-intercompany indebtedness. In that same year, the P group sustained a $50 consolidated net operating loss, of which $10 was attributable to S1, $20 was attributable to S2, and $20 was attributable to S3 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv). At the beginning of Year 4, S1's only asset was the stock of S2, and S2's only asset was the stock of S3 with a value of $10. After the computation of tax imposed for Year 3 and before the application of sections 108 and 1017 and this section, S1's stock of S2 had a basis of $120 and S2's stock of S3 had a basis of $180. In addition, none of S1, S2, and S3 had any liabilities.

Analysis
—(A)
Reduction of tax attributes attributable to debtor.
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the tax attributes attributable to S1 must first be reduced to take into account its excluded COD income in the amount of $170.

)
Reduction of net operating losses.
Pursuant to section 108(b)(2)(A) and paragraph (a) of this section, the net operating loss and the net operating loss carryovers attributable to S1 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv) are reduced in the order prescribed by section 108(b)(4)(B). Accordingly, the consolidated net operating loss for Year 3 is reduced by $10, the portion of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to S1, to $40. Then, the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 2 is reduced by $40, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S1, to $10.
(

)
Reduction of basis.
Following the reduction of the net operating loss and the net operating loss carryovers attributable to S1, S1 reduces its basis in its assets pursuant to section 1017 and § 1.1017-1. Accordingly, S1 reduces its basis in the stock of S2 by $120, from $120 to $0.
(B)
Tiering down of stock basis reduction to S2.
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, for purposes of sections 108 and 1017 and this section, S2 is treated as realizing $120 of excluded COD income. Pursuant to section 108(b)(2)(A) and paragraph (a) of this section, therefore, the net operating loss and net operating loss carryovers attributable to S2 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv) are reduced in the order prescribed by section 108(b)(4)(B). Accordingly, the consolidated net operating loss for Year 3 is further reduced by $20, the portion of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to S2, to $20. Then, the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is reduced by $50, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S2, to $100. Then, the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 2 is further reduced by $10, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S2, to $0. Following the reduction of the net operating loss and the net operating loss carryovers attributable to S2, S2 reduces its basis in its assets pursuant to section 1017 and § 1.1017-1. Accordingly, S2 reduces its basis in its S3 stock by $40 to $140.
(C)
Tiering down of stock basis reduction to S3.
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, for purposes of sections 108 and 1017 and this section, S3 is treated as realizing $40 of excluded COD income. Pursuant to section 108(b)(2)(A) and paragraph (a) of this section, therefore, the net operating loss and the net operating loss carryovers attributable to S3 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv) are reduced in the order prescribed by section 108(b)(4)(B). Accordingly, the consolidated net operating loss for Year 3 is further reduced by $20, the portion of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to S3, to $0. Then, the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is reduced by $20, the lesser of the portion of that consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S3 and the remaining excluded COD income, to $80.

# Example 4.
(i)
Facts.
P is the common parent of a consolidated group that includes subsidiaries S1, S2, and S3. P owns 100 percent of the stock of each of S1 and S2. Each of S1 and S2 owns stock of S3 that represents 50 percent of the value of the stock of S3. None of P, S1, S2, or S3 had a separate return limitation year prior to Year 1. In Year 1, the P group sustained a $160 consolidated net operating loss. Under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), of that amount, $10 was attributable to P, $50 was attributable to S2, and $100 was attributable to S3. In Year 2, the P group sustained a $110 consolidated net operating loss. Under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), of that amount, $40 was attributable to S1 and $70 was attributable to S2. In Year 3, S1 realized $200 of excluded COD income from the discharge of non-intercompany indebtedness, and S2 realized $270 of excluded COD income from the discharge of non-intercompany indebtedness. In that
same year, the P group sustained a $50 consolidated net operating loss, of which $10 was attributable to S1, $20 was attributable to S2, and $20 was attributable to S3 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv). At the beginning of Year 4, S3 had one asset with a value of $10. After the computation of tax imposed for Year 3 and before the application of sections 108 and 1017 and this section, S1's basis in its S3 stock was $60, S2's basis in its S3 stock was $120, and S3's asset had a basis of $200. In addition, none of S1, S2, and S3 had any liabilities.

Analysis
—(A)
Reduction of tax attributes attributable to debtors.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the tax attributes attributable to each of S1 and S2 are reduced pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Then, pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the tax attributes attributable to S3 are reduced so as to reflect a reduction of S1's and S2's basis in the stock of S3. Then, paragraph (a)(4) is applied to reduce additional tax attributes.
(1)
Reduction of net operating losses generally.
Pursuant to section 108(b)(2)(A) and paragraph (a) of this section, the net operating losses and the net operating loss carryovers attributable to S1 and S2 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv) are reduced in the order prescribed by section 108(b)(4)(B).
(2)
Reduction of net operating losses attributable to S1.
The consolidated net operating loss for Year 3 is reduced by $10, the portion of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to S1, to $40. Then, the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 2 is reduced by $40, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S1, to $70.
(3)
Reduction of net operating losses attributable to S2.
The consolidated net operating loss for Year 3 is also reduced by $20, the portion of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to S2, to $20. Then, the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is reduced by $50, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S2, to $110. Then, the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 2 is reduced by $70, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S2, to $0.
(4)
Reduction of basis.
Following the reduction of the net operating losses and the net operating loss carryovers attributable to S1 and S2, S1 and S2 must reduce their basis in their assets pursuant to section 1017 and § 1.1017-1. Accordingly, S1 reduces its basis in the stock of S3 by $60, from $60 to $0, and S2 reduces its basis in the stock of S3 by $120, from $120 to $0.
(B)
Tiering down of basis reduction.
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, for purposes of sections 108 and 1017 and this section, S3 is treated as realizing $180 of excluded COD income. Pursuant to section 108(b)(2)(A) and paragraph (a) of this section, therefore, the net operating loss and the net operating loss carryovers attributable to S3 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv) are reduced in the order prescribed by section 108(b)(4)(B). Accordingly, the consolidated net operating loss for Year 3 is further reduced by $20, the portion of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to S3, to $0. Then, the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is reduced by $100, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S3, to $10. Following the reduction of the net operating loss and the net operating loss carryover attributable to S3, S3 reduces its basis in its asset pursuant to section 1017 and § 1.1017-1. Accordingly, S3 reduces its basis in its asset by $60, from $200 to $140.
(C)
Reduction of remaining consolidated tax attributes.
Finally, pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the remaining $90 of S1's excluded COD income and the remaining $10 of S2's excluded COD income reduce the remaining consolidated tax attributes. In particular, the remaining $10 consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is reduced by $10 to $0. Because that amount is less than the aggregate amount of remaining excluded COD income, such income is applied on a pro rata basis to reduce the remaining consolidated tax attributes. Accordingly, $9 of S1's remaining excluded COD income and $1 of S2's remaining excluded COD income is applied to reduce the remaining consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 1. Consequently, of S1's excluded COD income of $200, only $119 is applied to reduce tax attributes, and, of S2's excluded COD income of $270, only $261 is applied to reduce tax attributes.

Facts.
P is the common parent of a consolidated group that includes subsidiaries S1, S2, and S3. P owns 100 percent of the stock of S1 and S2, and S1 owns 100 percent of the stock of S3. None of P, S1, S2, or S3 has a separate return limitation year prior to Year 1. In Year 1, the P group sustained a $90 consolidated net operating loss. Under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), of that amount, $10 was attributable to P, $15 was attributable to S1, $20 was attributable to S2, and $45 was attributable to S3. On January 1 of Year 2, P realized $140 of excluded COD income from the discharge of non-intercompany indebtedness. On December 31 of Year 2, S1 issued stock representing 50 percent of the vote and value of its outstanding stock to a person that was not a member of the group. As a result of the issuance of stock, S1 and S3 ceased to be members of the P group. For the consolidated return year of Year 2, the P group sustained a $60 consolidated net operating loss, of which $5 was attributable to S1, $40 was attributable to S2, and $15 was attributable
to S3 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv). As of the beginning of Year 3, P's only assets were the stock of S1 and S2, S1's sole asset was the stock of S3, S2 had Asset A with a value of $10, and S3 had Asset B with a value of $10. After the computation of tax imposed for Year 2 and before the application of sections 108 and 1017 and this section, P had a $80 basis in the S1 stock and a $50 basis in the S2 stock, S1 had a $80 basis in the S3 stock, and Asset A and B each had a basis of $10. In addition, none of P, S1, S2, and S3 had any liabilities.
(ii)
Analysis.
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the tax attributes attributable to P must first be reduced to take into account its excluded COD income in the amount of $140.
(A)
Reduction of net operating losses.
Pursuant to section 108(b)(2)(A) and paragraph (a) of this section, the net operating loss and the net operating loss carryover attributable to P under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv) are reduced in the order prescribed by section 108(b)(4)(B). Accordingly, the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is reduced by $10, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to P, to $80.
(B)
Reduction of basis.
Following the reduction of the net operating loss and the net operating loss carryover attributable to P, P reduces its basis in its assets pursuant to section 1017 and § 1.1017-1. Accordingly, P reduces its basis in the stock of S1 by $80, from $80 to $0, and its basis in the stock of S2 by $50, from $50 to $0.
(C)
Tiering down of stock basis reduction to S1.
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, for purposes of sections 108 and 1017 and this section, S1 is treated as realizing $80 of excluded COD income, despite the fact that it ceases to be a member of the group at the end of the day on December 31 of Year 2. Pursuant to section 108(b)(2)(A) and paragraph (a) of this section, therefore, the net operating loss and net operating loss carryovers attributable to S1 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv) are reduced in the order prescribed by section 108(b)(4)(B). Accordingly, the consolidated net operating loss for Year 2 is reduced by $5, the portion of the consolidated net operating loss for Year 2 attributable to S1, to $55. Then, the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is reduced by an additional $15, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S1, to $65. Following the reduction of the net operating loss and the net operating loss carryover attributable to S1, S1 reduces its basis in its assets pursuant to section 1017 and § 1.1017-1. Accordingly, S1 reduces its basis in the stock of S3 by $60, from $80 to $20.
(D)
Tiering down of stock basis reduction to S2.
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, for purposes of sections 108 and 1017 and this section, S2 is treated as realizing $50 of excluded COD income. Pursuant to section 108(b)(2)(A) and paragraph (a) of this section, therefore, the net operating loss and net operating loss carryovers attributable to S2 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv) are reduced in the order prescribed by section 108(b)(4)(B). Accordingly, the consolidated net operating loss for Year 2 is reduced by an additional $40, the portion of the consolidated net operating loss for Year 2 attributable to S2, to $15. Then, the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is reduced by an additional $10, a portion of the consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S2, to $55.
(E)
Tiering down of stock basis reduction to S3.
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, for purposes of sections 108 and 1017 and this section, S3 is treated as realizing $60 of excluded COD income (by reason of S1's reduction in its basis of its S3 stock). Pursuant to section 108(b)(2)(A) and paragraph (a) of this section, therefore, the net operating loss and net operating loss carryovers attributable to S3 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv) are reduced in the order prescribed by section 108(b)(4)(B). Accordingly, the consolidated net operating loss for Year 2 is reduced by an additional $15, the portion of the consolidated net operating loss for Year 2 attributable to S3, to $0. Then, the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is reduced by an additional $45, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S3, to $10.

# Example 6.

Facts.
P1 is the common parent of a consolidated group that includes subsidiaries S1, S2, and S3. P1 owns 100 percent of the stock of S1 and S2. S1 owns 100 percent of the stock of S3. None of P1, S1, S2, or S3 has a separate return limitation year prior to Year 1. In Year 1, the P1 group sustained a $120 consolidated net operating loss. Under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), of that amount, $40 was attributable to P1, $35 was attributable to S1, $30 was attributable to S2, and $15 was attributable to S3. On January 1 of Year 2, S3 realized $65 of excluded COD income from the discharge of non-intercompany indebtedness. On June 30 of Year 2, S3 issued stock representing 80 percent of the vote and value of its outstanding stock to P2, the common parent of another group. As a result of the issuance of stock, S3 ceased to be a member of the P1 group and became a member of the P2 group. For the consolidated return year of Year 2, the P1 group sustained a $50 consolidated net operating loss, of which $5 was attributable to S1, $40 was attributable to S2, and $5 was attributable to S3 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv). As of the beginning of its taxable year beginning on July 1 of Year 2, S3's sole asset was Asset A with a $10 value. After the computation of tax imposed for Year 2 on the
P1 group and before the application of sections 108 and 1017 and this section and the computation of tax imposed for Year 2 on the P2 group, Asset A had a basis of $0. In addition, S3 had no liabilities. On January 1 of Year 3, P1 sold all of its stock of S1.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Reduction of tax attributes attributable to debtor.
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the tax attributes attributable to S3 must first be reduced to take into account its excluded COD income in the amount of $65. Pursuant to section 108(b)(2)(A) and paragraph (a) of this section, the net operating loss and the net operating loss carryover attributable to S3 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv) are reduced in the order prescribed by section 108(b)(4)(B). Accordingly, the consolidated net operating loss for Year 2 is reduced by $5, the portion of the consolidated net operating loss for Year 2 attributable to S3, to $45. Then, the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is reduced by $15, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S3, to $105.
(B)
Reduction of remaining consolidated tax attributes.
Pursuant to paragraphs (a)(4) and (b)(8) of this section, S3's remaining $45 of excluded COD income reduces the remaining consolidated tax attributes in the P1 group. In particular, the remaining $45 consolidated net operating loss for Year 2 is reduced by an additional $45 to $0.
(C)
Basis Adjustments.
For purposes of computing P1's gain or loss on the sale of the S1 stock in Year 3, P1's basis in its S1 stock will reflect a net positive adjustment of $40, which is the excess of the amount of S3's excluded COD income that is applied to reduce attributes ($65) over the reduction of S1's and S3's attributes in respect of such excluded COD income ($25).

# Example 7.
(i)
Facts.
P is the common parent of a consolidated group that includes subsidiaries S1 and S2. P owns 100 percent of the stock of S1, and S1 owns 100 percent of the stock of S2. None of P, S1, or S2 has a separate return limitation year prior to Year 1. In Year 1, the P group sustained a $50 consolidated net operating loss. Under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), of that amount, $10 was attributable to P, $20 was attributable to S1, and $20 was attributable to S2. On January 1 of Year 2, S1 realized $55 of excluded COD income from the discharge of non-intercompany indebtedness. On June 30 of Year 2, P transferred all of its assets to S1 in a transaction to which section 381(a) applied. As a result of that transaction, pursuant to § 1.1502-75(d)(2)(ii), S1 succeeded P as the common parent of the group. Pursuant to § 1.1502-75(d)(2)(iii), S1's taxable year closed on the date of the acquisition. However, P's taxable year did not close. On the consolidated return for Year 2, the group sustained a $50 consolidated net operating loss. Under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), of that amount, $10 was attributable to S1 for its taxable year that ended on June 30, $15 was attributable to S1 as the successor of P, and $25 was attributable to S2.
(ii)
Analysis.
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the tax attributes attributable to S1 must first be reduced to take into account its excluded COD income in the amount of $55. For this purpose, S1's attributes that remain after the determination of tax for the group for Year 2 are subject to reduction. Pursuant to section 108(b)(2)(A) and paragraph (a) of this section, the net operating loss and the net operating loss carryover attributable to S1 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv) are reduced. Accordingly, the consolidated net operating loss for Year 2 is reduced by $25, the portion of the consolidated net operating loss for Year 2 attributable to S1, to $25. Then, the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is reduced by $30, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S1 (which includes the portion attributable to P), to $20.

# Basis, Stock Ownership, and Earnings and Profits Rules
§ 1.1502-30
Stock basis after certain triangular reorganizations.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides rules for determining the basis of the stock of an acquiring corporation as a result
of a triangular reorganization. The definitions and nomenclature contained in § 1.358-6 apply to this section.
(b)
General rules
—(1)
Forward triangular merger, triangular C reorganization, or triangular B reorganization. P
adjusts its basis in the stock of S as a result of a forward triangular merger, triangular C reorganization, or triangular B reorganization under § 1.358-6(c) and (d), except that § 1.358-6 (c)(1)(ii) and (d)(2) do not apply. Instead,
P
adjusts such basis by taking into account the full amount of—
(i)
T
liabilities assumed by
S
or the amount of liabilities to which the
T
assets acquired by
S
are subject, and
(ii) The fair market value of any consideration not provided by
P
pursuant to the plan of reorganization.
(2)
Reverse triangular merger.
If
P
adjusts its basis in the
T
stock acquired as a result of a reverse triangular merger under § 1.358-6 (c)(2)(i) and (d), § 1.358-6 (c)(1)(ii) and (d)(2) do not apply. Instead,
P
adjusts such basis by taking into account the full amount of—
(i)
T
liabilities deemed assumed by
S
or the amount of liabilities to which the
T
assets deemed acquired by
S
are subject, and
(ii) The fair market value of any consideration not provided by
P
pursuant to the plan of reorganization.
(3)
Excess loss accounts.
Negative adjustments under this section may exceed
P
's basis in its
S
or
T
stock. The resulting negative amount is
P
's excess loss account in its
S
or
T
stock. See § 1.1502-19 for rules treating excess loss accounts as negative basis, and treating references to stock basis as including references to excess loss accounts.
(4)
Application of other rules of law.
If a transaction otherwise subject to this section is also a group structure change subject to § 1.1502-31, the provisions of § 1.1502-31 and not this section apply to determine stock basis. See § 1.1502-80(a) regarding the general applicability of other rules of law and a limitation on duplicative adjustments. See § 1.1502-80(d) for the non-application of section 357(c) to P.
(5)
Examples.
The rules of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following examples. For purposes of these examples,
P, S,
and
T
are domestic corporations,
P
and
S
file consolidated returns,
P
owns all of the only class of
S
stock, the
P
stock exchanged in the transaction satisfies the requirements of the applicable triangular reorganization provisions, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, and tax liabilities are disregarded.

# Example 1. Liabilities.
(a)
Facts. T
has assets with an aggregate basis of $60 and fair market value of $100.
T
's assets are subject to $70 of liabilities. Pursuant to a plan,
P
forms
S
with $5 of cash (which S retains), and
T
merges into
S.
In the merger, the
T
shareholders receive
P
stock worth $30 in exchange for their
T
stock. The transaction is a reorganization to which sections 368 (a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(D) apply.
(b)
Basis adjustment.
Under § 1.358-6,
P
adjusts its $5 basis in the
S
stock as if
P
had acquired the
T
assets with a carryover basis under section 362 and transferred these assets to
S
in a transaction in which
P
determines its basis in the
S
stock under section 358. Under the rules of this section, the limitation described in § 1.358-6(c)(1)(ii) does not apply. Thus,
P
adjusts its basis in the
S
stock by -$10 (the aggregate adjusted basis of
T
's assets decreased by the amount of liabilities to which the
T
assets are subject). Consequently, as a result of the reorganization,
P
has an excess loss account of $5 in its
S
stock.

# Example 2. Consideration not provided by P.
(a)
Facts. T
has assets with an aggregate basis of $10 and fair market value of $100 and no liabilities.
S
is an operating company with substantial assets that has been in existence for several years.
P
has a $5 basis in its
S
stock. Pursuant to a plan,
T
merges into
S
and the
T
shareholders receive $70 of
P
stock provided by
P
pursuant to the plan of reorganization and $30 of cash provided by
S
in exchange for their
T
stock. The transaction is a reorganization to which sections 368 (a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(D) apply.
(b)
Basis adjustment.
Under § 1.358-6,
P
adjusts its $5 basis in the
S
stock as if
P
had acquired the
T
assets with a carryover basis under section 362 and transferred these assets to
S
in a transaction in which
P
determines its basis in the
S
stock under section 358. Under the rules of this section, the limitation described in § 1.358-6(d)(2) does not apply. Thus,
P
adjusts its basis in the
S
stock by -$20 (the aggregate adjusted basis of
T
's assets decreased by the fair market value of the consideration provided by
S
). As a result of the reorganization,
P
has an excess loss account of $15 in its
S
stock.
(c)
Appreciated asset.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 2,
except that in the reorganization
S
provides an asset with a $20 adjusted basis and $30 fair market value instead of $30 cash. The basis is adjusted in the same manner as in paragraph
(b) of this
Example 2.
In addition, because
S
recognizes a $10 gain from the asset under section 1001,
P
's basis in its
S
stock is increased under § 1.1502-32(b) by
S
's $10 gain. Consequently, as a result of the reorganization,
P
has an excess loss account of $5 in its
S
stock. (The results would be the same if the appreciated asset provided by
S
was
P
stock with respect to which
S
recognized gain. See § 1.1032-2(c)).

# Example 3. Reverse triangular merger.
(a)
Facts. T
has assets with an aggregate basis of $60 and fair market value of $100.
T
's assets are subject to $70 of liabilities.
P
owns all of the only class of
S
stock.
P
has a $5 basis in its
S
stock. Pursuant to a plan,
S
merges into
T
with
T
surviving. In the merger, the
T
shareholders exchange their
T
stock for $2 cash from
P
and $28 worth of
P
stock provided by
P
pursuant to the plan. The transaction is a reorganization to which sections 368 (a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(E) apply.
(b)
Basis adjustment.
Under § 1.358-6,
P
's basis in the
T
stock acquired equals its $5 basis in its
S
stock immediately before the transaction adjusted by the $60 basis in the
T
assets deemed transferred, and the $70 of liabilities to which the
T
assets are subject. Under the rules of this section, the limitation described in § 1.358-6(c)(1)(ii) does not apply. Consequently,
P
has an excess loss account of $5 in its
T
stock as a result of the transaction.
(c)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to reorganizations occurring on or after December 21, 1995. However, paragraph (b)(4) of this section applies to reorganizations occurring on or after September 17, 2008.
[T.D. 8648, 60 FR 66082, Dec. 21, 1995, as amended by T.D. 9424, 73 FR 53949, Sept. 17, 2008]
§ 1.1502-31
Stock basis after a group structure change.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Overview.
If one corporation (P) succeeds another corporation (T) under the principles of § 1.1502-75(d) (2) or (3) as the common parent of a consolidated group in a group structure change, the basis of members in the stock of the former common parent (or the stock of a successor) is adjusted or determined under this section. See § 1.1502-33(f)(1) for the definition of group structure change. For example, if P owns all of the stock of another corporation (S), and T merges into S in a group structure change that is a reorganization described in section 368(a)(2)(D) in which P becomes the common parent of the T group, P's basis in S's stock must be adjusted to reflect the change in S's assets and liabilities. The rules of this section coordinate with the earnings and profits adjustments required under § 1.1502-33(f)(1), generally conforming the results of transactions in which the T group continues under § 1.1502-75 with P as the common parent. By preserving in P the relationship between T's earnings and profits and asset basis, these adjustments limit possible distortions under section 1502 (e.g., in the deconsolidation rules for earnings and profits under § 1.1502-33(e), and the continued filing requirements under § 1.1502-75(a)). This section applies whether or not T continues to exist after the group structure change.
(2)
Application of other rules of law.
If a transaction subject to this section is also a triangular reorganization otherwise subject to § 1.1502-30, the provisions of this section and not those of § 1.1502-30 apply to determine stock basis. See § 1.1502-80(a) regarding the general applicability of other rules of law and a limitation on duplicative adjustments.
(b)
General rules.
Except as otherwise provided in this section—
(1)
Asset acquisitions.
If a corporation acquires the former common parent's assets (and any liabilities assumed or to which the assets are subject) in a group structure change, the basis of members in the stock of the acquiring corporation is adjusted immediately after the group structure change to reflect the acquiring corporation's allocable share of the former common parent's net asset basis as determined under paragraph (c) of this section. For example, if S acquires all of T's assets in a group structure change that is a reorganization described in section 368(a)(2)(D), P's basis in S's stock is adjusted to reflect T's net asset basis. If P owned some of T's stock before the group structure change, the results would be the same because P's basis in the T stock is not taken into account in determining P's basis in S's stock. If T's net asset basis is a negative amount, it reduces P's basis in S's stock and, if the reduction exceeds P's basis in S's stock, the excess is P's excess loss account in S's stock. See § 1.1502-19 for rules treating P's excess
loss account as negative basis, and treating a reference to P's basis in S's stock as including an excess loss account.
(2)
Stock acquisitions.
If a corporation acquires stock of the former common parent in a group structure change, the basis of the members in the former common parent's stock immediately after the group structure change (including any stock of the former common parent owned before the group structure change) that is, or would otherwise be, transferred basis property is redetermined in accordance with the results for an asset acquisition described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. For example, if all of T's stock is contributed to P in a group structure change to which section 351 applies, P's basis in T's stock is T's net asset basis, rather than the amount determined under section 362. Similarly, if S merges into T in a group structure change described in section 368(a)(2)(E) and P acquires all of the T stock, P's basis in T's stock is the basis that P would have in S's stock under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if T had merged into S in a group structure change described in section 368(a)(2)(D).
(c)
Net asset basis.
The former common parent's net asset basis is the basis it would have in the stock of a newly formed subsidiary, if—
(1) The former common parent transferred its assets (and any liabilities assumed or to which the assets are subject) to the subsidiary in a transaction to which section 351 applies;
(2) The former common parent and the subsidiary were members of the same consolidated group (see § 1.1502-80(d) for the non-application of section 357(c) to the transfer); and
(3) The asset basis taken into account is each asset's basis immediately after the group structure change (e.g., taking into account any income or gain recognized in the group structure change and reflected in the asset's basis).
(d)
Additional adjustments.
In addition to the adjustments in paragraph (b) of this section, the following adjustments are made:
(1)
Consideration not provided by P.
The basis is reduced to reflect the fair market value of any consideration not provided by the member. For example, if S acquires T's assets in a group structure change described in section 368(a)(2)(D), and S provides an appreciated asset (e.g., stock of P) as partial consideration in the transaction, P's basis in S's stock is reduced by the fair market value of the asset.
(2)
Allocable share
—(i)
Asset acquisitions.
If a corporation receives less than all of the former common parent's assets and liabilities in the group structure change, the former common parent's net asset basis taken into account under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is adjusted accordingly.
(ii)
Stock acquisitions.
If less than all of the former common parent's stock is subject to the redetermination described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the percentage of the former common parent's net asset basis taken into account in the redetermination equals the percentage (by fair market value) of the former common parent's stock subject to the redetermination. For example, if P owns less than all of the former common parent's stock immediately after the group structure change and such stock would otherwise be transferred basis property, only an allocable part of the basis determined under this section is reflected in the shares owned by P (and the amount allocable to shares owned by nonmembers has no effect on the basis of their shares). Alternatively, if P acquired 10 percent of the former common parent's stock in a transaction in which the stock basis was determined by P's cost, and P later acquires the remaining 90 percent of the former common parent's stock in a separate transaction that is described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, P retains its cost basis in its original stock and the basis of P's newly acquired shares reflects only an allocable part of the former common parent's net asset basis.
(3)
Allocation among shares of stock.
The basis determined under this section is allocated among shares under the principles of section 358. For example, if P owns multiple classes of the former common parent's stock immediately after the group structure change, only an allocable part of the basis determined under this section is reflected in the basis of each share. See
§ 1.1502-19(d), for special allocations with respect to excess loss accounts.
(4)
Higher-tier members.
To the extent that the former common parent is owned by members other than the new common parent, the basis of members in the stock of all subsidiaries owning, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, an interest in the former common parent's assets or liabilities is adjusted in accordance with the principles of this section. The adjustments are applied in the order of the tiers, from the lowest to the highest.
(e)
Waiver of loss carryovers of former common parent
—(1)
General rule.
An irrevocable election may be made to treat all or any portion of a loss carryover attributable to the common parent as expiring for all Federal income tax purposes immediately before the group structure change. Thus, if the loss carryover is treated as expiring under the election, it will not result in a negative adjustment to the basis of P's stock under § 1.1502-32(b).
(2)
Election.
The election described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section must be made in a separate statement entitled, “ELECTION TO TREAT LOSS CARRYOVER AS EXPIRING UNDER § 1.1502-31(e).” The election must be filed by including the statement on or with the consolidated group's income tax return for the year that includes the group structure change. The statement must identify the amount of each loss carryover deemed to expire (or the amount of each loss carryover deemed not to expire, with any balance of any loss carryovers being deemed to expire).
(f)
Predecessors and successors.
For purposes of this section, any reference to a corporation includes a reference to a successor or predecessor as the context may require. See § 1.1502-32(f) for definitions of predecessor and successor.
(g)
Examples.
For purposes of the examples in this section, unless otherwise stated, all corporations have only one class of stock outstanding, the tax year of all persons is the calendar year, all persons use the accrual method of accounting, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, all transactions are between unrelated persons, and tax liabilities are disregarded. The principles of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1. Forward triangular merger.
(i)
Facts.
P is the common parent of one group and T is the common parent of another. T has assets with an aggregate basis of $60 and fair market value of $100 and no liabilities. T's shareholders have an aggregate basis of $50 in T's stock. In Year 1, pursuant to a plan, P forms S and T merges into S with the T shareholders receiving $100 of P stock in exchange for their T stock. The transaction is a reorganization described in section 368(a)(2)(D). The transaction is also a reverse acquisition under § 1.1502-75(d)(3) because the T shareholders, as a result of owning T's stock, own more than 50% of the value of P's stock immediately after the transaction. Thus, the transaction is a group structure change under § 1.1502-33(f)(1), and P's earnings and profits are adjusted to reflect T's earnings and profits immediately before T ceases to be the common parent of the T group.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, P's basis in S's stock is adjusted to reflect T's net asset basis. Under paragraph (c) of this section, T's net asset basis is $60, the basis T would have in the stock of a subsidiary under section 358 if T had transferred all of its assets and liabilities to the subsidiary in a transaction to which section 351 applies. Thus, P has a $60 basis in S's stock.
(iii)
Pre-existing S.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 1,
except that P has owned the stock of S for several years and P has a $50 basis in the S stock before the merger with T. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, P's $50 basis in S's stock is adjusted to reflect T's net asset basis. Thus, P's basis in S's stock is $110 ($50 plus $60).
(iv)
Excess loss account included in former common parent's net asset basis.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 1,
except that T has two assets, an operating asset with an $80 basis and $90 fair market value, and stock of a subsidiary with a $20 excess loss account and $10 fair market value. Under paragraph (c) of this section, T's net asset basis is $60 ($80 minus $20).
See
sections 351 and 358, and § 1.1502-19. Consequently, P has a $60 basis in S's stock. Under section 362 and § 1.1502-19, S has an $80 basis in the operating asset and a $20 excess loss account in the stock of the subsidiary.
(v)
Liabilities in excess of basis.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 1,
except that T's assets have a fair market value of $170 (and $60 basis) and are subject to $70 of liabilities. Under paragraph (c) of this section, T's net asset basis is negative $10 ($60 minus $70).
See
sections 351 and 358, and §§ 1.1502-19 and 1.1502-80(d). Thus, P has a $10 excess loss account in S's stock. Under section 362, S has a $60 basis in its assets
(which are subject to $70 of liabilities). (Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, because the liabilities are taken into account in determining net asset basis under paragraph (c) of this section, the liabilities are not also taken into account as consideration not provided by P under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.)
(vi)
Consideration provided by S.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 1,
except that P forms S with a $100 contribution at the beginning of Year 1, and during Year 6, pursuant to a plan, S purchases $100 of P stock and T merges into S with the T shareholders receiving P stock in exchange for their T stock. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, P's $100 basis in S's stock is increased by $60 to reflect T's net asset basis. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, P's basis in S's stock is decreased by $100 (the fair market value of the P stock) because the P stock purchased by S and used in the transaction is consideration not provided by P.
(vii)
Appreciated asset provided by S.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 1,
except that P has owned the stock of S for several years, and the shareholders of T receive $60 of P stock and an asset of S with a $30 adjusted basis and $40 fair market value. S recognizes a $10 gain from the asset under section 1001. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, P's basis in S's stock is increased by $60 to reflect T's net asset basis. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, P's basis in S's stock is decreased by $40 (the fair market value of the asset provided by S). In addition, P's basis in S's stock is increased under § 1.1502-32(b) by S's $10 gain.
(viii)
Depreciated asset provided by S.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 1,
except that P has owned the stock of S for several years, and the shareholders of T receive $60 of P stock and an asset of S with a $50 adjusted basis and $40 fair market value. S recognizes a $10 loss from the asset under section 1001. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, P's basis in S's stock is increased by $60 to reflect T's net asset basis. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, P's basis in S's stock is decreased by $40 (the fair market value of the asset provided by S). In addition, S's $10 loss is taken into account under § 1.1502-32(b) in determining P's basis adjustments under that section.

# Example 2. Stock acquisition.
(i)
Facts.
P is the common parent of one group and T is the common parent of another. T has assets with an aggregate basis of $60 and fair market value of $100 and no liabilities. T's shareholders have an aggregate basis of $50 in T's stock. Pursuant to a plan, P forms S and S acquires all of T's stock in exchange for P stock in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(B). The transaction is also a reverse acquisition under § 1.1502-75(d)(3). Thus, the transaction is a group structure change under § 1.1502-33(f)(1), and the earnings and profits of P and S are adjusted to reflect T's earnings and profits immediately before T ceases to be the common parent of the T group.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, although S is not the new common parent of the T group, adjustments must be made to S's basis in T's stock in accordance with the principles of this section. Although S's basis in T's stock would ordinarily be determined under section 362 by reference to the basis of T's shareholders in T's stock immediately before the group structure change, under the principles of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, S's basis in T's stock is determined by reference to T's net asset basis. Thus, S's basis in T's stock is $60.
(iii)
Higher-tier adjustments.
Under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, P's basis in S's stock is increased by $60 (to be consistent with the adjustment to S's basis in T's stock).
(iv)
Cross ownership.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 2
, except S purchased 10% of T's stock from an unrelated person for cash. In an unrelated transaction, S acquires the remaining 90% of T's stock in exchange for P stock. S's basis in the initial 10% of T's stock is not redetermined under this section. However, S's basis in the additional 90% of T's stock is redetermined under this section. S's basis in that stock is adjusted to $54 (90% of T's net asset basis).
(v)
Allocable share.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 2,
except that P owns only 90% of S's stock immediately after the group structure change. S's basis in T's stock is the same as in paragraph (ii) of this
Example 2.
Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, P's basis in its S stock is increased by $54 (90% of S's $60 adjustment).

# Example 3. Taxable stock acquisition.
(i)
Facts.
P is the common parent of one group and T is the common parent of another. T has assets with an aggregate basis of $60 and fair market value of $100 and no liabilities. T's shareholders have an aggregate basis of $50 in T's stock. Pursuant to a plan, P acquires all of T's stock in exchange for $70 of P's stock and $30 in a transaction that is a group structure change under § 1.1502-33(f)(1). P's acquired T stock is not transferred basis property. (Because of P's use of cash, the acquisition is not a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(B).)
(ii)
Analysis.
The rules of this section do not apply to determine P's basis in T's stock. Therefore, P's basis in T's stock is $100.
(h)
Effective/applicability dates
—(1)
General rule.
This section applies to group structure changes that occur after April 26, 2004. However, a group
may apply this section to group structure changes that occurred on or before April 26, 2004, and in consolidated return years beginning on or after January 1, 1995. In addition, paragraph (a)(2) of this section applies to group structure changes that occurred on or after September 17, 2008. Paragraph (e)(2) of this section applies to any original consolidated Federal income tax return due (without extensions) after June 14, 2007. For original consolidated Federal income tax returns due (without extensions) after May 30, 2006, and on or before June 14, 2007, see § 1.1502-31T as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on April 1, 2007. For original consolidated Federal income tax returns due (without extensions) on or before May 30, 2006, see § 1.1502-31 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on April 1, 2006.
(2)
Prior law.
For group structure changes that occur on or before April 26, 2004, and in consolidated return years beginning on or after January 1, 1995, with respect to which the group does not elect to apply the provisions of this section, see § 1.1502-31 as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 2003. For group structure changes that occur in consolidated return years beginning before January 1, 1995, see § 1.1502-31T as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1994.

§ 1.1502-32
Investment adjustments.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Purpose.
This section provides rules for adjusting the basis of the stock of a subsidiary (S) owned by another member (M). These rules modify the determination of M's basis in S's stock under applicable rules of law by adjusting M's basis to reflect S's distributions and S's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss taken into account for the period that S is a member of the consolidated group. The purpose of the adjustments is to treat M and S as a single entity so that consolidated taxable income reflects the group's income. For example, if M forms S with a $100 contribution, and S takes into account $10 of income, M's $100 basis in S's stock under section 358 is increased by $10 under this section to prevent S's income from being taken into account a second time on M's disposition of S's stock. Comparable adjustments are made for tax-exempt income and noncapital, nondeductible expenses that S takes into account, to preserve their treatment under the Internal Revenue Code.
(2)
Application of other rules of law, duplicative adjustments.
See § 1.1502-80(a) regarding the general applicability of other rules of law and a limitation on duplicative adjustments. The rules of this section are in addition to other rules of law. See, e.g., section 358 (basis determinations for distributees), section 1016 (adjustments to basis), § 1.1502-11(b) (limitations on the use of losses), § 1.1502-19 (treatment of excess loss accounts), § 1.1502-31 (basis after a group structure change), and § 1.1502-35 (additional rules relating to stock loss, including losses attributable to worthlessness and certain dispositions not followed by a separate return year). M's basis in S's stock must not be adjusted under this section and other rules of law in a manner that has the effect of duplicating an adjustment.
(3)
Overview
—(i)
In general.
The amount of the stock basis adjustments and their timing are determined under paragraph (b) of this section. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the amount of the adjustment is allocated among the shares of S's stock. Paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section provide definitions, an anti-avoidance rule, successor rules, and recordkeeping requirements.
(ii)
Excess loss account.
Negative adjustments under this section may exceed M's basis in S's stock. The resulting negative amount is M's excess loss account in S's stock. See § 1.1502-19 for rules treating excess loss accounts as negative basis, and treating references to stock basis as including references to excess loss accounts.
(iii)
Tiering up of adjustments.
The adjustments to S's stock under this section are taken into account in determining adjustments to higher-tier stock. The adjustments are applied in the order of the tiers, from the lowest to the highest. For example, if M is also a subsidiary, M's adjustment to
S's stock is taken into account in determining the adjustments to stock of M owned by other members.
(b)
Stock basis adjustments
—(1)
Timing of adjustments
—(i)
In general.
Adjustments under this section are made as of the close of each consolidated return year, and as of any other time (an interim adjustment) if a determination at that time is necessary to determine a tax liability of any person. For example, adjustments are made as of M's sale of S's stock in order to measure M's gain or loss from the sale, and if M's interest in S's stock is not uniform throughout the year (e.g., because M disposes of a portion of its S stock, or S issues additional shares to another person), the adjustments under this section are made by taking into account the varying interests. An interim adjustment may be necessary even if tax liability is not affected until a later time. For example, if M sells only 50% of S's stock and S becomes a nonmember, adjustments must be made for the retained stock as of the disposition (whether or not M has an excess loss account in that stock). Similarly, if S liquidates during a consolidated return year, adjustments must be made as of the liquidation (even if the liquidation is tax free under section 332).
(ii)
Special rule for discharge of indebtedness income.
Adjustments under this section resulting from the realization of discharge of indebtedness income of a member that is excluded from gross income under section 108(a) (excluded COD income) and from the reduction of attributes in respect thereof pursuant to sections 108 and 1017 and § 1.1502-28 (including reductions in the basis of property) when a member (the departing member) ceases to be a member of the group on or prior to the last day of the consolidated return year that includes the date the excluded COD income is realized are made immediately after the determination of tax for the group for the taxable year during which the excluded COD income is realized (and any prior years) and are effective immediately before the beginning of the taxable year of the departing member following the taxable year during which the excluded COD income is realized. Such adjustments when a corporation (the new member) is not a member of the group on the last day of the consolidated return year that includes the date the excluded COD income is realized but is a member of the group at the beginning of the following consolidated return year are also made immediately after the determination of tax for the group for the taxable year during which the excluded COD income is realized (and any prior years) and are effective immediately before the beginning of the taxable year of the new member following the taxable year during which the excluded COD income is realized. If the new member was a member of another group immediately before it became a member of the group, such adjustments are treated as occurring immediately after it ceases to be a member of the prior group.
(iii)
Allocation of items.
If § 1.1502-76(b) applies to S for purposes of an adjustment before the close of the group's consolidated return year, the amount of the adjustment is determined under that section. If § 1.1502-76(b) does not apply to the interim adjustment, the adjustment is determined under the principles of § 1.1502-76(b), consistently applied, and ratable allocation under the principles of § 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) or (iii) may be used without filing an election under § 1.1502-76(b)(2). The principles would apply, for example, if M becomes a nonmember but S remains a member.
(2)
Amount of adjustments.
M's basis in S's stock is increased by positive adjustments and decreased by negative adjustments under this paragraph (b)(2). The amount of the adjustment, determined as of the time of the adjustment, is the net amount of S's—
(i) Taxable income or loss;
(ii) Tax-exempt income;
(iii) Noncapital, nondeductible expenses; and
(iv) Distributions with respect to S's stock.
(3)
Operating rules.
For purposes of determining M's adjustments to the basis of S's stock under paragraph (b)(2) of this section—
(i)
Taxable income or loss.
S's taxable income or loss is consolidated taxable income (or loss) determined by including only S's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss taken into account in
determining consolidated taxable income (or loss), treating S's deductions and losses as taken into account to the extent they are absorbed by S or any other member. For this purpose:
(A) To the extent that S's deduction or loss is absorbed in the year it arises or is carried forward and absorbed in a subsequent year (e.g., under section 172, 465, or 1212), the deduction or loss is taken into account under paragraph (b)(2) of this section in the year in which it is absorbed.
(B) To the extent that S's deduction or loss is carried back and absorbed in a prior year (whether consolidated or separate), the deduction or loss is taken into account under paragraph (b)(2) of this section in the year in which it arises and not in the year in which it is absorbed.
(ii)
Tax-exempt income
—(A)
In general.
S's tax-exempt income is its income and gain which is taken into account but permanently excluded from its gross income under applicable law, and which increases, directly or indirectly, the basis of its assets (or an equivalent amount). For example, S's dividend income to which § 1.1502-13(f)(2)(ii) applies, and its interest excluded from gross income under section 103, are treated as tax-exempt income. However, S's income not recognized under section 1031 is not treated as tax- exempt income because the corresponding basis adjustments under section 1031(d) prevent S's nonrecognition from being permanent. Similarly, S's tax-exempt income does not include gain not recognized under section 332 from the liquidation of a lower-tier subsidiary, or not recognized under section 118 or section 351 from a transfer of assets to S.
(B)
Equivalent deductions.
To the extent that S's taxable income or gain is permanently offset by a deduction or loss that does not reduce, directly or indirectly, the basis of S's assets (or an equivalent amount), the income or gain is treated as tax-exempt income and is taken into account under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section. In addition, the income and the offsetting item are taken into account under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. For example, if S receives a $100 dividend with respect to which a $70 dividends received deduction is allowed under section 243, $70 of the dividend is treated as tax-exempt income. Accordingly, M's basis in S's stock increases by $100 because the $100 dividend and $70 deduction are taken into account under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section (resulting in $30 of the increase), and $70 of the dividend is also taken into account under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section as tax-exempt income (resulting in $70 of the increase). (See paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section if there is a corresponding negative adjustment under section 1059.) Similarly, income from mineral properties is treated as tax-exempt income to the extent it is offset by deductions for depletion in excess of the basis of the property.
(C)
Discharge of indebtedness income
—(
1
)
In general.
Excluded COD income is treated as tax-exempt income only to the extent the discharge is applied to reduce tax attributes attributable to any member of the group under section 108, section 1017 or § 1.1502-28. However, if S is treated as realizing excluded COD income pursuant to § 1.1502-28(a)(3), S shall not be treated as realizing excluded COD income for purposes of the preceding sentence.
(
2
)
Expired loss carryovers.
If the amount of the discharge exceeds the amount of the attribute reduction under sections 108 and 1017, and § 1.1502-28, the excess nevertheless is treated as applied to reduce tax attributes to the extent a loss carryover attributable to S expired without tax benefit, the expiration was taken into account as a noncapital, nondeductible expense under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, and the loss carryover would have been reduced had it not expired.
(D)
Basis shifts.
An increase in the basis of S's assets (or an equivalent as described in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B) of this section) is treated as tax-exempt income to the extent that the increase is not otherwise taken into account in determining stock basis, it corresponds to a negative adjustment that is taken into account by the group under this paragraph (b) (or incurred by the common parent), and it has the effect (viewing the group in the aggregate) of a permanent recovery of the reduction. For example, S's basis increase under section 50(c)(2) is treated as tax-exempt
income to the extent the preceding basis reduction under section 50(c)(1) is reflected in the basis of a member's stock. On the other hand, if S increases the basis of an asset as the result of an accounting method change, and the related positive section 481(a) adjustment is taken into account over time, the basis increase is not treated as tax-exempt income.
(E) [Reserved]
(iii)
Noncapital, nondeductible expenses
—(A)
In general.
S's noncapital, nondeductible expenses are its deductions and losses that are taken into account but permanently disallowed or eliminated under applicable law in determining its taxable income or loss, and that decrease, directly or indirectly, the basis of its assets (or an equivalent amount). For example, S's Federal taxes described in section 275 and loss not recognized under section 311(a) are noncapital, nondeductible expenses. Similarly, if a loss carryover (e.g., under section 172 or 1212) attributable to S expires or is reduced under section 108(b) and § 1.1502-28, it becomes a noncapital, nondeductible expense at the close of the last tax year to which it may be carried. However, when a tax attribute attributable to S is reduced as required pursuant to § 1.1502-28(a)(3), the reduction of the tax attribute is not treated as a noncapital, nondeductible expense of S. Finally, if S sells and repurchases a security subject to section 1091, the disallowed loss is not a noncapital, nondeductible expense because the corresponding basis adjustments under section 1091(d) prevent the disallowance from being permanent.
(B)
Nondeductible basis recovery.
Any other decrease in the basis of S's assets (or an equivalent as described in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B) of this section) may be a noncapital, nondeductible expense to the extent that the decrease is not otherwise taken into account in determining stock basis and is permanently eliminated for purposes of determining S's taxable income or loss. Whether a decrease is so treated is determined by taking into account both the purposes of the Code or regulatory provision resulting in the decrease and the purposes of this section. For example, S's noncapital, nondeductible expenses include any basis reduction under section 50(c)(1), section 1017, section 1059, § 1.1502-35(b) or (f)(2). Also included as a noncapital, nondeductible expense is the amount of any gross-up for taxes paid by another taxpayer that S is treated as having paid (e.g., income included under section 78, or the portion of an undistributed capital gain dividend that is treated as tax deemed to have been paid by a shareholder under section 852(b)(3)(D)(ii), whether or not any corresponding amount is claimed as a tax credit). In contrast, a decrease generally is not a noncapital, nondeductible expense if it results because S redeems stock in a transaction to which section 302(a) applies, S receives assets in a liquidation to which section 332 applies and its basis in the assets is less than its basis in the stock canceled, or S distributes the stock of a subsidiary in a distribution to which section 355 applies.
(C) [Reserved]
(iv)
Special rules for tax-exempt income and noncapital, nondeductible expenses.
For purposes of paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section:
(A)
Treatment as permanent.
An amount is permanently excluded from gross income, or permanently disallowed or eliminated, if it is so treated by S even though another person may take a corresponding amount into account. For example, if S sells property to a nonmember at a loss that is disallowed under section 267(a), S's loss is a noncapital, nondeductible expense even though under section 267(d) the nonmember may treat a corresponding amount of gain as not recognized. (If the nonmember is a subsidiary in another consolidated group, its gain not recognized under section 267(d) is tax-exempt income under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.)
(B)
Amounts equivalent to basis and adjustments to basis.
Amounts equivalent to basis include the amount of money, the amount of a loss carryover, and the amount of an adjustment to gain or loss under section 475(a) for securities described in section 475(a)(2). An equivalent to a basis increase includes a decrease in an excess loss account, and an equivalent to a basis decrease includes the denial of basis for taxable income.
(C)
Timing.
An amount is taken into account in the year in which it would
be taken into account under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section if it were subject to Federal income taxation.
(D)
Tax sharing agreements.
Taxes are taken into account by applying the principles of section 1552 and the percentage method under § 1.1502-33(d)(3) (and by assuming a 100% allocation of any decreased tax liability). The treatment of amounts allocated under this paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(D) is analogous to the treatment of allocations under § 1.1552-1(b)(2). For example, if one member owes a payment to a second member, the first member is treated as indebted to the second member. The right to receive payment is treated as a positive adjustment under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, and the obligation to make payment is treated as a negative adjustment under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. If the obligation is not paid, the amount not paid generally is treated as a distribution, contribution, or both, depending on the relationship between the members.
(v)
Distributions.
Distributions taken into account under paragraph (b)(2) of this section are distributions with respect to S's stock to which section 301 applies and all other distributions treated as dividends (e.g., under section 356(a)(2)). See § 1.1502-13(f)(2)(iv) for taking into account distributions to which section 301 applies (but not other distributions treated as dividends) under the entitlement rule.
(4)
Waiver of loss carryovers from separate return limitation years
—(i)
General rule.
If S has a loss carryover from a separate return limitation year when it becomes a member of a consolidated group, the group may make an irrevocable election to treat all or any portion of the loss carryover as expiring for all Federal income tax purposes immediately before S becomes a member of the consolidated group (deemed expiration). If S was a member of another group immediately before it became a member of the consolidated group, the expiration is also treated as occurring immediately after it ceases to be a member of the prior group.
(ii)
Stock basis adjustments from a waiver
—(A)
Qualifying transactions.
If S becomes a member of the consolidated group in a qualifying cost basis transaction and an election under this paragraph (b)(4) is made, the noncapital, nondeductible expense resulting from the deemed expiration does not result in a corresponding stock basis adjustment for any member under this section. A qualifying cost basis transaction is the purchase (i.e., a transaction in which basis is determined under section 1012) by members of the acquiring consolidated group (while they are members) in a 12-month period of an amount of S's stock satisfying the requirements of section 1504(a)(2).
(B)
Nonqualifying transactions.
If S becomes a member of the consolidated group other than in a qualifying cost basis transaction and an election under this paragraph (b)(4) is made, the basis of its stock that is owned by members immediately after it becomes a member is subject to reduction under the principles of this section to reflect the deemed expiration. The reduction occurs immediately before S becomes a member, but after it ceases to be a member of any prior group, and it therefore does not result in a corresponding stock basis adjustment for any higher-tier member of the transferring or acquiring consolidated group. Any basis reduction under this paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) is taken into account in making determinations of basis under the Code with respect to S's stock (e.g., a determination under section 362 because the stock is acquired in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(B)), but it does not result in corresponding stock basis adjustments under this section for any higher-tier member. If the basis reduction exceeds the basis of S's stock, the excess is treated as an excess loss account to which the members owning S's stock succeed.
(C)
Higher-tier corporations.
If S becomes a member of the consolidated group as a result, in whole or in part, of a higher-tier corporation becoming a member (whether or not in a qualifying cost basis transaction), additional adjustments are required. The highest-tier corporation (T) whose becoming a member resulted in S becoming a member, and T's chain of lower-tier corporations that includes S, are subject to the adjustment. The deemed expiration of S's loss carryover that results
in a negative adjustment for the first higher-tier corporation is treated as an expiring loss carryover of that higher-tier corporation for purposes of applying paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section to that corporation. For example, if M purchases all of the stock of T, T owns all of the stock of T1, T1 owns all of the stock of S, S becomes a member as a result of T becoming a member, and the election under this paragraph (b)(4) is made, the basis of the S stock is reduced and the reduction tiers up to T1, T1 treats the negative adjustment to its basis in S's stock as an expiring loss carryover of T1, and T then adjusts its basis in T1's stock. In addition, if T becomes a member of the acquiring group in a transaction other than a qualifying cost basis transaction, the amount that tiers up to T also reduces the basis of its stock under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section (but the amount does not tier up to higher-tier members).
(iii)
Net asset basis limitation.
Basis reduced under this paragraph (b)(4) is restored before S becomes a member (and before the basis of S's stock is taken into account in determining basis under the Code) to the extent necessary to conform a share's basis to its allocable portion of net asset basis. In the case of higher-tier corporations under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, the restoration does not tier up but is instead applied separately to each higher-tier corporation. For purposes of determining each corporation's net asset basis (including the basis of stock in lower-tier corporations), the restoration is applied in the order of tiers, from the lowest to the highest. For purposes of the restoration:
(A) A member's net asset basis is the positive or negative difference between the adjusted basis of its assets (and the amount of any of its loss carryovers that are not deemed to expire) and its liabilities. Appropriate adjustments must be made, for example, to disregard liabilities that subsequently will give rise to deductions (e.g., liabilities to which section 461(h) applies).
(B) Within a class of stock, each share has the same allocable portion of net asset basis. If there is more than one class of common stock, the net asset basis is allocated to each class by taking into account the terms of each class and all other facts and circumstances relating to the overall economic arrangement.
(iv)
Election.
The election described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section must be made in a separate statement entitled, “ELECTION TO TREAT LOSS CARRYOVER OF [INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OF S] AS EXPIRING UNDER § 1.1502-32(b)(4).” The election must be filed by including a statement on or with the consolidated group's income tax return for the year S becomes a member. A separate statement must be made for each member whose loss carryover is deemed to expire. The statement must identify the amount of each loss carryover deemed to expire (or the amount of each loss carryover deemed not to expire, with any balance of any loss carryovers being deemed to expire) and the basis of any stock reduced as a result of the deemed expiration.
(v)
Special rule for loss carryovers of a subsidiary acquired in a transaction for which an election under § 1.1502-20(i)(2) is made. See
paragraph (b)(4)(v) of this section as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2005.
(vi)
Special rules in the case of certain transactions subject to § 1.1502-35.
If a member of a consolidated group transfers stock of a subsidiary and such stock has a basis that exceeds its value immediately before such transfer or a subsidiary is deconsolidated and any stock of such subsidiary owned by members of the group immediately before such deconsolidation has a basis that exceeds its value, all members of the group are subject to the provisions of § 1.1502-35(b), which generally require a redetermination of members' basis in all shares of subsidiary stock.
(vii)
Special rules for amending waiver of loss carryovers from separate return limitation year relating to the acquisition of a subsidiary in a transaction subject to § 1.1502-20. See
paragraph (b)(4)(vii) of this section as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2005.
(5)
Examples
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of the examples in this section, unless otherwise stated, M owns all of the only class of S's stock, the stock is owned for the entire year, S owns no
stock of lower-tier members, the tax year of all persons is the calendar year, all persons use the accrual method of accounting, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, preferred stock is described in section 1504(a)(4), all transactions are between unrelated persons, and tax liabilities are disregarded.
(ii)
Stock basis adjustments.
The principles of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following examples.
(A)
Example 1. Taxable income
—(
1
)
Current taxable income.
For Year 1, the M group has $100 of taxable income when determined by including only S's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss taken into account. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, M's basis in S's stock is adjusted under this section as of the close of Year 1. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, M's basis in S's stock is increased by the amount of the M group's taxable income determined by including only S's items taken into account. Thus, M's basis in S's stock is increased by $100 as of the close of Year 1.
(
2
)
Intercompany gain that is not taken into account.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section (
Example 1
), except that S also sells property to another member at a $25 gain in Year 1, the gain is deferred under § 1.1502-13 and taken into account in Year 3, and M sells 10% of S's stock to nonmembers in Year 2. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, S's deferred gain is not additional taxable income for Year 1 or 2 because it is not taken into account in determining the M group's consolidated taxable income for either of those years. The deferred gain is not tax-exempt income under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section because it is not permanently excluded from S's gross income. The deferred gain does not result in a basis adjustment until Year 3, when it is taken into account in determining the M group's consolidated taxable income. Consequently, M's basis in the S shares sold is not increased to reflect S's gain from the intercompany sale of the property. In Year 3, the deferred gain is taken into account, but the amount allocable to the shares sold by M does not increase their basis because these shares are held by nonmembers.
(
3
)
Intercompany gain taken into account.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section (
Example 1
), except that M sells all of S's stock in Year 2 (rather than only 10%). Under § 1.1502-13, S takes the $25 gain into account immediately before S becomes a nonmember. Thus, M's basis in S's stock is increased to reflect S's gain from the intercompany sale of the property.
(B)
Example 2. Tax loss
—(
1
)
Current absorption.
For Year 2, the M group has a $50 consolidated net operating loss when determined by taking into account only S's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss. S's loss is absorbed by the M group in Year 2, offsetting M's income for that year. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section, because S's loss is absorbed in the year it arises, M has a $50 negative adjustment with respect to S's stock. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, M reduces its basis in S's stock by $50. Under paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, if the decrease exceeds M's basis in S's stock, the excess is M's excess loss account in S's stock.
(
2
)
Interim determination from stock sale.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section (
Example 2
), except that S's Year 2 loss arises in the first half of the calendar year, M sells 50% of S's stock on July 1 of Year 2, and M's income for Year 2 does not arise until after the sale of S's stock. M's income for Year 2 (exclusive of the sale of S's stock) is offset by S's loss, even though the income arises after the stock sale, and no loss remains to be apportioned to S.
See
§§ 1.1502-11 and 1.1502-21(b). Under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section, because S's $50 loss is absorbed in the year it arises, it reduces M's basis in the S shares sold by $25 immediately before the stock sale. Because S becomes a nonmember, the loss also reduces M's basis in the retained S shares by $25 immediately before S becomes a nonmember.
(
3
)
Loss carryback.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section (
Example 2
), except that M has no income or loss for Year 2, S's $50 loss is carried back and absorbed by the M group in Year 1 (offsetting the
income of M or S), and the M group receives a $17 tax refund in Year 2 that is paid to S. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section, because the $50 loss is carried back and absorbed in Year 1, it is treated as a tax loss for Year 2 (the year in which it arises). Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the refund is treated as tax-exempt income of S. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(C) of this section, the tax-exempt income is taken into account in Year 2 because that is the year it would be taken into account under S's method of accounting if it were subject to Federal income taxation. Thus, under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, M reduces its basis in S's stock by $33 as of the close of Year 2 (the $50 tax loss, less the $17 tax refund).
(
4
)
Loss carryforward.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section (
Example 2
), except that M has no income or loss for Year 2, and S's loss is carried forward and absorbed by the M group in Year 3 (offsetting the income of M or S). Under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section, the loss is not treated as a tax loss under paragraph (b)(2) of this section until Year 3.
(C)
Example 3. Tax-exempt income and noncapital, nondeductible expenses
—(
1
)
Facts.
For Year 1, the M group has $500 of consolidated taxable income. However, the M group has a $100 consolidated net operating loss when determined by including only S's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss taken into account. Also for Year 1, S has $80 of interest income that is permanently excluded from gross income under section 103, and S incurs $60 of related expense for which a deduction is permanently disallowed under section 265.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section, S has a $100 tax loss for Year 1. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, S has $80 of tax-exempt income. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, S has $60 of noncapital, nondeductible expense. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(C) of this section, the tax-exempt income and noncapital, nondeductible expense are taken into account in Year 1 because that is the year they would be taken into account under S's method of accounting if they were subject to Federal income taxation. Thus, under paragraph (b) of this section, M reduces its basis in S's stock as of the close of Year 1 by an $80 net amount (the $100 tax loss, less $80 of tax-exempt income, plus $60 of noncapital, nondeductible expenses).
(D)
Example 4. Discharge of indebtedness
—(
1
)
Facts.
M forms S on January 1 of Year 1 and S borrows $200. During Year 1, S's assets decline in value and the M group has a $100 consolidated net operating loss. Of that amount, $10 is attributable to M and $90 is attributable to S under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv). None of the loss is absorbed by the group in Year 1, and S is discharged from $100 of indebtedness at the close of Year 1. M has a $0 basis in the S stock. M and S have no attributes other than the consolidated net operating loss. Under section 108(a), S's $100 of discharge of indebtedness income is excluded from gross income because of insolvency. Under section 108(b) and § 1.1502-28, the consolidated net operating loss is reduced to $0.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, the reduction of $90 of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to S is treated as a noncapital, nondeductible expense in Year 1 because that loss is permanently disallowed by section 108(b) and § 1.1502-28. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section, all $100 of S's discharge of indebtedness income is treated as tax-exempt income in Year 1 because the discharge results in a $100 reduction to the consolidated net operating loss. Consequently, the loss and the cancellation of the indebtedness result in a net positive $10 adjustment to M's basis in its S stock.
(
3
)
Insufficient attributes.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(D)(
1
) of this section (
Example 4
), except that S is discharged from $120 of indebtedness at the close of Year 1. Under section 108(a), S's $120 of discharge of indebtedness income is excluded from gross income because of insolvency. Under section 108(b) and § 1.1502-28, the consolidated net operating loss is reduced by $100 to $0 after the determination of tax for Year 1. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this
section, the reduction of $90 of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to S is treated as a noncapital, nondeductible expense. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section, only $100 of the discharge is treated as tax-exempt income because only that amount is applied to reduce tax attributes. The remaining $20 of discharge of indebtedness income excluded from gross income under section 108(a) has no effect on M's basis in S's stock.
(
4
)
Purchase price adjustment.
Assume instead that S buys land in Year 1 in exchange for S's $100 purchase money note (bearing interest at a market rate of interest in excess of the applicable Federal rate, and providing for a principal payment at the end of Year 10), and the seller agrees with S in Year 4 to discharge $60 of the note as a purchase price adjustment to which section 108(e)(5) applies. S has no discharge of indebtedness income that is treated as tax-exempt income under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. In addition, the $60 purchase price adjustment is not a noncapital, nondeductible expense under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. A purchase price adjustment is not equivalent to a discharge of indebtedness that is offset by a deduction or loss. Consequently, the purchase price adjustment results in no net adjustment to M's basis in S's stock under paragraph (b) of this section.
(E)
Example 5. Distributions
—(
1
)
Amounts declared and distributed.
For Year 1, the M group has $120 of consolidated taxable income when determined by including only S's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss taken into account. S declares and makes a $10 dividend distribution to M at the close of Year 1. Under paragraph (b) of this section, M increases its basis in S's stock as of the close of Year 1 by a $110 net amount ($120 of taxable income, less a $10 distribution).
(
2
)
Distributions in later years.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(E)(
1
) of this section (
Example 5
), except that S does not declare and distribute the $10 until Year 2. Under paragraph (b) of this section, M increases its basis in S's stock by $120 as of the close of Year 1, and decreases its basis by $10 as of the close of Year 2. (If M were also a subsidiary, the basis of its stock would also be increased in Year 1 to reflect M's $120 adjustment to basis of S's stock; the basis of M's stock would not be changed as a result of S's distribution in Year 2, because M's $10 of tax-exempt dividend income under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section would be offset by the $10 negative adjustment to M's basis in S's stock for the distribution.)
(
3
)
Amounts declared but not distributed.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(E)(
1
) of this section (
Example 5
), except that, during December of Year 1, S declares (and M becomes entitled to) another $70 dividend distribution with respect to its stock, but M does not receive the distribution until after it sells all of S's stock at the close of Year 1. Under § 1.1502-13(f)(2)(iv), S is treated as making a $70 distribution to M at the time M becomes entitled to the distribution. (If S is distributing an appreciated asset, its gain under section 311 is also taken into account under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section at the time M becomes entitled to the distribution.) Consequently, under paragraph (b) of this section, M increases its basis in S's stock as of the close of Year 1 by only a $40 net amount ($120 of taxable income, less two distributions totaling $80). Any further adjustments after S ceases to be a member and the $70 distribution is made would be duplicative, because the stock basis has already been adjusted for the distribution. Accordingly, the distribution will not result in further adjustments or gain, even if the distribution is a payment to which section 301(c)(2) or (3) applies.

M owns all the stock of S and T. M owns ten shares of the same class of common stock of S and ten shares of the same class of common stock of T. The fair market value of each share of S stock is $10 and the fair market value of each share of T stock is $10. On January 1 of Year 1, M has a $5 basis in each of its ten shares of S stock and a $10 basis in each of its ten shares of T stock. S and T have no items of income, gain, deduction, or loss for Year 1. S and T each have substantial earnings and profits. At the
close of Year 1, T merges into S in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(A) (and in section 368(a)(1)(D)). M receives no additional S stock, but does receive $10 which is treated as received by M in a separate transaction occurring immediately after the merger of T into S.
(

)
Analysis.
The merger of T into S is a transaction to which § 1.1502-13(f)(3) applies. Under §§ 1.1502-13(f)(3) and 1.358-2(a)(2)(iii), M is deemed to receive ten additional shares of S stock with a total fair market value of $100 (the fair market value of the T stock surrendered by M). Under § 1.358-2(a)(2)(i), M will have a basis of $10 in each share of S stock deemed received in the reorganization. Under § 1.358-2(a)(2)(iii), M is deemed to surrender all twenty shares of its S stock in a recapitalization under section 368(a)(1)(E) in exchange for the ten shares of S stock, the number of shares of S stock held by M immediately after the transaction. Thus, under § 1.358-2(a)(2)(i), M has five shares of S stock each with a basis of $10 and five shares of S stock each with a basis of $20. The $10 M received is treated as a dividend distribution under section 301 and, under paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section, the $10 is a distribution to which paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section applies. Accordingly, M's total basis in the S stock is decreased by the $10 distribution.
(G)
Example 7. Tiering up of basis adjustments.
M owns all of S's stock, and S owns all of T's stock. For Year 1, the M group has $100 of consolidated taxable income when determined by including only T's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss taken into account, and $50 of consolidated taxable income when determined by including only S's items taken into account. S increases its basis in T's stock by $100 under paragraph (b) of this section. Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, this $100 basis adjustment is taken into account in determining M's adjustments to its basis in S's stock. Thus, M increases its basis in S's stock by $150 under paragraph (b) of this section.

Example 8. Allocation of items
—(

)
Acquisition in mid-year.
M is the common parent of a consolidated group, and S is an unaffiliated corporation filing separate returns on a calendar-year basis. M acquires all of S's stock and S becomes a member of the M group on July 1 of Year 1. For the entire calendar Year 1, S has $100 of ordinary income and under § 1.1502-76(b) $60 is allocated to the period from January 1 to June 30 and $40 to the period from July 1 to December 31. Under paragraph (b) of this section, M increases its basis in S's stock by $40.
(

)
Sale in mid-year.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(H)(
1
) of this section (
Example 8
), except that S is a member of the M group at the beginning of Year 1 but ceases to be a member on June 30 as a result of M's sale of S's stock. Under paragraph (b) of this section, M increases its basis in S's stock by $60 immediately before the stock sale. (M's basis increase would be the same if S became a nonmember because S issued additional shares to nonmembers.)
(

)
Absorption of loss carryovers.
Assume instead that S is a member of the M group at the beginning of Year 1 but ceases to be a member on June 30 as a result of M's sale of S's stock, and a $100 consolidated net operating loss attributable to S is carried over by the M group to Year 1. The consolidated net operating loss may be apportioned to S for its first separate return year only to the extent not absorbed by the M group during Year 1. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, if the loss is absorbed by the M group in Year 1, whether the offsetting income arises before or after M's sale of S's stock, the absorption of the loss carryover is included in the determination of S's taxable income or loss for Year 1. Thus, M's basis in S's stock is adjusted under paragraph (b) of this section to reflect any absorption of the loss by the M group.
(I)
Example 9. Gross-ups
—(
1
)
Facts.
M owns all of the stock of S, and S owns all of the stock of T, a newly formed controlled foreign corporation that is not a passive foreign investment company. In Year 1, T has $100 of subpart F income and pays $34 of foreign income tax, leaving T with $66 of earnings and profits. The M group has $100 of consolidated taxable income when determined by taking into account only S's items (the inclusion under section 951(a), taking into account the section
78 gross-up). As a result of the section 951(a) inclusion, S increases its basis in T's stock by $66 under section 961(a).
(
2
)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, S has $100 of taxable income. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, the $34 gross-up for taxes paid by T that S is treated as having paid is a noncapital, nondeductible expense (whether or not any corresponding amount is claimed by the M group as a tax credit). Thus, M increases its basis in S's stock under paragraph (b) of this section by the net adjustment of $66.
(
3
)
Subsequent distribution.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(I)(
1
) of this section (
Example 9
), except that T distributes its $66 of earnings and profits in Year 2. The $66 distribution received by S is excluded from S's income under section 959(a) because the distribution represents earnings and profits attributable to amounts that were included in S's income under section 951(a) for Year 1. In addition, S's basis in T's stock is decreased by $66 under section 961(b). The excluded distribution is not tax-exempt income under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section because of the corresponding reduction to S's basis in T's stock. Consequently, M's basis in S's stock is not adjusted under paragraph (b) of this section for Year 2.
(J)
Example 10. Recapture of tax-exempt items
—(
1
)
Facts.
S is a life insurance company. For Year 1, the M group has $200 of consolidated taxable income, determined by including only S's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss taken into account (including a $300 small company deduction under section 806). In addition, S has $100 of tax-exempt interest income, $60 of which is S's company share. The remaining $40 of tax-exempt income is the policyholders' share that reduces S's deduction for increase in reserves.
(
2
)
Tax-exempt items generally.
Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, S has $200 of taxable income for Year 1. Also for Year 1, S has $100 of tax-exempt income under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, and another $300 is treated as tax-exempt income under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section because of the deduction under section 806. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, S has $40 of noncapital, nondeductible expenses for Year 1 because S's deduction under section 807 for its increase in reserves has been permanently reduced by the $40 policyholders' share of the tax-exempt interest income. Thus, M increases its basis in S's stock by $560 under paragraph (b) of this section.
(

)
Recapture.
Assume instead that S is a property and casualty company and, for Year 1, S accrues $100 of estimated salvage recoverable under section 832. Of this amount, $87 (87% of $100) is excluded from gross income because of the “fresh start” provisions of Sec. 11305(c) of Public Law 101-508 (the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990). Thus, S has $87 of tax-exempt income under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section that increases M's basis in S's stock for Year 1. (S also has $13 of taxable income over the period of inclusion under section 481.) In Year 5, S determines that the $100 salvage recoverable was overestimated by $30 and deducts $30 for the reduction of the salvage recoverable. However, S has $26.10 (87% of $30) of taxable income in Year 5 due to the partial recapture of its fresh start. Because S has no basis corresponding to this income, S is treated under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section as having a $26.10 noncapital, nondeductible expense in Year 5. This treatment is necessary to reflect the elimination of the erroneous fresh start in S's stock basis and causes a decrease in M's basis in S's stock by $30 for Year 5 (a $3.90 taxable loss and a $26.10 special adjustment).
(c)
Allocation of adjustments among shares of stock
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Distributions.
The adjustment that is described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section (negative adjustments for distributions) is allocated to the shares of S stock to which the distribution relates.
(ii)
Special rules applicable in the case of certain loss transfers of subsidiary stock
—(A)
Losses reattributed pursuant to an election under § 1.1502-36(d)(6)
—(
1
)
General rule.
If a member transfers loss shares of S stock and the common parent elects under § 1.1502-36(d)(6) to reattribute all or a portion of S's attributes, S's resulting noncapital, nondeductible expense is allocated to all loss shares of S stock transferred by
members in the transaction. The expense is allocated among those S shares in proportion to the loss in the shares. The tier-up of that expense is included in the remaining adjustment (see paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section).
(
2
)
Reattribution of attributes of a subsidiary that is lower-tier to S.
If a member transfers loss shares of S stock and the common parent elects under § 1.1502-36(d)(6) to reattribute attributes of a subsidiary (S2) that is lower-tier to S, S2's resulting noncapital, nondeductible expense is allocated among S2 shares held by members as of the transaction, other than those transferred in the transaction and with respect to which gain or loss was recognized (recognition transfer), in a manner that permits the full amount of the expense to tier up and be applied to the bases of the loss shares of S stock transferred by members in the transaction. The expense is allocated among those S2 shares with positive basis in a manner that, first, reduces the bases of S2's preferred shares to equalize and then eliminate loss and, second, reduces the bases of S2's common shares in a manner that reduces disparity among the bases of those common shares to the greatest extent possible. The noncapital, nondeductible expense applied to the S2 shares tiers up and is applied to the stock of any subsidiaries that are lower-tier to S (middle-tier subsidiaries) in a manner that will permit the full amount of this expense to be applied to reduce the bases of the loss shares of S stock transferred by members in the transaction. Similar to the allocation among the S2 shares, the tier-up of this expense is allocated among the middle-tier subsidiary shares held by members as of the transaction, other than those transferred in a recognition transfer, in a manner that permits the full amount of the expense to tier up and be applied to the bases of the loss shares of S stock transferred by members in the transaction. The tier-up of this expense is allocated among those middle-tier subsidiary shares with positive basis in a manner that, first, reduces the bases of the middle-tier subsidiary's preferred shares to equalize and then eliminate loss and, second, reduces the bases of the middle-tier subsidiary's common shares in a manner that reduces disparity among the bases of those common shares to the greatest extent possible. The tier-up of this expense is allocated to the loss shares of S stock transferred by members in the transaction in the same manner as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section, and thereafter the tier-up of that expense is included in the remaining adjustment (see paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section).
(

)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A).

# Example.
Assume P owns M1, P and M1 own M2, M2 owns S, M1 and S own S1, and M1 and S1 own S2. If S sells a portion of the S1 shares at a gain and M2 sells all of the S stock at a net loss (after adjusting the basis for the gain recognized by S on the sale of the S1 shares), and P elects under § 1.1502-36(d)(6) to reattribute attributes of S2, the resulting noncapital, nondeductible expense is allocated entirely to the S2 shares held by S1 with positive basis in a manner that reduces the disparity in those bases to the greatest extent possible. The tier-up of this amount is allocated entirely to the S1 shares held by S (excluding the S1 shares sold) with positive basis in a manner that reduces the disparity in those bases to the greatest extent possible. The tier-up of this amount is allocated to the loss shares of S stock sold by M2 in proportion to the loss in those shares. The tier-up of this amount is then included in the remaining adjustment and tiers up from M2 to M1 and P, and from M1 to P under the general rules of this section.
(B)
Tier-up of reallocated investment adjustments subject to prior use limitation.
If the reallocation of an investment adjustment under § 1.1502-36(b)(2) is subject to the prior use limitation in § 1.1502-36(b)(2)(iii)(B)(2), no amount of the tier-up of such reallocated investment adjustment shall be allocated to any share whose prior use resulted in the application of the limitation. Thereafter, the tier-up of this amount is included in the remaining adjustment (see paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section).
(iii)
Remaining adjustment.
The
remaining adjustment
is the adjustment that consists of the items described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(iii) of this section (adjustments for taxable income or loss, tax-exempt income, and noncapital, nondeductible expenses),
including adjustments to lower-tier stock basis that tier up under paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, but only to the extent not specially allocated under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. The remaining adjustment is allocated among the shares of S stock as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(4) of this section. If the remaining adjustment is positive, it is allocated first to any preferred stock as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and then to the common stock as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. If the remaining adjustment is negative, it is allocated only to common stock as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(iv)
Nonmember shares.
No adjustment under this section that is allocated to a share for the period it is owned by a nonmember affects the basis of the share.
(v)
Cross-references.
See paragraph (c)(4) of this section for the reallocation of adjustments, and paragraph (d) of this section for definitions. See § 1.1502-19(d) for special allocations of basis determined or adjusted under the Internal Revenue Code (Code) with respect to excess loss accounts.
(2)
Common stock
—(i)
Allocation within a class.
The remaining adjustment described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section that is allocable to a class of common stock is generally allocated equally to each share within the class. However, if a member has an excess loss account in a share of a class of common stock at the time a positive remaining adjustment is to be allocated, the portion of the positive remaining adjustment allocable to the member with respect to the class is allocated first to equalize and then eliminate that member's excess loss accounts. It is then allocated equally among the members' shares in that class. Similarly, the portion of any negative remaining adjustment allocable to the member with respect to the class is allocated equally to the member's shares with positive bases, eliminating all positive basis in shares of the class before creating or increasing any excess loss accounts. After positive basis is eliminated, any remaining portion of the negative remaining adjustment is allocated to equalize the member's excess loss accounts in the shares of that class to the greatest extent possible. Distributions and any adjustments or determinations under the Internal Revenue Code (for example, under section 358, including any modifications under § 1.1502-19(d)) are taken into account before the allocation is made under this paragraph (c)(2)(i).
(ii)
Allocation among classes
—(A)
General rule.
If S has more than one class of common stock, the extent to which the remaining adjustment described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section is allocated to each class is determined, based on consistently applied assumptions, by taking into account the terms of each class and all other facts and circumstances relating to the overall economic arrangement. The allocation generally must reflect the manner in which the classes participate in the economic benefit or burden (if any) corresponding to the items of income, gain, deduction, or loss allocated. In determining participation, any differences in voting rights are not taken into account, and the following factors are among those to be considered—
(
1
) The interest of each share in economic profits and losses (if different from the interest in taxable income);
(
2
) The interest of each share in cash flow and other non-liquidating distributions; and
(
3
) The interest of each share in distributions in liquidation.
(B)
Distributions and Code adjustments.
Distributions and any adjustments or determinations under the Internal Revenue Code are taken into account before the allocation is made under this paragraph (c)(2)(ii).
(3)
Preferred stock.
If the remaining adjustment described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section is positive, it is allocated to preferred stock to the extent required (when aggregated with prior allocations to the preferred stock during the period that S is a member of the consolidated group) to reflect distributions described in section 301 (and all other distributions treated as dividends) to which the preferred stock becomes entitled, and arrearages arising, during the period that S is a member of the consolidated group. For this purpose, the preferred stock is treated as
entitled to a distribution no later than the time the distribution is taken into account under the Internal Revenue Code (e.g., under section 305). If the amount of distributions and arrearages exceeds the positive amount (when aggregated with prior allocations), the positive amount is first allocated among classes of preferred stock to reflect their relative priorities, and the amount allocated to each class is then allocated pro rata within the class. An allocation to a share with respect to arrearages and distributions for the period the share is owned by a nonmember is not reflected in the basis of the share under paragraph (b) of this section. However, if M and S cease to be members of one consolidated group and remain affiliated as members of another consolidated group, M's ownership of S's stock during consolidated return years of the prior group is treated for this purpose as ownership by a member to the extent that the adjustments during the prior consolidated return years are still reflected in the basis of the preferred stock.
(4)
Cumulative redetermination
—(i)
General rule.
A member's basis in each share of S preferred and common stock must be redetermined whenever necessary to determine the tax liability of any person. See paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The redetermination is made by reallocating S's adjustments described in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii)(B) (specially allocated adjustments for tier-up of reallocated investment adjustments subject to prior use limitation) and (c)(1)(iii) (remaining adjustments) of this section for each consolidated return year (or other applicable period) of the group by taking into account all of the facts and circumstances affecting allocations under this paragraph (c) as of the redetermination date with respect to all of the S shares. For this purpose:
(A) Amounts may be reallocated from one class of S's stock to another class, but not from one share of a class to another share of the same class.
(B) If there is a change in the equity structure of S (e.g., as the result of S's issuance, redemption, or recapitalization of shares), a cumulative redetermination is made for the period before the change. If a reallocation is required by another redetermination after a change, amounts arising after the change are reallocated before amounts arising before the change.
(C) If S becomes a nonmember as a result of a change in its equity structure, any reallocation is made only among the shares of S's stock immediately before the change. For example, if S issues stock to a nonmember creditor in exchange for its debt, and the exchange results in S becoming a nonmember, any reallocation is only among the shares of S's stock immediately before the exchange.
(D) Any reallocation is treated for all purposes after it is made (including subsequent redeterminations) as the original allocation of an amount under this paragraph (c), but the reallocation does not affect any prior period.
(ii)
Prior use of allocations.
An amount may not be reallocated under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section to the extent that the amount has been used before the reallocation. For this purpose, an amount has been used to the extent it has been taken into account, directly or indirectly, by any member in determining income, gain, deduction, or loss, or in determining the basis of any property that is not subject to this section (e.g., stock of a corporation that has become a nonmember). For example, if M sells a share of S stock, an amount previously allocated to the share cannot be reallocated to another share of S stock, but an amount allocated to another share of S stock can still be reallocated to the sold share because the reallocated amount has not been taken into account; however, any adjustment reallocated to the sold share may effectively be eliminated, because the reallocation was not in effect when the share was previously sold and M's gain or loss from the sale is not redetermined. If, however, M sells the share of S stock to another member, the amount is not used until M's gain or loss is taken into account under § 1.1502-13.
(5)
Examples.
The principles of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1. Ownership of less than all the stock.
(a)
Facts.
M owns 80% of S's only class of stock with an $800 basis. For Year 1, S has $100 of taxable income.
(b)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the $100 positive adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section for S's taxable income is allocated among the shares of S's stock, including shares owned by nonmembers. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the adjustment is allocated equally to each share of S's stock. Thus, M increases its basis in S's stock under paragraph (b) of this section as of the close of Year 1 by $80. (The basis of the 20% of S's stock owned by nonmembers is not adjusted under this section.)
(c)
Varying interest.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 1,
except that M buys the remaining 20% of S's stock at the close of business on June 30 of Year 1 for $208. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the principles of § 1.1502-76(b), S's $100 of taxable income is allocable $40 to the period from January 1 to June 30 and $60 to the period from July 1 to December 31. Thus, for the period ending June 30, M is treated as having a $32 adjustment with respect to the S stock that M has owned since January 1 (80% of $40) and, under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the adjustment is allocated equally among those shares. For the period ending December 31, M is treated as having a $60 adjustment (100% of $60) that is also allocated equally among M's shares of S's stock owned after June 30. M's basis in the shares owned as of the beginning of the year therefore increases by $80 (the sum of 80% of $40 and 80% of $60), from $800 to $880, and M's basis in the shares purchased on June 30 increases by $12 (20% of $60), from $208 to $220. Thus, M's aggregate basis in S's stock as of the end of Year 1 is $1,100.
(d)
Tax liability.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 1,
except that M pays S's $34 share of the group's consolidated tax liability resulting from S's taxable income, and S does not reimburse M. S's $100 of taxable income results in a positive adjustment under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, and S's $34 of tax liability results in a negative adjustment under paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(D) of this section and the principles of section 1552. Because S does not make any payment in recognition of the additional tax liability, by analogy to the treatment under § 1.1552-1(b)(2), S is treated as having made a $34 payment that is described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section (noncapital, nondeductible expenses) and as having received an equal amount from M as a capital contribution. Thus, M increases its basis in its S stock by $52.80 (80% of the $100 of taxable income, less 80% of the $34 tax payment). In addition, M increases its basis in S's stock by $34 under the Internal Revenue Code and paragraph (a)(2) of this section to reflect the capital contribution. In the aggregate, M increases its basis in S's stock by $86.80. (If, as in paragraph (c) of this
Example 1,
M buys the remaining 20% of S's stock at the close of business on June 30, M increases its basis in S's stock by another $7.90 for the additional 20% interest in S's income after June 30 ($60 multiplied by 20%, less 20% of the $20.40 tax payment on $60); the $34 capital contribution by M is reflected in all of its S shares (not just the original 80%), and M's aggregate basis adjustment under this section is $94.70 ($86.80 plus $7.90).)

# Example 2. Preferred stock.
(a)
Facts.
M owns all of S's common stock with an $800 basis, and nonmembers own all of S's preferred stock. The preferred stock was issued for $200, has a $20 annual, cumulative preference as to dividends, and has an initial liquidation preference of $200. For Year 1, S has $50 of taxable income and no distributions are declared or made.
(b)
Analysis of arrearages.
Under paragraphs (c) (1) and (3) of this section, $20 of the $50 positive adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section is allocated first to the preferred stock to reflect the dividend arrearage arising in Year 1. The remaining $30 of the positive adjustment is allocated to the common stock, increasing M's basis from $800 to $830 as of the close of Year 1. (The basis of the preferred stock owned by nonmembers is not adjusted under this section.)
(c)
Current distribution.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 2,
except that S declares and makes a $20 distribution with respect to the preferred stock during Year 1 in satisfaction of its preference. The results are the same as in paragraph (b) of this
Example 2.
(d)
Varying interest.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 2,
except that S has no income or loss for Years 1 and 2, M purchases all of S's preferred stock at the beginning of Year 3 for $240, and S has $70 of taxable income for Year 3. Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, $60 of the $70 positive adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section is allocated to the preferred stock to reflect the dividends arrearages for Years 1 through 3, but only the $20 for Year 3 is reflected in the basis of the preferred stock under paragraph (b) of this section. (The remaining $40 is not reflected because the preferred stock was owned by nonmembers during Years 1 and 2.) Thus, M increases its basis in S's preferred stock from $240 to $260, and its basis in S's common stock from $800 to $810, as of the close of Year 3. (If M had acquired all of S's preferred stock in a transaction to which section 351 applies, and M's initial basis in S's preferred stock was $200 under section 362, M's basis in S's preferred stock would increase from $200 to $220.)
(e)
Varying interest with current distributions.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d) of this
Example 2,
except that S declares and makes a $20 distribution with respect to the preferred stock in each of Years 1 and 2
in satisfaction of its preference, and M purchases all of S's preferred stock at the beginning of Year 3 for $200. Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, $40 of the $70 positive adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section is allocated to the preferred stock to reflect the distributions in Years 1 and 2, and $20 of the $70 is allocated to the preferred stock to reflect the arrearage for Year 3. However, as in paragraph (d) of this
Example 2,
only the $20 attributable to Year 3 is reflected in the basis of the preferred stock under paragraph (b) of this section. Thus, M increases its basis in S's preferred stock from $200 to $220, and M increases its basis in S's common stock from $800 to $810.

# Example 3. Cumulative redetermination.
(a)
Facts.
M owns all of S's common and preferred stock. The preferred stock has a $100 annual, cumulative preference as to dividends. For Year 1, S has $200 of taxable income, the first $100 of which is allocated to the preferred stock and the remaining $100 of which is allocated to the common stock. For Year 2, S has no adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section, and M sells all of S's common stock at the close of Year 2.
(b)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, M's basis in S's common stock must be redetermined as of the sale of the stock. The redetermination is made by reallocating the $200 positive adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section for Year 1 by taking into account all of the facts and circumstances affecting allocations as of the sale. Thus, the $200 positive adjustment for Year 1 is reallocated entirely to the preferred stock to reflect the dividend arrearages for Years 1 and 2. The reallocation away from the common stock reflects the fact that, because of the additional amount of arrearage in Year 2, the common stock is not entitled to any part of the $200 of taxable income from Year 1. Thus, the common stock has no positive or negative adjustment, and the preferred stock has a $200 positive adjustment. These reallocations are treated as the original allocations for Years 1 and 2. (The results for the common stock would be the same if the common and preferred stock were not owned by the same member, or the preferred stock were owned by nonmembers.)
(c)
Preferred stock issued after adjustment arises.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 3,
except that S does not issue its preferred stock until the beginning of Year 2, S has no further adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section for Years 2 and 3, and M sells S's common stock at the close of Year 3. Under paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section, the $200 positive adjustment for Year 1 is initially allocated entirely to the common stock. Under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the $200 adjustment is reallocated to the preferred stock to reflect the arrearages for Years 2 and 3. Thus, the common stock has no positive or negative adjustment.
(d)
Common stock issued after adjustment arises.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 3,
except that S has no preferred stock, S issues additional common stock of the same class at the beginning of Year 2, S has no further adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section in Years 2 and 3, and M sells its S common stock at the close of Year 3. Under paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section, the $200 positive adjustment for Year 1 is initially allocated entirely to the original common stock. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) of this section, the $200 adjustment is not reallocated among the original common stock and the additional stock. Unlike the preferred stock in paragraph (c) of this
Example 3,
the additional common stock is of the same class as the original stock, and there is no reallocation between shares of the same class.
(e)
Positive and negative adjustments.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 3,
except that S has a $200 loss for Year 2 that results in a negative adjustment to the common stock before any redetermination. For purposes of the basis redetermination under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the Year 1 and 2 adjustments under paragraph (b) of this section are not netted. Thus, as in paragraph (b) of this
Example 3,
the redetermination is made by reallocating the $200 positive adjustment for Year 1 entirely to the preferred stock. The $200 negative adjustment for Year 2 is allocated entirely to the common stock. Consequently, the preferred stock has a $200 positive cumulative adjustment, and the common stock has a $200 negative cumulative adjustment. (The results would be the same if there were no other adjustments described in paragraph (b) of this section, M sells S's common stock at the close of Year 3 rather than Year 2, and an additional $100 arrearage arises in Year 3; only adjustments under paragraph (b) of this section may be reallocated, and there is no additional adjustment for Year 3.)
(f)
Current distributions.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 3,
except that, during Year 1, S declares and makes a distribution to M of $100 as a dividend on the preferred stock and $100 as a dividend on the common stock. The taxable income and distributions result in no Year 1 adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section for either the common or preferred stock. For example, if T merges into S, S is treated, as the context may require, as a successor to T and as becoming a member of the group. However, as in paragraph (b) of this
Example 3,
the redetermination under paragraph (c)(4) of this section is made by reallocating a $200 positive adjustment for Year 1 (S's net adjustment described in paragraph (b) of this section, determined without taking distributions into account) to the preferred stock. Consequently, the preferred
stock has a $100 positive cumulative adjustment ($200 of taxable income, less a $100 distribution with respect to the preferred stock) and the common stock has a $100 negative cumulative adjustment (for the distribution).
(g)
Convertible preferred stock.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 3,
except that the preferred stock is convertible into common stock that is identical to the common stock already outstanding, the holders of the preferred stock convert the stock at the close of Year 2, and no stock is sold until the close of Year 5. Under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the $200 positive adjustment for Year 1 is reallocated entirely to the preferred stock immediately before the conversion. The newly issued common stock is treated as a second class of S common stock, and adjustments under paragraph (b) of this section are allocated between the original and the new common stock under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Although the preferred stock is converted to common stock, the $200 adjustment to the preferred stock is not subsequently reallocated between the original and the new common stock. Because the original and the new stock are equivalent, adjustments under paragraph (b) of this section for subsequent periods are allocated equally to each share.
(h)
Prior use of allocations.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 3,
except that M sells 10% of S's common stock at the close of Year 1, and the remaining 90% at the close of Year 2. M's basis in the common stock sold in Year 1 reflects $10 of the adjustment allocated to the common stock for Year 1. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, because $10 of the Year 1 adjustment was used in determining M's gain or loss, only $90 is reallocated to the preferred stock, and $10 remains allocated to the common stock sold.
(i)
Lower-tier members.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 3,
except that M owns only S's common stock, and M is also a subsidiary. If there is a redetermination under paragraph (c)(4) of this section by a member owning M's stock, a redetermination with respect to S's stock must be made first, and the effect of that redetermination on M's adjustments is taken into account under paragraph (b) of this section. However, as in paragraph (h) of this
Example 3,
to the extent an amount of the initial adjustments with respect to S's common stock have already been tiered up and used by a member owning M's stock, that amount remains with S's common stock (and the higher-tier member using the adjustment with respect to M's stock), and may not be reallocated to S's preferred stock.

# Example 4. Allocation to preferred stock between groups.
(a)
Facts.
M owns all of S's only class of stock, and S owns all of T's common and preferred stock. The preferred stock has a $100 annual, cumulative preference as to dividends. For Year 1, T has $200 of taxable income, the first $100 of which is allocated to the preferred stock and the remaining $100 of which is allocated to the common stock, and S has no adjustments other than the amounts tiered up from T. S and T have no adjustments under paragraph (b) of this section for Years 2 and 3. X, the common parent of another consolidated group, purchases all of S's stock at the close of Year 3, and S and T become members of the X group. For Year 4, T has $200 of taxable income, and S has no adjustments other than the amounts tiered up from T.
(b)
Analysis for Years 1 through 3.
Under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the allocation of S's adjustments under paragraph (b) of this section (determined without taking distributions into account) must be redetermined as of the time M sells S's stock. As a result of this redetermination, T's common stock has no positive or negative adjustment and the preferred stock has a $200 positive adjustment.
(c)
Analysis for Year 4.
Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the allocation of T's $200 positive adjustment in Year 4 to T's preferred stock with respect to arrearages is made by taking into account the consolidated return years of both the M group and the X group. Thus, the allocation of the $200 positive adjustment for Year 4 to T's preferred stock is not treated as an allocation for a period for which the preferred stock is owned by a nonmember. Thus, the $200 adjustment is reflected in S's basis in T's preferred stock under paragraph (b) of this section.
(d)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section—
(1)
Class.
The shares of a member having the same material terms (without taking into account voting rights) are treated as a single class of stock.
(2)
Preferred stock.
Preferred stock is stock that is limited and preferred as to dividends and has a liquidation preference. A class of stock that is not described in section 1504(a)(4), however, is not treated as preferred stock for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section if members own less than 80% of each class of common stock (determined without taking this paragraph (d)(2) into account).
(3)
Common stock.
Common stock is stock that is not preferred stock.
(4)
Becoming a nonmember.
A member is treated as becoming a nonmember if it has a separate return year (including another group's consolidated return year). For example, S may become a
nonmember if it issues additional stock to nonmembers, but S does not become a nonmember as a result of its complete liquidation.
(e)
Anti-avoidance rule
—(1)
General rule.
If any person acts with a principal purpose contrary to the purposes of this section, to avoid the effect of the rules of this section or apply the rules of this section to avoid the effect of any other provision of the consolidated return regulations, adjustments must be made as necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.
(2)
Examples.
The principles of this paragraph (e) are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1. Preferred stock treated as common stock.
(a)
Facts.
S has 100 shares of common stock and 100 shares of preferred stock described in section 1504(a)(4). M owns 80 shares of S's common stock and all of S's preferred stock. The shareholders expect that S will have negative adjustments under paragraph (b) of this section for Years 1 and 2 (all of which will be allocable to S's common stock), the negative adjustments will have no significant effect on the value of S's stock, and S will have offsetting positive adjustments thereafter. When the preferred stock was issued, M intended to cause S to recapitalize the preferred stock into additional common stock at the end of Year 2 in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(E). M's temporary ownership of the preferred stock is with a principal purpose to limit M's basis reductions under paragraph (b) of this section to 80% of the anticipated negative adjustments. The recapitalization is intended to cause significantly more than 80% of the anticipated positive adjustments to increase M's basis in S's stock because of M's increased ownership of S's common stock immediately after the recapitalization.
(b)
Analysis.
S has established a transitory capital structure with a principal purpose to enhance M's basis in S's stock under this section. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, all of S's common and preferred stock is treated as a single class of common stock in Years 1 and 2 for purposes of this section. Thus, S's items are allocated under the principles of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, and M decreases its basis in both the common and preferred stock accordingly.

# Example 2. Contribution of appreciated property.
(a)
Facts.
M owns all of the stock of S and T, and S and T each own 50% of the stock of U. M's S stock has a $150 basis and $200 value, and M's T stock has a $200 basis and $200 value. With a principal purpose to eliminate M's gain from an anticipated sale of S's stock, T contributes to U an asset with a $100 value and $0 basis, and S contributes $100 cash. U sells T's asset and recognizes a $100 gain that results in a $100 positive adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, U's adjustment ordinarily would be allocated equally to each share of U's stock. If so allocated, M's basis in S's stock would increase from $150 to $200 and M would recognize no gain from the sale of S's stock for $200. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, however, because T transferred an appreciated asset to U with a principal purpose to shift a portion of the stock basis increase from M's stock in T to M's stock in S, the allocation of the $100 positive adjustment under paragraph (c) of this section between the shares of U's stock must take into account the contribution. Consequently, all $100 of the positive adjustment is allocated to the U stock owned by T, rather than $50 to the U stock owned by S and $50 to the U stock owned by T. M's basis in S's stock remains $150, and its basis in T's stock increases to $300. Thus, M recognizes a $50 gain from its sale of S's stock for $200.

# Example 3. Reorganizations.
(a)
Facts.
M forms S with an $800 contribution, $200 of which is in exchange for S's preferred stock described in section 1504(a)(4) and the balance of which is for S's common stock. For Years 1 through 3, S has a total of $160 of ordinary income, $60 of which is distributed with respect to the preferred stock in satisfaction of its $20 annual preference as to dividends. Under this section, M's basis in S's preferred stock is unchanged, and its basis in S's common stock is increased from $600 to $700. To reduce its gain from an anticipated sale of S's preferred stock, M forms T at the close of Year 3 with a contribution of all of S's stock in exchange for corresponding common and preferred stock of T in a transaction to which section 351 applies. At the time of the contribution, the fair market value of the common stock is $700 and the fair market value of the preferred stock is $300 (due to a decrease in prevailing market interest rates). M subsequently sells T's preferred stock for $300.
(b)
Analysis.
Under section 358(b), M ordinarily has a $630 basis in T's common stock (70% of the $900 aggregate stock basis) and a $270 basis in T's preferred stock (30% of the $900 aggregate stock basis). However, because M transferred S's stock to T with a principal purpose to shift the allocation of basis adjustments under this section, adjustments are made under paragraph (e)(1) of this section to preserve the allocation under this section. Thus, M has a $700 basis in T's common stock and a $200 basis in T's preferred stock. Consequently, M recognizes a $100 gain from the sale of T's preferred stock.

# Example 4. Post-deconsolidation basis adjustments.
(a)
Facts.
For Year 1, the M group has
$40 of taxable income when determined by including only S's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss taken into account, and M increases its basis in S's stock by $40 under paragraph (b) of this section. M anticipates that S will have a $40 ordinary loss for Year 2 that will be carried back and offset S's income in Year 1 and result in a $40 reduction to M's basis in S's stock for Year 2 under paragraph (b) of this section. With a principal purpose to avoid the reduction, M causes S to issue voting preferred stock that results in S becoming a nonmember at the beginning of Year 2. As anticipated, S has a $40 loss for Year 2, which is carried back to Year 1 and offsets S's income from Year 1.
(b)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, because M caused S to become a nonmember with a principal purpose to absorb S's loss but avoid the corresponding negative adjustment under this section, and M bears a substantial portion of the loss because of its continued ownership of S common stock, the basis of M's common stock in S is decreased by $40 for Year 2. (If M has less than a $40 basis in the retained S stock, M must recognize income for Year 2 to the extent of the excess.) Section 1504(a)(3) limits the ability of S to subsequently rejoin the M group's consolidated return.
(c)
Carryback to pre-consolidation year.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 4,
except that M anticipates that S's loss will be carried back and absorbed in a separate return year of S before Year 1 (rather than to the M group's consolidated return for Year 1). Although M causes S to become a nonmember with a principal purpose to avoid the negative adjustment under this section, and M bears a substantial portion of the loss because of its continued ownership of S common stock, both S's income and loss are taken into account under the separate return rules. Consequently, no one has acted with a principal purpose contrary to the purposes of this section, and no adjustments are necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.

# Example 5. Pre-consolidation basis adjustments.
(a)
Facts.
M forms S with a $100 contribution, and S becomes a member of the M affiliated group which does not file consolidated returns. For Years 1 through 3, S earns $300. M anticipates that it will elect under section 1501 for the M group to begin filing consolidated returns in Year 5. In anticipation of filing consolidated returns, and to avoid the negative stock basis adjustment that would result under paragraph (b) of this section from distributing S's earnings after Year 5, M causes S to distribute $300 during Year 4 as a qualifying dividend within the meaning of section 243(b). There is no plan or intention to recontribute the funds to S after the distribution.
(b)
Analysis.
Although S's distribution of $300 is with a principal purpose to avoid a corresponding negative adjustment under this section, the $300 was both earned and distributed entirely under the separate return rules. Consequently, M and S have not acted with a principal purpose contrary to the purposes of this section, and no adjustments are necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.
(f)
Predecessors and successors.
For purposes of this section, any reference to a corporation or to a share of stock includes a reference to a successor or predecessor as the context may require. A corporation is a successor if the basis of its assets is determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of another corporation (the predecessor). For example, if T merges into S, S is treated, as the context may require, as a successor to T and as becoming a member of the group. A share is a successor if its basis is determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of another share (the predecessor).
(g)
Recordkeeping.
Adjustments under this section must be reflected annually on permanent records (including work papers). See also section 6001, requiring records to be maintained. The group must be able to identify from these permanent records the amount and allocation of adjustments, including the nature of any tax-exempt income and noncapital, nondeductible expenses, so as to permit the application of the rules of this section for each year.
(h)
Effective/applicability date
—(1)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (h)(8) of this section, this section applies with respect to determinations of the basis of the stock of a subsidiary (e.g., for determining gain or loss from a disposition of stock), in consolidated return years beginning on or after January 1, 1995. If this section applies, basis must be determined or redetermined as if this section were in effect for all years (including, for example, the consolidated return years of another consolidated group to the extent adjustments from those years are still reflected). For example, if the portion of a consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S expired in 1990 and is treated as a noncapital, nondeductible expense under paragraph (b) of this section, it is taken into account in tax years beginning on or
after January 1, 1995 as a negative adjustment for 1990. Any such determination or redetermination does not, however, affect any prior period. Thus, the negative adjustment for S's noncapital, nondeductible expense is not taken into account for tax years beginning before January 1, 1995.
(2)
Dispositions of stock before effective date
—(i)
In general.
If M disposes of stock of S in a consolidated return year beginning before January 1, 1995, the amount of M's income, gain, deduction, or loss, and the basis reflected in that amount, are not redetermined under this section.
(ii)
Lower-tier members.
Although M disposes of S's stock in a tax year beginning before January 1, 1995, S's determinations or adjustments with respect to the stock of a lower-tier member with which it continues to file a consolidated return are redetermined in accordance with the rules of this section (even if they were previously taken into account by M and reflected in income, gain, deduction, or loss from the disposition of S's stock). For example, assume that M owns all of S's stock, S owns all of T's stock, and T owns all of U's stock. If S sells 80% of T's stock in a tax year beginning before January 1, 1995 (the effective date), the amount of S's income, gain, deduction, or loss from the sale, and the stock basis adjustments reflected in that amount, are not redetermined if M sells S's stock after the effective date. If S sells the remaining 20% of T's stock after the effective date, S's stock basis adjustments with respect to that T stock are also not redetermined because T became a nonmember before the effective date. However, if T and U continue to file a consolidated return with each other and T sells U's stock after the effective date, T's stock basis adjustments with respect to U's stock are redetermined (even though some of those adjustments may have been taken into account by S in its prior sale of T's stock before the effective date).
(iii)
Deferred amounts.
For purposes of this paragraph (h)(2), a disposition does not include a transaction to which § 1.1502-13, § 1.1502-13T, § 1.1502-14, or § 1.1502-14T applies. Instead, the transaction is deemed to occur as the income, gain, deduction, or loss (if any) is taken into account.
(3)
Distributions
—(i)
Deemed dividend elections.
If there is a deemed distribution and recontribution pursuant to § 1.1502-32(f)(2) as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1994 in a consolidated return year beginning before January 1, 1995, the deemed distribution and recontribution under the election are treated as an actual distribution by S and recontribution by M as provided under the election.
(ii)
Affiliated earnings and profits.
This section does not apply to reduce the basis in S's stock as a result of a distribution of earnings and profits accumulated in separate return years, if the distribution is made in a consolidated return year beginning before January 1, 1995, and the distribution does not cause a negative adjustment under the investment adjustment rules in effect at the time of the distribution. See paragraph (h)(5) of this section for the rules in effect with respect to the distribution.
(4)
Expiring loss carryovers.
If S became a member of a consolidated group in a consolidated return year beginning before January 1, 1995, and S had a loss carryover from a separate return limitation year at that time, the group does not treat any expiration of the loss carryover (even if in a tax year beginning on or after January 1, 1995) as a noncapital, nondeductible expense resulting in a negative adjustment under this section. If S becomes a member of a consolidated group in a consolidated return year beginning on or after January 1, 1995, and S has a loss carryover from a separate return limitation year at that time, adjustments with respect to the expiration are determined under this section.
(5)
Continuing basis reductions for certain deconsolidated subsidiaries.
If a subsidiary ceases to be a member of a group in a consolidated return year beginning before January 1, 1995, and its basis was subject to reduction under § 1.1502-32T or § 1.1502-32(g) as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1994, its basis remains subject to reduction under those principles. For example, if S ceased to be a member in 1990, and M's basis in any
retained S stock was subject to a basis reduction account, the basis remains subject to reduction. Similarly, if an election could be made to apply § 1.1502-32T instead of § 1.1502-32(g), the election remains available. However, §§ 1.1502-32T and 1.1502-32(g) do not apply as a result of a subsidiary ceasing to be a member in tax years beginning on or after January 1, 1995.
(6)
Loss suspended under § 1.1502-35(c) or disallowed under § 1.1502-35(g)(3)(iii).
Paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(3)(iii)(C) and (D), and (b)(4)(vi) of this section are applicable on and after March 10, 2006.
(7)
Rules related to discharge of indebtedness income excluded from gross income.
Paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (b)(3)(ii)(C)(
1
), (b)(3)(iii)(A), and (b)(5)(ii),
Example 4,
paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section apply with respect to determinations of the basis of the stock of a subsidiary in consolidated return years the original return for which is due (without regard to extensions) after March 21, 2005. However, groups may apply those provisions with respect to determinations of the basis of the stock of a subsidiary in consolidated return years the original return for which is due (without regard to extensions) on or before March 21, 2005, and after August 29, 2003.
(8)
Determination of stock basis in reorganization with boot.
Paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(F) of this section (
Example 6
) applies only with respect to determinations of the basis of the stock of a subsidiary on or after January 23, 2006.
(9)
Allocations of investment adjustments, including adjustments attributable to certain loss transfers; certain conforming amendments.
Paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(3)(ii)(C)(
2
), (c)(1), (c)(2)(i), (c)(2)(ii)(A), (c)(3), and (c)(4)(i) of this section are applicable for determinations of the basis of stock of a subsidiary on or after September 17, 2008.
(i) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.1502-32T(i) through (j)(1).
(10)
Election to treat loss carryover as expiring.
Paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section applies to any original consolidated Federal income tax return due (without extensions) after June 14, 2007. For original consolidated Federal income tax returns due (without extensions) after May 30, 2006, and on or before June 14, 2007,
see
§ 1.1502-32T as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on April 1, 2007.

§ 1.1502-33
Earnings and profits.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Purpose.
This section provides rules for adjusting the earnings and profits of a subsidiary (S) and any member (P) owning S's stock. These rules modify the determination of P's earnings and profits under applicable rules of law, including section 312, by adjusting P's earnings and profits to reflect S's earnings and profits for the period that S is a member of the consolidated group. The purpose for modifying the determination of earnings and profits is to treat P and S as a single entity by reflecting the earnings and profits of lower-tier members in the earnings and profits of higher-tier members and consolidating the group's earnings and profits in the common parent. References in this section to earnings and profits include deficits in earnings and profits.
(2)
Application of other rules of law, duplicative adjustments.
See § 1.1502-80(a) regarding the general applicability of other rules of law and a limitation on duplicative adjustments. The rules of this section are in addition to other rules of law. For example, the allowance for depreciation is determined in accordance with section 312(k). P's earnings and profits must not be adjusted under this section and other rules of law in a manner that has the effect of duplicating an adjustment. For example, if S's earnings and profits are reflected in P's earnings and profits under paragraph (b) of this section, and S transfers its assets to P in a liquidation to which section 332 applies, S's earnings and profits that P succeeds to under section 381 must be adjusted to prevent duplication.
(b)
Tiering up earnings and profits
—(1)
General rule.
P's earnings and profits are adjusted under this section to reflect changes in S's earnings and profits in accordance with the applicable
principles of § 1.1502-32, consistently applied, and an adjustment to P's earnings and profits for a tax year under this paragraph (b)(1) is treated as earnings and profits of P for the tax year in which the adjustment arises. Under these principles, for example, the adjustments are made as of the close of each consolidated return year, and as of any other time if a determination at that time is necessary to determine the earnings and profits of any person. Similarly, S's earnings and profits are allocated under the principles of § 1.1502-32(c), and the adjustments are applied in the order of the tiers, from the lowest to the highest. However, modifications to the principles include:
(i) The amount of P's adjustment is determined by reference to S's earnings and profits, rather than S's taxable and tax-exempt items (and therefore, for example, the deferral of a negative adjustment for S's unabsorbed losses does not apply).
(ii) The tax sharing rules under paragraph (d) of this section apply rather than those of § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iv)(D).
(2)
Affiliated earnings and profits.
The reduction in S's earnings and profits under section 312 from a distribution of earnings and profits accumulated in separate return years of S that are not separate return limitation years does not tier up to P's earnings and profits. Thus, the increase in P's earnings and profits under section 312 from receipt of the distribution is not offset by a corresponding reduction.
(3)
Examples
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of the examples in this section, unless otherwise stated, P owns all of the only class of S's stock, the stock is owned for the entire year, S owns no stock of lower-tier members, the tax year of all persons is the calendar year, all persons use the accrual method of accounting, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, preferred stock is described in section 1504(a)(4), all transactions are between unrelated persons, and tax liabilities are disregarded.
(ii)
Tiering up earnings and profits.
The principles of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1. Tier-up and distribution of earnings and profits.
(a)
Facts.
P forms S in Year 1 with a $100 contribution. S has $100 of earnings and profits for Year 1 and no earnings and profits for Year 2. During Year 2, S declares and distributes a $50 dividend to P.
(b)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, S's $100 of earnings and profits for Year 1 increases P's earnings and profits for Year 1. P has no additional earnings and profits for Year 2 as a result of the $50 distribution in Year 2, because there is a $50 increase in P's earnings and profits as a result of the receipt of the dividend and a corresponding $50 decrease in S's earnings and profits under section 312(a) that is reflected in P's earnings and profits under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(c)
Distribution of current earnings and profits.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 1,
except that S distributes the $50 dividend at the end of Year 1 rather than during Year 2. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, P's earnings and profits are increased by $100 (S's $50 of undistributed earnings and profits, plus P's receipt of the $50 distribution). Thus, S's earnings and profits increase by $50 and P's earnings and profits increase by $100.
(d)
Affiliated earnings and profits.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 1,
except that P and S do not begin filing consolidated returns until Year 2. Because P and S file separate returns for Year 1, P's basis in S's stock remains $100 under § 1.1502-32 and this section, S has $100 of earnings and profits, and none of S's earnings and profits is reflected in P's earnings and profits under paragraph (b) of this section. S's distribution in Year 2 ordinarily would reduce S's earnings and profits but not increase P's earnings and profits. (P's $50 of earnings and profits from the dividend would be offset by S's $50 reduction in earnings and profits that tiers up under paragraph (b) of this section.) However, under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the negative adjustment for S's distribution to P does not apply. Thus, S's distribution reduces its earnings and profits by $50 but increases P's earnings and profits by $50. (If S's earnings and profits had been accumulated in a separate return limitation year, paragraph (b)(2) of this section would not apply and the distribution would reduce S's earnings and profits but not increase P's earnings and profits.)
(e)
Earnings and profits deficit.
Assume instead that after P forms S in Year 1 with a $100 contribution, S borrows additional funds and has a $150 deficit in earnings and profits for Year 1. The corresponding loss for tax purposes is not absorbed in Year 1, and is included in the group's consolidated net operating loss carried forward to Year 2. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, however, S's $150 deficit in earnings and profits decreases P's earnings and profits for Year 1 by $150. (Absorption of the loss in a later tax year has no effect on the earnings and profits of P and S.)

# Example 2. Section 355 distribution.
(a)
Facts.
P owns all of S's stock and S owns all of T's stock. For Year 1, T has $100 of earnings and profits. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the earnings and profits of T tier up to S and to P. S and P have no other earnings and profits for Year 1. S distributes T's stock to P at the end of Year 1 in a distribution to which section 355 applies.
(b)
Analysis.
Because S's distribution of T's stock is a distribution to which section 355 applies, the applicable principles of § 1.1502-32(b)(2)(iv) do not require P's earnings and profits to be adjusted by reason of the distribution. In addition, although S's earnings and profits may be reduced under section 312(h) as a result of the distribution, the applicable principles of § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iii) do not require P's earnings and profits to be adjusted to reflect this reduction in S's earnings and profits.

# Example 3. Allocating earnings and profits among shares.
P owns 80% of S's stock throughout Year 1. For Year 1, S has $100 of earnings and profits. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, $80 of S's earnings and profits is allocated to P based on P's ownership of S's stock. Accordingly, $80 of S's earnings and profits for Year 1 is reflected in P's earnings and profits for Year 1.
(c)
Special rules.
For purposes of this section—
(1)
Stock of members.
For purposes of determining P's earnings and profits from the disposition of S's stock, P's basis in S's stock is adjusted to reflect S's earnings and profits determined under paragraph (b) of this section, rather than under § 1.1502-32. For example, P's basis in S's stock is increased by positive earnings and profits and decreased by deficits in earnings and profits. Similarly, P's basis in S's stock is not reduced for distributions to which paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies (affiliated earnings and profits). P may have an excess loss account in S's stock for earnings and profits purposes (whether or not there is an excess loss account under § 1.1502-32), and the excess loss account is determined, adjusted, and taken into account in accordance with the principles of §§ 1.1502-19 and 1.1502-32.
(2)
Intercompany transactions.
Intercompany items and corresponding items are not reflected in earnings and profits before they are taken into account under § 1.1502-13. See § 1.1502-13 for the applicable rules and definitions.
(3)
Example.
The principles of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by the following example.

# Example. Adjustments to stock basis.
(a)
Facts.
P forms S in Year 1 with a $100 contribution. For Year 1, S has $75 of taxable income and $100 of earnings and profits. For Year 2, S has no taxable income or earnings and profits, and S declares and distributes a $50 dividend to P. P sells all of S's stock for $150 at the end of Year 2.
(b)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, P's basis in S's stock for earnings and profits purposes immediately before the sale is $150 (the $100 initial basis, plus S's $100 of earnings and profits for Year 1, minus the $50 distribution of earnings and profits in Year 2). Thus, P recognizes no gain or loss from the sale of S's stock for earnings and profits purposes.
(c)
Earnings and profits deficit.
Assume instead that S has a $100 tax loss and earnings and profits deficit for Year 1. The tax loss is not absorbed in Year 1 and is included in the group's consolidated net operating loss carried forward to Year 2. Under paragraph (b) of this section, S's $100 deficit in earnings and profits decreases P's earnings and profits for Year 1. Under paragraph (c) of this section, P decreases its basis in S's stock for purposes of determining earnings and profits from $100 to $0. (If S had borrowed an additional $50 that it also lost in Year 1, P would have decreased its earnings and profits for Year 1 by the additional $50, and P would have had a $50 excess loss account in S's stock for earnings and profits purposes, which would be taken into account in determining P's earnings and profits from its sale of S's stock.)
(d)
Affiliated earnings and profits.
Assume instead that P and S do not begin filing consolidated returns until Year 2. Under paragraph (b) of this section, the negative adjustment under § 1.1502-32(b) for distributions does not apply to S's distribution of earnings and profits accumulated in a separate return year that is a not separate return limitation year. Thus, P's basis in S's stock for earnings and profits purposes remains $100, and P has $50 of earnings and profits from the sale of S's stock.
(d)
Federal income tax liability
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Extension of tax allocations.
Section 1552 allocates the tax liability of a consolidated group among its members for purposes of determining the amounts by which their earnings and profits are reduced for taxes. Section 1552 does not reflect the absorption by one member of another member's tax attributes (e.g., losses, deductions and credits). For example, if P's $100 of income is offset by S's $100 of
deductions, consolidated tax liability is $0 and no amount is allocated under section 1552. However, the group may elect under this paragraph (d) to allocate additional amounts to reflect the absorption by one member of the tax attributes of another member. Permissible methods are set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) through (4) of this section, and election procedures are provided in paragraph (d)(5) of this section. Allocations under this paragraph (d) must be reflected annually on permanent records (including work papers). Any computations of separate return tax liability are subject to the principles of section 1561.
(ii)
Effect of extended tax allocations.
The amounts allocated under this paragraph (d) are treated as allocations of tax liability for purposes of § 1.1552-1(b)(2). For example, if P's taxable income is offset by S's loss, and tax liability is allocated under the percentage method of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, P's earnings and profits are reduced as if its income were subject to tax, P is treated as liable to S for the amount of the tax, and corresponding adjustments are made to S's earnings and profits. If the liability of one member to another is not paid, the amount not paid generally is treated as a distribution, contribution, or both, depending on the relationship between the members.
(2)
Wait-and-see method.
The wait-and-see method under this paragraph (d)(2) is derived from Securities and Exchange Commission procedures. In the year that a member's tax attribute is absorbed, the group's consolidated tax liability is allocated in accordance with the group's method under section 1552. When, in effect, the member with the tax attribute could have absorbed the attribute on a separate return basis in a later year, a portion of the group's consolidated tax liability for the later year that is otherwise allocated to members under section 1552 is reallocated. The reallocation takes into account all consolidated return years to which this paragraph (d) applies (the computation period), and is determined by comparing the tax allocated to a member during the computation period with the member's tax liability determined as if it had filed separate returns during the computation period.
(i)
Cap on allocation under section 1552.
A member's allocation under section 1552 for a tax year may not exceed the excess, if any, of—
(A) The total of the tax liabilities of the member for the computation period (including the current year), determined as if the member had filed separate returns; over
(B) The total amount allocated to the member under section 1552 and this paragraph (d) for the computation period (except the current year).
(ii)
Reallocation of capped amounts.
To the extent that the amount allocated to a member under section 1552 exceeds the limitation under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the excess is allocated among the remaining members in proportion to (but not to exceed the amount of) each member's excess, if any, of—
(A) The total of the tax liabilities of the member for the computation period (including the current year), determined as if the member had filed separate returns; over
(B) The total amount allocated to the member under section 1552 and this paragraph (d) for the computation period (including for the current year only the amount allocated under section 1552).
(iii)
Reallocation of excess capped amounts.
If the reductions under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section exceed the amounts allocable under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the excess is allocated among the members in accordance with the group's method under section 1552 without taking this paragraph (d)(2) into account.
(3)
Percentage method.
The percentage method under this paragraph (d)(3) allocates tax liability based on the absorption of tax attributes, without taking into account the ability of any member to subsequently absorb its own tax attributes. The allocation under this method is in addition to the allocation under section 1552.
(i)
Decreased earnings and profits.
A member's allocation under section 1552 for any year is increased, thereby decreasing its earnings and profits, by a fixed percentage (not to exceed 100%) of the excess, if any, of—
(A) The member's separate return tax liability for the consolidated return year as determined under § 1.1552-1(a)(2)(ii); over
(B) The amount allocated to the member under section 1552.
(ii)
Increased earnings and profits.
An amount equal to the total decrease in earnings and profits under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section (including amounts allocated as a result of a carryback) increases the earnings and profits of the members whose attributes are absorbed, and is allocated among them in a manner that reasonably reflects the absorption of the tax attributes.
(4)
Additional methods.
The absorption by one member of the tax attributes of another member may be reflected under any other method approved in writing by the Commissioner.
(5)
Election of allocation method
—(i)
In general.
Tax liability may be allocated under this paragraph (d) only if an election is filed with the group's first return. The election must—
(A) Be made in a separate statement entitled “ELECTION TO ALLOCATE TAX LIABILITY UNDER § 1.1502-33(d)”;
(B) State the allocation method elected under § 1.1502-33(d) and under section 1552;
(C) If the percentage method is elected, state the percentage (not to exceed 100%) to be used; and
(D) If a method is permitted under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, provide the date and control number of the private letter ruling issued by the Internal Revenue Service approving such method.
(ii)
Consent
—(A)
Electing or changing methods.
An election for a later year, or an election to change methods, may be made only with the written consent of the Commissioner.
(B)
Prior law elections.
An election in effect for the last tax year beginning before January 1, 1995, remains in effect under this section. However, a group may elect to conform its earnings and profits computations to the method described in § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iv)(D) (the percentage method, using a 100% allocation), whether or not it has previously made an election for earnings and profits purposes. If a conforming election is made, the group must make all adjustments necessary to prevent amounts from being duplicated or omitted. The conforming election is made by attaching a statement entitled “ELECTION TO CONFORM TAX ALLOCATIONS UNDER §§ 1.1502-32 and 1.1502-33(d)” to the consolidated group's return for its first tax year beginning on or after January 1, 1995. The statement must be signed by the common parent, and must specify whether the method is conformed only for years beginning on or after January 1, 1995 or as if the method were in effect for all prior years. The statement must also describe the adjustments made by reason of the change (e.g., to reflect prior use of earnings and profits).
(6)
Examples.
The principles of this paragraph (d) are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1. Wait-and-see method.
(a)
Facts.
P owns all of the stock of S1 and S2. The P group uses the wait-and-see method of allocation under paragraph (d)(2) of this section in conjunction with § 1.1552-1(a)(1). For Year 1, each member's taxable income, both for purposes of § 1.1552-1(a)(1) and redetermined as if the member had filed separate returns, is as follows: P $0, S1 $2,000, and S2 ($1,000). Thus, the P group's consolidated tax liability for Year 1 is $340 (assuming a 34% tax rate).
(b)
Analysis.
Under § 1.1552-1(a)(1)(i), the tax liability of the P group is allocated among the members in accordance with the portion of the consolidated taxable income attributable to each member having taxable income. Thus, all of the P group's $340 consolidated tax liability is allocated to S1. As a result, S1 decreases its earnings and profits under section 1552 by $340 (even if S1 does not pay the tax liability). No further allocations are made under paragraph (d)(2) of this section because S2 cannot yet absorb its loss on a separate return basis.
(c)
Payment of tax liability.
If S1 pays the $340 tax liability, there is no further effect on the income, earnings and profits, or stock basis of any member. If P pays the $340 tax liability (and the payment is not a loan from P to S1), P is treated as making a $340 contribution to the capital of S1; if S2 pays the $340 tax liability (and the payment is not a loan from S2 to S1), S2 is treated as making a $340 distribution to P with respect to its stock, and P is treated as making a $340 contribution to the capital of S1. See § 1.1552-1(b)(2).
(d)
Year 2.
For Year 2, each member's taxable income, under § 1.1552-1(a)(1)(ii) and redetermined as if the member had filed separate returns, without taking into account any carryover from Year 1, is as follows: P $0, S1 $1,000, and S2 $3,000. Thus, the P group's consolidated tax liability for Year 2 is $1,360 (assuming a 34% tax rate). Of this amount, section 1552 would allocate $340 to S1 and $1,020 to S2. However, under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, no more than $680 may be allocated to S2. This is because S2 would have had an aggregate tax liability of $680 if it had filed separate returns for Years 1 and 2 (a $0 tax liability for Year 1, and a $680 tax liability for Year 2, taking into account a $1,000 net operating loss carryover from Year 1). Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the entire excess of $340 which would otherwise be allocated to S2 under § 1.1552-1(a)(1) is allocated to S1. This is because S1 would have had an additional $340 of aggregate tax liability if it had filed separate returns for Years 1 and 2 (a $680 tax liability for Year 1, and a $340 tax liability for Year 2, not taking into account S2's $1,000 net operating loss for Year 1). The effect of the allocation of $680 to S1 and $680 to S2 is determined under § 1.1552-1(b)(2).

# Example 2. Percentage method.
(a)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
but the P group uses the percentage method of allocation under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, with a percentage of 100%. In addition, the taxable incomes and losses of the members are the same if computed as provided in § 1.1552-1(a)(2)(ii).
(b)
Analysis.
Under § 1.1552-1(a)(2)(ii), $340 of tax liability is allocated to S1 for Year 1. Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, S1 is allocated another $340 of tax liability because S1 would have had a $680 tax liability if it had filed separate returns but only $340 is allocated to S1 under section 1552. Thus, S1's earnings and profits are decreased by the $680 total. Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, S2's earnings and profits are increased by $340 because the additional $340 allocated to S1 under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section is attributable to the absorption of S2's losses.
(c)
Payment of tax liability.
If S1 pays the $340 tax liability of the P group and pays $340 to S2, the Year 1 tax liability results in no further adjustments to the income, earnings and profits, or basis of any member's stock. If S1 pays the $340 tax liability of the P group and pays the other $340 to P instead of S2 because, for example, of an agreement among the members, S2 is treated as distributing $340 to P with respect to its stock in the year that S1 makes the payment to P. See § 1.1552-1(b)(2).
(d)
Year 2.
For Year 2, $340 is allocated to S1 and $1,020 is allocated to S2 under section 1552. No additional amounts are allocated under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(e)
Deconsolidations
—(1)
In general.
Immediately before it becomes a nonmember, S's earnings and profits are eliminated to the extent they were taken into account by any member under this section. If S's earnings and profits are eliminated under this paragraph (e)(1), no corresponding adjustment is made to the earnings and profits of P (or any other member) under paragraph (b) of this section or to any basis in a member's stock under paragraph (c) of this section. For this purpose, S is treated as becoming a nonmember on the first day of its first separate return year (including another group's consolidated return year).
(2)
Acquisition of group
—(i)
Application.
This paragraph (e)(2) applies only if a consolidated group (the terminating group) ceases to exist as a result of—
(A) The acquisition of either the assets of the common parent of the terminating group in a reorganization described in section 381(a)(2), or the stock of the common parent of the terminating group; or
(B) The application of the principles of § 1.1502-75(d)(2) or (d)(3).
(ii)
General rule.
Paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not apply solely by reason of the termination of a group because it is acquired, if there is a surviving group that is, immediately thereafter, a consolidated group. Instead, the surviving group is treated as the terminating group for purposes of applying this paragraph (e) to the terminating group. This treatment does not apply, however, to members of the terminating group that are not members of the surviving consolidated group immediately after the terminating group ceases to exist (e.g., under section 1504(a)(3) relating to reconsolidation, or section 1504(c) relating to includible insurance companies).
(3)
Certain corporate separations and reorganizations.
The adjustments under paragraph (e)(1) of this section must be modified to the extent necessary to effectuate the principles of section 312(h). Thus, P's earnings and profits rather than S's earnings and profits may be eliminated immediately before S becomes a nonmember. P's earnings
and profits are eliminated to the extent that its earnings and profits reflect S's earnings and profits after applying section 312(h) immediately after S becomes a nonmember (determined without taking this paragraph (e) into account).
(4)
Special uses of earnings and profits.
Paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not apply for purposes of determining—
(i) The extent to which a distribution is charged to reserve accounts under section 593(e);
(ii) The extent to which a distribution is taxable to the recipient under sections 805(a)(4) and 832; and
(iii) Any other special use identified in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
(5)
Example.
The principles of this paragraph (e) are illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
(a)
Facts.
Individuals A and B own all of P's stock, and P owns all of the stock of S and T, each with a $500 basis. For Year 1, S has $100 of earnings and profits and T has $50 of earnings and profits. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the earnings and profits of S and T tier up to P, and P has $150 of earnings and profits for Year 1. P sells all of S's stock for $600 at the close of Year 1.
(b)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, S's $100 of earnings and profits is eliminated immediately before S becomes a nonmember because the earnings and profits are taken into account under paragraph (b) of this section in P's earnings and profits. However, no corresponding adjustment is made to P's earnings and profits or to P's basis in S's stock for purposes of earnings and profits. P's earnings and profits for Year 1 remain $150 following the sale of S's stock.
(c)
Forward merger.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example,
except that, rather than P selling S's stock, S merges into a nonmember in a transaction described in section 368(a)(2)(D). Under paragraph (h) of this section, the nonmember is treated as a successor to S. Thus, as in paragraph (b) of this
Example,
S's $100 of earnings and profits is eliminated immediately before S ceases to be a member.
(d)
Acquisition of entire group.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example,
except that X, the common parent of another consolidated group, purchases all of P's stock at the close of Year 1, and P sells S's stock during Year 3. Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the earnings and profits of S and T are not eliminated as a result of X purchasing P's stock. However, S's earnings and profits from consolidated return years of both the P group and the X group are eliminated immediately before S becomes a nonmember of the X group.
(e)
Earnings and profits deficit.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d) of this
Example,
except that S has a $550 deficit in earnings and profits for Year 1. The effect of paragraph (e)(1) of this section is the same. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, P would have an excess loss account in S's stock for earnings and profits purposes under the principles of §§ 1.1502-19 and 1.1502-32, and, under the principles of § 1.1502-19(c)(2), the excess loss account is not taken into account as a result of X's purchase of P's stock. Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, S's deficit is not eliminated under paragraph (e)(1) of this section immediately before X's purchase of P's stock. However, S's earnings and profits (or deficit) is eliminated immediately before S becomes a nonmember of the X group.
(f)
Section 355 distribution.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example,
except that, rather than selling S's stock, P distributes S's stock to A at the close of Year 1 in a distribution to which section 355 applies. Under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, P's earnings and profits may be reduced under section 312(h) as a result of the distribution. To the extent that P's earnings and profits are reduced, S's earnings and profits are not eliminated under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(f)
Changes in the structure of the group
—(1)
Changes in the common parent
—(i)
General rule.
If P succeeds another corporation under the principles of § 1.1502-75(d) (2) or (3) as the common parent of a consolidated group (a group structure change), the earnings and profits of P are adjusted immediately after P becomes the new common parent to reflect the earnings and profits of the former common parent immediately before the former common parent ceases to be the common parent. The adjustment is made as if P succeeds to the earnings and profits of the former common parent in a transaction described in section 381(a). See § 1.1502-31 for the basis of the stock of members following a group structure change.
(ii)
Minority shareholders.
If the former common parent's stock is not wholly owned by members of the consolidated group immediately after the former common parent ceases to be the common parent, appropriate adjustments must be made to reflect in the new common parent only an allocable part of the former common parent's earnings and profits.
(iii)
Higher-tier members.
To the extent that earnings and profits are adjusted under this paragraph (f)(1), and the former common parent is owned by members other than P, the earnings and profits of the intermediate subsidiaries must be adjusted in accordance with the principles of this section.
(iv)
Example.
The principles of this paragraph (f)(1) are illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
(a)
Facts.
X is the common parent of a consolidated group with $100 of earnings and profits, and P is the common parent of another consolidated group with $20 of earnings and profits. P acquires all of X's stock at the close of Year 1 in exchange for 70% of P's stock. The exchange is a reverse acquisition under § 1.1502-75(d)(3), and the X group is treated as remaining in existence with P as its new common parent.
(b)
Adjustments for X group earnings and profits.
Under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, P's earnings and profits are adjusted immediately after P becomes the new common parent, to reflect X's $100 of earnings and profits immediately before X ceases to be the common parent. The adjustment is made as if P succeeds to X's earnings and profits in a transaction described in section 381(a). Thus, immediately after the acquisition, P has $120 of accumulated earnings and profits and X continues to have $100 of accumulated earnings and profits.
(c)
Adjustments for P group earnings and profits.
Although the P group terminates on P's acquisition of X's stock, under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, no adjustments are made to the earnings and profits of any subsidiaries in the terminating P group.
(d)
Acquisition of separate return corporation.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example,
except that, immediately before the acquisition of its stock by P, X is not affiliated with any other corporation. The exchange is a reverse acquisition under § 1.1502-75(d)(3), and P is treated as the common parent of the X group. Consequently, the results are the same as in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this
Example.
(2)
Change in the location of subsidiaries.
If the location of a member within a group changes, appropriate adjustments must be made to the earnings and profits of the members to prevent the earnings and profits from being eliminated. For example, if P transfers all of S's stock to another member in a transaction to which section 351 and § 1.1502-13 apply, the transferee's earnings and profits are adjusted immediately after the transfer to reflect S's earnings and profits immediately before the transfer from consolidated return years. On the other hand, if the transferee purchases S's stock from P, the transferee's earnings and profits are not adjusted.
(g)
Anti-avoidance rule.
If any person acts with a principal purpose contrary to the purposes of this section, to avoid the effect of the rules of this section or apply the rules of this section to avoid the effect of any other provision of the consolidated return regulations, adjustments must be made as necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.
(h)
Predecessors and successors.
For purposes of this section, any reference to a corporation or to a share includes a reference to a successor or predecessor as the context may require. A corporation is a successor if its earnings and profits are determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the earnings and profits of another corporation (the predecessor). A share is a successor if its basis is determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of another share (the predecessor).
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Effective/applicability date
—(1)
General rule.
This section applies with respect to determinations of the earnings and profits of a member (e.g., for purposes of a characterizing a distribution to which section 301 applies) in consolidated return years beginning on or after January 1, 1995. If this section applies, earnings and profits must be determined or redetermined as if this section were in effect for all years (including, for example, the consolidated return years of another consolidated group to the extent the earnings and profits from those years are still reflected). For example, if a distribution by P to a nonmember shareholder in 1990 was a dividend because of an unabsorbed loss carryover attributable to S, P's earnings and profits in tax years beginning after January 1, 1995 are redetermined by taking into account a negative adjustment in the tax year S's loss arose and in 1990 for P's distribution, and any subsequent absorption of the loss has no effect on earnings and profits. Any such determination or redetermination does not,
however, affect any prior period. Thus, the shareholder's treatment in 1990 of the distribution as a dividend (and the effect of the distribution on stock basis) is not redetermined under this section. Paragraphs (a)(2) and (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section apply with respect to determinations of the earnings and profits of a member in consolidated return years beginning on or after September 17, 2008. However, taxpayers may apply paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section with respect to determinations of the earnings and profits of a member in consolidated return years beginning prior to September 17, 2008.
(2)
Dispositions of stock before effective date
—(i)
In general.
If P disposes of stock of S in a consolidated return year beginning before January 1, 1995, the amount of P's earnings and profits with respect to S are not redetermined under paragraph (j)(1) of this section. See § 1.1502-19 as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1994 for the definition of disposition, and paragraph (j)(5) of this section for the rules applicable to such dispositions.
(ii)
Lower-tier members.
Although P disposes of S's stock in a tax year beginning before January 1, 1995, S's determinations or adjustments with respect to lower-tier members with which it continues to file a consolidated return are redetermined in accordance with the rules of this section (even if S's earnings and profits were previously taken into account by P). For example, assume that P owns all of S's stock, S owns all of T's stock, and T owns all of U's stock. If S sells 80% of T's stock in a tax year beginning before January 1, 1995 (the effective date), the amount of S's earnings and profits from the sale, and the adjustments to stock basis for earnings and profits purposes that are reflected in that amount, are not redetermined if P sells S's stock after the effective date. If S sells the remaining 20% of T's stock after the effective date, S's stock basis adjustments with respect to that T stock are also not redetermined because T became a nonmember before the effective date. However, if T and U continue to file a consolidated return with each other, paragraph (e)(1) of this section did not apply, and T sells U's stock after the effective date, T's earnings and profits with respect to U are redetermined (even though some of the earnings and profits may have been taken into account by S in its prior sale of T's stock before the effective date).
(iii)
Deferred amounts.
For purposes of this paragraph (j)(2), a disposition does not include a transaction to which § 1.1502-13, § 1.1502-13T, § 1.1502-14, or § 1.1502-14T applies. Instead, the transaction is deemed to occur as the earnings and profits (if any) are taken into account.
(3)
Deconsolidations and group structure changes
—(i)
In general.
Paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section apply with respect to deconsolidations and group structure changes occurring in consolidated return years beginning on or after January 1, 1995.
(ii)
Prior period group structure changes.
If there was a group structure change in a consolidated return year beginning before January 1, 1995, and earnings and profits were not determined under § 1.1502-33T(a) as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1994, a distribution in a tax year ending after September 7, 1988, of earnings and profits that are not reflected in the earnings and profits of the distributee member, but would have been so reflected if § 1.1502-33T(a) as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1994 had applied, the negative adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section for distributions does not apply (and there is therefore no offset to the increase in the earnings and profits of the distributee).
(4)
Deemed dividend elections.
If there is a deemed distribution and recontribution pursuant to § 1.1502-32(f)(2) as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1994 in a consolidated return year beginning before January 1, 1995, the deemed distribution and recontribution under the election are treated as an actual distribution by S and recontribution by P as provided under the election.
(5)
Prior law.
For prior determinations, see prior regulations under section 1502 as in effect with respect to the determination. See, e.g., §§ 1.1502-33
and 1.1502-33T as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1994.
(k)
Effective/applicability date.
Paragraph (d)(5)(i)(D) of this section applies to any original consolidated Federal income tax return due (without extensions) after June 14, 2007. For original consolidated Federal income tax returns due (without extensions) after May 30, 2006, and on or before June 14, 2007, see § 1.1502-33T as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on April 1, 2007. For original consolidated Federal income tax returns due (without extensions) on or before May 30, 2006, see § 1.1502-33 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on April 1, 2006.
[T.D. 8560, 59 FR 41695, Aug. 15, 1994, as amended by T.D. 8597, 60 FR 36710, July 18, 1995; T.D. 9264, 71 FR 30603, May 30, 2006; T.D. 9329, 72 FR 32805, June 14, 2007; T.D. 9424, 73 FR 53951, Sept. 17, 2008; 73 FR 62204, Oct. 20, 2008]
§ 1.1502-34
Special aggregate stock ownership rules.
(a)
Determination of stock ownership.
For purposes of the consolidated return regulations, in determining the stock ownership of a member of a group in another corporation (issuing corporation) for purposes of determining the application of section 165(g)(3)(A), 332(b)(1), 351(a), 732(f), or 904(f) in a consolidated return year, stock in the issuing corporation owned by all other members of the group is included. For the determination of whether a member of the group is an 80-percent distributee,
see
section 337(c) (providing that, for purposes of section 337, the determination of whether any corporation is an 80-percent distributee is made without regard to any consolidated return regulation).
(b)
Example regarding liquidation of member.
The following example illustrates the stock ownership aggregation rule set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.
(1)
Facts.
P wholly owns A, B, and C, each of which is a member of the P group. A, B, and C each owns 33
1/3
percent of the stock of D. D liquidates in a transaction purported to qualify under section 332.
(2)
Analysis.
For purposes of determining satisfaction of the 80-percent stock ownership requirement under section 332(b)(1), under the stock ownership aggregation rule set forth in paragraph (a) of this section: A is treated as owning all of the D stock owned by B and C; B is treated as owning all of the D stock owned by A and C; and C is treated as owning all of the D stock owned by A and B. Therefore, each of A, B, and C is treated as owning 100 percent of the stock of D and thus meeting the 80-percent stock ownership requirement for purposes of section 332. However, none of A, B, or C is treated as an 80-percent distributee for purposes of section 337.
See
section 337(c). Therefore, section 337(a) does not apply.
[T.D. 10018, 89 FR 106871, Dec. 30, 2024]
§ 1.1502-35
Transfers of subsidiary stock and deconsolidations of subsidiaries.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Purpose.
The purpose of this section is to prevent a group from obtaining more than one tax benefit from a single economic loss. The provisions of this section shall be construed in a manner that is consistent with that purpose and in a manner that reasonably carries out that purpose.
(2)
Dates of applicability.
This section applies if—
(i) On or after March 7, 2002, a member recognizes a loss on the disposition of a share of stock of a subsidiary (or, on or after April 10, 2007, a share of stock of a former subsidiary) or a carryover basis asset (subject to paragraph (c)(6) of this section),
(ii) The member's loss on the share of subsidiary stock or the carryover basis asset is allowed on or before the date that is ten years after the disposition of the share or carryover basis asset, and
(iii) If the disposition is of a share of subsidiary stock, it is not a transfer to which § 1.1502-36 applies.
(b)
Redetermination of basis on certain nondeconsolidating transfers of subsidiary stock and on certain deconsolidations of subsidiaries
—(1)
Redetermination of basis on certain nondeconsolidating transfers of subsidiary stock.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, if, immediately after a transfer of stock
of a subsidiary that has a basis that exceeds its value, the subsidiary remains a member of the group, then the basis in each share of subsidiary stock owned by each member of the group shall be redetermined in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b)(1) immediately before such transfer. All of the members' bases in the shares of subsidiary stock immediately before such transfer shall be aggregated. Such aggregated basis shall be allocated first to the shares of the subsidiary's preferred stock that are owned by the members of the group immediately before such transfer, in proportion to, but not in excess of, the value of those shares at such time. After allocation of the aggregated basis to all shares of the preferred stock of the subsidiary pursuant to the preceding sentence, any remaining basis shall be allocated among all common shares of subsidiary stock held by members of the group immediately before the transfer, in proportion to the value of such shares at such time.
(2)
Redetermination of basis on certain deconsolidations of subsidiaries
—(i)
Allocation of reallocable basis amount.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, if, immediately before a deconsolidation of a subsidiary, any share of stock of such subsidiary owned by a member of the group has a basis that exceeds its value, then the basis in each share of the subsidiary's stock owned by each member of the group shall be redetermined in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b)(2) immediately before such deconsolidation. The basis in each share of the subsidiary's stock held by members of the group immediately before the deconsolidation that has a basis in excess of value at such time shall be reduced, but not below such share's value, in a manner that, to the greatest extent possible, causes the ratio of the basis to the value of each such share to be the same; provided, however, that the aggregate amount of such reduction shall not exceed the reallocable basis amount (as computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section). Then, to the extent of the reallocable basis amount, the basis of each share of the preferred stock of the subsidiary that are held by members of the group immediately before the deconsolidation shall be increased, but not above such share's value, in a manner that, to the greatest extent possible, causes the ratio of the basis to the value of each such share to be the same. Then, to the extent that the reallocable basis amount does not increase the basis of shares of preferred stock of the subsidiary pursuant to the third sentence of this paragraph (b)(2)(i), such amount shall increase the basis of all common shares of the subsidiary's stock held by members of the group immediately before the deconsolidation in a manner that, to the greatest extent possible, causes the ratio of the basis to the value of each such share to be the same.
(ii)
Calculation of reallocable basis amount.
The reallocable basis amount shall equal the lesser of—
(A) The aggregate of all amounts by which, immediately before the deconsolidation, the basis exceeds the value of a share of subsidiary stock owned by any member of the group at such time; and
(B) The total of the subsidiary's (and any predecessor's) items of deduction and loss, and the subsidiary's (and any predecessor's) allocable share of items of deduction and loss of all lower-tier subsidiaries, that were taken into account in computing the adjustment under § 1.1502-32 to the bases of shares of stock of the subsidiary (and any predecessor) held by members of the group immediately before the deconsolidation, other than shares that have bases in excess of value immediately before the deconsolidation.
(3)
Exceptions to application of redetermination rules.
(i) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not apply to a transfer of subsidiary stock if—
(A) During the taxable year of such transfer, in one or more fully taxable transactions, the members of the group dispose of all of the shares of the subsidiary stock that they own immediately before the transfer, other than the shares the transfer of which would otherwise trigger the application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, to a person or persons that are not members of the group;
(B) During the taxable year of such transfer, the members of the group are
allowed a worthless stock loss under section 165(g) (taking into account the provisions of § 1.1502-80(c)) with respect to all of the shares of subsidiary stock that they own immediately before the transfer, other than the shares the transfer of which would otherwise trigger the application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section; or
(C) Such transfer is to a member of the group and section 332 (provided the stock is transferred to an 80-percent distributee), section 351, section 354, or section 361 applies to such transfer.
(ii) Paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to a deconsolidation of a subsidiary if—
(A) During the taxable year of such deconsolidation, in one or more fully taxable transactions, the members of the group dispose of all of the shares of the subsidiary stock that they own immediately before the deconsolidation to a person or persons that are not members of the group;
(B) Such deconsolidation results from a fully taxable disposition, to a person or persons that are not members of the group, of some of the shares of the subsidiary, and, during the taxable year of such deconsolidation, the members of the group are allowed a worthless stock loss under section 165(g) with respect to all of the shares of the subsidiary stock that they own immediately after the deconsolidation;
(C) The members of the group are allowed a worthless stock loss under section 165(g) with respect to all of the shares of the subsidiary stock that they own immediately before the deconsolidation;
(D) The deconsolidation of the subsidiary results from the deconsolidation of a higher-tier subsidiary and, immediately after the deconsolidation of the subsidiary, none of the stock of the subsidiary is owned by a group member; or
(E) The deconsolidation of the subsidiary results from a termination of the group.
(4)
Special rule for lower-tier subsidiaries.
If, immediately after a transfer of subsidiary stock or a deconsolidation of a subsidiary, a lower-tier subsidiary some of the stock of which is owned by the subsidiary is a member of the group, then, for purposes of applying this paragraph (b), the subsidiary shall be treated as having transferred its stock of the lower-tier subsidiary. This principle shall apply to stock of subsidiaries that are owned by such lower-tier subsidiary.
(5)
Stock basis adjustments for higher-tier stock.
The basis adjustments required under this paragraph (b) result in basis adjustments to higher-tier member stock. The adjustments are applied in the order of the tiers, from the lowest to highest. For example, if a common parent owns stock of a subsidiary that owns stock of a lower-tier subsidiary and the subsidiary recognizes a loss on the disposition of a portion of its shares of the lower-tier subsidiary stock, the common parent must adjust its basis in its subsidiary stock under the principles of § 1.1502-32 to reflect the adjustments that the subsidiary must make to its basis in its stock of the lower-tier subsidiary.
(6)
Ordering rules.
(i) The rules of this paragraph (b) apply after the rules of § 1.1502-32 are applied.
(ii) The rules of this paragraph (b) apply before the rules of § 1.337(d)-2 and paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section are applied.
(iii) This paragraph (b) (and any resulting basis adjustments to higher-tier member stock made pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section) applies to redetermine the basis of stock of a lower-tier subsidiary before this paragraph (b) applies to a higher-tier member of such lower-tier subsidiary.
(c)
Loss suspension
—(1)
General rule.
Any loss recognized by a member of a consolidated group with respect to the disposition of a share of subsidiary stock shall be suspended to the extent of the duplicated loss with respect to such share of stock if, immediately after the disposition, the subsidiary is a member of the consolidated group of which it was a member immediately prior to the disposition (or any successor group).
(2)
Special rule for lower-tier subsidiaries.
This paragraph (c)(2) applies if neither paragraph (c)(1) nor (f) of this section applies to a member's disposition of a share of stock of a subsidiary (the departing member), a loss is recognized on the disposition of such share, and the departing member owns stock
of one or more other subsidiaries (a remaining member) that is a member of such group immediately after the disposition. In that case, such loss shall be suspended to the extent the duplicated loss with respect to the departing member stock disposed of is attributable to the remaining member or members.
(3)
Treatment of suspended loss
—(i)
General rule.
For purposes of the rules of § 1.1502-32, any loss suspended pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section is treated as a noncapital, nondeductible expense of the member that disposes of subsidiary stock, incurred during the taxable year that includes the date of the disposition of stock to which paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section applies. See § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iii)(C). Consequently, the basis of a higher-tier member's stock of the member that disposes of subsidiary stock is reduced by the suspended loss in the year it is suspended.
(ii)
Location of suspended loss following deconsolidation of selling member.
If a member recognizes a loss that is suspended under this paragraph (c) but that member ceases to be a member of the group before the loss is allowable, the common parent is treated as succeeding to the loss in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies.
(4)
Reduction of suspended loss
—(i)
General rule.
The amount of any loss suspended pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of § 1.1502-35 shall be reduced, but not below zero, by the subsidiary's (and any successor's) items of deduction and loss, and the subsidiary's (and any successor's) allocable share of items of deduction and loss of all lower-tier subsidiaries, that are allocable to the period beginning on the date of the disposition that gave rise to the suspended loss and ending on the day before the first date on which the subsidiary (and any successor) is not a member of the group of which it was a member immediately prior to the disposition (or any successor group), and that are taken into account in determining consolidated taxable income (or loss) of such group for any taxable year that includes any date on or after the date of the disposition and before the first date on which the subsidiary (and any successor) is not a member of such group; provided, however, that such reduction shall not exceed the excess of the amount of such items over the amount of such items that are taken into account in determining the basis adjustments made under § 1.1502-32 to stock of the subsidiary (or any successor) owned by members of the group. The preceding sentence shall not apply to items of deduction and loss to the extent that the group can establish that all or a portion of such items was not reflected in the computation of the duplicated loss with respect to the subsidiary on the date of the disposition of stock that gave rise to the suspended loss.
(ii)
Operating rules
—(A)
Year in which deduction or loss is taken into account.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, a subsidiary's (or any successor's) deductions and losses are treated as taken into account when and to the extent they are absorbed by the subsidiary (or any successor) or any other member. To the extent that the subsidiary's (or any successor's) deduction or loss is absorbed in the year it arises or is carried forward and absorbed in a subsequent year (e.g., under section 172, 465, or 1212), the deduction is treated as taken into account in the year in which it is absorbed. To the extent that a subsidiary's (or any successor's) deduction or loss is carried back and absorbed in a prior year (whether consolidated or separate), the deduction or loss is treated as taken into account in the year in which it arises and not in the year in which it is absorbed.
(B)
Determination of items that are allocable to the post-disposition, pre-deconsolidation period.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the determination of whether a subsidiary's (or any successor's) items of deduction and loss and allocable share of items of deduction and loss of all lower-tier subsidiaries are allocable to the period beginning on the date of the disposition of subsidiary stock that gave rise to the suspended loss and ending on the day before the first date on which the subsidiary (or any successor) is not a member of the consolidated group of which it was a member immediately prior to the disposition (or any successor group) is determined pursuant to the rules of § 1.1502-76(b)(2),
without regard to § 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D), as if the subsidiary ceased to be a member of the group at the end of the day before the disposition and filed separate returns for the period beginning on the date of the disposition and ending on the day before the first date on which it is not a member of such group.
(5)
Allowable loss
—(i)
General rule.
To the extent not reduced under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, any loss suspended pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section shall be allowed, to the extent otherwise allowable under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations, on a return filed by the group of which the subsidiary was a member on the date of the disposition of subsidiary stock that gave rise to the suspended loss (or any successor group) for the taxable year that includes the earlier of—
(A) The day before the first date on which the subsidiary (and any successor) is not a member of such group or the date the group is allowed a worthless stock loss under section 165 (taking into account the provisions of § 1.1502-80(c)) with respect to all of the subsidiary stock owned by members and;
(B) The date that is ten years after the date of the disposition of subsidiary stock that gave rise to the suspended loss.
(ii)
No tiering up of certain adjustments.
No adjustments shall be made to a member's basis of stock of a subsidiary (or any successor) for a suspended loss that is taken into account under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section. See § 1.1502-32(a)(2).
(iii)
Statement of allowed loss.
Paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section applies only if the separate statement required under this paragraph (c)(5)(iii) is filed with, or as part of, the taxpayer's return for the year in which the loss is allowable. The statement must be entitled “ALLOWED LOSS UNDER § 1.1502-35(c)(5)” and must contain the name and employer identification number of the subsidiary the stock of which gave rise to the loss.
(6)
Special rule for dispositions of certain carryover basis assets.
If—
(i) A member of a group recognizes a loss on the disposition of an asset other than stock of a subsidiary;
(ii) Such member's basis in the asset disposed of was determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of stock of a subsidiary and, at the time of the determination of the member's basis in the asset disposed of, there was a duplicated loss with respect to such stock of the subsidiary; and
(iii) Immediately after the disposition, the subsidiary is a member of such group, then such loss shall be suspended pursuant to the principles of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section to the extent of the duplicated loss with respect to such stock at the time of the determination of basis of the asset disposed of. Principles similar to those set forth in paragraphs (c)(3), (c)(4), and (c)(5) of this section shall apply to a loss suspended pursuant to this paragraph (c)(6).
(7)
Coordination with loss deferral, loss disallowance, and other rules
—(i)
In general.
Loss recognized on the disposition of subsidiary stock or another asset is subject to redetermination, deferral, or disallowance under other applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder, including sections 267(f) and 482. Paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(6) of this section do not apply to a loss that is disallowed under any other provision. If loss is deferred under any other provision, paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(6) of this section apply when the loss would otherwise be taken into account under such other provision. However, if an overriding event described in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section occurs before the deferred loss is taken into account, paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(6) of this section apply to the loss immediately before the event occurs, even though the loss may not be taken into account until a later time.
(ii)
Overriding events.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section, the following are overriding events—
(A) The stock ceases to be owned by a member of the consolidated group;
(B) The stock is canceled or redeemed (regardless of whether it is retired or held as treasury stock); or
(C) The stock is treated as disposed of under § 1.1502-19(c)(1)(ii)(B) or (c)(1)(iii).
(8)
No elimination of economic loss.
This paragraph (c) shall not be applied in a manner that permanently disallows a deduction for an economic loss, provided that such deduction is otherwise allowable. If the application of any provision of this paragraph (c) results in such a disallowance, proper adjustment may be made to prevent such a disallowance. Whether a provision of this paragraph (c) has resulted in such a disallowance is determined on the date on which the subsidiary (or any successor) the disposition of the stock of which gave rise to a suspended stock loss is not a member of the group or the date the group is allowed a worthless stock loss under section 165(g) (taking into account the provisions of § 1.1502-80(c)) with respect to all of such subsidiary stock owned by members. Proper adjustment in such cases shall be made by restoring the suspended stock loss immediately before the subsidiary ceases to be a member of the group or the group is allowed a worthless stock loss under section 165(g) (taking into account the provisions of § 1.1502-80(c)) with respect to all of such subsidiary stock owned by members, to the extent that its reduction pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section had the result of permanently disallowing a deduction for an economic loss.
(9)
Ordering rule.
The rules of this paragraph (c) apply after the rules of paragraph (b) of this section and § 1.337(d)-2 are applied.
(d)
Definitions
—(1)
Disposition
means any event in which gain or loss is recognized, in whole or in part.
(2)
Deconsolidation
means any event that causes a subsidiary to no longer be a member of the consolidated group.
(3)
Value
means fair market value.
(4)
Duplicated loss
—(i)
In general.
Duplicated loss is determined immediately after a disposition and equals the excess, if any, of—
(A) The sum of—
(
1
) The aggregate adjusted basis of the subsidiary's assets other than any stock that subsidiary owns in another subsidiary;
(
2
) Any losses attributable to the subsidiary and carried to the subsidiary's first taxable year following the disposition; and
(
3
) Any deductions of the subsidiary that have been recognized but are deferred under a provision of the Internal Revenue Code (such as deductions deferred under section 469); over
(B) The sum of—
(
1
) The value of the subsidiary's stock; and
(
2
) Any liabilities of the subsidiary that have been taken into account for tax purposes.
(ii)
Special rules.
(A) The amounts determined under paragraph (d)(4)(i) (other than amounts described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(1)) of this section with respect to a subsidiary include its allocable share of corresponding amounts with respect to all lower-tier subsidiaries. If 80 percent or more in value of the stock of a subsidiary is acquired by purchase in a single transaction (or in a series of related transactions during any 12-month period), the value of the subsidiary's stock may not exceed the purchase price of the stock divided by the percentage of the stock (by value) so purchased. For this purpose, stock is acquired by purchase if the transferee is not related to the transferor within the meaning of sections 267(b) and 707(b)(1), using the language “10 percent” instead of “50 percent” each place that it appears, and the transferee's basis in the stock is determined wholly by reference to the consideration paid for such stock.
(B) The amounts determined under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section are not applied more than once to suspend a loss under this section.
(5)
Predecessor and successor.
A predecessor is a transferor of assets to a transferee (the successor) in a transaction—
(i) To which section 381(a) applies;
(ii) In which substantially all of the assets of the transferor are transferred to members in a complete liquidation;
(iii) In which the successor's basis in assets is determined (directly or indirectly, in whole or in part) by reference to the transferor's basis in such assets, but the transferee is a successor only with respect to the assets the basis of which is so determined; or
(iv) Which is an intercompany transaction, but only with respect to assets that are being accounted for by the transferor in a prior intercompany transaction.
(6)
Successor group.
A surviving group is treated as a successor group of a consolidated group (the terminating group) that ceases to exist as a result of—
(i) The acquisition by a member of another consolidated group of either the assets of the common parent of the terminating group in a reorganization described in section 381(a)(2), or the stock of the common parent of the terminating group; or
(ii) The application of the principles of § 1.1502-75(d)(2) or (3).
(7)
Preferred stock, common stock.
Preferred stock and common stock shall have the meanings set forth in § 1.1502-32(d)(2) and (3), respectively.
(8)
Higher-tier.
A subsidiary is higher-tier with respect to a member if or to the extent investment adjustments under § 1.1502-32 with respect to the stock of the latter member would affect investment adjustments with respect to the stock of the former member.
(9)
Lower-tier.
A subsidiary is lower-tier with respect to a member if or to the extent investment basis adjustments under § 1.1502-32 with respect to the stock of the former member would affect investment adjustments with respect to the stock of the latter member.
(e)
Examples.
For purposes of the examples in this section, unless otherwise stated, all groups file consolidated returns on a calendar-year basis, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, all transactions are between unrelated persons, and tax liabilities are disregarded. In addition, all transactions described in section 362(a) are completed before October 22, 2004, and therefore are not subject to section 362(e)(2). The principles of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1. Nondeconsolidating sale of preferred stock of lower-tier subsidiary.
(i)
Facts.
P owns 100 percent of the common stock of each of S1 and S2. S1 and S2 each have only one class of stock outstanding. P's basis in the stock of S1 is $100 and the value of such stock is $130. P's basis in the stock of S2 is $120 and the value of such stock is $90. P, S1, and S2 are all members of the P group. S1 and S2 form S3. In Year 1, in transfers to which section 351 applies, S1 contributes $100 to S3 in exchange for all of the common stock of S3 and S2 contributes an asset with a basis of $50 and a value of $20 to S3 in exchange for all of the preferred stock of S3. S3 becomes a member of the P group. In Year 3, in a transaction that is not part of the plan that includes the contributions to S3, S2 sells the preferred stock of S3 for $20. Immediately after the sale, S3 is a member of the P group.
(ii)
Application of basis redetermination rule.
Because S2's basis in the preferred stock of S3 exceeds its value immediately prior to the sale and S3 is a member of the P group immediately after the sale, all of the P group members' bases in the stock of S3 is redetermined pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Of the group members' total basis of $150 in the S3 stock, $20 is allocated to the preferred stock, the fair market value of the preferred stock on the date of the sale, and $130 is allocated to the common stock. S2's sale of the preferred stock results in the recognition of $0 of gain/loss. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the redetermination of S1's and S2's bases in the stock of S3 results in adjustments to P's basis in the stock of S1 and S2. In particular, P's basis in the stock of S1 is increased by $30 to $130 and its basis in the stock of S2 is decreased by $30 to $90.

# Example 2. Deconsolidating sale of common stock.
(i)
Facts.
In Year 1, in a transfer to which section 351 applies, P contributes Asset A with a basis of $900 and a value of $200 to S in exchange for one share of S common stock (CS1). In Years 2 and 3, in successive but unrelated transfers to which section 351 applies, P transfers $200 to S in exchange for one share of S common stock (CS2), Asset B with a basis of $300 and a value of $200 in exchange for one share of S common stock (CS3), and Asset C with a basis of $1000 and a value of $200 in exchange for one share of S common stock (CS4). In Year 4, S sells Asset A for $200, recognizing $700 of loss that is used to offset income of P recognized during Year 4. As a result of the sale of Asset A, the basis of each of P's four shares of S common stock is reduced by $175. Therefore, the basis of CS1 is $725. The basis of CS2 is $25. The basis of CS3 is $125, and the basis of CS4 is $825. In Year 5 in a transaction that is not part of a plan that includes the Year 1 contribution, P sells CS4 for $200. Immediately after the sale of CS4, S is not a member of the P group.
(ii)
Application of basis redetermination rule.
Because P's basis in each of CS1 and CS4 exceeds its value immediately prior to the deconsolidation of S, P's basis in its shares of S common stock is redetermined pursuant
to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the reallocable basis amount is $350 (the lesser of $1150, the gross loss inherent in the stock of S owned by P immediately before the sale, and $350, the aggregate amount of S's items of deduction and loss that were previously taken into account in the computation of the adjustment to the basis of the stock of S that P did not hold at a loss immediately before the deconsolidation). Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, first, P's basis in CS1 is reduced from $725 to $600 and P's basis in CS4 is reduced from $825 to $600. Then, the reallocable basis amount increases P's basis in CS2 from $25 to $250 and P's basis in CS3 from $125 to $250. P recognizes $400 of loss on the sale of CS4. The loss suspension rule does not apply because S is no longer a member of the P group. Thus, the loss is allowable at that time.

# Example 3. Nondeconsolidating sale of common stock.
(i)
Facts.
In Year 1, P forms S with a contribution of $80 in exchange for 80 shares of the common stock of S, which at that time represents all of the outstanding stock of S. S becomes a member of the P group. In Year 2, P contributes Asset A with a basis of $50 and a value of $20 in exchange for 20 shares of the common stock of S in a transfer to which section 351 applies. In Year 4, in a transaction that is not part of the plan that includes the Year 2 contribution, P sells the 20 shares of the common stock of S that it acquired in Year 2 for $20. Immediately after the Year 4 stock sale, S is a member of the P group. At the time of the Year 4 stock sale, S has $80 and Asset A. In Year 5, S sells Asset A, the basis and value of which have not changed since its contribution to S. On the sale of Asset A for $20, S recognizes a $30 loss. The P group cannot establish that all or a portion of the $30 loss was not reflected in the calculation of the duplicated loss of S on the date of the Year 4 stock sale. The $30 loss is used on the P group return to offset income of P. In Year 6, P sells its remaining S common stock for $80.
(ii)
Application of basis redetermination and loss suspension rules.
Because P's basis in the common stock sold exceeds its value immediately prior to the sale and S is a member of the P group immediately after the sale, P's basis in all of the stock of S is redetermined pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Of P's total basis of $130 in the S common stock, a proportionate amount is allocated to each of the 100 shares of S common stock. Accordingly, $26 is allocated to the common stock of S that is sold and $104 is allocated to the common stock of S that is retained. On P's sale of the 20 shares of the common stock of S for $20, P recognizes a loss of $6. Because the sale of the 20 shares of common stock of S does not result in the deconsolidation of S, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, that loss is suspended to the extent of the duplicated loss with respect to the shares sold. The duplicated loss with respect to the shares sold is $6. Therefore, the entire $6 loss is suspended.
(iii)
Effect of subsequent asset sale on stock basis.
Of the $30 loss recognized on the sale of Asset A, $24 is taken into account in determining the basis adjustments made under § 1.1502-32 to the stock of S owned by P. Accordingly, P's basis in its S stock is reduced by $24 from $104 to $80.
(iv)
Effect of subsequent asset sale on suspended loss.
Because P cannot establish that all or a portion of the loss recognized on the sale of Asset A was not reflected in the calculation of the duplicated loss of S on the date of the Year 4 stock sale and such loss is allocable to the period beginning on the date of the Year 4 disposition of the S stock and ending on the day before the first date on which S is not a member of the P group and is taken into account in determining consolidated taxable income (or loss) of the P group for a taxable year that includes a date on or after the date of the Year 4 disposition and before the first date on which S is not a member of the P group, such asset loss reduces the suspended loss pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section. The amount of such reduction, however, cannot exceed $6, the excess of the amount of such loss, $30, over the amount of such loss that is taken into account in determining the basis adjustment made to the stock of S owned by P, $24. Therefore, the suspended loss is reduced to zero.
(v)
Effect of subsequent stock sale.
P recognizes $0 gain/loss on the Year 6 sale of its remaining S common stock. No amount of suspended loss remains to be allowed under paragraph (c)(5) of this section.

# Example 4. Nondeconsolidating sale of common stock of lower-tier subsidiary.
(i)
Facts.
In Year 1, P forms S1 with a contribution of $200 in exchange for all of the common stock of S1, which represents all of the outstanding stock of S1. In the same year, S1 forms S2 with a contribution of $80 in exchange for 80 shares of the common stock of S2, which at that time represents all of the outstanding stock of S2. S1 and S2 become members of the P group. In the same year, S2 purchases Asset A for $80. In Year 2, S1 contributes Asset B with a basis of $50 and a value of $20 in exchange for 20 shares of the common stock of S2 in a transfer to which section 351 applies. In Year 4, S1 sells the 20 shares of the common stock of S2 that it acquired in Year 2 for $20. Immediately after the Year 4 stock sale, S2 is a member of the P group. At the time of the Year 4 stock sale, the bases and values of Asset A and Asset B are unchanged. In Year 5, S2 sells Asset B for $45, recognizing a $5 loss. The P group cannot establish that all or a portion of the $5 loss was
not reflected in the calculation of the duplicated loss of S2 on the date of the Year 4 stock sale. The $5 loss is used on the P group return to offset income of P. In Year 6, S1 sells its remaining S2 common stock for $100.
(ii)
Application of basis redetermination and loss suspension rules.
Because S1's basis in the S2 common stock sold exceeds its value immediately prior to the sale and S2 is a member of the P group immediately after the sale, S1's basis in all of the stock of S2 is redetermined pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Of S1's total basis of $130 in the S2 common stock, a proportionate amount is allocated to each of the 100 shares of S2 common stock. Accordingly, a total of $26 is allocated to the common stock of S2 that is sold and $104 is allocated to the common stock of S2 that is retained. On S1's sale of the 20 shares of the common stock of S2 for $20, S1 recognizes a loss of $6. Because the sale of the 20 shares of common stock of S2 does not result in the deconsolidation of S2, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, that loss is suspended to the extent of the duplicated loss with respect to the shares sold. The duplicated loss with respect to the shares sold is $6. Therefore, the entire $6 loss is suspended. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section and § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iii)(C), the suspended loss is treated as a noncapital, nondeductible expense incurred by S1 during the tax year that includes the date of the disposition of stock to which paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies. Accordingly, P's basis in its S1 stock is reduced from $200 to $194.
(iii)
Effect of subsequent asset sale on stock basis.
Of the $5 loss recognized on the sale of Asset B, $4 is taken into account in determining the basis adjustments made under § 1.1502-32 to the stock of S2 owned by S1. Accordingly, S1's basis in its S2 stock is reduced by $4 from $104 to $100 and P's basis in its S1 stock is reduced by $4 from $194 to $190.
(iv)
Effect of subsequent asset sale on suspended loss.
Because P cannot establish that all or a portion of the loss recognized on the sale of Asset B was not reflected in the calculation of the duplicated loss of S2 on the date of the Year 4 stock sale and such loss is allocable to the period beginning on the date of the Year 4 disposition of the S2 stock and ending on the day before the first date on which S2 is not a member of the P group and is taken into account in determining consolidated taxable income (or loss) of the P group for a taxable year that includes a date on or after the date of the Year 4 disposition and before the first date on which S2 is not a member of the P group, such asset loss reduces the suspended loss pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section. The amount of such reduction, however, cannot exceed $1, the excess of the amount of such loss, $5, over the amount of such loss that is taken into account in determining the basis adjustment made to the stock of S2 owned by members of the P group, $4. Therefore, the suspended loss is reduced to $5.
(v)
Effect of subsequent stock sale.
In year 6, when S1 sells its remaining S2 stock for $100, it recognizes $0 gain/loss. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the remaining $5 of the suspended loss is allowed on the P group's return for Year 6 when S1 sells its remaining S2 stock.

# Example 5. Deconsolidating sale of subsidiary owning stock of another subsidiary that remains in group.
(i)
Facts.
In Year 1, P forms S1 with a contribution of Asset A with a basis of $50 and a value of $20 in exchange for 100 shares of common stock of S1 in a transfer to which section 351 applies. Also in Year 1, P and S1 form S2. P contributes $80 to S2 in exchange for 80 shares of common stock of S2. S1 contributes Asset A to S2 in exchange for 20 shares of common stock of S2 in a transfer to which section 351 applies. In Year 3, in a transaction that is not part of a plan that includes the Year 1 contributions, P sells its 100 shares of S1 common stock for $20. Immediately after the Year 3 stock sale, S2 is a member of the P group. At the time of the Year 3 stock sale, S1 owns 20 shares of common stock of S2, and S2 has $80 and Asset A. In Year 4, S2 sells Asset A, the basis and value of which have not changed since its contribution to S2. On the sale of Asset A for $20, S2 recognizes a $30 loss. That $30 loss is used on the P group return to offset income of P. In Year 5, P sells its S2 common stock for $80.
(ii)
Application of basis redetermination and loss suspension rules.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, because immediately before P's transfer of S1 stock S1 owns stock of S2 (another subsidiary of the same group) that has a basis that exceeds its value, paragraph (b) of this section applies as if S1 had transferred its stock of S2. Because S2 is a member of the group immediately after the transfer of the S1 stock, the group member's basis in the S2 stock is redetermined pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section immediately prior to the sale of the S1 stock. Of the group members' total basis of $130 in the S2 stock, $26 is allocated to S1's 20 shares of S2 common stock and $104 is allocated to P's 80 shares of S2 common stock. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the redetermination of S1's basis in the stock of S2 results in an adjustment to P's basis in the stock of S1. In particular, P's basis in the stock of S1 is decreased by $24 to $26. On P's sale of its 100 shares of S1 common stock for $20, P recognizes a loss of $6. Because S1 is not a member of the P group immediately after P's sale of the S1 stock, paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply to suspend such loss. However, because P recognizes a loss with respect to the disposition of the S1 stock and S1 owns stock of S2 (which is a member of the P group immediately
after the disposition), paragraph (c)(2) of this section does apply to suspend up to $6 of that loss, an amount equal to the amount by which the duplicated loss with respect to the stock of S1 sold is attributable to S2's adjusted basis in its assets, loss carryforwards, and deferred deductions.
(iii)
Effect of subsequent asset sale on stock basis.
Of the $30 loss recognized on the sale of Asset A, $24 is taken into account in determining the basis adjustments made under § 1.1502-32 to the stock of S2 owned by P. Accordingly, P's basis in its S2 stock is reduced by $24 from $104 to $80.
(iv)
Effect of subsequent asset sale on suspended loss.
Because P cannot establish that all or a portion of the loss recognized on the sale of Asset A was not reflected in the calculation of the duplicated loss of S2 on the date of the Year 3 stock sale and such loss is allocable to the period beginning on the date of the Year 3 deemed disposition of the S2 stock and ending on the day before the first date on which S2 is not a member of the P group and is taken into account in determining consolidated taxable income (or loss) of the P group for a taxable year that includes a date on or after the date of the Year 3 deemed disposition and before the first date on which S2 is not a member of the P group, such asset loss reduces the suspended loss pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section. The amount of such reduction, however, cannot exceed $6, the excess of the amount of such loss, $30, over the amount of such loss that is taken into account in determining the basis adjustment made to the stock of S2 owned by P, $24. Therefore, the suspended loss is reduced to zero.
(v)
Effect of subsequent stock sale.
P recognizes $0 gain/loss on the Year 5 sale of its remaining S2 common stock. No amount of suspended loss remains to be allowed under paragraph (c)(5) of this section.

# Example 6. Loss recognized on asset with basis determined by reference to stock basis of subsidiary.
(i)
Facts.
In Year 1. P forms S with a contribution of $80 in exchange for 80 shares of common stock of S which at that time represents all of the outstanding stock of S. S becomes a member of the P group. In Year 2, P contributes Asset A with a basis of $50 and a value of $20 in exchange for 20 shares of common stock of S in a transfer to which section 351 applies. In Year 4, in a transaction that is not part of a plan that includes the Year 1 and Year 2 contributions, P contributes the 20 shares of S common stock it acquired in Year 2 to PS, a partnership, in exchange for a 20 percent capital and profits interest in a transaction described in section 721. Immediately after the contribution to PS, S is a member of the P group. In Year 5, P sells its interest in PS for $20.
(ii)
Application of basis redetermination rule upon nonrecognition transfer.
Because P's basis in the S common stock contributed to PS exceeds its value immediately prior to the transfer and S is a member of the P group immediately after the transfer, P's basis in all of the S stock is redetermined pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Of P's total basis of $130 in the common stock of S, a proportionate amount is allocated to each share of S common stock. Accordingly, $26 is allocated to the S common stock that is contributed to PS and, under section 722, P's basis in its interest in PS is $26.
(iii)
Application of loss suspension rule on disposition of asset with basis determined by reference to stock basis of subsidiary.
P recognizes a $6 loss on its disposition of its interest in PS. Because P's basis in its interest in PS was determined by reference to the basis of S stock and at the time of the determination of P's basis in its interest in PS such S stock had a duplicated loss of $6, and, immediately after the disposition, S is a member of the P group, such loss is suspended to the extent of such duplicated loss. Principles similar to those of paragraphs (c)(3), (c)(4), and (c)(5) of this section shall apply to such suspended loss.
(f)
Worthlessness not followed by separate return years.
Notwithstanding any other provision in the regulations under section 1502, if a member of a group (the claiming group) treats stock of a subsidiary as worthless under section 165 (taking into account the provisions of § 1.1502-80(c)) and, on the day following the last day of the claiming group's taxable year in which the worthless stock deduction is claimed, the subsidiary (or its successor, determined without regard to paragraphs (d)(5)(iii) and (iv) of this section) is a member of a group that includes any corporation that, during that taxable year, was a member of the claiming group (other than a lower-tier subsidiary of the subsidiary) or is a successor (determined without regard to paragraphs (d)(5)(iii) and (iv) of this section) of such a member, then all losses treated as attributable to the subsidiary under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv) shall be treated as expired as of the beginning of the day following the last day of the claiming group's taxable year in which the worthless stock deduction is claimed. In addition, notwithstanding any other provision in the regulations under section 1502, if a member recognizes a loss with respect to subsidiary stock and on the following day the subsidiary is not a member of the group and does not
have a separate return year, then all losses treated as attributable to the subsidiary under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv) shall be treated as expired as of the beginning of the day following the last day of the group's taxable year in which the stock loss is claimed. For purposes of this paragraph (f), the determination of the losses attributable to the subsidiary shall be made after computing the taxable income of the group for the taxable year in which the group treats the stock of the subsidiary as worthless or the subsidiary liquidates and after computing the taxable income for any taxable year to which such losses may be carried back. The loss treated as expired under this paragraph (f) shall not be treated as a noncapital, nondeductible expense under § 1.1502-32(b)(2)(iii). This paragraph (f) applies to worthlessness determinations and liquidations that occur on or after March 10, 2006. For rules applicable to worthless determinations and liquidations before March 10, 2006, see § 1.1502-35T(f)(1) and (2) as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on January 1, 2006.
(g)
Anti-avoidance rules
—(1)
Transfer of share without a loss in avoidance.
If a share of subsidiary stock has a basis that does not exceed its value and the share is transferred with a view to avoiding application of the rules of paragraph (b) of this section prior to the transfer of a share of subsidiary stock that has a basis that does exceed its value or a deconsolidation of a subsidiary, the rules of paragraph (b) of this section shall apply immediately prior to the transfer of stock that has a basis that does not exceed its value.
(2)
Transfers of loss property in avoidance.
If a member of a consolidated group contributes an asset with a basis that exceeds its value to a partnership in a transaction described in section 721 or a corporation that is not a member of such group in a transfer described in section 351, such partnership or corporation contributes such asset to a subsidiary in a transfer described in section 351, and such contributions are undertaken with a view to avoiding the rules of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, adjustments must be made to carry out the purposes of this section.
(3)
Anti-loss reimportation rule
—(i)
Conditions for application.
This paragraph (g)(3) applies when—
(A) A member of a group (selling group) recognized and was allowed a loss with respect to a share of stock of S, a subsidiary or former subsidiary of the selling group;
(B) That stock loss was duplicated (in whole or in part) in S's attributes (duplicating items) at the earlier of the time that the loss was recognized or that S ceased to be a member; and
(C) Within ten years of the date that S ceased to be a member, there is a reimportation event. For this purpose, a reimportation event is any event after which a duplicating item is a reimported item. A reimported item is any duplicating item that is reflected in the attributes of any member of the selling group, including S, or, if not reflected in the attributes, would be properly taken into account by any member of the selling group (for example as the result of a carryback).
(ii)
Effect of application.
Immediately before the time that a reimported item (or any portion of a reimported item) would be properly taken into account (but for the application of this paragraph (g)(3)), such item (or such portion of the item) is reduced to zero and no deduction or loss is allowed, directly or indirectly, with respect to that item.
(iii)
Operating rules.
For purposes of this paragraph (g)(3)—
(A) The terms
member, subsidiary,
and
group
include their predecessors and successors to the extent necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section; and
(B) The reduction of a reimported item (other than duplicating items that are carried back to a consolidated return year of the selling group) is a noncapital, nondeductible expense within the meaning of § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iii).
(4)
Avoidance of recognition of gain.
(i) If a transaction is structured with a view to, and has the effect of, deferring or avoiding the recognition of gain on a disposition of stock by invoking the application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section to redetermine the basis of stock of a subsidiary, and the stock loss that gives rise to the application
of paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not significant, paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall not apply.
(ii) If a transaction is structured with a view to, and has the effect of, deferring or avoiding the recognition of gain on a disposition of stock by invoking the application of paragraph (b)(2) of this section to redetermine the basis of stock of a subsidiary, and the duplicated loss of the subsidiary that is reflected in stock of the subsidiary owned by members of the group immediately before the deconsolidation is not significant, paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall not apply.
(5)
Examples.
For purposes of the examples in this section, all transactions described in section 362(a) are completed before October 22, 2004, and therefore are not subject to section 362(e)(2). The principles of this paragraph (g) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1. Transfers of property in the avoidance of basis redetermination rule.
(i)
Facts.
In Year 1, P forms S with a contribution of $100 in exchange for 100 shares of common stock of S which at that time represents all of the outstanding stock of S. S becomes a member of the P group. In Year 2, P contributes 20 shares of common stock of S to PS, a partnership, in exchange for a 20 percent capital and profits interest in a transaction described in section 721. In Year 3, P contributes Asset A with a basis of $50 and a value of $20 to PS in exchange for an additional capital and profits interest in PS in a transaction described in section 721. Also in Year 3, PS contributes Asset A to S and P contributes an additional $80 to S in transfers to which section 351 applies. In Year 4, S sells Asset A for $20, recognizing a loss of $30. The P group uses that loss to offset income of P. In Year 5, P sells its entire interest in PS for $40.
(ii)
Analysis.
Pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section, if P's contributions of S stock and Asset A to PS were undertaken with a view to avoiding the application of the basis redetermination or the loss suspension rule, adjustments must be made such that the group does not obtain more than one tax benefit from the $30 loss inherent in Asset A.

# Example 2. Transfers effecting a reimportation of loss.
(i)
Facts.
In Year 1, P forms S with a contribution of Asset A with a value of $100 and a basis of $120, Asset B with a value of $50 and a basis of $70, and Asset C with a value of $90 and a basis of $100 in exchange for all of the common stock of S and S becomes a member of the P group. In Year 2, in a transaction that is not part of a plan that includes the contribution, P sells the stock of S for $240, recognizing a loss of $50. At such time, the bases and values of Assets A, B, and C have not changed since their contribution to S. In Year 3, S sells Asset A, recognizing a $20 loss. In Year 3, S merges into M in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(A). In Year 8, P purchases all of the stock of M for $300. At that time, M has a $10 net operating loss. In addition, M owns Asset D, which was acquired in an exchange described in section 1031 in connection with the surrender of Asset B. Asset C has a value of $80 and a basis of $100. Asset D has a value of $60 and a basis of $70. In Year 9, P has operating income of $100 and M recognizes $20 of loss on the sale of Asset C. In Year 10, P has operating income of $50 and M recognizes $50 of loss on the sale of Asset D.
(ii)
Analysis.
P's $50 loss on the sale of S stock is entirely attributable to duplicated loss. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (g)(3) of this section, assuming the P group cannot establish otherwise, M's $10 net operating loss is treated as attributable to assets that were owned by S on the date of the disposition and that had bases in excess of value on such date. Without regard to any other limitations on the group's use of M's net operating loss, the P group cannot use M's $10 net operating loss pursuant to paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(D) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (g)(3)(iv) of this section and § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iii)(D), such loss is treated as a noncapital, nondeductible expense of M incurred during the taxable year that it would otherwise be absorbed, namely in Year 9. In addition, the P group is denied the use of $10 of the loss recognized on the sale of Asset C. Finally, the P group is denied the use of $10 of the loss recognized on the sale of Asset D. Pursuant to paragraph (g)(3)(iv) of this section and § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iii)(D), each such disallowed loss is treated as a noncapital, nondeductible expense of M incurred during the taxable year that includes the date of the disposition of the asset with respect to which such loss was recognized.

# Example 3. Transfers to avoid recognition of gain.
(i)
Facts.
P owns all of the stock of S1 and S2. The S2 stock has a basis of $400 and a value of $500. S1 owns 50% of the S3 common stock with a basis of $150. S2 owns the remaining 50% of the S3 common stock with a basis of $100 and a value of $200 and one share of S3 preferred stock with a basis of $10 and a value of $9. P intends to sell all of its S2 stock to an unrelated buyer. P, therefore, engages in the following steps to dispose of S2 without recognizing a substantial portion of the built-in gain in S2. First, P causes a recapitalization of S3 in which S2's S3 common stock is exchanged for new S3 preferred shares. P then sells all of its S2 stock. Immediately after the sale of the S2 stock, S3 is a member of the P group.
(ii)
Analysis.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, because S2 owns stock of S3 (another subsidiary of the same group) and, immediately after the sale of the S2 stock, S3 is a member of the group, then for purposes of applying paragraph (b) of this section, S2 is deemed to have transferred its S3 stock. Because S3 is a member of the group immediately after the transfer of the S2 stock and the S3 stock deemed transferred has a basis in excess of value, the group in the S3 stock is redetermined pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section immediately prior to the sale of the S2 stock. Accordingly, P would recognize only $1 of gain on the sale of its S2 stock. However, because the recapitalization of the S3 was structured with a view to, and has the effect of, avoiding the recognition of gain on a disposition of stock by invoking the application of paragraph (b) of this section, paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section applies. Accordingly, paragraph (b) of this section does not apply upon P's disposition of the S2 stock and P recognizes $100 gain on the disposition of the S2 stock.

General anti-avoidance rule.
If a taxpayer acts with a view to avoid the purposes of this section, appropriate adjustments will be made to carry out the purposes of this section.

§ 1.1502-36
Unified loss rule.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Scope.
This section provides rules for adjusting members' bases in stock of a subsidiary (S) and for reducing S's attributes when a member (M) transfers a loss share of S stock. See paragraph (f) of this section for definitions of the terms used in this section, including
transfer
and
value.
(2)
Purpose.
The rules in this section have two principal purposes. The first is to prevent the consolidated return provisions from reducing a group's consolidated taxable income through the creation and recognition of noneconomic loss on S stock. The second is to prevent members (including former members) of the group from collectively obtaining more than one tax benefit from a single economic loss. Additional purposes are set forth in other paragraphs of this section. The rules of this section must be interpreted and applied in a manner that is consistent with and reasonably carries out the purposes of this section.
(3)
Overview
—(i)
General application of section.
This section applies when M transfers a share of S stock and, after taking into account the effects of all applicable rules of law (even if the adjustments required by such provisions are not deemed effective until after the transfer, such as certain adjustments required under sections 108 and 1017 and § 1.1502-28), the share is a loss share. When this section applies, paragraph (b) of this section applies first and may redetermine members' bases in their shares of S stock. If the transferred share is a loss share after any basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section, paragraph (c) of this section applies and may reduce M's basis in the transferred loss share. If the transferred share is a loss share after any basis reduction required by paragraph (c) of this section, paragraph (d) of this section applies and may reduce attributes of S and subsidiaries that are lower-tier to S. Although the determination of whether there is a transfer of a loss share is made as of the transfer, this section applies, and any adjustments it requires are given effect, immediately before the transfer. Paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section provide general operating rules (including rules for transfers of S stock between members), definitions, and an anti-abuse rule, respectively.
(ii)
Stock of multiple subsidiaries transferred in the transaction
—(A)
Initial application of section to transferred shares in lowest tier.
If shares of stock of more than one subsidiary are transferred in a transaction, the application of this section begins at the lowest tier. If no transferred shares of stock of the lowest-tier subsidiary (S2) are loss shares, any gain recognized with respect to the S2 shares immediately tiers up and adjusts members' bases in subsidiary stock under § 1.1502-32. However, if any
of the transferred S2 shares are loss shares, paragraph (b) of this section applies with respect to those shares. If, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, any transferred S2 shares are still loss shares, paragraph (c) of this section applies with respect to those shares. If, after the application of paragraph (c) of this section, any transferred S2 shares are still loss shares and P makes an election under paragraph (d)(6) of this section with respect to those S2 shares, then paragraph (d) of this section applies with respect to those shares, but only to the extent necessary to give effect to the election. After taking into account the effects of any adjustments required by this initial application of this section, recognized gain or loss is computed on all transferred S2 shares. Any adjustments under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the effect of any election under paragraph (d)(6) of this section, any gain or loss recognized on the transferred S2 shares (whether allowed or disallowed), and any other related or resulting adjustments then tier-up and apply to adjust members' bases in subsidiary stock under § 1.1502-32.
(B)
Initial application of section to transferred shares in higher tiers.
After taking into account the effects of any adjustments described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, transferred shares in the next higher tier, and then in each next higher tier successively, other than the transferred loss shares at the highest tier, are treated in the manner described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.
(C)
Application of section to transferred shares in highest tier.
After paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and, to the extent necessary to give effect to any election under paragraph (d)(6) of this section, paragraph (d) of this section, have been applied to or with respect to all lower-tier transferred loss shares, and after all lower-tier adjustments have been taken into account (whether resulting from the application of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, an election under paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the recognition of gain or loss on a transfer, or otherwise), paragraphs (b), then (c), and then (d) of this section apply with respect to the highest-tier shares that are transferred loss shares.
(D)
Final application of section to transferred shares in lower tiers.
After paragraph (d) of this section has been applied with respect to transferred loss shares in the highest tier, it is applied with respect to transferred shares in each next lower tier, successively, to the extent such shares are loss shares after the application of paragraph (d) of this section.
(4)
Other rules of law and coordination with deferral and disallowance provisions.
In general, this section applies and has effect immediately upon the transfer of a loss share even if the loss is deferred, disallowed, or otherwise not taken into account under any other applicable rules of law. However, see paragraph (e)(3) of this section for special rules applicable to shares of S stock transferred in an intercompany transaction. See section § 1.1502-80(a) for the general applicability of other rules of law and a limitation on duplicative adjustments.
(5)
Nomenclature, factual assumptions adopted in this section.
Unless otherwise stated, for purposes of this section, the following nomenclature and assumptions are adopted. P is the common parent of a consolidated group of which S, M, and M1 are members. X is not a member of the P group. If a corporation has preferred stock outstanding, it is stock described in section 1504(a)(4). The examples set forth the only facts, elections, and activities relevant to the example. All transactions are between unrelated persons and are independent of each other. Tax liabilities and their effect, and the application of any other loss disallowance or deferral provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) or regulations, including but not limited to section 267, are disregarded. All persons report on a calendar year basis and use the accrual method of accounting. All parties comply with filing and other requirements of this section and all other provisions of the Code and regulations.
(b)
Basis redetermination to reduce disparity
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Purpose and scope.
The rules of this paragraph (b) reduce the extent to which there is disparity in members' bases in shares of S stock. These rules supplement the operation of the investment adjustment
system; their purpose is to prevent the realization of noneconomic loss and facilitate the elimination of duplicated loss when members hold S shares with disparate bases. The rules of this paragraph (b) only reallocate investment adjustments previously applied to members' bases in shares of S stock, thus they do not alter the aggregate amount of basis in shares of S stock held by members or the aggregate amount of investment adjustments applied to shares of S stock.
(ii)
Special rules for applicability of redetermination rule.
Notwithstanding the general rule in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, members' bases in shares of S stock are not redetermined under this paragraph (b) if—
(A) There is no disparity among members' bases in shares of S common stock and no member owns a share of S preferred stock with respect to which there is unrecognized gain or loss; or
(B) All the shares of S stock held by members are transferred to one or more nonmembers, become worthless under section 165 (taking into account the provisions of § 1.1502-80(c)), or a combination thereof, in one fully taxable transaction. However, in such a case, P may elect to redetermine such bases under this paragraph (b). Such an election is made in the manner provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section. If stock of more than one subsidiary is transferred in the transaction, the election may be made with respect to one or more of such subsidiaries.
(iii)
Investment adjustment.
For purposes of this paragraph (b), the term
investment adjustment
includes adjustments specially allocated under § 1.1502-32(c)(1)(ii)(B) and remaining adjustments described in § 1.1502-32(c)(1)(iii). In applying any provision of this section, the term includes all such adjustments reflected in the basis of the share as of the application of the provision, whether originally allocated under § 1.1502-32 or otherwise. The term therefore includes adjustments previously reallocated to the share, and it does not include adjustments previously reallocated from the share, whether pursuant to this section or any other provision of law. It also includes the proportionate amount of adjustments reflected in the exchanged basis of a share, such as the basis determined under section 358 in connection with a reorganization or a transaction qualifying under section 355.
(2)
Basis redetermination rule.
If M transfers a loss share of S stock, all members' bases in all their shares of S stock are subject to redetermination under this paragraph (b). The determination of whether a share is a loss share is made as of the transfer, taking into account the effects of all applicable rules of law. The redeterminations are made immediately before applying paragraph (c) of this section and in accordance with the following:
(i)
Decreasing the bases of transferred loss shares
—(A)
Removing positive investment adjustments from transferred loss shares of common stock.
M's basis in each of its transferred loss shares of S common stock is first reduced, but not below value, by removing positive investment adjustments previously applied to the basis of the share. The positive investment adjustments removed from transferred loss shares of S common stock are reallocated under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section after negative investment adjustments are reallocated under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
(B)
Reallocating negative investment adjustments from shares of S common stock.
If a transferred share is still a loss share after applying paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section, M's basis in the share is reduced, but not below value, by reallocating negative investment adjustments to the transferred loss share (whether common or preferred stock) from members' shares of S common stock that are not transferred loss shares. The adjustments reallocated under this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) are reallocated and applied first to M's bases in transferred loss shares of S preferred stock and then to M's bases in transferred loss shares of S common stock. Reallocations under this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) are made in a manner that, to the greatest extent possible, reduces the disparity among members' bases in all transferred loss shares of S preferred stock, and reduces the disparity among members' bases in all shares of S common stock.
(ii)
Increasing the bases of gain preferred and all common shares
—(A)
Preferred stock.
After the application of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the positive investment adjustments removed from transferred loss shares of S common stock under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section are reallocated and applied to increase, but not above value, members' bases in shares of S preferred stock (without regard to whether such shares are transferred in the transaction). Reallocations under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) are made in a manner that, to the greatest extent possible, reduces the disparity among members' bases in all shares of S preferred stock.
(B)
Common stock.
Any positive investment adjustments removed from transferred loss shares of S common stock under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section and not reallocated and applied to S preferred shares are reallocated and applied to increase members' bases in shares of S common stock. Reallocations are made to shares of S common stock without regard to whether a particular share is a loss share or a transferred share, and without regard to the share's value. Reallocations under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) are made in a manner that, to the greatest extent possible, reduces the disparity among members' bases in all shares of S common stock.
(iii)
Operating rules
—(A)
Method.
In general, reallocations should be made first with respect to the earliest available adjustments. However, the overall application of this paragraph (b) to a transaction must be made in a manner that, to the greatest extent possible, reduces basis disparity (as provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(B) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section). The specific reallocation of an investment adjustment under this paragraph (b) may be made using any reasonable method or formula that is consistent with the provisions of this paragraph (b)(2) and furthers the purposes of this section.
(B)
Limits on reallocation
—(
1
)
Restriction to members' outstanding shares.
Investment adjustments can only be reallocated to shares that were held by members at the time the adjustment was originally applied.
(
2
)
Limitation by prior use
—(
i
)
In general.
In order to prevent the reallocation of investment adjustments from either increasing or decreasing members' aggregate bases in subsidiary stock, no investment adjustment (positive or negative) may be reallocated under this paragraph (b)(2) to the extent that it was (or would have been) used prior to the time that it would otherwise be reallocated under this paragraph (b)(2). For this purpose, an investment adjustment was used (or would have been used) to the extent that it was reflected in (or would have been reflected in) the basis of a share of subsidiary stock and the basis of that share has already been taken into account, directly or indirectly, in determining income, gain, deduction, or loss (including by affecting the application of this section to a prior transfer of subsidiary stock) or in determining the basis of any property that is not subject to § 1.1502-32. However, if the prior use was in an intercompany transaction, an investment adjustment may be reallocated to the extent that § 1.1502-13 has prevented the gain or loss on the transaction from being taken into account. (In that case, appropriate adjustments must be made to the intercompany item from the prior intercompany transaction that has not yet been taken into account.) Further, if an investment adjustment was reflected in (or would have been reflected in) the basis of a share that has been taken into account, the limitation on reallocation under this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B)(
2
) does not apply to the extent the basis of that share would not change as a result of the reallocation (for example, because the reallocation is between shares that are both lower-tier to the share with the previously used basis). See § 1.1502-32(c)(1)(ii)(B) regarding special allocations applicable to the tier-up of the reallocated investment adjustment if the reallocation is limited under this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B)(
2
) due to prior use at a higher tier.
(
ii
)
Example.
The application of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B)(
2
) is illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i)
Facts.
P owns all 20 shares of M stock, and 10 shares of S stock. M owns the remaining 10 shares of S stock. In year 1, S
recognizes $200 of income that results in a $10 positive investment adjustment being allocated to each share of S stock. The group does not recognize any other items. The $100 positive adjustment to M's basis in the S stock tiers up, and results in a $5 positive adjustment to each share of M stock. In year 2, P sells one share of M stock and recognizes a gain. In year 3, M sells one loss share of S stock, and this paragraph (b) applies and requires a reallocation of the year 1 positive investment adjustment applied to the basis of the transferred S share.
(ii)
Application of limitation by prior use.
M's basis in the transferred loss share of S stock reflects a $10 positive investment adjustment attributable to S's year 1 income. Under the general rule of this paragraph (b), that $10 would be subject to reallocation to reduce basis disparity. However, that $10 adjustment had originally tiered up to adjust P's basis in its M shares and, as a result, $.50 of that adjustment was reflected in P's basis in each share of M stock. When P sold the share of M stock, the basis of that share (which included the tiered-up $.50) was used in determining the gain on the sale. Thus, $.50 of the $10 investment adjustment originally allocated to the transferred S share that tiered-up to the sold M share was previously used and, as such, cannot be reallocated in a manner that would (if it were the original allocation) affect the basis of the sold M share. Accordingly, no more than $9.50 of the adjustment to M's transferred S share could be reallocated to P's shares of S stock. If so, under the special allocation rule in § 1.1502-32(c)(1)(ii)(B), the tier-up of this $9.50 would only be allocated among P's remaining 19 shares of M stock. Alternatively, all $10 of the investment adjustment could be reallocated to M's other S shares (because the tier-up to P's M shares would have been the same regardless which of M's shares of S stock were adjusted).
(iii)
Application of limitation where adjustment would have been used.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this
Example
except that M does not sell any shares of S stock and, in year 3, P sells a loss share of S stock. As in paragraph (i) of this
Example
, when P sold the share of M stock, the basis of that share was used in determining the gain on the share. When P sells the loss share of S stock, the $10 positive investment adjustment from S's year 1 income cannot be reallocated in a manner that would (if it were the original adjustment) affect the basis of the sold M share. If this $10 positive investment adjustment had originally been allocated to the S shares held by M, $.50 of the $10 investment adjustment would have tiered up to the M share that P sold, would have been reflected in P's basis in that M share, and would have been used in determining P's gain or loss on the sale. Accordingly, up to $9.50 of the $10 investment adjustment applied to the basis of P's transferred S share could be reallocated to M's shares of S stock. If so, under the special allocation rule in § 1.1502-32(c)(1)(ii)(B), the tier-up of this $9.50 would only be allocated among P's remaining 19 shares of M stock. Alternatively, all $10 of the investment adjustment could be reallocated to P's other S shares.
(3)
Examples.
The general application of this paragraph (b) is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1. Transfer of stock received in section 351 exchange.
(i)
Redetermination to prevent noneconomic loss.
(A)
Facts.
For many years, M has owned two assets, Asset 1 and Asset 2. On January 1, year 1, M receives the only four outstanding shares of S common stock (Block 1 shares) in exchange for Asset 1, which has a basis and value of $80. Section 351 applies to the exchange and, therefore, under section 358, M's aggregate basis in the Block 1 shares is $80 ($20 per share). On July 1, year 2, M receives another share of S common stock (Block 2 share) in exchange for Asset 2, which has a basis of $0 and value of $20. Section 351 applies to this exchange and, under section 358, M's basis in the Block 2 share is $0. On October 1, year 3, S sells Asset 2 for $20, recognizing a $20 gain. On December 31, year 3, M sells one of its Block 1 shares to X for $20. After taking into account the effects of all applicable rules of law, M's basis in each Block 1 share is $24 (M's original $20 basis increased under § 1.1502-32 by $4, the share's allocable portion of the $20 gain recognized on the sale of Asset 2). In addition, M's basis in its Block 2 share is $4 (M's original $0 basis increased under § 1.1502-32 by $4 (the share's allocable portion of the $20 gain recognized on the sale of Asset 2)). M's sale of the Block 1 share is a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to this section.
(B)
Basis redetermination under this paragraph (b).
Under this paragraph (b), M's bases in all its shares of S stock are subject to redetermination. First, paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section applies to reduce M's basis in the transferred loss share, but not below value, by removing positive investment adjustments applied to the basis of the share. Accordingly, M's basis in the transferred Block 1 share is reduced by $4 (the amount of the positive investment adjustment applied to the share), from $24 to $20. Even if there were negative investment adjustments applied to adjust the bases of nontransferred common shares, no further reduction to the basis of the share would be required under this paragraph (b) because the basis of the transferred share is then equal to the share's value. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the positive investment adjustment removed from the transferred loss share is reallocated and applied to increase M's bases
in its S common shares in a manner that reduces disparity in M's bases in all the S common shares, to the greatest extent possible. Accordingly, the $4 positive investment adjustment removed from the Block 1 share is reallocated and applied to the basis of the Block 2 share, increasing it from $4 to $8.
(C)
Application of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
Because M's sale of the Block 1 share is not a transfer of a loss share after the application of this paragraph (b), neither paragraph (c) of this section nor paragraph (d) of this section applies to the transfer.
(ii)
Redetermination to eliminate duplicated loss.
(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this
Example 1
, except that, at the time of the second contribution, the value of Asset 1 had declined to $20 and so, instead of contributing Asset 2, M contributed Asset 3 to S in exchange for the Block 2 share. At the time of that exchange, Asset 3 had a basis and value of $5. On October 1, year 3, S sells Asset 1 for $20, recognizing a $60 loss that is absorbed by the group. On December 31, year 3, M sells one of its Block 1 shares to X for $5. After taking into account the effects of all applicable rules of law, M's basis in each Block 1 share is $8 (M's original $20 basis decreased under § 1.1502-32 by $12 (the share's allocable portion of the $60 loss recognized on the sale of Asset 1)). M's basis in its Block 2 share is an excess loss account of $7 (M's original basis of $5 reduced under § 1.1502-32 by $12, the share's allocable portion of the loss recognized on the sale of Asset 1). M's sale of the Block 1 share is a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to this section.
(B)
Basis redetermination under this paragraph (b).
Under this paragraph (b), M's bases in all its shares of S stock are subject to redetermination. There are no positive investment adjustments and so there is no adjustment under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section. However, under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, M's basis in the transferred Block 1 share is reduced, but not below value, by reallocating negative investment adjustments from common shares that are not transferred loss shares. In total, there were $48 of negative investment adjustments applied to common shares that are not transferred loss shares. Accordingly, M's basis in the Block 1 share is reduced by $3, from $8 to its value of $5. Under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the negative investment adjustments applied to the transferred share are reallocated from (and therefore cause an increase in the basis of) S common shares that are not transferred loss shares in a manner that reduces disparity among members' bases in all S common shares to the greatest extent possible. Accordingly, the $3 negative investment adjustment reallocated and applied to the transferred Block 1 share is reallocated entirely from the Block 2 share, increasing the basis in the Block 2 share from an excess loss account of $7 to an excess loss account of $4.
(C)
Application of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
Because M's sale of the Block 1 share is not a transfer of a loss share after the application of this paragraph (b), neither paragraph (c) of this section nor paragraph (d) of this section applies to the transfer.
(iii)
Nonapplicability of redetermination rule to sale of entire interest.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (ii)(A) of this
Example 1
, except that, on December 31, year 3, M sells all its shares of S stock to X for $25. M's sale of the S stock to X is a transfer of all of the shares of S stock held by members to one or more nonmembers in one fully taxable transaction and, therefore, basis is not redetermined under this paragraph (b). Accordingly, the sale of the Block 1 shares remains a transfer of loss shares and, as such, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. However, paragraphs (c)(7) and (d)(3)(i)(A) of this section apply netting principles to prevent adjustments under either paragraph (c) or paragraph (d) of this section, respectively. Alternatively, the group could elect to apply this paragraph (b). In that case, the $12 negative adjustment applied to the Block 2 shares would be reallocated to the Block 1 shares with the result that there would be no loss (or gain) on any of the transferred shares following the application of this paragraph (b). In that case, there would be no further application of this section to the transfer.
(iv)
Transfer of entire interest, partially taxable.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (iii) of this
Example 1
, except that, instead of selling the Block 2 share to X, M contributes the share to a nonmember in a section 351 exchange that is part of the same transaction. Although all the S shares held by members are transferred in the transaction, not all the shares are transferred to one or more nonmembers in one fully taxable transaction. Therefore, paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section does not apply and M must redetermine its bases in its shares of S stock under this paragraph (b). In total, there were $12 of negative investment adjustments applied to common shares that are not transferred loss shares (the Block 2 share, a gain share). Accordingly, M's basis in each of the Block 1 shares is reduced by $3, from $8 to its value of $5. Under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the negative investment adjustments applied to the transferred shares are reallocated from (and therefore cause an increase in the basis of) S shares that are not transferred loss shares in a manner that reduces disparity among members' bases in all S common shares to the greatest extent possible. Accordingly, the $12 negative investment adjustment reallocated and applied to the transferred Block 1 shares is reallocated entirely from the Block 2 share, increasing the basis in the Block 2 share from an excess loss account of $7 to a basis of $5. Because
M's transfer is not a transfer of loss shares after the application of this paragraph (b), neither paragraph (c) of this section nor paragraph (d) of this section applies to the transfer.

# Example 2. Redetermination increases basis of transferred loss share.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, year 1, M owns all 10 outstanding shares of S common stock. Five of the shares have a basis of $20 per share (Block 1 shares) and five of the shares have a basis of $10 per share (Block 2 shares). S's only asset, Asset 1, has a basis of $50. S has no other attributes. On October 1, year 1, S sells Asset 1 for $100, recognizing a $50 gain. On December 31, year 2, M sells one Block 1 share and one Block 2 share to X for $10 per share. After taking into account the effects of all applicable rules of law, M's basis in each Block 1 share is $25 (M's original $20 basis increased under § 1.1502-32 by $5, the share's allocable portion of the $50 gain recognized on the sale of Asset 1), and M's basis in each Block 2 share is $15 (M's original $10 basis increased under § 1.1502-32 by $5, the share's allocable portion of the $50 gain recognized on the sale of Asset 1). M's sale of the Block 1 and Block 2 shares is a transfer of loss shares and therefore subject to this section.
(ii)
Basis redetermination under this paragraph (b).
Under this paragraph (b), M's bases in all its shares of S stock are subject to redetermination. First, paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section applies to reduce M's basis in the transferred Block 1 and Block 2 shares, but not below value, by removing the positive investment adjustments applied to the bases of the transferred loss shares. Accordingly, the basis of the transferred Block 1 share is reduced by $5, from $25 to $20. The basis of the transferred Block 2 share is also reduced by $5, from $15 to $10. (Although the transferred Block 1 share is still a loss share, there is no reduction to its basis under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section because there were no negative investment adjustments applied to the bases of the S common shares that are not transferred loss shares.) Next, paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section applies to reallocate and apply the $10 of positive investment adjustments removed from the transferred loss shares to increase M's bases in its S common shares in a manner that reduces the disparity in its bases in all S common shares to the greatest extent possible. Accordingly, of the $10 of positive investment adjustments to be reallocated, $6 is reallocated and applied to the basis of the transferred Block 2 share (increasing it from $10 to $16) and $4 is reallocated and applied equally to the basis of each of the four retained Block 2 shares (increasing the basis of each from $15 to $16). After giving effect to the reallocations under this paragraph (b), M's basis in each retained Block 1 share is $25, M's basis in the transferred Block 1 share is $20, and M's basis in each Block 2 share is $16.
(iii)
Application of paragraph (c) of this section.
After the application of this paragraph (b), M's sale of the Block 1 and Block 2 shares is still a transfer of loss shares and, accordingly, subject to paragraph (c) of this section. No adjustment is required to the basis of the transferred Block 1 share under paragraph (c) of this section because, after its basis is redetermined under this paragraph (b), the net positive adjustment to the basis of the share is $0. See paragraph (c)(3) of this section. However, under paragraph (c) of this section M's basis in the transferred Block 2 share is reduced by $6 (the lesser of its net positive adjustment, $6, and its disconformity amount, $6), from $16 to $10, its value. See paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(iv)
Application of paragraph (d) of this section.
After the application of paragraph (c) of this section, M's sale of the Block 1 share is still a transfer of a loss share and, accordingly, subject to paragraph (d) of this section. No adjustment is required under paragraph (d) of this section because there is no aggregate inside loss. See paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section. Because M's sale of the Block 2 share is no longer a transfer of a loss share after the application of paragraph (c) of this section, paragraph (d) of this section does not apply to the transfer of the Block 2 share.

# Example 3. Tiered subsidiaries.
(i)
Transfer of all shares of common stock.
(A)
Facts.
P owns the sole outstanding share of S stock with a basis of $100, and the sole outstanding share of M stock with a basis of $300. M has $200 and owns an asset with a basis of $0. S owns one asset, Asset 1, with a basis of $100. At a time when Asset 1 has a value of $200, S issues a second share of common stock to M in exchange for $200. Later S sells Asset 1 for $200, recognizing a $100 gain. After taking into account the effects of all applicable rules of law, P's basis in its S stock is $150 (P's original $100 basis increased under § 1.1502-32 by $50, the share's allocable portion of the $100 gain recognized on the sale of Asset 1), M's basis in its S stock is $250 (M's original $200 basis increased under § 1.1502-32 by $50, the share's allocable portion of the $100 gain recognized on the sale of Asset 1), and P's basis in its M stock is $350 (P's original $300 basis increased under § 1.1502-32 by $50, the tier-up of M's increase in its basis in its S stock). P then sells its M share and its S share to X for $300 and $200, respectively. M and S are not members of the same consolidated group immediately after the sale. Therefore, the M share and both of the S shares are transferred in the transaction. Regarding P's sale of its share of S stock and its share of M stock, see paragraph (f)(10)(i)(A) of this section (ceasing to own a share in a taxable transaction) and paragraph (f)(10)(i)(C) of this section (nonmember
acquires share); regarding M's share of S stock, see paragraph (f)(10)(i)(B) of this section (ceasing to be members of the same group). The application of this section begins with respect to the stock of S, the subsidiary at the lowest tier in which there is a transfer of subsidiary stock. See paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section. Although both P and M transfer their S shares, only M's S share is a loss share. Thus, only M's transfer is a transfer of a loss share of S stock and only M's transfer is subject to this section.
(B)
Application of section to transferred S shares.
Although only M's transfer is subject to this section, all members' bases in their shares of S stock are subject to redetermination under this paragraph (b). First, paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section applies to reduce M's basis in its transferred S share, but not below value, by removing the positive investment adjustment applied to that share. Accordingly, the basis of M's S share is reduced by $50, from $250 to $200 (under § 1.1502-32, that redetermination adjustment tiers up to reduce P's basis in its M stock by $50, from $350 to $300). Because there are no negative adjustments to reallocate under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section then applies to reallocate and apply the $50 positive investment adjustment removed from the transferred loss S share to increase P's basis in its S share in a manner that reduces disparity among members' bases in all S common shares to the greatest extent possible. Accordingly, all $50 of the positive investment adjustment is reallocated and applied to P's basis in its S share (increasing the basis from $150 to $200). Because M's transfer of its S share is not a transfer of a loss share after the application of this paragraph (b), neither paragraph (c) of this section nor paragraph (d) of this section applies to that transfer.
(C)
Application of section to transfers at next higher tier.
After the adjustments to M's share of S stock are given effect, P's transfer of its share of M stock is not a transfer of a loss share and so this section does not apply to that transfer.
(D)
Result of application of section.
After the application of this section, P recognizes no gain or loss on its sale of either the S share or the M share. In addition, the unrecognized (noneconomic) loss in M's basis in its S share is eliminated. The results would be the same if, in addition to the facts in paragraph (i)(A) of this
Example 3
, M transferred its S share to X in a fully taxable transaction and, as permitted under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, P elected to redetermine basis under this paragraph (b).
(ii)
Transfer of less than all lower-tier shares of stock.
(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this
Example 1
, except that M and S are members of the same consolidated group immediately after the sale. Therefore, in this case, M's S share is not transferred and so this section has no application with respect to M's S share. P's transfer of its S share is not a transfer of a loss share and so is also not subject to this section. However, P's sale of its share of M stock is a transfer of a loss share and is subject to this section.
(B)
Basis redetermination under this paragraph (b).
Although P's transfer of its share of M stock is subject to this section, this paragraph (b) does not apply to the transfer because there is only one share of M stock outstanding (and so there can be no disparity among members' bases in common shares and there are no outstanding preferred shares with respect to which there can be unrecognized gain or loss). Accordingly, after the application of this paragraph (b), P's sale of its M share is still a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to paragraph (c) of this section.
(C)
Application of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
Under paragraph (c) of this section, P must reduce its basis in its M share by $50, the lesser of its net positive adjustment ($50, see paragraph (c)(3) of this section) and its disconformity amount ($150, see paragraphs (c)(4), (c)(5), and (c)(6) of this section). As a result, the share is no longer a loss share and the transfer is not subject to paragraph (d) of this section.
(D)
Result of application of section.
After the application of this section, P recognizes a $50 gain on its sale of the S share and no loss on its sale of the M share. Although there is unrecognized loss preserved in M's basis in its S share, if M later transfers the share when it is a loss share, that transfer will be subject to this section.

# Example 4. Application to outstanding common and preferred shares.
(i)
Facts.
P owns all the stock of M and all eight outstanding shares of S common stock. S also has two shares of nonvoting preferred stock outstanding; the preferred shares each have a $100 annual, cumulative preference as to dividends. M owns one of the preferred shares (PS1) and P owns the other (PS2). On January 1, year 1, the bases and values of the outstanding S shares are:

(A) As of January 1, year 1, there are no arrearages on the preferred stock. In year 1, S has a $1100 capital loss and $100 of ordinary income. The group absorbs the loss and the negative remaining adjustment of $1000 is allocable entirely to the common stock, equally to each common share ($125 per share). See § 1.1502-32(c)(1)(iii) and (c)(2).
(B) In year 2, S has $700 of ordinary income and a $100 ordinary loss. Also, on October 1, year 2, S declares and makes a $200 dividend distribution with respect to the preferred stock ($100 per share). Under § 1.1502-32(c)(1)(i), a negative adjustment of $100 is first allocated to each of the preferred shares to reflect the declaration of the dividend. The $600 positive remaining adjustment determined under § 1.1502-32(c)(1)(iii) (reflecting S's net income reduced by the distribution) is then allocated to each of the preferred shares to the extent of its entitlement to dividends accruing in year 1 and year 2 ($200 per share). See § 1.1502-32(c)(1)(iii) and (c)(3). The $200 of the positive remaining adjustment not allocated to the preferred shares is then allocated to the common stock, equally to each common share ($25 per share). See § 1.1502-32(c)(1)(iii) and (c)(2). After taking into account the effects of all applicable rules of law, the adjusted bases and the values of the shares as of January 1, year 3, are:

(C) On January 1, year 3, M sells PS1 for $1100 and P sells CS2 for $275. The sales of PS1 and CS2 are transfers of loss shares and therefore subject to this section.
(ii)
Basis redetermination under this paragraph (b).
Under this paragraph (b), all members' bases in shares of S stock are subject to redetermination in accordance with the following:
(A)
Removing positive investment adjustments from transferred loss common shares.
First, paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section applies to reduce P's basis in CS2, but not below value, by removing the positive investment adjustment applied to the basis of the share. Accordingly, P's basis in CS2 is reduced by $25, from $610 to $585.
(B)
Reallocating negative investment adjustments from common shares that are not transferred loss shares.
Because the transferred shares remain loss shares after the removal of positive investment adjustments, their bases are further reduced under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, but not below value, by reallocating negative investment adjustments applied to common shares that are not transferred loss shares. Reallocations are made first to preferred shares and then to the common shares, in a manner that reduces disparity among members' bases in transferred loss preferred shares, and reduces disparity among members' bases in all common shares, to the greatest extent possible. The loss on PS1 is $250, the remaining loss on CS2 is $310, and the total amount of negative investment adjustments applied to shares that are not transferred loss shares is $875 (the sum of the negative adjustments applied to all common shares other than CS2). Thus, $250 of negative investment adjustments are reallocated and applied to the basis of PS1, reducing it to the share's value, $1100. The negative investment adjustments are reallocated from the common shares that are not transferred loss shares in a manner that reduces disparity among members' bases in all common shares to the greatest extent possible. The negative investment adjustments may be reallocated to PS1 from the common shares that are not transferred loss shares as follows: $125 from each of CS7 and CS8. Such reallocations increase the basis of CS7 by $125, from $115 to $240, and increase the basis of CS8 by $125, from $0 to $125. Negative investment adjustments are then reallocated to CS2 from the common shares that are not transferred loss shares in a manner that reduces disparity among members' bases in all common shares to the greatest extent possible. The negative investment adjustments may be reallocated to CS2 from the other common shares as follows: $80 from CS4, $105 from CS5, and $125 from CS6. Such reallocations reduce the basis of CS2 by $310, from $585 to $275, increase the basis of CS4 by $80, from $300 to $380, increase the basis of CS5 by $105, from $275 to $380, and increase the basis
of CS6 by $125, from $150 to $275. However, there may be other reasonable reallocations.
(C)
Increasing basis by reallocated positive investment adjustments.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the $25 positive investment adjustment removed from CS2 (the transferred loss common share) is then reallocated and applied to increase the basis of preferred shares, but not above value. Accordingly, $10 of that amount is reallocated to PS2, increasing its basis from $1090 to $1100, its value. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the remaining $15 is reallocated and applied to the common shares in a manner that reduces disparity among members' bases in all common shares to the greatest extent possible. The $15 positive investment adjustment that is reallocated to common shares may be reallocated entirely to CS8, increasing its basis from $125 to $140. However, there may be other reasonable reallocations.

(iii)
Application of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
Because M's sale of PS1 and P's sale of CS2 are not transfers of loss shares after the application of this paragraph (b), paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section do not apply.
(iv)
Higher-tier effects.
The $250 reduction in the basis of PS1 under this paragraph (b) is a noncapital, nondeductible expense under § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iii)(B) that will be included in the year 3 investment adjustment to be applied to P's basis in its M stock.
(c)
Stock basis reduction to prevent noneconomic loss
—(1)
In general.
The rules of this paragraph (c) reduce M's basis in a transferred share of S stock to prevent noneconomic stock loss and thus promote the clear reflection of the group's income. These rules limit the reduction to M's basis in the S share to the amount of net unrealized appreciation reflected in the share's basis as of the transfer (the disconformity amount). These rules also limit the reduction to M's basis in the S share to the portion of the share's basis that is attributable to investment adjustments made pursuant to the consolidated return regulations.
(2)
Basis reduction rule.
This paragraph (c) applies if M transfers a share of S stock and, after taking into account the effects of all applicable rules of law, including any adjustments under paragraph (b) of this section, the share is a loss share. Under this paragraph (c), M's basis in the share is reduced, but not below value, by the lesser of—
(i) The share's net positive adjustment (as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section); and
(ii) The share's disconformity amount (as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section).
(3)
Net positive adjustment.
A share's
net positive adjustment
is the greater of—
(i) Zero; and
(ii) The sum of all investment adjustments reflected in the basis of the share. The term
investment adjustment
has the same meaning as in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, except that it includes all adjustments specially allocated under § 1.1502-32(c)(1)(ii).
(4)
Disconformity amount.
A share's
disconformity amount
is the excess, if any, of—
(i) M's basis in the share; over
(ii) The share's allocable portion of S's net inside attribute amount (as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section).
(5)
Net inside attribute amount.
S's
net inside attribute amount
is determined as of the transfer, taking into account all applicable rules of law (even if the adjustments required by such rules are
not deemed effective until after the transfer, such as certain adjustments required under sections 108 and 1017 and § 1.1502-28). S's net inside attribute amount is the sum of S's net operating and capital loss carryovers, deferred deductions, money, and basis in assets other than money, reduced by the amount of S's liabilities. For this purpose, S's basis in any share of lower-tier subsidiary stock is generally S's basis in that share, adjusted to reflect any gain or loss recognized in the transaction with respect to the share and any other related or resulting adjustments to the basis of the share. However, see paragraph (c)(6) of this section for special rules regarding the computation of S's net inside attribute amount for purposes of this paragraph (c) if S holds stock of a subsidiary that is not transferred in the transaction. See paragraph (f) of this section for definitions of “allocable portion,” “deferred deduction,” “liability,” “loss carryover,” and other relevant terms.
(6)
Determination of S's net inside attribute amount if S owns stock of a lower-tier subsidiary
—(i)
Overview.
If a loss share of S stock is transferred when S holds a share of stock of another subsidiary (S1) and the S1 share is not transferred in the same transaction, S's net inside attribute amount is determined by treating S's basis in its S1 share as tentatively reduced under this paragraph (c)(6). The purpose of this rule is to reduce the extent to which S1's investment adjustments increase noneconomic loss on S stock (as a result of S1's recognition of items that are indirectly reflected in a member's basis in a share of S stock).
(ii)
General rule for nontransferred shares of lower-tier subsidiary stock.
For purposes of determining the disconformity amount of a share of S stock, S's basis in a nontransferred share of S1 stock is treated as reduced by the share's tentative reduction amount. The tentative reduction amount is the lesser of the S1 share's net positive adjustment and the S1 share's disconformity amount.
(iii)
Multiple tiers of nontransferred shares.
If S directly or indirectly owns nontransferred shares of stock of subsidiaries in multiple tiers, then, subject to the limitations in paragraph (c)(6)(iv) of this section (regarding nontransferred shares that are lower-tier to transferred shares), the rules of this paragraph (c)(6) first apply to determine the tentatively reduced basis of stock of the subsidiary at the lowest tier. These rules then apply to determine the tentatively reduced basis of nontransferred shares of stock of subsidiaries successively at each next higher tier that is lower-tier to S. The tentative reductions at each tier are treated as noncapital, nondeductible expenses that tier up under the principles of § 1.1502-32, and, as such, result in a tentative reduction of basis and any net positive adjustment of subsidiary shares that are lower-tier to S.
(iv)
Nonapplicability of tentative basis reduction rule to transferred shares.
The tentative basis reduction rule in this paragraph (c)(6) does not apply to any share of stock of a lower-tier subsidiary (S1) that is transferred in the same transaction in which the S share is transferred. Further, for purposes of determining the S share's disconformity amount, the tentative basis reduction rule in this paragraph (c)(6) only applies with respect to stock of a lower-tier subsidiary if such stock is lower-tier to a nontransferred S1 share. The purpose of this rule is to prevent tentative adjustments to the bases of lower-tier shares if this paragraph (c) has already applied with respect to the shares, without regard to whether such application resulted in the reduction of the basis of any share.
(v)
Example.
The rules of this paragraph (c)(6) are illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i)
Facts.
M owns the sole outstanding share of S stock, S owns the sole outstanding share of S1 stock, S1 owns all five outstanding shares of S2 stock (the bases of which are equal), and S2 owns the sole outstanding share of S3 stock. The basis of each of the shares reflects its allocable portion of a $5 positive investment adjustment attributable to income recognized by S3. The basis of the S share exceeds its value by $10 and the basis of the S1 share exceeds its value by $5. The basis of each S2 share is $1 less than its value. In one transaction, M sells its S share to X, S1 issues new shares in an amount that prevents S and S1 from being members of the same group, and S1 sells one of its S2 shares to an unrelated individual. S1, S2, and S3 elect to file a consolidated return following the transaction.
(ii)
General applicability of section.
As a result of the transaction, there is a transfer of the S share and the S2 share that was sold (because both shares were sold to nonmembers) and of the S1 share (because S and S1 cease to be members of the same group as a result of the stock issuance). The transfer of the S2 share is not a transfer of a loss share, and so this section does not apply to that transfer. The transfers of the S and S1 shares are transfers of loss shares, and so this section applies to those transfers. The S3 share and the four retained S2 shares are not transferred in the transaction. Under paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, this section applies first to the transfer of the S1 share because it is the lowest-tier transferred loss share.
(iii)
Application of paragraph (b) of this section and this paragraph (c) to transfer of S1 stock.
First, the $1 gain recognized on the transfer of the S2 share tiers up to adjust the basis of each upper-tier share. The transferred S1 share is still a loss share (by $4) and is therefore subject to this section. Although the transfer is subject to paragraph (b) of this section, there is no basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section because there is only one share of S1 stock outstanding (and so there can be no disparity among members' bases in common shares and there are no outstanding preferred shares with respect to which there can be unrecognized gain or loss). See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. Therefore, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, the S1 share is still a loss share and, as such, subject to this paragraph (c). In determining the amount of any basis reduction under this paragraph (c), the disconformity amount of the S1 share is computed by comparing S's basis in its S1 share to S1's net inside attribute amount (because there is only one S1 share outstanding, the entire amount is allocable to that share). In determining S1's net inside attribute amount, the tentative reduction rule in this paragraph (c)(6) applies to nontransferred lower-tier shares (provided they are lower-tier to nontransferred shares). Thus, the rule applies to S1's four retained shares of S2 stock and to S2's share of S3 stock. The tentative reduction begins at the lowest level (S2's share of S3 stock) and any tentative reduction amount tiers up as a noncapital, nondeductible expense under the principles of § 1.1502-32, tentatively reducing the bases of any upper tier nontransferred shares that are lower-tier to the transferred loss share (the S1 share). Accordingly, each of S1's nontransferred share of S2 stock is tentatively reduced by its portion of the tentative reduction to S2's share of S3 stock. S1 then applies the tentative reduction rule to its four nontransferred S2 shares. S1's net inside attribute amount is the sum of its basis in each of its nontransferred S2 shares, as tentatively reduced under this paragraph (c)(6) and S1's actual basis in the transferred S2 share, increased to reflect the gain recognized on the sale of that share. After the application of this paragraph (c) to the transfer of the S1 share, paragraph (b) of this section applies to M's transfer of the S share.
(iv)
Application of section to transfer of S stock.
Because the S share is still a loss share after applying paragraph (b) of this section and this paragraph (c) to the transfer of the S1 stock, this section applies to M's transfer of the S share. Although paragraph (b) of this section applies to the transfer, there is no basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section because there is only one share of S stock outstanding (and so there can be no disparity among members' bases in common shares and there are no outstanding preferred shares with respect to which there can be unrecognized gain or loss). See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. Therefore, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, the share is still a loss share and, as such, subject to this paragraph (c). In determining the disconformity amount of the S share, S's net inside attribute amount is determined using S's actual basis in the transferred S1 stock (after any reduction under this paragraph (c)), because the tentative reduction rule in this paragraph (c)(6) does not apply to shares that are transferred in the transaction. All other shares are lower-tier to the transferred S1 share and are therefore also not subject to tentative reduction for purposes of determining the disconformity amount of the S share. After the application of this paragraph (c) to the transfer of the S share, paragraph (d) of this section applies with respect to M's transfer of the S share. After the application of paragraph (d) of this section with respect to the transfer of the S share, if the S1 share is still a loss share, paragraph (d) of this section applies with respect to S's transfer of the S1 share.

Netting of gains and losses taken into account
—(i)
General rule.
Solely for purposes of computing the basis reduction required under this paragraph (c), the basis of each transferred loss share of S stock is treated as reduced proportionately (as to loss) by the amount of income or gain taken into account by members with respect to transferred shares of S stock, provided that—
(A) The shares are transferred in one transaction; and
(B) The gain is taken into account as of the transaction.
(ii)
Example.
The netting rule of this paragraph (c)(7) is illustrated by the following example:

# Example. Disposition of gain and loss shares.
(i)
Facts.
M owns the only three outstanding shares of S stock. Share A has a basis of $54, Share B has a basis of $100, and Share C has a basis of $80. In the same transaction, M sells all three S shares to X for $60 each. M realizes a gain of $6 on Share A, a loss of $40 on Share B, and a loss of $20 on Share C. M's sales of Share B and Share C are transfers of loss shares and therefore subject to this section. M's sale is a transfer of all of the shares of S stock held by members to one or more nonmembers in one fully taxable transaction and, therefore, basis is not redetermined under paragraph (b) of this section. See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. The transfer is then subject to this paragraph (c). However, for this purpose, M treats its bases in Share B and Share C as reduced by the $6 gain taken into account on Share A. The gain is allocated to Share B and Share C proportionately based on the amount of loss in each share. Thus, $4 of gain ($40/$60 × $6) is treated as allocated to Share B and $2 of gain ($20/$60 × $6) is treated as allocated to Share C. Accordingly, M computes the basis reduction required under this paragraph (c) by treating its basis in Share B as $96 ($100 less $4) and its basis in Share C as $78 ($80 less $2). If, after the application of this paragraph (c), the sales of Share B and Share C are still transfers of loss shares, then the transfers are subject to paragraph (d) of this section. (Although the bases of Share B and Share C are not actually reduced by any portion of the gain, paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A) of this section applies netting principles to limit adjustments under paragraph (d) of this section.)
(ii)
Disposition of stock with deferred gain.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this
Example,
except that M sells the gain share to another member. Under § 1.1502-13, M's gain recognized on Share A is not taken into account in the taxable year of the transfer and therefore cannot be treated as reducing M's loss recognized on Share B and Share C for purposes of this paragraph (c). The applicability of this section to the transfer of Share A is determined as of the time that the intercompany item (the gain on M's sale to the other member) is taken into account; see paragraph (e)(3) of this section. However, if Share B (instead of Share A) were sold to a member, the entire gain on Share A would be treated as reducing the loss on Share C for purposes of applying this paragraph (c); see paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(8)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (c) is illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1. Appreciation reflected in stock basis at acquisition.
(i)
Appreciation recognized as gain.
(A)
Facts.
On January 1, year 1, M purchases the sole outstanding share of S stock for $100. At that time, S owns two assets, Asset 1 with a basis of $0 and a value of $40, and Asset 2 with a basis and value of $60. In year 1, S sells Asset 1 for $40, recognizing a $40 gain. On December 31, year 1, M sells its S share for $100. After taking into account the effects of all applicable rules of law, M's basis in the S share is $140 (M's original $100 basis increased under § 1.1502-32 by $40, the share's allocable portion of the gain recognized on the sale of Asset 1). M's sale of the S share is a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to this section.
(B)
Application of paragraph (b) of this section.
Although the transfer is subject to this section, there is no basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section because there is only one share of S stock outstanding (and so there can be no disparity among members' bases in common shares and there are no outstanding preferred shares with respect to which there can be unrecognized gain or loss). See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. Therefore, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, the share is still a loss share and, as such, subject to this paragraph (c).
(C)
Basis reduction under this paragraph (c).
Under this paragraph (c), M's basis in the S share, $140, is reduced, but not below value, $100, by the lesser of the share's net positive adjustment and disconformity amount. The share's net positive adjustment is the greater of zero and the sum of all investment adjustments (as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section) applied to the basis of the share. The only investment adjustment applied to the basis of the share is the $40 adjustment attributable to the gain recognized on the sale of Asset 1. Thus, the share's net positive adjustment is $40. The share's disconformity amount is the excess, if any, of its basis, $140, over its allocable portion of S's net inside attribute amount. S's net inside attribute amount is the sum of S's money ($40 from the sale of Asset 1) and S's basis in Asset 2, $60, or $100. The share is the only outstanding S share and so its allocable portion of the $100 net inside attribute amount is the entire $100. Thus, the share's disconformity amount is $40, the excess of $140 over $100. The lesser of the net positive adjustment, $40, and the share's disconformity amount, $40, is $40. Accordingly, immediately before the application of paragraph (d) of this section, M's basis in the share is reduced by $40, from $140 to $100.
(D)
Application of paragraph (d) of this section.
Because M's sale of the S share is not a transfer of a loss share after the application of this paragraph (c), paragraph (d) of this section does not apply to the transfer.
(ii)
Appreciation recognized as income earned in the consumption of built-in gain.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this
Example 1,
except that, instead of selling Asset 1, the value of Asset 1 is consumed in
the production of $40 of income in year 1 (reducing the value of Asset 1 to $0). Because the net positive adjustment includes items of income as well as items of gain, the results are the same as those described in paragraph (i) of this
Example 1.
(iii)
Post-acquisition appreciation eliminates stock loss.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this
Example 1
except that, in addition, the value of Asset 2 increases to $100 before the stock is sold. As a result, M sells the S share for $140. Because M's sale of the S share is not a transfer of a loss share, this section does not apply to the transfer, notwithstanding that P's basis in the S share was increased by the gain recognized on Asset 1.
(iv)
Distributions.
(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this
Example 1
except that, in addition, S declares and makes a $10 dividend distribution before the end of year 1. As a result, the value of the share decreases and M sells the share for $90. After taking into account the effects of all applicable rules of law, M's basis in the S share is $130 (M's original $100 basis increased under § 1.1502-32 by $30, the $10 distribution on the share reduced by the share's allocable portion of the $40 gain recognized on the sale of Asset 1). M's sale of the S share is a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to this section.
(B)
Application of paragraph (b) of this section.
Although the transfer is subject to this section, there is no basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section for the reasons set forth in paragraph (i)(B) of this
Example 1.
Therefore, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, the share is still a loss share and, as such, subject to this paragraph (c).
(C)
Basis reduction under this paragraph (c).
Under this paragraph (c), M's basis in the S share, $130, is reduced, but not below value, $90, by the lesser of the share's net positive adjustment and disconformity amount. The share's net positive adjustment is $40 (the sum of all investment adjustments (as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section) applied to the basis of the share). The share's disconformity amount is the excess of its basis, $130, over its allocable portion of S's net inside attribute amount. S's net inside attribute amount is $90, the sum of S's money ($30, the $40 sale proceeds less the $10 distribution) and S's basis in Asset 2, $60. The share is the only outstanding S share and so its allocable portion of the $90 net inside attribute amount is the entire $90. The lesser of the share's net positive adjustment, $40, and its disconformity amount, $40, is $40. Accordingly, immediately before the application of paragraph (d) of this section, the basis in the share is reduced by $40, from $130 to $90.
(D)
Application of paragraph (d) of this section.
Because M's sale of the S share is not a transfer of a loss share after the application of this paragraph (c), paragraph (d) of this section does not apply to the transfer.

# Example 2. Loss of appreciation reflected in basis.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, year 1, M purchases the sole outstanding share of S stock for $100. At that time, S owns two assets, Asset 1 with a basis of $0 and a value of $40, and Asset 2 with a basis and value of $60. The value of Asset 1 declines to $0 and M sells its S share for $60. After taking into account the effects of all applicable rules of law, M's basis in the S share is $100. M's sale of the S share is a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to this section.
(ii)
Application of paragraph (b) of this section.
Although the transfer is subject to this section, there is no basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section because there is only one share of S stock outstanding (and so there can be no disparity among members' bases in common shares and there are no outstanding preferred shares with respect to which there can be unrecognized gain or loss). See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. Therefore, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, the share is still a loss share and, as such, subject to this paragraph (c).
(iii)
Basis reduction under this paragraph (c).
Under this paragraph (c), M's $100 basis in the S share is reduced, but not below its $60 value by the lesser of the share's net positive adjustment and disconformity amount. There were no investment adjustments applied to M's basis in the share and so the share's net positive adjustment is $0. Thus, although the share's disconformity amount is $40 (the excess of M's $100 basis in the share over the share's $60 allocable portion of S's net inside attribute amount), no basis reduction is required under this paragraph (c).
(iv)
Application of paragraph (d) of this section.
After the application of this paragraph (c), M's sale of the S share is still a transfer of a loss share, and, accordingly, subject to paragraph (d) of this section. No adjustment is required under paragraph (d) of this section because there is no aggregate inside loss. See paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section.

# Example 3. Items accruing after S becomes a member.
(i)
Recognition of loss accruing after S becomes a member.
(A)
Facts.
On January 1, year 1, M purchases the sole outstanding share of S stock for $100. At that time, S owns two assets, Asset 1, with a basis of $0 and a value of $40, and Asset 2, with a basis and value of $60. In year 1, S sells Asset 1 for $40, recognizing a $40 gain. Also in year 1, the value of Asset 2 declines and S sells Asset 2 for $20, recognizing a $40 loss that is absorbed by the group. On December 31, year 1, M sells its S share for $60. After taking into account the effects of all applicable rules of law, M's basis in the S share is $100 (M's original $100 basis, unadjusted under § 1.1502-32 because
the $40 gain recognized on the sale of Asset 1 and the $40 loss on the sale of Asset 2 net, resulting in an adjustment of $0). M's sale of the S share is a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to this section.
(B)
Application of paragraph (b) of this section.
Although the transfer is subject to this section, there is no basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section because there is only one share of S stock outstanding (and so there can be no disparity among members' bases in common shares and there are no outstanding preferred shares with respect to which there can be unrecognized gain or loss). See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. Therefore, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, the share is still a loss share and, as such, subject to this paragraph (c).
(C)
Basis reduction under this paragraph (c).
Under this paragraph (c), M's basis in the S share is reduced, but not below the share's $60 value, by the lesser of the share's net positive adjustment and disconformity amount. The share's net positive adjustment is $0. Thus, although the share has a disconformity amount of $40 (the excess of M's basis in the share, $100, over the share's allocable portion of S's net inside attribute amount, $60), no basis reduction is required under this paragraph (c).
(D)
Application of paragraph (d) of this section.
After the application of this paragraph (c), M's sale of the S share is still a transfer of a loss share, and, accordingly, subject to paragraph (d) of this section. No adjustment is required under paragraph (d) of this section because there is no aggregate inside loss. See paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Recognition of gain accruing after S becomes a member.
(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this
Example 3
, except that M does not sell the S share and S does not sell either asset in year 1. In addition, in year 2, the value of Asset 1 declines to $0, the value of Asset 2 returns to $60, and S creates Asset 3 (with a basis of $0). In year 3, S sells Asset 3 for $40, recognizing a $40 gain. On December 31, year 3, M sells its S share for $100. After taking into account the effects of all applicable rules of law, M's basis in the S share is $140 (M's original $100 basis increased under § 1.1502-32 by $40 (the share's allocable portion of the gain recognized on the sale of Asset 3 in year 3)). M's sale of the S share is a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to this section.
(B)
Application of paragraph (b) of this section.
Although the transfer is subject to this section, there is no basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section for the reasons set forth in paragraph (i)(B) of this
Example 3.
Therefore, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, the share is still a loss share and, as such, subject to this paragraph (c).
(C)
Basis reduction under this paragraph (c).
Under this paragraph (c), M's basis in the S share, $140, is reduced, but not below value, $100, by the lesser of the share's net positive adjustment and disconformity amount. The share's net positive adjustment is $40 (the year 3 investment adjustment). The share's disconformity amount is the excess of its basis, $140, over its allocable portion of S's net inside attribute amount. S's net inside attribute amount is $100, the sum of S's money ($40 from the sale of Asset 3) and its basis in its assets ($60 (the sum of Asset 1's basis of $0 and Asset 2's basis of $60)). S's $100 net inside attribute amount is allocable entirely to the sole outstanding S share. Thus, the share's disconformity amount is the excess of $140 over $100, or $40. The lesser of the share's net positive adjustment, $40, and its disconformity amount, $40, is $40. Accordingly, the basis in the share is reduced by $40, from $140 to $100.
(D)
Application of paragraph (d) of this section.
Because M's sale of the S share is not a transfer of a loss share after the application of this paragraph (c), paragraph (d) of this section does not apply to the transfer.
(iii)
Recognition of income earned after S becomes a member.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (ii)(A) of this
Example 3
, except that instead of creating Asset 3, S earns $40 of income from services provided in year 3. Because the net positive adjustment includes items of income as well as items of gain, the results are the same as those described in paragraph (ii) of this
Example 3.

# Example 4. Computing the disconformity amount.
(i)
Unrecognized loss reflected in stock basis.
(A)
Facts.
M owns the sole outstanding share of S stock with a basis of $100. S owns two assets, Asset 1 with a basis of $20 and a value of $60, and Asset 2 with a basis of $60 and a value of $40. In year 1, S sells Asset 1 for $60, recognizing a $40 gain. On December 31, year 1, M sells the S share for $100. After taking into account the effects of all applicable rules of law, M's basis in the S share is $140 (M's original $100 basis increased under § 1.1502-32 by $40, the share's allocable portion of the gain recognized on the sale of Asset 1). M's sale of the S share is a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to this section.
(B)
Application of paragraph (b) of this section.
Although the transfer is subject to this section, there is no basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section because there is only one share of S stock outstanding (and so there can be no disparity among members' bases in common shares and there are no outstanding preferred shares with respect to which there can be unrecognized gain or loss). See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. Therefore, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, the share is still a loss share and, as such, subject to this paragraph (c).
(C)
Basis reduction under this paragraph (c).
Under this paragraph (c), M's basis in the S share, $140, is reduced, but not below the share's $100 value, by the lesser of the share's net positive adjustment and disconformity amount. The share's net positive adjustment is $40 (the year 1 investment adjustment). The share's disconformity amount is the excess of its basis, $140, over its allocable portion of S's net inside attribute amount. S's net inside attribute amount is $120, the sum of S's money ($60 from the sale of Asset 1) and S's basis in Asset 2, $60. S's net inside attribute amount is allocable entirely to the sole outstanding S share. Thus, the share's disconformity amount is $20, the excess of $140 over $120. The lesser of the share's net positive adjustment, $40, and its disconformity amount, $20, is $20. Accordingly, the basis in the share is reduced by $20, from $140 to $120.
(D)
Application of paragraph (d) of this section.
After the application of this paragraph (c), M's sale of the S share is still a transfer of a loss share, and, accordingly, S's attributes (to the extent of the $20 duplicated loss) are subject to reduction under paragraph (d) of this section.
(ii)
Loss carryover.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this
Example 4
, except that Asset 2 has a basis of $0 (rather than $60) and S has a $60 loss carryover (as defined in paragraph (f)(6) of this section). The analysis is the same as paragraph (i) of this
Example 4.
Furthermore, the analysis of the application of this paragraph (c) would be the same if the $60 loss carryover were subject to a section 382 limitation from a prior ownership change, or if, instead, the $60 loss carryover were subject to the limitation in § 1.1502-21(c) on losses carried from separate return limitation years.
(iii)
Liabilities.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this
Example 4
, except that S borrows $100 before M sells the S share. S's net inside attribute amount remains $120, computed as the sum of S's money ($160, $60 from the sale of Asset 1 plus the $100 borrowed) and S's basis in Asset 2, $60, less its liabilities, $100. Thus, the S share's disconformity amount remains the excess of $140 over $120, or $20. The results are the same as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 4.

# Example 5. Computing the allocable portion of the net inside attribute amount.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, year 1, M owns all five outstanding shares of S stock with a basis of $20 per share. S owns Asset with a basis of $0. In year 1, S sells Asset for $100, recognizing a $100 gain. On December 31, year 1, M sells one of the S shares, Share 1, for $20. After taking into account the effects of all applicable rules of law, M's basis in Share 1 is $40 (M's original $20 basis increased under § 1.1502-32 by $20 (the share's allocable portion of the gain recognized on the sale of Asset)). M's sale of Share 1 is a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to this section.
(ii)
Application of paragraph (b) of this section.
Although the transfer is subject to this section, basis is not redetermined under paragraph (b) of this section because there is no disparity among M's bases in shares of S common stock and there are no shares of S preferred stock outstanding (so there can be no unrecognized gain or loss with respect to preferred shares). See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. After the application of paragraph (b) of this section, M's sale of Share 1 is still a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to this paragraph (c).
(iii)
Basis reduction under this paragraph (c).
Under this paragraph (c), M's $40 basis in Share 1 is reduced, but not below its $20 value by the lesser of the share's net positive adjustment and disconformity amount. Share 1's net positive adjustment is $20 (the year 1 investment adjustment). Share 1's disconformity amount is the excess of its $40 basis over its allocable portion of S's net inside attribute amount. S's net inside attribute amount is equal to the amount of S's money ($100 from the sale of the asset). Share 1's allocable portion of S's $100 net inside attribute amount is $20 (1/5 × $100). Thus, Share 1's disconformity amount is the excess of $40 over $20, or $20. The lesser of the share's $20 net positive adjustment and its $20 disconformity amount is $20. Accordingly, the basis in the share is reduced by $20, from $40 to $20.
(iv)
Application of paragraph (d) of this section.
Because M's sale of Share 1 is not a transfer of a loss share after the application of this paragraph (c), paragraph (d) of this section does not apply to the transfer.

# Example 6. Liabilities.
(i)
In general.
(A)
Facts.
On January 1, year 1, M purchases the sole outstanding share of S stock for $100. At that time, S owns Asset, with a basis of $0 and value of $100, and $100 cash. S also has a $100 liability. In year 1, S declares and makes a $60 dividend distribution to M and recognizes $20 of income. The value of Asset declines to $60 and, on December 31, year 1, M sells the S share for $20. After taking into account the effects of all applicable rules of law, M's basis in the S share is $60 (M's original $100 basis decreased under § 1.1502-32 by $40 (the net of the $60 distribution and the $20 income recognized)). M's sale of the S share is a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to this section.
(B)
Application of paragraph (b) of this section.
Although the transfer is subject to this section, there is no basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section because there is only one share of S stock outstanding (and so there can be no disparity among members' bases in common shares and there are no outstanding preferred shares with respect to which there can be unrecognized gain or loss). See paragraph
(b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. Therefore, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, the share is still a loss share and, as such, subject to this paragraph (c).
(C)
Basis reduction under this paragraph (c).
Under this paragraph (c), M's basis in the S share, $60, is reduced, but not below value, $20, by the lesser of the share's net positive adjustment and disconformity amount. The share's net positive adjustment is $20 (the year 1 investment adjustment, as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section). The share's disconformity amount is the excess of its basis, $60, over its allocable portion of S's net inside attribute amount. S's net inside attribute amount is negative $40, computed as the sum of S's money ($60 ($100 less the $60 distribution plus the $20 income recognized)) and S's basis in Asset, $0, less S's liability, $100. S's net inside attribute amount is allocable entirely to the sole outstanding S share. Thus, the share's disconformity amount is the excess of $60 over negative $40, or $100. The lesser of the share's net positive adjustment, $20, and its disconformity amount, $100, is $20. Accordingly, the basis in the share is reduced by $20, from $60 to $40.
(D)
Application of paragraph (d) of this section.
After the application of this paragraph (c), the S share is still a loss share and, accordingly, S's attributes are subject to reduction under paragraph (d) of this section. No adjustment is required under paragraph (d) of this section, however, because there is no aggregate inside loss. See paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Excluded cancellation of indebtedness income—insufficient attributes available for reduction under sections 108 and 1017, and § 1.1502-28.
(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this
Example 6
, except that M does not sell the S share. Instead, in year 4, Asset is destroyed in a fire and S spends its $60 on deductible expenses that are not absorbed by the group. S's loss becomes part of the consolidated net operating loss (CNOL). In year 5, S becomes insolvent and S's debt is discharged. Because of S's insolvency, S's discharge of indebtedness income is excluded under section 108 and, as a result, S's attributes are subject to reduction under sections 108 and 1017, and § 1.1502-28. S's only attribute is the portion of the CNOL attributable to S, $60, and it is reduced to $0. There are no other consolidated attributes. In year 5, the S stock (which is treated as a capital asset) becomes worthless under section 165, taking into account § 1.1502-80(c). After taking into account the effects of all applicable rules of law, M's basis in the S share is $60 (M's original $100 basis decreased under § 1.1502-32 by the year 1 investment adjustment of $40 (the net of the $60 distribution and the $20 income recognized). The investment adjustment for year 5 is $0 (the net of the $60 tax exempt income from the excluded COD applied to reduce attributes and the $60 noncapital, nondeductible expense from the reduction of S's portion of the CNOL). Under paragraph (f)(10)(i)(D) of this section, a share is transferred on the last day of the taxable year during which it becomes worthless under section 165 if the share is treated as a capital asset, or the date the share becomes worthless if the share is not treated as a capital asset, taking into account § 1.1502-80(c). Accordingly, M transfers the loss share of S stock on December 31, year 5, and the transfer is therefore subject to this section.
(B)
Application of paragraph (b) of this section.
Although the transfer is subject to this section, there is no basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section for the reasons set forth in paragraph (i)(B) of this
Example 6.
Therefore, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, the share is still a loss share and, as such, subject to this paragraph (c).
(C)
Basis reduction under this paragraph (c).
Under this paragraph (c), M's basis in its S share, $60, is reduced, but not below value, $0, by the lesser of the share's net positive adjustment and disconformity amount. The share's net positive adjustment is $20 (the year 1 investment adjustment, as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section). The share's disconformity amount is the excess of its basis, $60, over its allocable portion of S's net inside attribute amount. S's net inside attribute amount is $0. (The effects of the attribute reduction required under sections 108 and 1017 and § 1.1502-28 are taken into account in applying this section; therefore, for purposes of this section, S's portion of the CNOL is treated as eliminated under section 108 and § 1.1502-28.) S's net inside attribute amount is allocable entirely to the sole outstanding S share. Thus, the share's disconformity amount is the excess of $60 over $0, or $60. The lesser of the share's net positive adjustment, $20, and its disconformity amount, $60, is $20. Accordingly, the basis in the share is reduced by $20, from $60 to $40, immediately before the transfer.
(D)
Application of paragraph (d) of this section.
After the application of this paragraph (c), the S share is still a loss share, and, accordingly, S's attributes are subject to reduction under paragraph (d) of this section. No adjustment is required under paragraph (d) of this section, however, because there is no aggregate inside loss. See paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section.
(iii)
Excluded cancellation of indebtedness income—full attribute reduction under sections 108 and 1017, and § 1.1502-28 (using attributes attributable to another member).
(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (ii)(A) of this
Example 6
except that M loses the $60 distributed in year 1 and the group does not absorb the loss. Thus, as of December 31, year 5, the CNOL is $120, attributable $60 to
S and $60 to P. As a result, under § 1.1502-28(a)(4), after the portion of the CNOL attributable to S is reduced to $0, the remaining $40 of excluded COD applies to the portion of the CNOL attributable to P, reducing it from $60 to $20. After taking into account the effects of all applicable rules of law, M's basis in the S share at the end of year 5 is $100 (M's original $100 basis decreased under § 1.1502-32 by $40 at the end of the year 1 and then increased under § 1.1502-32 by $40 at end of the year 5 (the net of the $100 tax exempt income from the excluded COD applied to reduce attributes and the $60 noncapital, nondeductible expense from the reduction of S's portion of the CNOL)). Under paragraph (f)(10)(i)(D) of this section, a share is transferred on the last day of the taxable year during which it becomes worthless under section 165 if the share is treated as a capital asset, or the date the share becomes worthless if the share is not treated as a capital asset, taking into account § 1.1502-80(c). Accordingly, M transfers the loss share of S stock on December 31, year 5, and the transfer is therefore subject to this section.
(B)
Application of paragraph (b) of this section.
Although the transfer is subject to this section, there is no basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section for the reasons set forth in paragraph (i)(B) of this
Example 6.
Therefore, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, the share is still a loss share and, as such, subject to this paragraph (c).
(C)
Basis reduction under this paragraph (c).
Under this paragraph (c), M's basis in the S share, $100, is reduced, but not below value, $0, by the lesser of the share's net positive adjustment and disconformity amount. The share's net positive adjustment is $60 (the sum of the year 1 investment adjustment, as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, $20, and the year 5 investment adjustment, $40). The share's disconformity amount is the excess of its basis, $100, over its allocable portion of S's net inside attribute amount. S's net inside attribute amount is $0 (taking into account the effects of the attribute reduction required under sections 108 and 1017 and § 1.1502-28). S's net inside attribute amount is allocable entirely to the sole outstanding S share. The share's disconformity amount is therefore $100. The lesser of the share's net positive adjustment, $60, and its disconformity amount, $100, is $60. Accordingly, M's basis in the share is reduced by $60, from $100 to $40, immediately before the transfer.
(D)
Application of paragraph (d) of this section.
After the application of this paragraph (c), the S share is still a loss share, and, accordingly, S's attributes are subject to reduction under paragraph (d) of this section. No adjustment is required under paragraph (d) of this section, however, because there is no aggregate inside loss. See paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section.

# Example 7. Lower-tier subsidiary (no transfer of lower-tier stock).
(i)
Facts.
M owns the sole outstanding share of S stock with a basis of $160. S owns two assets, Asset 1 with a basis and value of $100, and the sole outstanding share of S1 stock with a basis of $60. S1 owns one asset, Asset 2, with a basis of $20 and value of $60. In year 1, S1 sells Asset 2 to X for $60, recognizing a $40 gain. On December 31, year 1, M sells its S share to Y, a member of another consolidated group, for $160. After taking into account the effects of all applicable rules of law, M's basis in the S share is $200 (M's original $160 basis increased under § 1.1502-32 by $40 (to reflect the tier-up of the adjustment to S's basis in the S1 stock for the gain recognized on S1's sale of Asset 2)). M's sale of the S share is a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to this section. (S does not transfer the S1 share because S and S1 are members of the same group following the transfer. See paragraph (f)(10) of this section.)
(ii)
Application of paragraph (b) of this section.
Although the transfer is subject to this section, there is no basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section because there is only one share of S stock outstanding (and so there can be no disparity among members' bases in common shares and there are no outstanding preferred shares with respect to which there can be unrecognized gain or loss). See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. Therefore, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, the share is still a loss share and, as such, subject to this paragraph (c).
(iii)
Basis reduction under this paragraph (c).
(A)
In general.
Under this paragraph (c), M's basis in the S share, $200, is reduced, but not below value, $160, by the lesser of the share's net positive adjustment and disconformity amount. The S share's net positive adjustment is $40. The share's disconformity amount is the excess of its basis, $200, over the share's allocable portion of S's net inside attribute amount. S's net inside attribute amount is the sum of S's basis in Asset 1, $100, and S's basis in the S1 share.
(B)
S's basis in the S1 share.
Although S's actual basis in the S1 share is $100 (S's original $60 basis increased under § 1.1502-32 by $40 (the share's allocable portion of the gain recognized on the sale of Asset 2)), for purposes of computing the S share's disconformity amount, S's net inside attribute amount is determined by treating S's basis in the S1 share as tentatively reduced by the lesser of the S1 share's net positive adjustment and the S1 share's disconformity amount. The S1 share's net positive adjustment is $40 (the year 1 investment adjustment). The S1 share's disconformity amount is the excess of its basis, $100, over the share's allocable portion of S1's net inside attribute amount.
S1's net inside attribute amount is equal to the amount of S1's money ($60 from the sale of Asset 2), and is allocable entirely to the sole outstanding S1 share. Thus, the S1 share's disconformity amount is the excess of $100 over $60, or $40. The lesser of the S1 share's net positive adjustment, $40, and its disconformity amount, $40, is $40. Accordingly, for purposes of computing the disconformity amount of the S share, S's net inside attribute amount is determined by treating S's basis in its S1 share as tentatively reduced by $40, from $100 to $60.
(C)
The disconformity amount of M's S share.
S's net inside attribute amount is treated as the sum of its basis in Asset 1, $100, and its tentatively reduced basis in the S1 share, $60, or $160. S's net inside attribute amount is allocable entirely to the sole outstanding S share. Thus, the S share's disconformity amount is the excess of $200 over $160, or $40.
(D)
Amount of reduction.
M's basis in its S share is reduced by the lesser of the S share's net positive adjustment, $40, and disconformity amount, $40, or $40. Accordingly, M's basis in the S share is reduced by $40, from $200 to $160.
(E)
Effect on S's basis in its S1 share.
The tentative reduction under this paragraph (c) has no effect on S's actual basis in the S1 share. Thus, after the application of this paragraph (c), S owns the S1 share with a basis of $100 (S's original $60 basis increased under § 1.1502-32 by $40 (the share's allocable portion of the gain recognized on the sale of Asset 2)).
(iv)
Application of paragraph (d) of this section.
Because M's sale of the S share is not a transfer of a loss share after the application of this paragraph (c), paragraph (d) of this section does not apply to the transfer.
(d)
Attribute reduction to prevent duplication of loss
—(1)
In general.
The rules of this paragraph (d) reduce attributes of S and its lower-tier subsidiaries to the extent they duplicate a net loss on shares of S stock transferred by members in one transaction. This rule furthers single-entity principles by preventing S (or its lower-tier subsidiaries) from using deductions and losses to the extent that the group or its members (including former members) have either used, or preserved for later use, a corresponding loss in S shares.
(2)
Attribute reduction rule
—(i)
General rule.
If a transferred share is a loss share after taking into account the effects of all applicable rules of law, including any adjustments under paragraph (b), (c), or (d)(5)(iii) of this section, S's attributes are reduced by S's attribute reduction amount immediately before the transfer. S's attribute reduction amount is determined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section and applied in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (d)(4), (d)(5), and (d)(6) of this section. In addition, paragraph (d)(7) of this section provides for additional attribute reduction in the case of certain transfers due to worthlessness and certain transfers not followed by a separate return year.
(ii)
Attribute reduction amount less than five percent of value.
This paragraph (d) generally does not apply to a transaction if the aggregate attribute reduction amount in the transaction is less than five percent of the aggregate value of the shares transferred by members in the transaction. However, in such a case, P may elect to apply this paragraph (d) to the transaction. If such an election is made, this paragraph (d) will apply with respect to the entire aggregate attribute reduction amount determined in the transaction. Such an election is made in the manner provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.
(3)
Attribute reduction amount
—(i)
In general.
S's
attribute reduction amount
is the lesser of—
(A) The net stock loss (as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section); and
(B) S's aggregate inside loss (as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section).
(ii)
Net stock loss.
The
net stock loss
is the excess, if any, of—
(A) The aggregate basis of all shares of S stock transferred by members in the transaction; over
(B) The aggregate value of those shares.
(iii)
Aggregate inside loss
—(A)
In general.
S's
aggregate inside loss
is the excess, if any, of—
(
1
) S's net inside attribute amount; over
(
2
) The value of all outstanding shares of S stock.
(B)
Net inside attribute amount.
S's
net inside attribute amount
generally has the same meaning as in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. However, if S holds stock of a lower-tier subsidiary, the provisions of paragraph (d)(5) of this section (and not the provisions of paragraph (c)(6) of this section) modify
the computation of S's net inside attribute amount for purposes of this paragraph (d).
(iv)
Lower-tier subsidiaries.
See paragraph (d)(5) of this section for special rules relating to the application of this paragraph (d) if S owns shares of stock of a subsidiary.
(4)
Application of attribute reduction amount
—(i)
Attributes available for reduction.
S's attributes available for reduction under this paragraph (d) are—
(A)
Category A.
Capital loss carryovers;
(B)
Category B.
Net operating loss carryovers;
(C)
Category C.
Deferred deductions; and
(D)
Category D.
Basis of assets other than assets identified as Class I assets in § 1.338-6(b)(1).
(ii)
Rules of application
—(A)
Category A, Category B, and Category C attributes.
S's attribute reduction amount is first allocated and applied to reduce the attributes in Category A, Category B, and Category C.
(
1
)
Attribute reduction amount less than total attributes in Category A, Category B, and Category C.
If S's attribute reduction amount is less than S's total attributes in Category A, Category B, and Category C, all of S's attribute reduction amount will be applied to reduce such attributes. However, P may specify the allocation of S's attribute reduction amount among such attributes. An election to specify the allocation of S's attribute reduction amount is made in the manner provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section. To the extent that P does not specify an allocation of S's attribute reduction amount, S's attribute reduction amount will be applied to reduce any Category A attributes not reduced as a result of the specific allocation of S's attribute reduction amount, from oldest to newest, until they are eliminated. Then, any remaining attribute reduction amount will be applied to reduce any Category B attributes not reduced as a result of the specific allocation of S's attribute reduction amount, from oldest to newest, until they are eliminated. Finally, any remaining attribute reduction amount will be applied to reduce any Category C attributes not reduced as a result of the specific allocation of S's attribute reduction amount, proportionately.
(
2
)
Attribute reduction amount not less than the total attributes in Category A, Category B, and Category C.
If S's attribute reduction amount equals or exceeds S's total attributes in Category A, Category B, and Category C, all such attributes are eliminated and any remaining attribute reduction amount is allocated and applied as provided in paragraphs (d)(4)(ii)(B) and (d)(4)(ii)(C) of this section.
(B)
Category D attributes.
Any attribute reduction amount not applied to reduce S's Category A, Category B, and Category C attributes is allocated and applied as provided in this paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(B) and, to the extent applicable, paragraph (d)(5) of this section.
(
1
)
Allocation if S holds stock of another subsidiary.
If S holds shares of stock of another subsidiary, the attribute reduction amount not applied to reduce S's Category A, Category B, and Category C attributes is first allocated between S's shares of lower-tier subsidiary stock and S's other Category D assets in the manner provided in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section. S's attribute reduction amount allocated to shares of lower-tier subsidiary stock is applied to reduce S's bases in those shares, becomes an attribute reduction amount of the lower-tier subsidiary, and, subject to certain limitations, reduces the lower-tier subsidiary's attributes. See paragraphs (d)(5)(iii) through (d)(5)(vi) of this section.
(
2
)
Allocation and application of attribute reduction amount not applied to lower-tier subsidiary stock.
Any portion of S's attribute reduction amount not applied to reduce S's Category A, Category B, and Category C attributes and not allocated to lower-tier subsidiary stock is allocated to S's Category D assets other than lower-tier subsidiary stock in the manner provided in this paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(B)(
2
). Such amount is first allocated to S's bases (if any) in its assets identified as Class VII assets in § 1.338-6(b)(2)(vii). If the attribute reduction amount allocated to Class VII assets is less than S's aggregate basis in those assets, it is applied proportionately (by basis) to reduce the bases
of such assets. If the attribute reduction amount allocated to Class VII assets equals or exceeds S's aggregate basis in those assets, it is applied to reduce the bases of such assets to zero. Any remaining attribute reduction amount is then allocated and applied in the same manner to reduce S's bases (if any) in assets identified as Class VI assets in § 1.338-6(b)(2)(vi), and then to reduce S's bases (if any) in its assets identified in § 1.338-6(b)(2) as Class V, Class IV, Class III, and Class II, successively.
(C)
Attribute reduction amount exceeding attributes available for reduction.
If the amount to be allocated and applied to attributes in Category D other than lower-tier subsidiary stock exceeds the amount of attributes in that category, then—
(
1
) To the extent of any liabilities of S that are not taken into account for tax purposes before the transfer, such excess amount is suspended. The suspended amount is applied proportionately to reduce any amounts attributable to S that would be deductible or capitalizable as a result of such liabilities being taken into account by S or any other person. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C)(
1
) and paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, the term
liability
means any liability or obligation the satisfaction of which would be required to be capitalized as an assumed liability by a person that purchased all of S's assets and assumed all of S's liabilities in a single transaction.
(
2
) To the extent such excess amount is greater than any amount suspended under paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section, it is disregarded and has no further effect.
(iii)
Time and effect of attribute reduction.
In general, the reduction of attributes is effective immediately before the transfer of a loss share of S stock. If the reduction to a member's basis in a share of lower-tier subsidiary stock exceeds the basis of that share, to the extent the excess is not restored under paragraph (d)(5)(vi) of this section it is an excess loss account in that share (and such excess loss account is not taken into account under § 1.1502-19 or otherwise as a result of the transaction). The reductions to attributes required under this paragraph (d)(4), including by reason of paragraph (d)(5)(v) of this section (tier down of attribute reduction amounts to lower-tier subsidiaries), are not noncapital, nondeductible expenses described in § 1.1502-32(b)(2)(iii).
(5)
Special rules applicable if S holds stock of another subsidiary.
If S holds shares of stock of any other subsidiary (S1) as of a transfer of loss shares of S stock, the rules of this paragraph (d)(5) apply with respect to each such subsidiary.
(i)
Treatment of lower-tier subsidiary stock for computation of S's attribute reduction amount.
For purposes of determining S's net inside attribute amount and attribute reduction amount under paragraph (d)(3) of this section—
(A)
Single share.
All of S's shares of S1 stock held as of the transfer of S stock (whether or not transferred in, or held by S immediately after, the transaction) are treated as a single share of stock (generally referred to as the S1 stock); and
(B)
Deemed basis.
S's basis in its S1 stock is treated as its
deemed basis
in the stock, which is equal to the greater of—
(
1
) The sum of S's basis in each share of S1 stock (adjusted to reflect any gain or loss recognized on the transfer of any S1 shares in the transaction, whether allowed or disallowed); and
(
2
) The portion of S1's net inside attribute amount allocable to S's shares of S1 stock.
(C)
Multiple tiers.
For purposes of computing deemed basis under paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B) of this section, a subsidiary's basis in stock of a lower-tier subsidiary is the deemed basis in that lower-tier subsidiary stock. Thus, if stock is held in multiple tiers, the computation of deemed basis begins at the lowest tier, so that the computation of deemed basis at each tier takes into account the deemed basis of all lower-tier shares.
(ii)
Allocation of S's attribute reduction amount between lower-tier subsidiary stock and other Category D assets.
The portion of S's attribute reduction amount that is not applied to reduce S's Category A, Category B, and Category C attributes must be allocated between each of S's deemed single
shares of S1 stock and all of S's other Category D assets. For this purpose, S's Category D assets other than lower-tier subsidiary stock are treated as one asset with a basis equal to the aggregate bases of all Category D assets other than lower-tier subsidiary stock (non-stock Category D asset). S's attribute reduction amount is allocated proportionately (by basis) between (among) the non-stock Category D asset and S's deemed single share(s) of subsidiary stock. (See paragraphs (d)(4)(ii)(B)(
2
) and (d)(4)(ii)(C) of this section regarding the portion of S's attribute reduction amount allocated to the Category D assets other than lower-tier subsidiary stock.) For allocation purposes, S's basis in each deemed single share of S1 stock is its deemed basis (determined under paragraphs (d)(5)(i)(B) and (d)(5)(i)(C) of this section), reduced by—
(A) The value of S's transferred shares of S1 stock; and
(B) The nontransferred S1 shares' allocable portion of the excess of S1's non-loss assets over S1's liabilities (including liabilities described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section). For this purpose, S1's non-loss assets are—
(
1
) S1's assets identified as Class I assets in § 1.338-6(b)(1),
(
2
) The value of S1's transferred shares of lower-tier subsidiary stock, and
(
3
) The nontransferred lower-tier subsidiary shares' allocable portions of lower-tier non-loss assets (net of liabilities, including liabilities described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section) of all lower-tier subsidiaries.
(iii)
Application of attribute reduction amount to S's S1 stock.
The portion of S's attribute reduction amount allocated under paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section to each deemed single share of S1 stock (allocated attribute reduction amount) is apportioned among, and applied to reduce S's bases in, individual S1 shares in accordance with the following—
(A) No portion of the allocated attribute reduction amount is apportioned to an individual share of transferred S1 stock if gain or loss is recognized on its transfer (recognition transfer);
(B) The allocated attribute reduction amount is apportioned among all of S's other shares of S1 stock in a manner that, first reduces the loss in and disparity among S's bases in loss shares of S1 preferred stock to the greatest extent possible, and then reduces the disparity among S's bases in the shares of S1 common stock (other than those transferred in a recognition transfer) to the greatest extent possible;
(C) The allocated attribute reduction amount apportioned to an individual S1 share is applied to reduce the basis of that share to, but not below, value if the share is either a preferred share or a common share that is transferred other than in a recognition transfer; and
(D) The allocated attribute reduction amount apportioned to an individual S1 share is applied to reduce the basis of that share without regard to value if the share is a common share that is not transferred in the transaction.
(iv)
Unapplied allocated attribute reduction amount.
Any portion of the allocated attribute reduction amount that is not applied to reduce S's basis in a share of S1 stock has no effect on any other attributes of S, it is not a noncapital, nondeductible expense of S, and it does not cause S to recognize income or gain. However, such amounts continue to be part of the allocated attribute reduction amount for purposes of the tier down rule in paragraph (d)(5)(v) of this section.
(v)
Tier down of attribute reduction amount
—(A)
General rule.
The allocated attribute reduction amount of each deemed single share of S1 stock is an attribute reduction amount of S1 (tier-down attribute reduction amount). Accordingly, the tier-down attribute reduction amount, in combination with any attribute reduction amount computed with respect to the transferred S1 shares (if any) (direct S1 attribute reduction amount), applies to reduce S1's attributes under the provisions of this paragraph (d). The tier-down attribute reduction amount is an attribute reduction amount of S1 that must be allocated to S1's assets, and may become an allocated attribute reduction amount of lower-tier subsidiary stock (and thus a tier-down attribute reduction amount of a lower-
tier subsidiary), even if its application to S1's attributes is limited under paragraph (d)(5)(v)(B) of this section.
(B)
Conforming limitation on reduction of lower-tier subsidiary's attributes.
Notwithstanding the general rule in paragraph (d)(5)(v)(A) of this section, and unless P elects otherwise in the manner provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, the application of S1's tier-down attribute reduction amount to S1's attributes is limited to an amount equal to the excess of the portion of S1's net inside attribute amount that is allocable to all S1 shares held by members as of the transaction (whether or not transferred in the transaction) over the sum of—
(
1
) Any direct S1 attribute reduction amount;
(
2
) The aggregate value of all S1 shares transferred by members in the transaction with respect to which gain or loss was recognized (recognition transfer);
(
3
) The sum of all members' bases (after any reduction under this section, including this paragraph (d)) in any shares of S1 stock transferred by members in the transaction (other than in a recognition transfer), reduced by any direct S1 attribute reduction amount computed with respect to the transfer of such S1 shares; and
(
4
) The sum of all members' bases (after any reduction under this section, including this paragraph (d)) in any nontransferred shares of S1 stock held as of the transaction.
(vi)
Stock basis restoration
—(A)
In general.
After paragraph (d)(5)(v) of this section has applied with respect to all shares of subsidiary stock transferred in the transaction, lower-tier subsidiary stock basis is restored under this paragraph (d)(5)(vi). Under this paragraph (d)(5)(vi), the reductions to members' bases in shares of lower-tier subsidiary stock under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section are reversed to the extent necessary to restore such bases to an amount that conforms the basis of each such share to its allocable portion of the subsidiary's net inside attribute amount, taking into account any reductions under this paragraph (d). Restoration adjustments are first made at the lowest tier and then at each next higher tier successively. Restoration adjustments do not tier up to affect the bases of higher-tier shares. Rather, restoration is computed and applied separately at each tier. For purposes of this rule, when computing a subsidiary's net inside attribute amount—
(
1
) The subsidiary's basis in stock of a lower-tier subsidiary is the actual basis of the stock after application of this paragraph (d); and
(
2
) Any attribute reduction amount allocated to the subsidiary's Category D assets other than lower-tier subsidiary stock that is suspended under paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section is treated as reducing the subsidiary's net inside attribute amount.
(B)
Election not to restore basis.
Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(5)(vi)(A) of this section, P may elect not to restore basis in stock of a lower-tier subsidiary that was reduced under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section. An election not to restore lower-tier subsidiary stock basis is made in the manner provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.
(6)
Elections to reduce the potential for loss duplication
—(i)
In general.
Notwithstanding the general operation of this paragraph (d), P may elect to reduce the potential for loss duplication, and thereby reduce or avoid attribute reduction. To the extent of S's attribute reduction amount tentatively computed without regard to any election under this paragraph (d)(6), P may elect—
(A) To reduce all or any portion (including any portion in excess of a specified amount) of members' bases in transferred loss shares of S stock;
(B) To reattribute all or any portion (including any portion in excess of a specified amount) of S's Category A, Category B, and Category C attributes (including such attributes of lower-tier subsidiaries), to the extent they would otherwise be subject to reduction under this paragraph (d); or
(C) Any combination thereof.
(ii)
Manner and effect of election.
An election to reduce loss duplication under this paragraph (d)(6) is made in the manner provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section. Although such elections are irrevocable, they have no effect—
(A) If there is no attribute reduction amount; or
(B) To the extent S's attribute reduction amount is less than the amount specified in the election.
(iii)
Order of application
—(A)
Stock of one subsidiary transferred in the transaction.
If shares of stock of only one subsidiary are transferred in the transaction, any stock basis reduction and reattribution of attributes (including from lower-tier subsidiaries) is deemed to occur immediately before the application of this paragraph (d). If a transferred share is still a loss share after giving effect to this election, the other provisions of this paragraph (d) then apply with respect to that share.
(B)
Stock of multiple subsidiaries transferred in the transaction.
If shares of stock of more than one subsidiary are transferred in the transaction and elections under this paragraph (d)(6) are made with respect to transfers of stock of subsidiaries in multiple tiers, effect is given to the elections from the lowest tier to the highest tier in the manner provided in this paragraph (d)(6)(iii)(B). The amount of the election for the transfer at the lowest tier is determined by applying this paragraph (d) with respect to the transferred loss shares of this lowest-tier subsidiary immediately after applying paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section to the stock of such subsidiary. The effect of any stock basis reduction or reattribution of losses immediately tiers up under § 1.1502-32 to adjust members' bases in higher-tier shares. Elections and adjustments are then made with respect to transfers at each next higher tier successively.
(iv)
Special rules for reattribution elections
—(A)
In general.
Because the reattribution election is intended to provide the group a means to retain certain S attributes, and not to change the location of attributes where S continues to be a member of the same group as P, the election to reattribute attributes may only be made if S becomes a nonmember (within the meaning of § 1.1502-19(c)(2)) as a result of the transaction and S does not become a member of any group that includes P. The election to reattribute S's attributes can only be made for attributes in Category A, Category B, and Category C. The attributes that would otherwise be reduced under paragraph (d)(4) of this section may be reattributed to P. Accordingly, P may specify the attributes in Category A, Category B, and Category C to be reattributed. Such an election is made in the manner provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section. To the extent that P elects to reattribute attributes but does not specify the attributes to be reattributed, any attributes not specifically reattributed will be reattributed in the default amount, order, and category described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section. P succeeds to reattributed attributes as if such attributes were succeeded to in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. Any owner shift of the subsidiary (including any deemed owner shift resulting from section 382(g)(4)(D) or section 382(l)(3)) in connection with the transaction is not taken into account under section 382 with respect to the reattributed attributes. (See § 1.1502-96(d) for rules relating to section 382 and the reattribution of losses under this paragraph (d)(6).) The reattribution of S's attributes is a noncapital, nondeductible expense described in § 1.1502-32(b)(2)(iii). See § 1.1502-32(c)(1)(ii)(A) regarding special allocations applicable to such noncapital, nondeductible expense. If P elects to reattribute S attributes (including attributes of a lower-tier subsidiary) and reduce S stock basis, the reattribution is given effect before the stock basis reduction.
(B)
Insolvency limitation.
If S, or any higher-tier subsidiary, is insolvent within the meaning of section 108(d)(3) at the time of the transfer, S's losses may be reattributed only to the extent they exceed the sum of the separate insolvencies of any subsidiaries (taking into account only S and its higher-tier subsidiaries) that are insolvent. For purposes of determining insolvency, liabilities owed to higher-tier members are not taken into account, and stock of a subsidiary that is limited and preferred as to dividends and that is not owned by higher-tier members is treated as a liability to the extent of the amount of preferred distributions to which the stock would be entitled if
the subsidiary were liquidated on the date of the transfer.
(C)
Limitation on reattribution from lower-tier subsidiaries.
P's ability to reattribute attributes of lower-tier subsidiaries is limited under this paragraph (d)(6)(iv)(C) in order to prevent circular computations of the attribute reduction amount. Accordingly, attributes that would otherwise be reduced as a result of tier-down attribute reduction under paragraph (d)(5)(v) of this section may only be reattributed to the extent that the reduction in the basis of any lower-tier subsidiary stock resulting from the noncapital, nondeductible expense (as allocated under § 1.1502-32(c)(1)(ii)(A)(
2
)) will not create an excess loss account in any such stock.
(v)
Special rules for stock basis reduction elections
—(A)
In general.
An election to reduce basis in S stock is made with respect to all members' bases in loss shares of S stock that are transferred in the transaction. The reduction is allocated among all such shares in proportion to the amount of loss on each share. This reduction in S stock basis is a noncapital, nondeductible expense described in § 1.1502-32(b)(2)(iii) of the transferring member.
(B)
Adjustment to the attribute reduction amount.
The attribute reduction amount (determined under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section) is treated as reduced by the amount of any elective reduction in the basis of the S stock under this paragraph (d)(6). Accordingly, the election to reduce stock basis under this paragraph (d)(6) is treated as reducing or eliminating the duplication even if the shares of S stock are loss shares after giving effect to the election.
(C)
Deemed stock basis reduction election in the case of certain disallowed stock losses.
If there is a net stock loss in transferred shares after taking into account any actual elections under this paragraph (d)(6), and the stock loss would otherwise be permanently disallowed (for example, under section 311(a)), P will be deemed to have made a stock basis reduction election equal to such net stock loss.
(7)
Additional attribute reduction in the case of certain transfers due to worthlessness and certain transfers not followed by a separate return year
—(i)
In general.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph (d), if a transfer is subject to this paragraph (d)(7) any of S's Category A, Category B, and Category C attributes not otherwise reduced or reattributed under this paragraph (d), and any credit carryover attributable to S, including any consolidated credits that would be apportioned to S under the principles of § 1.1502-79 if S had a separate return year, are eliminated. Attributes other than consolidated tax attributes are eliminated under this paragraph (d)(7)(i) immediately before the transfer subject to this paragraph (d)(7)(i). The elimination of attributes under this paragraph (d)(7)(i) is not a noncapital, nondeductible expense described in § 1.1502-32(b)(2)(iii).
(ii)
Transfers subject to this paragraph (d)(7).
A transfer is subject to this paragraph (d)(7) if—
(A) M transfers a share of S stock solely by reason of a transfer defined in paragraph (f)(10)(i)(D) of this section (worthlessness where the provisions of § 1.1502-80(c) are satisfied), M recognizes a net deduction or loss on the share, and S is a member of the group on the day following the last day of the group's taxable year during which the share becomes worthless under section 165 (taking into account the provisions of § 1.1502-80(c)), or
(B) M recognizes a net deduction or loss on the stock of S in a transaction in which S ceases to be a member and does not become a nonmember within the meaning of § 1.1502-19(c)(2).
(iii)
Example.
The application of this paragraph (d) to transfers due to worthlessness and to loss transfers not followed by separate return years is illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
(i)
Worthlessness where S continues as a member.
M owns the sole share of S stock. The share is worthless under section 165. In addition, S has disposed of all its assets within the meaning of § 1.1502-19(c)(1)(iii)(A) and therefore satisfies the provisions of § 1.1502-80(c). M claims a worthless securities deduction with respect to the share. The worthlessness is a transfer of the S share, a loss share, and therefore subject to this section. After the application of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, M's basis in the share (and therefore M's net stock loss) is $75. The portion of the consolidated net
operating loss attributable to S is $100. Under the general rules of this paragraph (d), S's attribute reduction amount is $75 (the lesser of M's $75 net stock loss and S's $100 aggregate inside loss ($100 net inside attribute amount over $0 value of S share)). S's attributes are reduced by $75, from $100 to $25. In addition, if S remains a member of the P group, this paragraph (d)(7) applies to eliminate the remaining $25 of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to S because the S share is worthless, and M recognizes a deduction (taking into account § 1.1502-80(c)) with respect to the share. Accordingly, after the application of this section, M recognizes a $75 worthless securities deduction, S has $0 net inside attributes, and the consolidated net operating loss is reduced by a total of $100.
(ii)
Dissolution of insolvent subsidiary.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this
Example,
except that S is insolvent, does not dispose of all its assets within the meaning of § 1.1502-19(c)(1)(iii)(A), M causes S to be legally dissolved, and the S share held by M is cancelled without consideration. Under paragraph (d)(7)(ii)(B) of this section, the dissolution of S is subject to this paragraph (d)(7) and the result is the same as in paragraph (i) of this
Example.
The result would also be the same if instead of being legally dissolved, S was converted into an entity that is disregarded as separate from M.
(iii)
Stock cancelled in connection with a section 381(a) transaction with another member.
M owns the sole share of S common stock with a basis of $75. M1 owns the sole share of S preferred stock. The value of S's assets (net of liabilities) is less than the liquidation preference on the S preferred stock. In a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D), S transfers all of its assets to M2 in exchange for M2 common stock and M2's assumption of S's liabilities, S distributes all of the M2 common stock received in the exchange to M1 in exchange for M1's S preferred stock, the S common stock held by M is cancelled without consideration, and S ceases to exist. Notwithstanding that M is not entitled to treat its common share of S stock as worthless until § 1.1502-80(c) is satisfied, M's share is transferred within the meaning of paragraph (f)(10)(i)(A) of this section because M ceases to own the share in a transaction in which, but for this section (and notwithstanding the deferral of any amount recognized on the transfer, other than by reason of § 1.1502-13), M would recognize a loss or deduction with respect to the share. Accordingly, there is a transfer of the S common share and this section applies to the transfer. There are no adjustments under paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section because no investment adjustments have been applied to the bases of the shares. The transfer of the S common stock is subject to the general rules of this paragraph (d), but is not subject to the additional attribute reduction under this paragraph (d)(7) because the transfer was not solely by reason of worthlessness where § 1.1502-80(c) is satisfied, and S did not cease to be a member because M2 is a successor to S.
(iv)
Stock cancelled in connection with a section 381(a) transaction with a nonmember.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (iii) of this
Example,
except that the S preferred share is held by X, instead of M2 acquiring S's assets, S merges into Y in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(A), M1 receives all of the Y stock issued in the merger in exchange for M1's S preferred stock, and Y does not become a member as a result of the transaction. M treats the cancelled S common stock as worthless, and § 1.1502-80(c) is satisfied because S ceases to be a member. In this case, there is a transfer of M's S common share because it becomes worthless (taking into account § 1.1502-80(c)); because M ceases to own the share in a transaction in which, but for this section (and notwithstanding the deferral of any amount recognized on the transfer, other than by reason of § 1.1502-13), M would recognize a loss or deduction with respect to the share; and because M and S cease to be members of the same group. The transfer of the S common stock is subject to the general rules of this paragraph (d), but is not subject to the additional attribute reduction under this paragraph (d)(7) because the transfer was not solely by reason of worthlessness where § 1.1502-80(c) is satisfied and, although S did cease to be a member, S became a nonmember within the meaning of § 1.1502-19(c)(2) because Y is a successor to S.
(8)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (d) is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1. Computation of attribute reduction amount.
(i)
Transfer of all S shares.
(A)
Facts.
M owns all 100 of the outstanding shares of S stock with a basis of $2 per share. S owns land with a basis of $100, has a $120 loss carryover, and has no liabilities. Each share has a value of $1. M sells 30 of the S shares to X for $30. As a result of the sale, M and S cease to be members of the same group. Accordingly, all 100 of the S shares are transferred. See paragraphs (f)(10)(i)(A), (f)(10)(i)(B), and (f)(10)(i)(C) (with respect to the 30 S shares sold to X) of this section. M's transfer of the S shares is a transfer of loss shares and therefore subject to this section.
(B)
Application of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
Although the transfer is subject to this section, there is no basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section because there is no disparity among M's bases in shares of S common stock and there are no shares of S preferred stock outstanding (so there can be no unrecognized
gain or loss on preferred stock). See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. Therefore, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, the share is still a loss share and, as such, subject to paragraph (c) of this section. No adjustment is required under paragraph (c) of this section because the net positive adjustment is $0. See paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Thus, after the application of paragraph (c) of this section, M's transfer of the S shares is still a transfer of loss shares and, accordingly, subject to this paragraph (d).
(C)
Attribute reduction under this paragraph (d).
Under this paragraph (d), S's attributes are reduced by S's attribute reduction amount. Paragraph (d)(3) of this section provides that S's attribute reduction amount is the lesser of the net stock loss and S's aggregate inside loss. The net stock loss is the excess of the $200 aggregate bases of the transferred shares over the $100 aggregate value of the transferred shares, or $100. S's aggregate inside loss is the excess of its $220 net inside attribute amount (the sum of the $100 basis in the land and the $120 loss carryover) over the $100 value of all outstanding S shares, or $120. The attribute reduction amount is therefore the lesser of the $100 net stock loss and the $120 aggregate inside loss, or $100. Under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, S's $100 attribute reduction amount is allocated and applied to reduce S's $120 loss carryover to $20. Under paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section, the reduction of the loss carryover is not a noncapital, nondeductible expense and has no effect on M's basis in the S stock.
(ii)
Transfer of less than all S shares.
(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this
Example 1
, except that M only sells 20 S shares to X. M's sale of the 20 S shares is a transfer of loss shares and therefore subject to this section. See paragraph (f)(10)(i)(A) and (f)(10)(i)(C) of this section. (There is no transfer of the remaining shares because S and M remain members of the same group.)
(B)
Application of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
No adjustment is required under paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) of this section for the reasons set forth in paragraph (i)(B) of this
Example 1.
Thus, after the application of paragraph (c) of this section, M's transfer of the S shares is still a transfer of loss shares and, accordingly, subject to this paragraph (d).
(C)
Attribute reduction under this paragraph (d).
Under this paragraph (d), S's attributes are reduced by S's attribute reduction amount. Paragraph (d)(3) of this section provides that S's attribute reduction amount is the lesser of the net stock loss and S's aggregate inside loss. The net stock loss is $20, the excess of the $40 aggregate bases of the transferred shares over the $20 aggregate value of the transferred shares. S's aggregate inside loss is $120, the excess of its $220 net inside attribute amount (the sum of the $100 basis in the land and the $120 loss carryover) over the $100 value of all outstanding S shares. The attribute reduction amount is therefore $20, the lesser of the $20 net stock loss and the $120 aggregate inside loss. Under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, S's $20 attribute reduction amount is allocated and applied to reduce S's $120 loss carryover to $100.

# Example 2. Proportionate allocation of attribute reduction amount.
(i)
Facts.
M owns the sole outstanding share of S stock with a basis of $150. S owns land with a basis of $60, a factory with a basis of $30, publicly traded property with a basis of $30 and goodwill with a basis of $30. M sells its S share for $90. M's sale of the S share is a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to this section. See paragraphs (f)(10)(i)(A), (f)(10)(i)(B), and (f)(10)(i)(C) of this section.
(ii)
Application of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
Although the transfer is subject to this section, there is no basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section because there is only one share of S stock outstanding (and so there can be no disparity among members' bases in common shares and there are no outstanding preferred shares with respect to which there can be unrecognized gain or loss). See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. Therefore, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, the share is still a loss share and, as such, subject to paragraph (c) of this section. No adjustment is required under paragraph (c) of this section because both the disconformity amount and the net positive adjustment are $0. See paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Thus, after the application of paragraph (c) of this section, M's sale of the S share is still a transfer of a loss share and, accordingly, subject to this paragraph (d).
(iii)
Attribute reduction under this paragraph (d).
Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, S's attribute reduction amount is determined to be $60, the lesser of the $60 net stock loss ($150 basis over $90 value) and S's $60 aggregate inside loss (the excess of S's $150 net inside attribute amount (the $60 basis of the land, plus the $30 basis of the factory, plus the $30 basis of the publicly traded property, plus the $30 basis of the goodwill) over the $90 value of the S share). Under paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section, the $60 attribute reduction amount is allocated and applied to reduce S's bases in its Category D assets, S's only attributes available for reduction, as follows:

(A)
Facts.
P owns the sole outstanding share of M stock with a basis of $1,000 and M owns the sole outstanding share of S stock with a basis of $210. M sells its S share to X for $100. M's sale of the S share is a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to this section. See paragraphs (f)(10)(i)(A), (f)(10)(i)(B), and (f)(10)(i)(C) of this section. At the time of the sale, S has no liabilities and the following attributes:

See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. Therefore, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, the share is still a loss share and, as such, subject to paragraph (c) of this section. No adjustment is required under paragraph (c) of this section because both the disconformity amount and the net positive adjustment are $0. See paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Thus, after the application of paragraph (c) of this section, M's transfer of the S share is still a transfer of a loss share and, accordingly, subject to this paragraph (d).
(C)
Attribute reduction under this paragraph (d).
(

)
Computation of attribute reduction amount.
Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, S's attribute reduction amount is the lesser of the $110 net stock loss ($210 basis over $100 value) and S's aggregate inside loss. S's aggregate inside loss is $200 (S's $300 net inside attribute amount (the $10 capital loss carryover, plus the $200 NOL carryover, plus the $40 deferred deductions, plus the $50 basis in land) less the $100 value of all outstanding S shares). Thus, the attribute reduction amount is $110, the lesser of the $110 net stock loss and S's $200 aggregate inside loss. Under paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A)(

# Example 4. Attributes attributable to liability not taken into account.
(i)
S operates one business.
(A)
Facts.
On January 1, year 1, M forms S by exchanging $150 for the sole outstanding share of S stock. In year 1, S earns $500, purchases land for $50, spends $100 to build a factory on that land, and then purchases publicly traded property for $250. In year 2, S earns a section 38 general business credit of $50. However, pollution generated by S's business gives rise to an environmental remediation liability under Federal law that would be required to be capitalized if a person purchased S's assets and assumed the liability. Before any amounts have been taken into account with respect to the environmental remediation liability, when the liability has a present value of $500, M sells its S share to X for $150. After giving effect to all other provisions of law, M's basis in the S share is $650 (the original basis of $150 increased under § 1.1502-32 by $500 for the income earned). The sale is therefore a transfer of a loss share of subsidiary stock and subject to this section. See paragraphs (f)(10)(i)(A), (f)(10)(i)(B), and (f)(10)(i)(C) of this section.
(B)
Application of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
Although the transfer is subject to this section, there is no basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section because there is only one share of S stock outstanding (and so there can be no disparity among members' bases in common shares and there are no outstanding preferred shares with respect to which there can be unrecognized gain or loss). See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. Therefore, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, the share is still a loss share and, as such, subject to paragraph (c) of this section. No adjustment to basis is made under paragraph (c) of this section because, although the net positive adjustment is $500, the disconformity amount is $0. See paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Thus, after the application of paragraph (c) of this section, M's sale of the S share is still a transfer of a loss share and, accordingly, subject to this paragraph (d).
(C)
Attribute reduction under this paragraph (d).
(
1
) Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, S's attribute reduction amount is the lesser of the $500 net stock loss ($650 basis over $150 value) and the aggregate inside loss. The aggregate inside loss is $500, computed as the excess of S's $650 net inside attribute amount (the sum of S's $100 basis in the factory, $50 basis in the land, $250 basis in the publicly traded property, and $250 cash remaining after the purchases) over the $150 value of the S share. Thus, S's attribute reduction amount is $500, the lesser of the $500 net stock loss and the $500 aggregate inside loss. Under paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section, S's $500 attribute reduction amount is allocated and applied to reduce S's attributes as follows:
Available attributes

(

) The remaining $100 attribute reduction amount is not applied to S's $250 cash (Class I asset) or to S's $50 general business tax credit. Under the general rule of this paragraph (d), that remaining $100 attribute reduction amount would have no further effect on S's attributes. However, S has a $500 liability that has not been taken into account. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section, the remaining $100 attribute reduction amount is suspended and will be allocated and applied to reduce any amounts that become deductible or capitalizable as a result of the environmental remediation liability later being taken into account. If the liability is satisfied for an amount that is less than $100, under paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section the remaining portion of that $100 suspended attribute reduction amount is disregarded and has no further effect.
(ii)
Lower-tier subsidiary with additional liability.
(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of
Example 4,
except that, in addition, S exchanged $50 for the sole outstanding share of stock of S1. S1 has $50 and equipment with an aggregate basis of $0. S1 also has employee medical expense liabilities that have not been taken into account and that would be required to be capitalized if a person purchased S1's assets and assumed the liabilities. At the time of the sale, S's environmental remediation liability had a present value of $475 and S1's employee medical expenses had a present value of $25. For the reasons set forth in paragraph (i)(A) of this
Example 4,
M's sale of the S share is a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to this section.
(B)
Application of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
No adjustment is made under paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) of this section for the reasons set forth in paragraph (i)(B) of this
Example 4.
Thus, after the application of paragraph (c) of this section, M's sale of the S share is still a transfer of a loss share and, accordingly, subject to this paragraph (d).
(C)
Attribute reduction under this paragraph (d).
(
1
)
Computation of attribute reduction amount.
Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, S's attribute reduction amount is the lesser of the $500 net stock loss ($650 basis over $150 value) and the aggregate inside loss. The aggregate inside loss is the excess of S's net inside attribute amount over the value of the S share. Under paragraphs (d)(3)(iii)(B) and (d)(5)(i)(B) of this section, S's net inside attribute amount is determined by using S's $50 deemed basis in the S1 share (the greater of S's $50 actual basis in the share and S1's $50 net inside attribute amount). Accordingly, S's net inside attribute amount is $650 (the sum of its $100 basis in the factory, $50 basis in the land, $250 basis in the publicly traded property, $200 cash, and $50 deemed basis in its S1 share). The aggregate inside loss is $500, the excess of S's $650 net inside attribute amount over the $150 value of the S share. Thus, S's attribute reduction amount is $500, the lesser of the $500 net stock loss and S's $500 aggregate inside loss.

Under paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5)(ii) of this section, S's $500 attribute reduction amount is allocated proportionately (by basis) between its S1 share and its non-stock Category D asset (consisting of all S's Category D assets other than its share of S1 stock, with a basis equal to $600, the aggregate basis of S's non-stock assets). However, under paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section, for purposes of allocating S's attribute reduction amount between its non-stock Category D asset and the S1 share, S's $50 deemed basis in its S1 share is treated as reduced by S1's $25 net non-loss assets (its Class I asset, $50 cash over S1's liabilities (which, for this purpose include the $25 of employee medical expense liabilities not taken into account as of the transfer)). As a result, S's attribute reduction amount is allocated $480 (600/625 × 500) to S's non-stock Category D asset and $20 (25/625 × 500) to the S1 share. The $480 attribute reduction amount allocated to S's non-stock Category D asset produces the same reduction in the bases of S's assets (other than the S1 stock) as in paragraph (i)(C) of this
Example 4;
in addition, the $80 attribute reduction amount not applied to reduce S's attributes is suspended and applied to reduce any amounts that become deductible or capitalizable as a result of the environmental remediation liability later being taken into account. If the liability is satisfied for an amount that is less than $80, under paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section the remaining portion of that $80 suspended attribute reduction amount is disregarded and has no further effect. Because the S1 share is not transferred within the meaning of paragraph (f)(10) of this section, the allocated attribute reduction amount apportioned to the S1 share is applied fully to reduce the basis of the S1 share to $30. See paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section.
(D)
Tier down of S's attribute reduction amount.
The $20 portion of S's attribute reduction amount allocated to the S1 share is an attribute reduction amount of S1. Because S1 holds only cash, it has no attributes available for reduction under this paragraph (d). However, because S1 has a $25 liability not taken into account for tax purposes, paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section requires that $20 of the unapplied attribute reduction amount be suspended and then allocated and applied to reduce any amounts that become deductible or capitalizable as a result of the employee medical expense liabilities later being taken into account. If these liabilities are satisfied for an amount that is less than $20, under paragraph
(d)(4)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section the remaining portion of that $20 suspended attribute reduction amount is disregarded and has no further effect.

# Example 5. Wholly owned lower-tier subsidiary (no lower-tier transfer).
(i)
Application of conforming limitation.
(A)
Facts.
M owns the sole outstanding share of S stock with a basis of $250. S owns Asset with a basis of $100 and the only two outstanding shares of S1 stock (Share A has a basis of $40 and Share B has a basis of $60). S1 owns Asset 1 with a basis of $50. M sells its S share to P1, the common parent of another consolidated group, for $50. The sale is a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to this section. See paragraphs (f)(10)(i)(A), (f)(10)(i)(B), and (f)(10)(i)(C) of this section.
(B)
Application of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
Although the transfer is subject to this section, there is no basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section because there is only one share of S stock outstanding (and so there can be no disparity among members' bases in common shares and there are no outstanding preferred shares with respect to which there can be unrecognized gain or loss). See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. Therefore, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, the share is still a loss share and, as such, subject to paragraph (c) of this section. No adjustment is required under paragraph (c) of this section because, although there is a $50 disconformity amount, the net positive adjustment is $0. See paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Thus, after the application of paragraph (c) of this section, M's sale of the S share is still a transfer of a loss share and, accordingly, subject to this paragraph (d).
(C)
Attribute reduction under this paragraph (d).
(

)
Computation of attribute reduction amount.
Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, S's attribute reduction amount is the lesser of M's net stock loss and S's aggregate inside loss. M's net stock loss is $200 ($250 basis over $50 value). S's aggregate inside loss is the excess of S's net inside attribute amount over the value of the S share. Under paragraphs (d)(3)(iii)(B) and (d)(5)(i)(B) of this section, S's net inside attribute amount is $200, computed as the sum of S's $100 basis in Asset and its $100 deemed basis in the deemed single share of S1 stock (computed as the greater of S's $100 aggregate basis in the S1 shares and S1's $50 basis in Asset 1). S's aggregate inside loss is therefore $150, $200 net inside attribute amount over the $50 value of the S share. Accordingly, S's attribute reduction amount is $150, the lesser of the $200 net stock loss and the $150 aggregate inside loss.
(

)
Allocation, apportionment, and application of S's attribute reduction amount.
Under paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5)(ii) of this section, S's $150 attribute reduction amount is allocated proportionately (by basis) between Asset (non-stock Category D asset) with a basis of $100, and the S1 stock (treated as a single share with a deemed basis of $100). Accordingly, $75 of the attribute reduction amount ($100/$200 × $150) is allocated to Asset and $75 of the attribute reduction amount ($100/$200 × $150) is allocated to the S1 stock. The $75 of the attribute reduction amount allocated to Asset is applied to reduce S's basis in Asset from $100 to $25. The $75 of the attribute reduction amount allocated to the S1 stock is first apportioned between the shares in a manner that reduces disparity to the greatest extent possible. Thus, of the total $75 allocated to the S1 stock, $27.50 is apportioned to Share A and $47.50 is apportioned to Share B. Because neither of the S1 shares is transferred within the meaning of paragraph (f)(10) of this section, the allocated attribute reduction amount apportioned to each of the individual S1 shares is applied fully to reduce the basis of each share to $12.50. See paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section. As a result, immediately after the allocation, apportionment, and application of S's attribute reduction amount, S's basis in Asset is $25 and S's basis in each of the S1 shares is $12.50.

Tier down of S's attribute reduction amount, application of conforming limitation.
Under paragraph (d)(5)(v)(A) of this section, the $75 portion of S's attribute reduction amount allocated to the S1 stock is an attribute reduction amount of S1 (regardless of the extent, if any, to which it is apportioned and applied to reduce the basis of any shares of S1 stock). Under the general rules of this paragraph (d), the $75 tier-down attribute reduction amount would be allocated and applied to reduce S1's basis in Asset 1 from $50 to $0. However, under paragraph (d)(5)(v)(B) of this section, S1's attributes can be reduced by only $25, the excess of the $50 portion of S1's net inside attribute amount that is allocable to all S1 shares held by members as of the transaction over $25, the aggregate amount of members' bases in nontransferred S1 shares after reduction under this paragraph (d). Thus, of S1's $75 tier-down attribute reduction amount, only $25 is applied to reduce S1's basis in Asset 1, from $50 to $25. The $50 unapplied portion of the tier-down attribute reduction amount subject to the conforming limitation has no further effect.

Application of basis restoration rule.
(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this
Example 5,
except that S's basis in Share A is $15 and S's basis in Share B is $35, and S1's basis in Asset 1 is $100.
(B)
Basis redetermination and basis reduction under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
No adjustment is required under paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) of this section for the reasons set forth in paragraph (i)(B) of this
Example 5.
Thus, after the application of paragraph (c) of this section, M's transfer of the
S share is still a transfer of a loss share and, accordingly, subject to this paragraph (d).
(C)
Attribute reduction under this paragraph (d).
(

)
Computation of attribute reduction amount.
Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, S's attribute reduction amount is the lesser of M's net stock loss and S's aggregate inside loss. M's net stock loss is $200 ($250 basis over $50 value). S's aggregate inside loss is the excess of S's net inside attribute amount over the value of the S share. Under paragraphs (d)(3)(iii)(B) and (d)(5)(i)(B) of this section, S's net inside attribute amount is $200, the sum of S's $100 basis in Asset and its $100 deemed basis in the deemed single share of S1 stock (computed as the greater of S's $50 aggregate basis in the S1 shares and S1's $100 basis in Asset 1). S's aggregate inside loss is therefore $150, $200 net inside attribute amount over the $50 value of the S share. Accordingly, S's attribute reduction amount is $150, the lesser of the $200 net stock loss and the $150 aggregate inside loss.
(

)
Allocation, apportionment, and application of S's attribute reduction amount.
Under paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5)(ii) of this section, S's $150 attribute reduction amount is allocated proportionately (by basis) between Asset (non-stock Category D asset) with a basis of $100, and the S1 stock (treated as a single share with a deemed basis of $100). Accordingly, $75 of the attribute reduction amount ($100/$200 × $150) is allocated to Asset and $75 of the attribute reduction amount ($100/$200 × $150) is allocated to the S1 stock. The $75 of the attribute reduction amount allocated to Asset is applied to reduce S's basis in Asset from $100 to $25. The $75 of the attribute reduction amount allocated to the S1 stock is first apportioned between the shares in a manner that reduces disparity to the greatest extent possible. Thus, of the total $75 allocated to the S1 stock, $27.50 is apportioned to Share A and $47.50 is apportioned to Share B. Because neither of the S1 shares is transferred within the meaning of paragraph (f)(10) of this section, the allocated attribute reduction amount apportioned to each of the individual S1 shares is applied fully to reduce the basis of each share to an excess loss account of $12.50. See paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section. As a result, immediately after the allocation, apportionment, and application of S's attribute reduction amount, S's basis in Asset is $25 and S's basis in each of the S1 shares is an excess loss account of $12.50.
(

)
Tier down of S's attribute reduction amount.
Under paragraph (d)(5)(v)(A) of this section, the $75 portion of S's attribute reduction amount allocated to S1 stock is an attribute reduction amount of S1 (regardless of the extent, if any, to which it is apportioned and applied to reduce the basis of any shares of S1 stock). Accordingly, under the general rules of this paragraph (d), the $75 tier-down attribute reduction amount is applied to reduce S1's basis in Asset 1 from $100 to $25.
(

)
Basis restoration.
Under paragraph (d)(5)(vi)(A) of this section, after this paragraph (d) has been applied with respect to all transfers of subsidiary stock, any reduction made to the basis of a share of lower-tier subsidiary stock under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section is reversed to the extent necessary to conform the basis of that share to the share's allocable portion of the subsidiary's net inside attribute amount (after reduction). S1's net inside attribute amount after the application of this paragraph (d) is $25 and thus each of the two S1 share's allocable portion of S1's net inside attribute amount is $12.50. Accordingly, the reductions to Share A and to Share B under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section are reversed to the extent necessary to restore the basis of each share to $12.50. Thus, $25 of the $27.50 of reduction to the basis of Share A, and $25 of the $47.50 of reduction to the basis of share B, is reversed, restoring the basis of each share to $12.50.

# Example 6. Multiple blocks of lower-tier subsidiary stock outstanding.
(i)
Excess loss account taken into account (transfer of upper-tier share causes disposition within the meaning of § 1.1502-19(c)(1)(ii)(B)).
(A)
Facts.
M owns the sole outstanding share of S stock with a basis of $200. S holds all five outstanding shares of S1 common stock (Shares A, B, C, D, and E). S has an excess loss account of $20 in Share A and a positive basis of $20 in each of the other shares. The only investment adjustment applied to any S1 share was a negative $20 investment adjustment applied to Share A when it was the only outstanding share, and this amount tiered up and adjusted M's basis in the S share. S1 owns one asset with a basis of $250. M sells its S share to P1, the common parent of a consolidated group, for $20. The sale of the S share is a disposition of Share A under § 1.1502-19(c)(1)(ii)(B) (S1 becomes a nonmember because it will have a separate return year as a member of the P1 group). Accordingly, under § 1.1502-19(b)(1)(i) and paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, before the application of this section, S's excess loss account in Share A is taken into account, increasing S's basis in Share A to $0 and M's basis in its S share to $220. After giving effect to the recognition of the excess loss account, M's sale of the S share is a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to this section. See paragraphs (f)(10)(i)(A), (f)(10)(i)(B), and (f)(10)(i)(C) of this section.
(B)
Basis redetermination and basis reduction under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
Although the transfer is subject to this section, there is no basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section because there is only one share of S stock outstanding (and so there can be no disparity among members' bases in common shares and there are no
outstanding preferred shares with respect to which there can be unrecognized gain or loss). See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. Therefore, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, the share is still a loss share and, as such, subject to paragraph (c) of this section. No adjustment is made under paragraph (c) of this section because, even though there is a disconformity amount of $140, the net positive adjustment is $0. See paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Thus, after the application of paragraph (c) of this section, M's sale of the S share remains a transfer of a loss share and, accordingly, subject to this paragraph (d).
(C)
Attribute reduction under this paragraph (d).
(
1
)
Computation of attribute reduction amount.
Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, S's attribute reduction amount is the lesser of M's net stock loss and S's aggregate inside loss. M's net stock loss is $200 ($220 basis over $20 value). S's aggregate inside loss is the excess of S's net inside attribute amount over the value of the S share. Under paragraphs (d)(3)(iii)(B) and (d)(5)(i)(B) of this section, S's net inside attribute amount is $250, S's $250 deemed basis in the deemed single share of S1 stock (computed as the greater of S's $80 aggregate basis in the S1 shares ($0 basis in Share A plus $20 basis in each of the four other shares) and S1's $250 basis in its asset). S's aggregate inside loss is therefore $230, $250 net inside attribute amount over the $20 value of the S share. Accordingly, S's attribute reduction amount is $200, the lesser of the $200 net stock loss and the $230 aggregate inside loss.
(
2
)
Allocation, apportionment, and application of S's attribute reduction amount.
Under paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5)(ii) of this section, S's $200 attribute reduction amount is allocated entirely to the S1 stock (treated as a single share) and then apportioned among the shares in a manner that reduces disparity to the greatest extent possible. Thus, $24 is apportioned to Share A and $44 is apportioned to each of the other shares. Because none of the S1 shares are transferred within the meaning of paragraph (f)(10) of this section (notwithstanding that there is a disposition under § 1.1502-19(c)(1)(ii)(B)), the allocated attribute reduction amount apportioned to each of the individual S1 shares is applied fully to reduce the basis of each share to an excess loss account of $24. See paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section.
(

)
Tier down of S's attribute reduction amount.
Under paragraph (d)(5)(v)(A) of this section, the $200 of S's attribute reduction amount allocated to the S1 shares is an attribute reduction amount of S1 (regardless of the extent, if any, to which it is apportioned and applied to reduce the basis of any shares of S1 stock). Under the general rules of this paragraph (d), S1's $200 tier-down attribute reduction amount is allocated and applied to reduce S1's basis in its asset from $250 to $50.
(

)
Basis restoration.
Under paragraph (d)(5)(vi)(A) of this section, after this paragraph (d) has been applied with respect to all transfers of subsidiary stock, any reduction made to the basis of a share of lower-tier subsidiary stock under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section is reversed to the extent necessary to conform the basis of that share to the share's allocable portion of the subsidiary's net inside attribute amount (after reduction). S1's net inside attribute amount after the application of this paragraph (d) is $50 and thus each of the five S1 share's allocable portion of S1's net inside attribute amount is $10. Accordingly, the reductions to the bases of S1 shares under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section are reversed to the extent necessary to restore (to the extent possible) the basis of each share to $10. Thus, $24 of the $24 of reduction to the basis of Share A is reversed, restoring the basis of Share A to $0, and $34 of the $44 of reduction to the basis of each other share is reversed, restoring the basis of each of those shares to $10.
(ii)
Sale of gain share to member.
(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this
Example 6,
except that M owns Shares A, B, C, and D, S owns Share E, S has a liability of $20, and S1's basis in its asset is $500. Also, as part of the transaction, S sells Share E to M for $40. Unlike under the facts of paragraph (i)(A) of this
Example 6,
there is no disposition of Share A within the meaning of § 1.1502-19(c)(1)(ii)(B) (S1 continues to be a member of the group, and thus does not have a separate return year). As a result, the Share A excess loss account is not taken into account. Although S's sale of Share E is a transfer of that share, the share is not a loss share and thus the transfer is not subject to this section. M's sale of the S share, however, is a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to this section. See paragraphs (f)(10)(i)(A), (f)(10)(i)(B), and (f)(10)(i)(C) of this section.
(B)
Transfer in lowest tier (gain share).
S's sale of Share E is the lowest-tier transfer in the transaction. Under paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, because there are no transfers of loss shares at that tier, no adjustments are required under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. However, S's gain recognized on the transfer of Share E is computed and immediately adjusts members' bases in subsidiary stock under § 1.1502-32 (because M and S are not members of the same group immediately after the transaction, the sale is not an intercompany transaction subject to § 1.1502-13). Accordingly, M's basis in its S share is increased by $20, from $200 to $220.
(C)
Transfers in next higher tier, application of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
The next higher tier transfer is M's sale of the S stock. The sale is a transfer of a loss share
and therefore subject to this section. Although the transfer is subject to this section, there is no basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section because there is only one share of S stock outstanding (and so there can be no disparity among members' bases in common shares and there are no outstanding preferred shares with respect to which there can be unrecognized gain or loss). See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. Therefore, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, the share is still a loss share and, as such, subject to paragraph (c) of this section. Under paragraph (c) of this section, M's basis in its S share is decreased by $20, the lesser of S's $200 disconformity amount (computed as the excess of M's $220 basis in the S stock over S's $20 net inside attribute amount (computed as the $20 basis in Share E, increased by $20 to reflect the gain recognized with respect to the share, less the $20 liability)), and the $20 net positive adjustment. Thus, after the application of paragraph (c) of this section, M's basis in the S share is $200, and the sale remains a transfer of a loss share. There are no higher tier transfers and, therefore, M's transfer of the S share is then subject to this paragraph (d).
(D)
Attribute reduction under this paragraph (d).
(
1
)
Computation of attribute reduction amount.
Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, S's attribute reduction amount is the lesser of M's net stock loss and S's aggregate inside loss. M's net stock loss is $180 ($200 basis over $20 value). S's aggregate inside loss is the excess of S's net inside attribute amount over the value of the S share. Under paragraphs (d)(3)(iii)(B) and (d)(5)(i)(B) of this section, S's net inside attribute amount is $80, computed as $100 (S's deemed basis in Share E (the greater of $40 (S's $20 basis in Share E, adjusted for the $20 gain recognized with respect to the share), and Share E's allocable portion of S1's net inside attribute amount of $100 (1/5 of S1's $500 basis in its asset)), less S's $20 liability. Accordingly, S's aggregate inside loss is $60 ($80 net inside attribute amount over the $20 value of the S stock). S's attribute reduction amount is therefore $60, the lesser of $180 net stock loss and $60 aggregate inside loss.
(

)
Allocation, apportionment, and application of S's attribute reduction amount.
Under paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5)(ii) of this section, S's $60 attribute reduction amount is allocated entirely to its S1 stock, Share E. However, because Share E was transferred within the meaning of paragraph (f)(10) of this section and gain was recognized on its transfer, none of the allocated amount is apportioned to, or applied to reduce the basis of Share E. See paragraph (d)(5)(iii)(A) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(5)(iv) of this section, the $60 allocated attribute reduction amount not apportioned or applied to Share E has no effect on S or S's attributes.
(

)
Tier down of S's attribute reduction amount.
Notwithstanding the fact that no portion of the allocated attribute reduction amount was apportioned to or applied to reduce the basis of Share E, the entire $60 allocated attribute reduction amount is an attribute reduction amount of S1. See paragraph (d)(5)(v)(A) of this section. Under the general rules of this paragraph (d), S1's $60 tier-down attribute reduction amount is allocated and applied to reduce S1's basis in its asset from $500 to $440.
(

)
Basis restoration.
Under paragraph (d)(5)(vi)(A) of this section, after this paragraph (d) has been applied with respect to all transfers of subsidiary stock, any reduction made to the basis of a share of subsidiary stock under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section is reversed to the extent necessary to conform the basis of that share to the share's allocable portion of the subsidiary's net inside attribute amount. No reduction was made to the basis of the S1 stock under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section. Therefore, no stock basis is increased under the basis restoration rule in paragraph (d)(5)(vi)(A) of this section.

# Example 7. Allocation of attribute reduction if lower-tier subsidiary has non-loss assets or liabilities.
(i)
S1 holds cash.
(A)
Facts.
M owns the sole outstanding share of S stock with a basis of $800. S owns Asset with a basis of $400 and the sole outstanding share of S1 stock with a basis of $300. S1 holds Asset 1 with a basis of $50, and $100 cash. M sells its S share to P1, the common parent of a consolidated group, for $100. The sale is not a transfer of the S1 share because S and S1 are members of the same group following the transaction. However, the sale is a transfer of the S share, a loss share, and therefore subject to this section. See paragraphs (f)(10)(i)(A), (f)(10)(i)(B), and (f)(10)(i)(C) of this section.
(B)
Application of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
Although the transfer is subject to this section, there is no basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section because there is only one share of S stock outstanding (and so there can be no disparity among members' bases in common shares and there are no outstanding preferred shares with respect to which there can be unrecognized gain or loss). See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. Therefore, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, the share is still a loss share and, as such, subject to the provisions of this paragraph (c). No adjustment is required under paragraph (c) of this section because, even though there is a disconformity amount of $100, the net positive adjustment is $0. See paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Thus, after the application of paragraph (c) of this section, M's sale of the S share is still a transfer of a loss share and, accordingly, subject to this paragraph (d).
(C)
Attribute reduction under this paragraph (d).
(

)
Computation of attribute reduction amount.
Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, S's attribute reduction amount is the lesser of M's net stock loss and S's aggregate inside loss. M's net stock loss is $700 ($800 basis over $100 value). S's aggregate inside loss is the excess of S's net inside attribute amount over the value of the S share. Under paragraphs (d)(3)(iii)(B) and (d)(5)(i)(B) of this section, S's net inside attribute amount is $700, the sum of its $400 basis in Asset and its $300 deemed basis in the S1 share (computed as the greater of S's $300 basis in the S1 share and S1's $150 net inside attribute amount (reflecting the sum of S1's $50 basis in Asset 1 and S1's $100 cash)). Therefore, S's aggregate inside loss is $600 ($700 net inside attribute amount over the $100 value of the S stock). S's attribute reduction amount is $600, the lesser of the $700 net stock loss and the $600 aggregate inside loss.
(

)
Allocation, apportionment, and application of S's attribute reduction amount.
Under paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5)(ii) of this section, S's $600 attribute reduction amount is allocated proportionately (by basis) between S's $400 basis in Asset (non-stock Category D asset) and its deemed basis in the S1 share. However, under paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section, for purposes of allocating the attribute reduction amount, S's $300 deemed basis in the S1 share is treated as reduced by S1's net non-loss assets (its Class I asset, $100 cash) to $200. Thus, the $600 is allocated $400 to Asset ($400/$600 × $600) and $200 to the S1 share ($200/$600 × $600). The $400 allocated to Asset is applied to reduce S's basis in Asset from $400 to $0. Because the S1 share is not transferred within the meaning of paragraph (f)(10) of this section, the allocated attribute reduction amount apportioned to the S1 share is applied fully to reduce the basis of the S1 share to $100. See paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section.

)
Tier down of S's attribute reduction amount.
Under paragraph (d)(5)(v)(A) of this section, the $200 portion of S's attribute reduction amount allocated to the S1 stock is an attribute reduction amount of S1 (regardless of the extent, if any, to which it is apportioned and applied to reduce the basis of any shares of S1 stock). Under the general rules of this paragraph (d), S1's $200 tier-down attribute reduction amount is allocated and applied to reduce S1's basis in Asset 1 (S1's only attribute available for reduction) from $50 to $0. The $150 unapplied attribute reduction amount is disregarded and has no further effect.

Basis restoration.
Under paragraph (d)(5)(vi)(A) of this section, after this paragraph (d) has been applied with respect to all transfers of subsidiary stock, any reduction made to the basis of a share of subsidiary stock under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section is reversed to the extent necessary to conform the basis of that share to the share's allocable portion of the subsidiary's net inside attribute amount. There is only one share of S1 stock outstanding and so S1's entire $100 net inside attribute amount is allocable to that share. Because S's $100 basis in the S1 share (as reduced under this paragraph (d)) is already conformed with its $100 allocable portion of S1's net inside attribute amount, there is no restoration under paragraph (d)(5)(vi)(A) of this section.
(ii)
S1 borrows cash.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this
Example 7
except that, in addition, S1 borrows $50 from X immediately before M sells the S share. The computation of the attribute reduction amount is the same as in paragraph (i)(C) of this
Example 7
(the $50 cash from the loan proceeds and the $50 liability offset in the computation of S1's net inside attribute amount and so the net amount is unaffected, and the computation of S's deemed basis in the S1 stock is unaffected). Similarly, for purposes of allocating the attribute reduction amount between the non-stock Category D asset and the S1 stock, paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section requires S's deemed basis in the S1 share to be treated as reduced by S1's net non-loss assets (S1's non-loss assets over S1's liabilities). Accordingly, the additional $50 cash proceeds is offset by the $50 liability and there is no effect on the allocation of the attribute reduction amount. The results are the same as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 7.
(iii)
S1 has a liability not taken into account for tax purposes.
(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (ii) of this
Example 7
except that, in addition, S1 has a $40 liability that is not taken into account for tax purposes as of the transfer and that would be required to be capitalized if a person purchased S1's assets and assumed the liability.
(B)
Application of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
No adjustment is required under paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) of this section for the reasons set forth in paragraph (i)(B) of this
Example 7.
Thus, after the application of paragraph (c) of this section, P's sale of the S share is still a transfer of a loss share and, accordingly, subject to this paragraph (d).
(C)
Attribute reduction under this paragraph (d).
(

)
Computation of attribute reduction amount.
The attribute reduction amount is the same as computed in paragraph (i)(C)(
1
) of this
Example 7
(under paragraph (f)(5) of this section, the term liability does not include liabilities not taken into account for tax purposes and so the additional $40 liability not yet taken into account for tax purposes does not affect the computation of S's attribute reduction amount).
(
2
)
Allocation, apportionment, and application of S's attribute reduction amount.
Under paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5)(ii) of this section,
S's $600 attribute reduction amount is allocated proportionately (by basis) between S's $400 basis in Asset 1 (non-stock Category D asset) and its deemed basis in the S1 share. However, under paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section, for purposes of allocating the attribute reduction amount, S's $300 deemed basis in the S1 share is treated as reduced by S1's net non-loss assets (S1's non-loss assets over S1's liabilities). For this purpose, the term liabilities includes liabilities not taken into account for tax purposes, as described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section (generally, liabilities that, if assumed in a purchase, would give rise to a capitalized amount when satisfied). Thus, for this purpose, S's $300 deemed basis in the S1 share is reduced by S1's $60 net non-loss assets (the excess of S1's $150 non-loss assets (its Class I asset, $150 cash) over S1's $90 liabilities ($50 loan and $40 liability not yet taken into account for tax purposes)), to $240. Accordingly, S's $600 attribute reduction amount is allocated and applied $375 ($400/$640 × $600) to Asset (reducing S's basis in Asset from $400 to $25) and $225 ($240/$640 × $600) to the S1 share. Because the S1 share is not transferred within the meaning of paragraph (f)(10) of this section, the allocated attribute reduction amount apportioned to the S1 share is applied fully to reduce the basis of the S1 share to $75. See paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section.
(
3
)
Tier down of S's attribute reduction amount, application of conforming limitation.
Under paragraph (d)(5)(v)(A) of this section, the $225 portion of S's attribute reduction amount allocated to the S1 stock is an attribute reduction amount of S1 (regardless of the extent, if any, to which it is apportioned and applied to reduce the basis of any shares of S1 stock). Under the general rules of this paragraph (d), S1's $225 tier-down attribute reduction amount would be allocated and applied to reduce S1's attributes. However, under paragraph (d)(5)(v)(B) of this section, S1's attributes can be reduced by only $75, the excess of the $150 portion of S1's net inside attribute amount that is allocable to all S1 shares held by members as of the transaction over $75, the aggregate amount of members' bases in nontransferred S1 shares, after reduction under this paragraph (d). Thus, of S1's $225 tier-down attribute reduction amount, $50 is applied to reduce S1's basis in Asset 1, from $50 to $0. Although the $25 unapplied attribute reduction amount not subject to the conforming limitation would generally be disregarded without further effect, because S1 has a $40 liability not taken into account for tax purposes, paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section requires that the $25 of the unapplied attribute reduction amount not subject to the conforming limitation be suspended and then allocated and applied to reduce any amounts that become deductible or capitalizable as a result of that liability later being taken into account. If the liability is satisfied for an amount that is less than $25, under paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section the remaining portion of that $25 suspended attribute reduction amount is disregarded and has no further effect. The $150 unapplied portion of the tier-down attribute reduction amount subject to the conforming limitation has no further effect.
(

)
Basis restoration.
Under paragraph (d)(5)(vi)(A) of this section, after this paragraph (d) has been applied with respect to all transfers of subsidiary stock, any reduction made to the basis of a share of lower-tier subsidiary stock under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section is reversed to the extent necessary to conform the basis of that share to the share's allocable portion of the subsidiary's net inside attribute amount. Paragraph (d)(5)(vi)(A) provides that, for this purpose, S1's net inside attribute amount is its net inside attribute amount, taking into account any reductions under this paragraph (d) and treating it as reduced by any attribute reduction amount suspended under paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section. Because S's $75 basis in its S1 stock (after application of this paragraph (d)) is already conformed with its $75 allocable portion of S1's net inside attribute amount ($100 net inside attributes after reduction, reduced by S1's $25 suspended attribute reduction amount), there is no restoration under paragraph (d)(5)(vi)(A) of this section.

# Example 8. Election to reduce stock basis or reattribute attributes under paragraph (d)(6) of this section.
(i)
Deconsolidating sale.
(A)
Facts.
P owns the sole outstanding share of M stock with a basis of $1,000. M owns all 100 outstanding shares of S stock with a basis of $2.10 per share ($210 total). M sells all its S shares to X for $1 per share ($100 total). M's sale of the S shares is a transfer of loss shares and therefore subject to this section. See paragraphs (f)(10)(i)(A), (f)(10)(i)(B), and (f)(10)(i)(C) of this section. At the time of the sale, S has no liabilities and the following:

(B)
Application of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
Although the transfer is subject to this section, there is no basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section because there is no disparity among M's bases in shares of S common stock and there are no shares of S preferred stock outstanding (so there can be no unrecognized gain or loss with respect to preferred shares). See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. No adjustment is required under paragraph (c) of this section because both the disconformity amount and the net positive adjustment are $0. See paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Thus, after the application of paragraph (c) of this section, M's transfer of the S shares is still a transfer of loss shares and, accordingly, subject to this paragraph (d).
(C)
Attribute reduction under this paragraph (d).
(

)
Computation of attribute reduction amount.
Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, S's attribute reduction amount is the lesser of the $110 net stock loss ($210 aggregate basis over the $100 aggregate value) and S's aggregate inside loss. S's aggregate inside loss is $110 (S's $210 net inside attribute amount (the $10 capital loss carryover, plus the $90 NOL carryover, plus the $40 deferred deduction, plus the $70 basis in the land) over the $100 value of all outstanding S shares). S's attribute reduction amount is $110, the lesser of the $110 net stock loss and the $110 aggregate inside loss.

(D)
Results.
The P group recognizes a $110 loss on M's sale of the S shares that is absorbed by the group, which reduces P's basis in the M share under § 1.1502-32 from $1,000 to $890. Immediately after the transaction, the entities own the following:

Election to reduce stock basis.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this
Example 8
except that P elects under paragraph (d)(6) of this section to reduce M's basis in the S shares by the full attribute reduction amount of $110, in lieu of S reducing its attributes. The election is effective for all transferred loss shares and is allocated to those shares in proportion to the loss in each. See paragraph (d)(6)(v)(A) of this section. Accordingly, the basis of each of the 100 transferred shares is reduced from $2.10 to $1.00. After giving effect to the election, the S shares are not loss shares and this section has no further application to the transfer. The $110 reduction in M's basis in the S shares pursuant to the election under paragraph (d)(6) of this section is a noncapital, nondeductible expense of M that will reduce P's basis in the M share. See paragraph (d)(6)(v)(A) of this section. Immediately after the transaction, the entities own the following:

(F)
Election to reattribute losses.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this
Example 8
except that P elects under paragraph (d)(6) of this section to reattribute S's
attributes. S's attribute reduction amount is $110, and P can reattribute all or any portion of the attributes in Category A, Category B, and Category C to the extent of $110. P elects to reattribute the $90 NOL, and, as a result, S's NOL is $0. Under paragraph (d)(6)(iv)(A) of this section, the reattribution of the $90 NOL is a noncapital, nondeductible expense of S. Under § 1.1502-32(c)(1)(ii)(A)(
1
) this $90 expense is allocated to the transferred loss shares of S stock in proportion to the loss in the shares, or $.90 per share. Further, this expense tiers up under § 1.1502-32 and reduces P's basis in the M stock by $90. After giving effect to the election, the P group would recognize a $20 loss on M's sale of the S shares, S would have an aggregate inside loss of $20 (S's $120 net inside attribute amount (the $10 capital loss carryover, plus the $40 deferred deduction, plus the $70 basis in the land) over the $100 value of all outstanding S shares), and S's attribute reduction amount would be $20 (applied $10 to the $10 capital loss carryover and $10 to the $40 deferred deduction). (Alternatively, under paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section, P could specify the allocation of S's $20 attribute reduction amount between S's $10 capital loss carryover and S's $40 deferred deduction. Further, P could elect to reduce M's remaining basis in the S shares by any amount up to the $20 attribute reduction amount, thereby reducing or eliminating S's attribute reduction amount.)

No adjustment is required under paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) of this section for the reasons set forth in paragraph (i)(B) of this

Computation of attribute reduction amount.
Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, S's attribute reduction amount is the lesser of the $22 net stock loss ($42 aggregate basis over $20 aggregate value) and S's $110 aggregate inside loss (as calculated in paragraph (i)(C)(

Results.
The P group recognizes a $22 loss on M's sale of the S shares that is absorbed by the group, which reduces P's basis in the M share under § 1.1502-32 from $1,000 to $978. Immediately after the transaction, the entities have the following:

The election is effective for all transferred loss shares and is allocated to such shares in proportion to the loss in each share. See paragraph (d)(6)(v)(A) of this section. Accordingly, the basis of each of the 20 transferred shares is reduced from $2.10 to $1.00. After giving effect to the election, the transferred S shares are not loss shares and this section has no further application to the transfer. The $22 reduction in M's basis in the S shares pursuant to the election under paragraph (d)(6) of this section is a noncapital, nondeductible expense of M that will reduce P's basis in the M share.

The facts are the same as in paragraph (ii)(A) of this

Because S remains a member of the same group as P following M's sale of S stock, P cannot elect under paragraph (d)(6) of this section to reattribute any portion of S's attributes in lieu of attribute reduction.

# Example 9. Transfers at multiple tiers, gain and loss shares.
(i)
Facts.
M owns the sole outstanding share of S stock with a basis of $700. S owns Asset 1 (basis of $170) and all ten outstanding shares of S1 common stock ($170 basis in share 1, $10 basis in share 2, and $15 basis in each of share 3 through share 10). S1 owns the sole outstanding share of S2 ($0 basis), the sole outstanding share of S3 ($60 basis), and the sole outstanding share of S4 ($100 basis). S2's sole asset is Asset 2 ($75 basis). S3's sole asset is Asset 3 ($75 basis). S4's sole asset is Asset 4 ($80 basis). In one transaction, M sells its S share to P1 (the common parent of a consolidated group) for $240, S sells S1 share 1 to X for $20, S contributes S1 share 2 to a partnership in a section 721 transaction, and S1 sells its S2 share to Y for $50. M's sale of the S share and S1's sale of the S2 share are transfers under paragraphs (f)(10)(i)(A), (f)(10)(i)(B), and (f)(10)(i)(C) of this section. S's sale of S1 share 1 to X is a transfer under paragraphs (f)(10)(i)(A) and (f)(10)(i)(C) of this section. S's contribution of S1 share 2 to the partnership is a transfer under paragraph (f)(10)(i)(C) of this section.
(ii)
Transfer in lowest tier (gain share).
However, S1's gain recognized on the transfer of the S2 share is computed and immediately adjusts members' bases in subsidiary stock under § 1.1502-32. Under paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, because there are no transfers of loss shares at that tier, no adjustments are required under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. However, S1's gain recognized on the transfer of the S2 share is computed and immediately adjusts members bases in subsidiary stock under § 1.1502-32. Accordingly, $5 is allocated to each of 10 S1 shares, increasing the basis of share 1 to $175, the basis of share 2 to $15, and the basis of each other share to $20. The $50 applied to S's bases in the S1 shares then tiers up to increase P's basis in the S share from $700 to $750.
(iii)
Transfers in next highest tier (loss share).
S's sale of the S1 share 1 and S's transfer of the S1 share 2 to a partnership are both transfers of stock in the next higher tier. However, only the S1 share 1 is a loss share and so this section only applies with respect to the transfer of that share.
(A)
Basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section, members' bases in S1 shares are redetermined by first removing the positive investment adjustments applied to the bases of transferred loss common shares. Accordingly, the $5 positive investment adjustment applied to the basis of S1 share 1 is removed, reducing the basis of S1 share 1 from $175 to $170. Because there were no negative adjustments applied to the bases of S1 shares, there are no negative adjustments that can be reallocated to further reduce the basis of S1 share 1 under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section. Finally, under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the $5 positive investment adjustment removed from S1 share 1 is reallocated and applied to increase the bases of other S1 common shares in a manner that reduces disparity to the greatest extent possible. Accordingly, the entire $5 investment adjustment removed from S1 share 1 is reallocated and applied to increase the basis of S1 share 2, from $15 to $20. After basis is redetermined under paragraph (b) of this section, the S1 share 1 is still a loss share and therefore subject to basis reduction under paragraph (c) of this section. (Because the S1 share 2 is not a loss share, this section does not apply with respect to the transfer of that share.)
(B)
Basis reduction under paragraph (c) of this section.
No adjustment is required to the basis of S1 share 1 under paragraph (c) of this section. The S1 share 1 has a disconformity amount of $149. This $149 disconformity amount is computed as the excess of the $170 basis in the S1 share 1 over the S1 share 1's $21 allocable portion (1/10) of S1's $210 net inside attribute amount. S1's $210 net inside attribute amount is determined under paragraph (c)(5) of this section as the sum of $50 (S1's $0 basis in the S2 share, adjusted for the $50 gain recognized with respect to that share), S1's $60 basis in the S3 stock, and S1's $100 basis in the S4 stock. (In computing the disconformity amount, the basis of the S2 share is not treated as tentatively reduced because that share is transferred in the transaction, and the bases of the S3 and S4 shares are not treated as tentatively reduced because no positive investment adjustments were applied to the bases of those shares.) However, the S1 share 1's net positive adjustment is $0 because the $5 positive investment adjustment originally allocated to S1 share 1 was reallocated to S1 share 2 under paragraph (b) of this section. See paragraph (c)(3) of this section. No adjustment is required to the basis of S1 share 2 under paragraph (c) of this section because S1 share 2 is not a loss share.
(C)
Computation of loss, adjustments to stock basis.
S recognizes a loss of $150 on the sale of the S1 share 1 ($170 basis over $20 amount
realized) that is absorbed by the group. Under § 1.1502-32, M's basis in its S share is therefore decreased by $100, the net of the $150 loss recognized by S on the sale of the S1 share, and the $50 gain that tiered up from S1 (as a result of S1's sale of the S2 share). Following these adjustments, M's basis in the S share is $600 and the sale of the S share is still a transfer of a loss share.
(iv)
Transfer in highest tier (loss share).
The sale of the S share is a transfer in the next higher tier, which is the highest tier in this transaction. Because the sale is a transfer of a loss share, it is subject to this section.
(A)
Basis redetermination and basis reduction under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
Although the transfer is subject to this section, there is no basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section because there is only one share of S stock outstanding (and so there can be no disparity among members' bases in common shares and there are no outstanding preferred shares with respect to which there can be unrecognized gain or loss). See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. Therefore, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, the share is still a loss share and, as such, subject to paragraph (c) of this section. In addition, no adjustment is required under paragraph (c) of this section. The S share has a disconformity amount of $230. This $230 disconformity amount is computed as the excess of the $600 basis in the S share over the S share's $370 allocable portion (1/1) of S's $370 net inside attribute amount. S's $370 net inside attribute amount is determined under paragraph (c)(5) of this section as the sum of $200 (S's $170 basis in the S1 share 1, adjusted for the $150 loss recognized with respect to that share, and S's $20 basis in each of S1 share 2 through share 10), and S's $170 basis in Asset 1. (In computing the disconformity amount, the bases of S1 share 1 and share 2 are not treated as tentatively reduced because those shares are transferred in the transaction, and the bases of S1 share 3 through share 10 are not treated as tentatively reduced because none of those shares have a disconformity amount—each share has a basis of $20 and a $21 allocable portion (1/10) of S1's $210 net inside attribute amount, as determined in paragraph (iii)(B) of this
Example 9.
) However, the S share's net positive adjustment is $0 (the S share's net adjustment is negative $100). See paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Accordingly, the sale of the S share is still a transfer of a loss share. Because there are no higher-tier loss shares transferred in the transaction, this paragraph (d) then applies with respect to the transfer of the S share.
(B)
Attribute reduction under this paragraph (d).
(
1
)
Computation of S's attribute reduction amount.
Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, S's attribute reduction amount is the lesser of P's net stock loss and S's aggregate inside loss. P's net stock loss is $360 ($600 basis over $240 amount realized). S's aggregate inside loss is the excess of S's net inside attribute amount over the value of the S share. S's net inside attribute amount is the sum of its bases in its assets, treating its S1 shares as a single share (the S1 stock) and treating S's deemed basis in the S1 stock as its basis in that stock. Under paragraph (d)(5)(i)(C) of this section, when subsidiaries are owned in multiple tiers, deemed basis is first determined for shares at the lowest tier, and then for stock in each next higher tier. Under paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B) of this section, S1's deemed basis in the S2 stock is $75 (computed as the greater of $50 (S1's $0 basis in the S2 share, adjusted for the $50 gain recognized with respect to the share) and $75 (S2's net inside attribute amount, the basis in Asset 2)). S1's deemed basis in the S3 stock is $75 (computed as the greater of $60 (S1's basis in the S3 share) and $75 (S3's net inside attribute amount, the basis in Asset 3)). S1's deemed basis in the S4 stock is $100 (computed as the greater of $100 (S1's basis in the S4 share) and $80 (S4's net inside attribute amount, the basis in Asset 4)). Accordingly, S1's net inside attribute amount is $250 ($75 deemed basis in the S2 stock plus $75 deemed basis in the S3 stock plus $100 deemed basis in the S4 stock). S's deemed basis in the S1 stock is the greater of the sum of S's actual basis in each share of S1 stock (adjusted for any gain or loss recognized) and S1's net inside attribute amount. S's actual basis in the S1 stock, adjusted for the loss recognized, is $200 (the sum of S's $170 basis in the S1 share 1, adjusted by the $150 loss recognized with respect to the share, and S's $20 basis in each of S1 share 2 through share 10). Thus, S's deemed basis in the S1 stock is $250, the greater of $200 (aggregate basis in S1 shares, adjusted for loss recognized) and $250 (S1's net inside attribute amount). As a result, S's net inside attribute amount is $420, the sum of S's $250 deemed basis in the S1 stock and S's $170 basis in Asset 1. Accordingly, the aggregate inside loss is $180, the excess of S's $420 net inside attribute amount over the $240 value of all of the S stock. S's attribute reduction amount is therefore $180, the lesser of the $360 net stock loss and the $180 aggregate inside loss.

Allocation, apportionment, and application of S's attribute reduction amount.
Under paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5)(ii) of this section, S's $180 attribute reduction amount is allocated proportionately (by basis) between Asset 1 (non-stock Category D asset) and the S1 stock. However, under paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section, for purposes of allocating S's $180 attribute reduction amount between S's non-stock Category D asset and the S1 stock, S's $250 deemed basis in the S1 stock is reduced by the $40 value of the transferred S1 shares (S1 share 1 and share 2) and the nontransferred S1 shares' $40 allocable portion
(8/10) of S1's $50 net non-loss assets. S1's net non-loss assets is the $50 value of S1's transferred S2 shares. (S1 has no other non-loss assets, and there are no non-loss assets held by lower-tier subsidiaries.) Accordingly, for this purpose, S's deemed basis in the S1 stock is reduced by $80, from $250 to $170. Thus, $90 of the attribute reduction amount ($170/$340 × $180) is allocated to Asset 1 (reducing S's basis in Asset 1 from $170 to $80) and $90 of the attribute reduction amount ($170/$340 × $180) is allocated to the S1 stock. Under paragraph (d)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, none of the $90 allocated attribute reduction amount is apportioned to S1 share 1 because loss is recognized on the transfer of S1 share 1. Under paragraph (d)(5)(iii)(B) of this section, the $90 allocated attribute reduction amount is apportioned among the other nine shares of S1 common stock in a manner that reduces disparity to the greatest extent possible. Accordingly, of the total $90 allocated amount, $10 is apportioned to each of the remaining nine shares of S1 stock. Under paragraph (d)(5)(iii)(C) of this section, the allocated attribute reduction amount apportioned to an individual share cannot be applied to reduce the basis of the share below its value if the share is transferred other than in a recognition transfer. Because the S1 share 2 is transferred (contributed to the partnership) and the basis of S1 share 2 is already equal to its value, none of the $10 allocated attribute reduction amount apportioned to S1 share 2 is applied to reduce its basis. Because none of S1 share 3 through share 10 are transferred within the meaning of paragraph (f)(10) of this section, the $10 allocated attribute reduction amount apportioned to each of S1 share 3 through share 10 is applied fully to reduce the basis of each of those shares from $20 to $10. As a result, immediately after the allocation and application of S's attribute reduction amount, S's basis in Asset 1 is $80 ($170 minus $90), its bases in S1 share 1 and share 2 are not adjusted under paragraph (d)(5)(iii), and its basis in each of S1 share 3 through share 10 is $10. Under paragraph (d)(5)(v)(A) of this section, the entire $90 of S's attribute reduction amount that was allocated to the S1 stock is an attribute reduction amount of S1, regardless of the fact that none of the allocated amount was apportioned to S1 share 1 and none of the amount apportioned to S1 share 2 was applied to reduce the basis of S1 share 2.
(v)
Attribute reduction under this paragraph (d) in next lower tier. (A) Computation of S1's attribute reduction amount.
S's sale of S1 share 1 is a transfer of a loss share and it is in the next lower tier. Thus, this paragraph (d) next applies with respect to S's transfer of S1 share 1. S1's attribute reduction amount will include both the $90 attribute reduction amount that tiered down from S and any attribute reduction amount resulting from the application of this paragraph (d) with respect to S's transfer of S1 share 1 and share 2 (S1's direct attribute reduction amount). Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, S1's direct attribute reduction amount is the lesser of the net stock loss on transferred S1 shares and S1's aggregate inside loss. The net stock loss on transferred S1 shares is $150, computed as the excess of S's $190 adjusted bases in transferred shares of S1 stock ($170 in S1 share 1 plus $20 in S1 share 2) over the $40 aggregate value of those shares. S1's aggregate inside loss is $50, the excess of S1's $250 net inside attribute amount (as calculated in paragraph (iv)(B)(
1
) of this
Example 9
) over the $200 value of all outstanding S1 shares. Therefore, S1's direct attribute reduction amount is $50, the lesser of the $150 net stock loss and S1's $50 aggregate inside loss. S1's total attribute reduction amount is thus $140, the sum of the $90 tier-down attribute reduction amount and the $50 direct attribute reduction amount.
(B)
Allocation, apportionment, and application of S1's attribute reduction amount.
Under paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5)(ii) of this section, S1's $140 attribute reduction amount is allocated proportionately (by basis) among the S2 stock, the S3 stock, and the S4 stock. However, under paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section, for purposes of allocating S1's $140 attribute reduction amount among S1's lower-tier subsidiary stock, S1's $75 deemed basis in the S2 stock is reduced by the $50 value of the transferred S2 share. Accordingly, for this purpose, S1's deemed basis in the S2 stock is reduced by $50, from $75 to $25. Thus, $17.50 of S1's attribute reduction amount ($25/$200 × $140) is allocated to the S2 stock, $52.50 of S1's attribute reduction amount ($75/$200 × $140) is allocated to the S3 stock, and $70 of S1's attribute reduction amount ($100/$200 × $140) is allocated to the S4 stock. Under paragraph (d)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, none of the $17.50 of S1's attribute reduction amount allocated to S2 stock is apportioned to the S2 share because gain was recognized on the transfer of the S2 share. Because neither the S3 share nor the S4 share is transferred within the meaning of paragraph (f)(10) of this section, the $52.50 of S1's attribute reduction amount allocated to the S3 stock, and the $70 of S1's attribute reduction amount allocated to the S4 stock, is apportioned to and applied fully to reduce the basis of such shares. Thus, S1's basis in the S3 share is reduced by $52.50, from $60 to $7.50, and S1's basis in the S4 stock is reduced by $70, from $100 to $30. (Note: The conforming limitation in paragraph (d)(5)(v)(B) of this section limits the application of the $90 tier down attribute reduction amount to $80, the amount by which the portion (10/10) S1's $250 net inside attribute amount attributable to S1 shares held by members exceeds $170 (the sum of the $50 direct attribute reduction amount, the $20
value of the S1 share 1 transferred in a recognition transfer, the $20 basis (after reduction) in the S1 share 2 transferred other than in a recognition transfer, and the $80 aggregate basis (after reduction) in the nontransferred S1 shares held by members). However, the conforming limitation does not limit the application of S1's $90 tier-down attribute reduction amount because none of the $17.50 of S1's total attribute reduction amount allocated to the S2 share was applied to reduce the basis of the share. Accordingly, only $78.75 ($90—($17.50 × ($90/$140)) of the $90 tier-down attribute reduction was applied to reduce S1's attributes.) Under paragraph (d)(5)(v)(A) of this section, the attribute reduction amount allocated to the S2 stock, the S3 stock, and the S4 stock becomes an attribute reduction amount of S2, S3, and S4, respectively (even though the amount allocated to S2 stock was not apportioned to or applied to reduce the basis of the S2 share).
(vi)
Attribute reduction under this paragraph (d) in lowest tier.
Although the sale of the S2 share is a transfer of subsidiary stock at the next lower tier, the S2 share is not a loss share. Thus, this paragraph (d) does not apply with respect to that transfer. However, S2, S3, and S4 have attribute reduction amounts that tiered down from S1 and that are applied to reduce attributes under this paragraph (d).
(A)
Tier down of S1's attribute reduction amount to S2.
Under the general rules of this paragraph (d), S2's $17.50 tier-down attribute reduction amount is allocated and applied to reduce S2's basis in Asset 2 from $75 to $57.50.
(B)
Tier down of S1's attribute reduction amount to S3.
Under the general rules of this paragraph (d), S3's $52.50 tier-down attribute reduction amount is allocated and applied to reduce S3's basis in Asset 3 from $75 to $22.50.
(C)
Tier down of S1's attribute reduction amount to S4, application of conforming limitation.
Under the general rules of this paragraph (d), S4's $70 tier-down attribute reduction amount is allocated to, and would be applied to reduce, S4's basis in Asset 4. However, under paragraph (d)(5)(v)(B) of this section, the reduction is limited to the excess of S4's $80 net inside attribute amount over the $30 basis of the S4 share (after reduction under this paragraph (d)). As a result, only $50 (the excess of $80 over $30) of S4's $70 attribute reduction amount is applied to S4's basis in Asset 4, reducing it from $80 to $30. The $20 unapplied portion of S4's tier-down attribute reduction amount subject to the conforming limitation is disregarded and has no further effect.
(vii)
Application of basis restoration rule.
Under paragraph (d)(5)(vi)(A) of this section, after this paragraph (d) has been applied with respect to all transfers of subsidiary stock, any reduction made to the basis of a share of lower-tier subsidiary stock under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section is reversed to the extent necessary to conform the basis of that share to the share's allocable portion of the subsidiary's net inside attribute amount. Restoration adjustments are first made at the lowest tier and then at each next higher tier successively.
(A)
Basis restoration at lowest tier.
The basis of the S2 share was not reduced under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section and so there is no restoration of any basis in the S2 share. S3's $22.50 net inside attribute amount (after reduction under this paragraph (d)) exceeds S1's $7.50 basis in the S3 share (after reduction under this paragraph (d)) by $15. To conform S1's basis in the S3 share to S3's net inside attribute amount, the $52.50 reduction to the basis of the S3 share under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section is reversed by $15 (restoring S1's basis in the S3 share to $22.50). The restoration of S1's basis in the S3 share does not tier up to affect the basis in stock of any other subsidiary. S1's $30 basis in the S4 share (after reduction under this paragraph (d)) is already conformed with S4's $30 net inside attribute amount (after reduction under this paragraph (d)) and so there is no restoration of any basis in the S4 share.
(B)
Basis restoration at next higher tier.
Each share of S1 stock has an allocable portion of S1's net inside attribute amount (after reduction) equal to $10.25 (1/10 × $102.50, the sum of S1's $0 basis in the S2 stock, adjusted for the $50 gain recognized with respect to the share, S1's $22.50 basis in the S3 stock (after restoration), and S1's $30 basis in the S4 stock). Neither S's basis in S1 share 1 nor S's basis in S1 share 2 was reduced under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section. Accordingly, there is no restoration of any basis in either S1 share 1 or share 2. However, S's basis in each of S1 share 3 through share 10 was reduced under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section by $10, from $20 to $10. Accordingly, the $10 reduction to the basis of each of those shares is reversed to the extent of $.25, to restore the basis of each such share to $10.25 (its allocable portion of S1's net inside attribute amount).
(viii)
Results.
After the application of this section, P recognizes a loss of $360 on the sale of the S share, S recognizes a loss of $150 on the sale of S1 share 1, and S1 recognizes a $50 gain on the sale of the S2 share. Immediately after the transaction, the entities each directly own the following:

Predecessors, successors.
This section applies to predecessor or successor persons, groups, and assets to the extent necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section.
(2)
Adjustments for prior transactions that altered stock basis or other attributes.
In certain situations, M's basis in S stock or S's attributes may be adjusted in a manner that alters the relationship between stock basis and inside attributes and prevents that relationship from identifying the extent to which stock basis reflects unrecognized gain and duplicated loss. The provisions of this paragraph (e)(2) modify the computations in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section to adjust for the effects of such adjustments.
(i)
Prior reductions to S's basis in assets or other attributes pursuant to section 362(e)(2)(A).
If M transferred loss property to S in an intercompany transaction subject to section 362(e)(2) (for example, if the transfer was prior to September 17, 2008, no election was made to apply § 1.1502-80(h), and, as a result, S's attributes were reduced under section 362(e)(2)), then the disconformity amount of the S shares received in the section 362(e)(2) transaction is reduced by the amount that the basis in such shares would have been reduced under section 362(e)(2)(C) had such an election been made. In addition, for purposes of determining the attribute reduction amount under paragraph (d) of this section resulting from the transfer of any S shares received (or deemed received) in such a transfer, and for purposes of applying paragraph (d)(5)(v)(B) of this section (conforming limitation) to S, the bases in such shares is treated as reduced by the amount the bases in such shares would have been reduced under section 362(e)(2)(C) had such an election been made.
(ii)
Prior reductions to the basis of any share of S stock pursuant to an election under section 362(e)(2)(C).
If M transferred loss property to S in an intercompany transaction subject to section 362(e)(2) and the basis of any share of S stock was reduced as the result of an election under section 362(e)(2)(C) (including in the hands of a predecessor, to the extent that the effect of the election remains reflected in the basis of the S stock), then, for purposes of computing either any S share's disconformity amount or S's aggregate inside loss, and for purposes of applying paragraph (d)(5)(vi)(A) of this section (stock basis restoration) to S, S's net inside attribute amount is treated as reduced by the amount that S's attributes would have been reduced under section 362(e)(2)(A) in the absence of an election under section 362(e)(2)(C). Notwithstanding the general rule of this paragraph (e)(2)(ii), no reduction will be required to the extent that the group can establish that the net loss in the S shares transferred by M is no longer reflected in S's net inside attributes.
(iii)
Other adjustments.
Appropriate adjustments will be made in any other case in which an adjustment to S's net inside attributes or to M's basis in a share of S stock alters the relationship between such amounts, and the adjustment does not relate to the extent to which loss reflected in M's basis in S stock is noneconomic or duplicated within the meaning of this section.
(3)
Special rules for subsidiary stock transferred in an intercompany transaction
—(i)
In general.
This section applies with respect to M's transfer of a share of S stock to another member in an intercompany transaction in which M's intercompany item is deferred under § 1.1502-13 (and to any subsequent transfer of that share by a member) as of the time M's intercompany item is taken into account under § 1.1502-13. In determining the application of this section, all transferor-members are treated as divisions of a single corporation. Appropriate adjustments will be made to the intercompany item(s), any member's basis in an S share, to S's attributes, or any combination thereof, to further the purposes of this section and § 1.1502-13.
(ii)
Certain prior intercompany transactions.
If M transferred a share of S stock to another member before September 17, 2008 and M's intercompany item related to the transfer is taken into account on or after September 17, 2008, P may elect to apply this paragraph (e)(3) to the transfer. The election is made in the manner provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.
(iii)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (e)(3) is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1. Intercompany sale with duplicated loss.
(i)
Buying member later sells at gain.
(A)
Facts.
M owns the sole outstanding share of stock of S with a basis of $100. S has one asset with a basis of $100. M sells the S share to M1 for $70, recognizing a loss of $30. While owned by M1, S recognizes $10 of depreciation deductions that are absorbed by the group. S's basis in the asset is reduced by $10 (from $100 to $90), and M1's basis in the S stock is reduced under § 1.1502-32 by $10 (from $70 to $60). Later, M1 sells the S share to X, an unrelated person, for $80.
(B)
Analysis.
M's sale of its S share to M1 is a transfer of the share, but this section applies as of the time M's intercompany item is taken into account under § 1.1502-13, as if M and M1 were divisions of a single corporation. If M and M1 were divisions of a single corporation, the S share's basis would be $90 ($100 reduced by $10 for the depreciation deductions absorbed by the group) and the group would recognize a $10 loss on the sale of the share that is potentially subject to this section. Thus, the sale would be a transfer of a loss share (to the extent of $10) and would be subject to this section (to the extent of that $10). Although the transfer would be subject to this section, there would be no adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section (S has only one share outstanding and so there is no disparity in bases of common shares and no unrecognized gain or loss with respect to preferred) or under paragraph (c) of this section (S has no net positive adjustment). Thus, after the application of paragraph (c) of this section, the share would still be a loss share and would therefore be subject to paragraph (d) of this section. Under paragraph (d) of this section, S would be subject to $10 of attribute reduction (the lesser of the $10 net stock loss and S's $10 aggregate inside loss), allocable to the basis in S's asset. Accordingly, S's basis in its asset is reduced by $10, from $90 to $80, M takes its $30 intercompany stock loss into account, and M1 recognizes a $20 stock gain.
(ii)
Selling member deconsolidates.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i)(A) of this
Example 1,
except that M1 does not sell the S share and M ceases to be a member of the group when the value of the S share is $80. Under § 1.1502-13, M's deconsolidation causes M's intercompany loss to be taken into account and this section applies at that time. At the time that M deconsolidates, if M and M1 were divisions of a single corporation, the basis in the S share would be $90 ($100 reduced by $10 for the depreciation deductions absorbed by the group) and the group would recognize a $10 loss on the sale of the share that is potentially subject to this section. Such a sale would be a transfer of a loss share (to the extent of $10) and would be subject to this section (to the extent of that $10). The analysis is then the same as in paragraph (i)(B) of this
Example 1.
As a result, S's basis in its asset is reduced from $90 to $80, M takes its $30 intercompany stock loss into account, and M1 holds the S stock with a basis of $60 (and an unrecognized gain of $20).
(iii)
M1 sells the S share at a loss.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i)(A) of this
Example 1,
except that S declines in value and M1 sells the S share to X for $50, realizing a $10 loss. In this case, if M and M1 were divisions of a single corporation, the share's basis would be $90 ($100 reduced by $10 for the depreciation deductions absorbed by the group) and the group would recognize a $40 loss on the sale of the share that is potentially subject to this section. Thus, the sale would be a transfer of a loss share (to the extent of $40) and would be subject to this section (to the extent of that $40). Although the transfer would be subject to this section, for the reasons set forth in paragraph (i)(B) of this
Example 1
, there would be no adjustment under either paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) of this section. Thus, after the application of paragraph (c), the share would still be a loss share and would therefore be subject to paragraph (d) of this section. Under paragraph (d) of this section, S would be subject to $40 of attribute reduction (the lesser of the $40 net
stock loss and S's $40 aggregate inside loss), allocable to the basis in S's asset. Accordingly, S's basis in its asset is reduced by $40, from $90 to $50, M takes its $30 intercompany stock loss into account, and M1 recognizes a $10 stock loss.

# Example 2. Intercompany sale of built-in gain stock.
(i)
Facts.
M owns the sole outstanding share of stock of S with a basis of $100. S's sole asset has a basis of $0. S sells its asset for $100 and recognizes a $100 gain that increases M's basis in its S share under § 1.1502-32 to $200. M sells the S share to M1 for $100 and recognizes a $100 intercompany loss. Later, M1 sells the S share to X, an unrelated person, for $120.
(ii)
Analysis.
M's sale of the S share to M1 is a transfer of the share, but this section applies as of the time M's intercompany item is taken into account under § 1.1502-13, as if M and M1 were divisions of a single corporation. If M and M1 were divisions of a single corporation, the S share's basis would be $200 ($100 increased by $100 for the gain recognized on the sale of the asset) and the group would recognize an $80 loss on the sale of the share that is potentially subject to this section. Thus, the sale would be a transfer of a loss share (to the extent of $80) and would be subject to this section (to the extent of that $80). Although the transfer would be subject to this section, there would be no adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section (S has only one share outstanding and so there is no disparity in bases of common shares and no unrecognized gain or loss with respect to preferred). Thus, after the application of paragraph (b), the share would still be a loss share and would therefore be subject to paragraph (c) of this section. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the basis in the S share would be reduced, but not below its $120 value, by the lesser of the $100 disconformity amount and the $100 net positive adjustment that was applied to the share when held by M. Accordingly, the basis in the S share would be reduced by $80, to $120. Because the S share would not be a loss share after the application of paragraph (c) of this section, paragraph (d) of this section would not apply to the transfer. As a result, because the positive adjustment was applied to the share when held by M, M's intercompany item is adjusted to reflect what it would have been had M's basis in its S share been reduced by $80 immediately before its sale to M1. Thus, M's intercompany loss is reduced to $20 and M takes this loss into account, and M1 recognizes a gain of $20.

# Example 3. Intercompany sale creates built-in gain stock.
(i)
Facts.
M owns the sole outstanding share of stock of S with a basis of $0. S's sole asset has a basis of $0. M sells the S share to M1 for $100 and recognizes a $100 intercompany gain. While owned by M1, S sells its asset for $100, recognizing a $100 gain that increases M1's basis in the S share under § 1.1502-32 to $200. Later, M1 sells the S share to X for $120.
(ii)
Analysis.
M's sale of its S share to M1 is a transfer of the share, but this section applies as of the time M's intercompany item is taken into account under § 1.1502-13, as if M and M1 were divisions of a single corporation. If M and M1 were divisions of a single corporation, the S share's basis would be $100 ($0 increased by $100 for the gain recognized on the sale of the asset) and the group would recognize a $20 gain on the sale of the share. Thus, the sale would not be a transfer of a loss share and this section would not apply to the transfer. Accordingly, under this paragraph (e)(3), no portion of M1's $80 loss is subject to this section. M takes its $100 intercompany stock gain into account, and M1 recognizes an $80 loss.

# Example 4. Disparate bases in members' shares.
(i)
Facts.
M holds Share A, one of the two outstanding shares of S stock, with a basis of $50 and M1 holds Share B, the other outstanding share of S stock with a basis of $0. S has $50 cash and an asset with a basis of $0. S sells the asset for $50, recognizing a $50 gain that increases M's basis in its S share under § 1.1502-32 by $25 (from $50 to $75) and increases M1's basis under § 1.1502-32 by $25 (from $0 to $25). Later, M sells its Share A to M1 for $50 and recognizes a $25 intercompany loss. Later, M1 sells both S shares to X for $100.
(ii)
Analysis.
M's sale of its Share A to M1 is a transfer of the share, but this section applies as of the time M's intercompany item is taken into account under § 1.1502-13, as if M and M1 were divisions of a single corporation. If M and M1 were divisions of a single corporation, the basis of Share A would be $75 ($50 increased by $25 for its share of the gain recognized on the sale of the asset), the basis of Share B would be $25, and the group would recognize a $25 loss on the sale of Share A that is potentially subject to this section and a $25 gain on the sale of Share B. Thus, the sale would be a transfer of a loss share (to the extent of $25) and would be subject to this section (to the extent of that $25). Although the transfer is subject to this section, there would be no adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section (all S shares held by members are transferred to a nonmember in one taxable transaction). Thus, after the application of paragraph (b), Share A would still be a loss share and therefore subject to paragraph (c) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(7) of this section, the basis of Share A would be treated as reduced by the gain recognized and taken into account with respect to the transfer of Share B in the same transaction, and so Share A would not be a loss share for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section. Although the share would be a loss share after the application of paragraph (c) of this section, no adjustment would be required under paragraph
(d) of this section because there would be no net stock loss in the transaction. Because no adjustment would be made under this section if M and M1 were divisions of a single corporation, M takes its $25 intercompany stock loss into account and M1 recognizes a gain of $25. Alternatively, if the group elects to apply paragraph (b) of this section, M's intercompany item would be adjusted to reflect what it would have been had the $25 investment adjustment applied to Share A been reallocated to Share B, and M1's basis in Share B would be increased by that amount. If so, M's $25 intercompany loss would be reduced to zero, M1's basis in Share B would be increased from $25 to $50, and there would be no gain or loss recognized on either share.

# Example 5. Subsidiary with built-in gain and built-in loss assets.
(i)
Facts.
M owns the sole outstanding share of stock of S with a basis of $100. S has two assets, Asset 1 with a basis of $0 and Asset 2 with a basis of $80. M sells the S share to M1 for $90 and recognizes a $10 intercompany loss. While owned by M1, S sells Asset 1 for $60, recognizing a $60 gain that increases M1's basis in the S share under § 1.1502-32 to $150. Later, M1 sells the S share to X for $90.
(ii)
Analysis.
M's sale of the S share to M1 is a transfer of the share, but this section applies as of the time M's intercompany item is taken into account under § 1.1502-13, as if M and M1 were divisions of a single corporation. If M and M1 were divisions of a single corporation, the S share's basis would be $160 ($100 increased by $60 for the gain recognized on the sale of Asset 1) and the group would recognize a $70 loss on the sale of the share that is potentially subject to this section. Thus, the sale would be a transfer of a loss share (to the extent of $70) and would be subject to this section (to the extent of that $70). Although the transfer is subject to this section, there would be no adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section (S has only one share outstanding and so there is no disparity in bases of common shares and no unrecognized gain or loss with respect to preferred). Thus, after the application of paragraph (b), the share would still be a loss share and would therefore be subject to paragraph (c) of this section. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the basis in the S share would be reduced, but not below its $90 value, by the lesser of the $20 disconformity amount ($160 stock basis over $140 net inside attribute amount) and the $60 net positive adjustment that was applied to the share when held by M1. Accordingly, the basis in the S share would be reduced by $20, to $140. Because the S share would still be a loss share after the application of paragraph (c) of this section, paragraph (d) of this section would apply to the transfer. Under paragraph (d) of this section, S would have an attribute reduction amount of $50, the lesser of the $50 net stock loss ($140 basis over $90 value) and S's $50 aggregate inside loss (the excess of the sum of S's $80 basis in Asset 2 and S's $60 cash from the sale of Asset 1, over the $90 value of the S share). The adjustments required under this section are applied as follows: because the positive adjustment was applied to the share when held by M1, the $20 basis reduction required under paragraph (c) of this section is applied to M1's basis in its S share immediately before its sale to X, reducing it from $150 to $130. In addition, pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, S's basis in Asset 2 is reduced by $50, from $80 to $30. M takes its $10 intercompany stock loss into account and M1 recognizes a loss of $40.
(iii)
Allocation of basis reduction.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 5,
except that, while S is held by M, S earns $30 (consuming a portion of Asset 1) and, while S is held by M1, S earns $20 (consuming a portion of Asset 1) and sells Asset 1 for $10. Thus, M's basis in the S share immediately before the sale to M1 is $130, and M recognizes a $40 intercompany stock loss, and M1's basis in the S share immediately before the sale to X is $120. The analysis regarding the application of this section is the same as in paragraph (ii) of this
Example 5.
On a separate entity basis, M's basis in the S share would be subject to a $20 reduction under paragraph (c) of this section (at the time M transferred the S share the share had a $30 net positive adjustment and a $20 disconformity amount), and M1's basis in the S share would not be subject to reduction under paragraph (c) of this section (at the time M1 transferred the S share the share had a $30 net positive adjustment and a $20 negative disconformity amount). Therefore, the $20 basis reduction required under paragraph (c) of this section is allocated entirely to M. Accordingly, M's intercompany item is adjusted to reflect what it would have been had the entire $20 basis reduction been applied to the S share while held by M, and M1's basis in the S share is not reduced. Thus, M's intercompany stock loss is reduced by $20 to $20 and M takes this loss into account, and M1 recognizes a $30 loss. S's basis in Asset 2 is reduced by $50, from $80 to $30.
(4)
Limited application to multiple-member section 332 liquidations.
If more than one member owns shares of S stock, paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section do not apply to any transfer of S shares resulting from a liquidation of S to which section 332 applies.
(5)
Form and manner of election(s) under this section.
The elections provided in this section are irrevocable and made in the form of a statement titled “Section 1.1502-36 Statement.” The statement must be included on or

(f)
Definitions.
In addition to the definitions in other paragraphs of this section and in other provisions of the regulations under section 1502, the following definitions apply for purposes of this section.
(1)
Allocable portion
has the same meaning as in § 1.1502-32(b)(4)(iii)(B). Thus, for example, within a class of stock, each share has the same allocable portion of the net inside attribute amount and, if there is more than one class of stock, the net inside attribute amount is allocated to each class by taking into account the terms of each class and all other facts and circumstances relating to the overall economic arrangement.
(2)
Deferred deduction
means any deduction for expenses or loss that would be taken into account under general tax accounting principles as of the time of the transfer of the share, but that is nevertheless not taken into account immediately after the transfer by reason of the application of a deferral provision. Such provisions include, for example, sections 163(j), 267(f), and 469, and § 1.1502-13. “Deferred deduction” also includes S's portion of such consolidated tax attributes, for example consolidated excess charitable contributions that would be apportioned to S under the principles of § 1.1502-79(e) if S had a separate return year. Additionally, it includes amounts equivalent to deductions, such as negative adjustments under section 475 (mark to market accounting method for dealers in securities) and section 481 (adjustments required by changes in method of accounting).
(3)
Distribution
has the same meaning as in § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(v).
(4)
Higher-tier, lower-tier.
A subsidiary (S1) (and its shares of stock) is “higher-tier” with respect to another subsidiary (S2) (and its shares of stock) if investment adjustments made to the bases of shares of S2 stock under § 1.1502-32 affect the investment adjustments made to the bases of shares of S1 stock. A subsidiary (S1) (and its shares of stock) is “lower-tier” with respect to another subsidiary (S) (and its shares of stock) if investment adjustments made to the bases of shares of S1 stock affect the investment adjustments made to the bases of shares of S stock. The term
lowest-tier subsidiary
generally refers to a subsidiary that owns no stock of another subsidiary. The term
highest-tier subsidiary
generally refers to a subsidiary the stock of which is not lower tier to any shares transferred in the transaction.
(5)
Liability
means a liability that has been incurred within the meaning of section 461(h), except to the extent otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section.
(6)
Loss carryover
means any net operating or capital loss carryover that is attributable to S, including any losses that would be apportioned to S under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2) if S had a separate return year. However, solely for purposes of applying paragraph (d) of this section, loss carryovers do not include the amount of any losses waived under § 1.1502-32(b)(4).
(7)
Loss share, gain share.
A
loss share
is a share of stock with a basis that exceeds its value. A
gain share
is a share of stock with a value that exceeds its basis.
(8)
Preferred stock, common stock. Preferred stock
and
common stock
have the same meanings as in § 1.1502-32(d)(2) and (3), respectively.
(9)
Transaction
includes all the steps taken pursuant to the same plan or arrangement.
(10)
Transfer
—(i)
Definition.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(10)(ii) of this section, for purposes of this section, M transfers a share of S stock on the earliest of—
(A) The date that M ceases to own the share as a result of a transaction in which, but for the application of this section (and notwithstanding the deferral of any amount recognized on the transfer, other than by reason of § 1.1502-13), M would recognize income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to the share (see paragraph (e)(3) of this section in the case of a transfer in an intercompany transaction);
(B) The date that M and S cease to be members of the same group;
(C) The date that a nonmember acquires the share from M; and
(D) The last day of the taxable year during which the share becomes worthless under section 165 (taking into account the provisions of § 1.1502-80(c)) if the share is treated as a capital asset, or the date the share becomes worthless (taking into account the provisions of § 1.1502-80(c)) if the share is not treated as a capital asset.
(ii)
Excluded transactions.
Notwithstanding paragraph (f)(10)(i) of this section, M does not transfer a share of S stock if—
(A) M ceases to own the share as a result of a transaction to which section 381(a) applies and in which either a member acquires assets from S or S acquires assets from M, provided that—
(
1
) M recognizes no income, gain, loss, or deduction with respect to the share, and
(
2
) If the transaction is a liquidation to which section 332 applies, M is the only member that owns shares of S stock (if another member owns shares of S stock, see paragraph (e)(4) of this section for a limitation on the application of this section); or
(B) M ceases to own the share as a result of a distribution of the share to a nonmember in a transaction to which section 355 applies, and in which the share is treated as qualified property for purposes of section 355(c) or section 361(c).
(11)
Value
means the amount realized, if any, or otherwise the fair market value.
(g)
Anti-abuse rule
—(1)
General rule.
If a taxpayer acts with a view to avoid the purposes of this section or to apply the rules of this section to avoid the purposes of any other rule of law, appropriate adjustments will be made to carry out the purposes of this section or such other rule of law.
(2)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of the anti-abuse rule in this paragraph (g). No implication is intended regarding the potential applicability of any other anti-abuse rules:

# Example 1. Loss Trafficking.
(i)
Facts.
M purchases the sole outstanding share of S stock for $100. At that time, S owns Asset 1 with a basis of $0. S sells Asset 1 for $100. Later, S purchases the sole outstanding share of X stock, a corporation with losses, with a view to liquidating X in a transaction to which section 332 applies in order to reduce S's disconformity amount. S purchases the X share for $1, and X has a $100 NOL and an asset with a basis of $1. Subsequently, M sells its S share for $100. After taking into account the effects of all applicable rules of law, M's basis in the S share is $200 (M's original $100 basis, increased under § 1.1502-32 to reflect the $100 gain recognized on the sale of Asset 1). M's sale of the S share is a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to this section.
(ii)
Analysis.
Although M's transfer of the S share is subject to this section, there is no adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section (S has only one share outstanding and so there is no disparity in bases of common shares and no shares of S preferred stock outstanding (and so there is no unrecognized gain or loss on S preferred stock)). See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. Accordingly, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, M's sale of the S share is still a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to paragraph (c) of this section. Under paragraph (c) of this section, M's $200 basis in the S share is reduced, but not below the share's $100 value, by the lesser of the share's net positive adjustment and disconformity amount. The share's net positive adjustment is $100, the positive adjustment attributable to the gain recognized on the sale of Asset 1. The share's disconformity amount is $0, the excess of M's $200 basis in the S share over S's $200 net inside attribute amount. Thus, the reduction to basis under paragraph (c) of this section would be $0. However, because S purchased the X stock and liquidated X with a view to avoiding the purposes of this section (by using X's attributes to minimize the disconformity amount of the S share), the attributes acquired from X are disregarded for purposes of applying this section. Accordingly, S's net inside attribute amount is limited to the $100 of attributes S would have had absent the purchase of the X stock, S's money ($100 from the sale of Asset 1). The loss share's disconformity amount is therefore the excess of $200 over $100, or $100. The
lesser of the share's $100 net positive adjustment and $100 disconformity amount is $100. As a result, M's $200 basis in the S share is reduced by $100, to $100, and M recognizes no gain or loss on the sale of the S share.

# Example 2. Use of a partnership to prevent current attribute reduction.
(i)
Facts.
M owns all 5 outstanding shares of S common stock with a basis of $200 each. S owns Asset 1 with a basis of $1000. In year 1, with a view to preventing a current reduction in the basis of Asset 1, S contributes Asset 1 to a partnership in a transaction in which S recognizes no gain or loss. On December 31, year 2, M sells one S share for $20. After taking into account the effects of all applicable rules of law, M's basis in each S share is $200. M's sale of the S share is a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to this section.
(ii)
Analysis.
Although M's transfer of the S share is subject to this section, there is no basis redetermination under paragraph (b) of this section because there is no disparity among M's bases in its shares of S common stock and there are no shares of S preferred stock outstanding (and so there is no unrecognized gain or loss on S preferred stock). See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. Accordingly, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, M's sale of the S share is still a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to paragraph (c) of this section. However, no adjustment is required under paragraph (c) of this section because both the disconformity amount and the net positive adjustment are $0. See paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Under paragraph (d) of this section, S's attribute reduction amount is $180 (the lesser of the $180 net stock loss and S's $900 aggregate inside loss ($1000 of attributes over $100 value of all of the S shares)). Absent the application of this paragraph (g), the $180 attribute reduction amount would be applied to reduce S's basis in the partnership interest. However, because S acted with a view to avoiding a current reduction in the basis of Asset 1 under paragraph (d) of this section, this section is applied by treating S as if it held Asset 1 at the time of the stock sale. The basis of Asset 1 is reduced by $180, to $820, effective immediately before the transfer to the partnership and, as a result, S's basis in its partnership interest is $820.

# Example 3. Creation of an intercompany receivable to mitigate attribute reduction.
(i)
Facts.
M owns all five outstanding shares of S common stock each with equal basis that exceeds value. S holds cash and Asset 1 with a basis that exceeds value. In year 1, with a view to mitigating a reduction in the basis of Asset 1, S lends the cash to M1. Asset 1 and the intercompany note received from M1 are assets of the same class under § 1.338-6(b)(2). On December 31, year 2, M sells one of its S shares and, without regard to this section, recognizes a loss. M's sale of the S share is a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to this section.
(ii)
Analysis.
Although M's transfer of the S share is subject to this section, no adjustment is required under paragraph (b) of this section because there is no disparity among M's bases in shares of S common stock and there are no shares of S preferred stock outstanding (and so there is no unrecognized gain or loss on S preferred stock). See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. Accordingly, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, M's sale of the S shares is still a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to paragraph (c) of this section. However, there is no adjustment under paragraph (c) of this section because the net positive adjustment is $0. See paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Under paragraph (d) of this section, S's attribute reduction amount would be applied to reduce S's basis in Asset 1 and the intercompany receivable in proportion to basis. However, because S acted with a view to mitigating the reduction in the basis of Asset 1 under paragraph (d) of this section, this section is applied without regard to the intercompany receivable. Accordingly, S's basis in Asset 1 is reduced by the full attribute reduction amount.

# Example 4. Use of a partnership to reduce net stock loss.
(i)
Facts.
M owns all ten outstanding shares of S common stock, one share (Share 1) has a basis of $0, and one share (Share 2) has a basis of $160. S has an aggregate inside loss of $80. In one transaction and with a view to mitigating a reduction in S's attributes, M contributes Share 1 to a partnership, recognizing no gain or loss, and sells Share 2 for $80. M's contribution of Share 1 to the partnership is a transfer, but the share is not a loss share and so the transfer is not subject to this section. M's sale of Share 2 is a transfer of a loss share and is therefore subject to this section.
(ii)
Analysis.
Although M's transfer of Share 2 is subject to this section, there is no adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section because there are no investment adjustments that have been applied to the shares. Accordingly, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, M's sale of Share 2 is still a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to paragraph (c) of this section. There is no adjustment under paragraph (c) of this section because the net positive adjustment is $0. See paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Accordingly, after the application of paragraph (c) of this section, M's sale of Share 2 is still a transfer of loss shares and therefore subject to paragraph (d) of this section. Under paragraph (d) of this section, the net stock loss would be determined to be $0, the excess of the $160 aggregate basis in all of the transferred shares over the $160 aggregate value of those shares. S's attribute reduction amount would be determined to be $0, the lesser of the $0 net stock loss and S's
$80 aggregate inside loss. Thus, there would be no reduction of attributes under this paragraph (d) of this section. However, because M acted with a view to reducing the attribute reduction amount by transferring a gain share to a partnership while avoiding the recognition of the gain on the share, this section is applied without regard to the transfer of the gain share. Accordingly, the net stock loss is determined to be $80, and the attribute reduction amount is determined to be $80.

# Example 5. Stuffing gain asset.
(i)
Facts.
M owns the sole outstanding share of S stock (Share 1) with a basis of $100. S owns Asset 1 with a basis of $100 and a value of $20. With a view to avoid the purposes of this section, M transfers Asset 2 with a basis of $0 and a value of $80 to S in exchange for four additional shares of S stock (Share 2 through Share 5) in a transaction to which section 351 applies. M later sells Share 1 to X for $20. M's sale of Share 1 is a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to this section.
(ii)
Analysis.
Although M's transfer of the Share 1 is subject to this section, there is no adjustment under paragraph (b) of this section because no investment adjustments have been applied to the basis of any S shares. Thus, after the application of paragraph (b) of this section, M's sale of the S share is still a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to paragraph (c) of this section. There is no adjustment under paragraph (c) of this section because the net positive adjustment is $0. Accordingly, after the application of paragraph (c) of this section, M's sale of the S share is still a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to paragraph (d) of this section. Under paragraph (d) of this section, S's attribute reduction amount would be $0, the lesser of the $80 net stock loss and S's $0 aggregate inside loss ($100 of attributes does not exceed the $100 value of all of the S shares). However, because M transferred Asset 2 to S with a view to avoid the purposes of this section, the application of this section to M's transfer of Share 1 is made without regard to the transfer of Asset 2. Accordingly, under paragraph (d) of this section, S's attribute reduction amount is $80, the lesser of the $80 net stock loss and S's $80 aggregate inside loss (computed without regard to Asset 2). S's basis in Asset 1 is therefore reduced by $80, from $100 to $20, under paragraph (d) of this section.
(iii)
Transfer of all S shares.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 5,
except that M sells all five S shares to X, recognizing both the gain and the loss on the S shares. The transfer of Share 1 is still a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to this section. However, because all the shares are transferred, the group's income is clearly reflected. Therefore, the purposes of this section are not avoided and this section applies without modification. S's attribute reduction amount is $0, the lesser of the $0 net stock loss and S's $0 aggregate inside loss.
(h)
Applicability date
—(1)
In general.
This section applies to transfers of shares of subsidiary stock on or after September 17, 2008 unless the transfer was made pursuant to a binding agreement that was in effect prior to September 17, 2008 and at all times thereafter. For transfers of shares of subsidiary stock that are not subject to this section, see §§ 1.337(d)-2 and 1.1502-35.
(2)
Definition in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
Paragraph (f)(2) of this section applies to taxable years beginning on or after November 13, 2020. For taxable years beginning before November 13, 2020, see § 1.1502-36 as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2019. However, taxpayers and their related parties, within the meaning of sections 267(b) and 707(b)(1), may choose to apply the rules of this section to a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and before November 13, 2020, so long as the taxpayers and their related parties consistently apply the rules of this section, the section 163(j) regulations (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(37)), and, if applicable, §§ 1.263A-9, 1.263A-15, 1.381(c)(20)-1, 1.382-1, 1.382-2, 1.382-5, 1.382-6, 1.382-7, 1.383-0, 1.383-1, 1.469-9, 1.469-11, 1.704-1, 1.882-5, 1.1362-3, 1.1368-1, 1.1377-1, 1.1502-13, 1.1502-21, 1.1502-79, 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-99 (to the extent they effectuate the rules of §§ 1.382-2, 1.382-5, 1.382-6, 1.382-7, and 1.383-1), and 1.1504-4, to that taxable year.
[T.D. 9424, 73 FR 53952, Sept. 17, 2008, as amended at 73 FR 62204, Oct. 20, 2008; 73 FR 65982, Nov. 6, 2008; T.D. 9905, 85 FR 56843, Sept. 14, 2020]

# Special Taxes and Taxpayers
§ 1.1502-43
Consolidated accumulated earnings tax.
(a)
Group subject to tax
—(1)
General rule.
For a group filing a consolidated return for the taxable year, the accumulated earnings tax under section 531 is imposed on consolidated accumulated taxable income (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section). This tax applies to any group that is formed or
availed of to avoid or prevent the imposition of the individual income tax on the shareholders of either any of its members or any other corporation by permitting earnings and profits to accumulate instead of dividing or distributing them. Section 531 and this section do not apply to a group that is treated as a “personal holding company” under section 542(a)(1) as a result of the application of section 542(b)(1). Special rules are provided in this section for other groups which include one or more personal holding companies.
(2)
Evidence of purpose to avoid income tax.
(i) Under section 533(a), the fact that the group's earnings and profits are permitted to accumulate beyond the reasonable needs of its business is determinative of the purpose to avoid the income tax with respect to shareholders, unless the group by the preponderance of the evidence proves to the contrary.
(ii) The fact that a group is a mere holding or investment group is prima facie evidence of the group's purpose to avoid the income tax with respect to the shareholders. The activities of a member which is a personal holding company are not taken into account in determining if the group is a mere holding or investment group.
(3)
Earnings and profits.
For purposes of this paragraph (a) and paragraph (d) of this section, the following rules apply:
(i) If no member of the group is a personal holding company, the group's earnings and profits are the aggregate of the earnings and profits (or deficit) of each corporation that is a member at the close of the taxable year, determined in accordance with § 1.1502-33.
(ii) Earnings and profits resulting from the application of § 1.1502-33(b) are not taken into account.
(iii) Earnings and profits resulting from the disposition of a member's stock are determined without regard to the stock basis adjustments under §§ 1.1502-32 and 1.1502-33(c)(1).
(4)
Reasonable needs of the business.
The reasonable needs of the group's business include the reasonable needs of the business of any corporation (other than a personal holding company) that is a member at the close of the taxable year. Thus, the earnings and profits of one member may be accumulated with respect to the reasonable business needs of another member. If under § 1.537-3(b) the business of a nonmember corporation is considered the business of a member, then the earnings and profits of any member may be accumulated with respect to such nonmember's reasonable business needs.
(5)
Burden of proof.
The notification described in section 534(b) and the statement described in section 534(c) are made to or by the common parent corporation in accordance with § 1.1502-77.
(b)
Consolidated accumulated taxable income
—(1)
In general.
“Consolidated accumulated taxable income” is the group's consolidated taxable income determined under § 1.1502-11 adjusted in the manner provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, minus the sum of—
(i) The consolidated dividends paid deduction determined under paragraph (c) of this section and
(ii) The consolidated accumulated earnings credit determined under paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Adjustments to consolidated taxable income.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, consolidated taxable income is adjusted as follows:
(i) Under section 535(b)(1), the deduction for taxes is the excess of—
(A) The consolidated liability for tax determined without § 1.1502-2(a)(2) through (4), and without the foreign tax credit provided by section 27, over
(B) The consolidated foreign tax credit determined pursuant to § 1.1502-4. Foreign taxes deductible under § 1.535-2(a)(2) are also allowed as a deduction under section 535(b)(1).
(ii) The consolidated charitable contributions deduction under § 1.1502-24 does not apply. Under section 535(b)(2), there shall be allowed the aggregate charitable contributions of the members allowable under section 170, determined without section 170 (b)(2) and (d)(2).
(iii) Under section 535(b)(3), the deduction determined under § 1.1502-26 is not allowed.
(iv) Under section 535(b)(4), the consolidated net operating loss deduction
described in § 1.1502-21(a) is not allowed.
(v) Under section 535(b)(5), there is allowed as a deduction the consolidated net capital loss, determined under § 1.1502-22(a).
(vi) Under section 535(b)(6), there is allowed as a deduction an amount equal to—
(A) The consolidated capital gain net income for the taxable year (determined under § 1.1502-22(a) and without the consolidated net capital loss carryovers and carrybacks to the taxable year), minus
(B) The taxes attributable to such gain.
(vii) Under section 535(b)(7), the consolidated net capital loss carryovers and carrybacks are not allowed.
See
§ 1.1502-22(b).
(viii) Section 1.1502-15 does not apply.
(3)
Personal holding company a member.
If a member is a personal holding company for the taxable year—
(i) [Reserved]
(ii) In applying paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, consolidated liability for tax (as determined under that paragraph (b)(2)(i)) is reduced by the portion thereof allocable to that member under section 1552(a) (1), (2), (3), or (4) (or § 1.1502-33(d)), whichever is applicable. The consolidated foreign tax credit is computed by excluding the taxable income and any foreign taxes paid or accrued by that member, and foreign taxes deductible under § 1.535-2(a)(2) do not include foreign taxes attributable to that member.
(c)
Consolidated dividends paid deduction
—(1)
General rule.
For purposes of this section, the consolidated dividends paid deduction is the aggregate of the members' deductions under section 561(a) (1) and (2). This deduction is determined by excluding deductions for dividends paid to other members.
(2)
Exception for certain personal holding companies.
[Reserved]
(3)
Dividends paid defined.
For purposes of this paragraph (c), “dividends paid” and “dividend (or portion thereof) paid” include amounts treated as dividends paid during the taxable year under sections 562(b)(1), 563, and 565 (relating respectively to liquidating distributions, dividends paid after year end, and consent dividends).
(4)
Examples.
This paragraph (c) can be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporations P and S constitute an affiliated group which files a consolidated return on a calendar year basis for 1984 and 1985. P owns all of S's stock and two individuals own all of P's stock. Neither member of the group is a personal holding company for 1984. Assume that on December 15, 1984, S pays a dividend (as defined in section 316 (a)) of $2,000 to P, and P pays a dividend (as so defined) of $3,000 on January 15, 1985, to its individual shareholders. All dividends are paid in cash and are pro rata with no preference as to any shares or class of stock. For purposes of this paragraph (c), the consolidated dividends paid deduction for 1984 is $3,000,
i.e.,
the dividend paid on January 15, 1985, by P to its nonmember shareholders. See section 563 (a). The $2,000 dividend paid by S to P is not taken into account in computing the consolidated dividends paid deduction.

(2)
Special rule if a consolidated group is part of a controlled group.
If a consolidated group is treated collectively as being one component member of a controlled group, or if each member of a consolidated group is treated as being a separate component member of a controlled group, see section 1561 for determining the portion of the accumulated earnings credit to be allocated to such group or to such members.
(e)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to any consolidated Federal income tax return due (without extensions) on or after December 21, 2009.
[T.D. 7937, 49 FR 3462, Jan. 27, 1984, as amended by T.D. 8560, 59 FR 41674, Aug. 15, 1994; T.D. 8677, 61 FR 33324, June 27, 1996; T.D. 8560, 62 FR 12098, Mar. 14, 1997; T.D. 8823, 64 FR 36100, July 2, 1999; T.D. 9304, 71 FR 76907, Dec. 22, 2006; T.D. 9476, 74 FR 68532, Dec. 28, 2009; T.D. 9885, 84 FR 67039, Dec. 6, 2019; T.D. 10018, 89 FR 106872, Dec. 30, 2024]
§ 1.1502-44
Percentage depletion for independent producers and royalty owners.
(a)
In general.
The sum of the percentage depletion deductions for the taxable year for all oil or gas property owned by all members, plus any carryovers under section 613A(d)(1) or paragraph (d) of this section from a
prior taxable year, may not exceed 65 percent of the group's adjusted consolidated taxable income (under paragraph (b) of this section) for the consolidated return year.
(b)
Adjusted consolidated taxable income.
For purposes of this section, adjusted consolidated taxable income is an amount (not less than zero) equal to the group's consolidated taxable income determined without—
(1) Any depletion with respect to an oil or gas property (other than a gas property with respect to which the depletion allowance for all production is determined pursuant to section 613A(b)) for which percentage depletion would exceed cost depletion in the absence of the depletable quantity limitations contained in section 613A(c)(1) and (6) and the consolidated taxable income limitation contained in paragraph (a) of this section;
(2) Any consolidated net operating loss carryback to the consolidated return year under § 1.1502-21; and
(3) Any consolidated net capital loss carryback to the consolidated return year under § 1.1502-22.
(c)
Allocation to oil and gas properties.
The maximum amount allowable as a deduction under section 613A(c), after the application of paragraph (a) of this section, is allocated to properties held by members in accordance with the regulations under section 613A(d). Those regulations provide for an initial allocation and possible reallocation of the maximum allowable percentage depletion deduction among oil and gas properties. Thus, if, after the initial allocation, cost depletion exceeds the percentage depletion that would be allowable for a particular oil or gas property, cost depletion must be used for that property and the maximum amount of percentage depletion allowable as a deduction for the group is reallocated among only the remaining properties held by all members.
(d)
Carryover for disallowed amounts.
(1) If any amount is disallowed as a deduction for the taxable year by reason of section 613A(d)(1) or paragraph (a) of this section, the disallowed amount for each oil or gas property is treated as an amount allowed as a deduction under section 613A(c), for the following taxable year for the member that owned the property, in accordance with the regulations under section 613A and paragraphs (a) and (d)(2) of this section.
(2) Any amount that was disallowed as a deduction in a separate return limitation year of a member may be carried to a consolidated return year only to the extent that 65 percent of the excess determined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section exceeds the sum of the otherwise allowable percentage depletion deductions for the member's oil and gas properties for the year.
(3) The excess determined in this subparagraph (3) for a member is the excess, if any, of adjusted consolidated taxable income for the year under paragraph (b) of this section over that income recomputed by excluding the items of income and deductions of the member.
(e)
Effective date.
This section applies to taxable years for which the due date (without extensions) for filing returns is after September 30, 1980.
[T.D. 7725, 45 FR 65561, Oct. 3, 1980, as amended by T.D. 8677, 61 FR 33324, June 27, 1996; T.D. 8823, 64 FR 36100, July 2, 1999; T.D. 10018, 89 FR 106872, Dec. 30, 2024]
§ 1.1502-45
Limitation on losses to amount at risk.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Scope.
This section applies to a loss of any subsidiary if the common parent's stock meets the stock ownership requirement described in section 465(a)(1)(B).
(2)
Limitation on use of losses.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, a loss from an activity of a subsidiary during a consolidated return year is includible in the computation of consolidated taxable income (or consolidated net operating loss) and consolidated capital gain net income (or consolidated net capital loss) only to the extent the loss does not exceed the amount that the parent is at risk in the activity at the close of that subsidiary's taxable year. In addition, the sum of a subsidiary's losses from all its activities is includible only to the extent that the parent is at risk in the subsidiary at the close of that year. Any excess may not be taken into account for the consolidated return year
but will be treated as a deduction allocable to that activity of the subsidiary in the first succeeding taxable year.
(3)
Amount parent is at risk in subsidiary's activity.
The amount the parent is at risk in an activity of a subsidiary is the lesser of the amount the parent is at risk in the subsidiary, or the amount the subsidiary is at risk in the activity. These amounts are determined under paragraph (b) of this section and the principles of section 465.
See
section 465 and the regulations thereunder and the examples in paragraph (e) of this section.
(4)
Excluded activities.
The limitation on the use of losses in paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not apply to a loss attributable to an activity described in section 465(c)(4).
(5)
Substance over form.
Any transaction or arrangement between members (or between a member and a person that is not a member) which does not cause the parent to be economically at risk in an activity of a subsidiary will be treated in accordance with the substance of the transaction or arrangement notwithstanding any other provision of this section.
(b)
Rules for determining amount at risk
—(1)
Excluded amounts.
The amount a parent is at risk in an activity of a subsidiary at the close of the subsidiary's taxable year does not include any amount that would not be taken into account under section 465 were the subsidiary not a separate corporation. Thus, for example, if the amount a parent is at risk in the activity of a subsidiary is attributable to nonrecourse financing, the amount at risk is not more than the fair market value of the property (other than the subsidiary's stock or debt or assets) pledged as security.
(2)
Guarantees.
If a parent guarantees a loan by a person other than a member to a subsidiary, the loan increases the amount the parent is at risk in the activity of the subsidiary.
(c)
Application of section 465.
This section applies in a manner consistent with the provisions of section 465. Thus, for example, the recapture of losses provided in section 465(e) applies if the amount the parent is at risk in the activity of a subsidiary is reduced below zero.
(d)
Other consolidated return provisions unaffected.
This section limits only the extent to which losses of a subsidiary may be used in a consolidated return year. This section does not apply for other purposes, such as §§ 1.1502-32 and 1.1502-19, relating to investment in stock of a subsidiary and excess loss accounts, respectively. Thus, a loss which reduces a subsidiary's earnings and profits in a consolidated return year, but is disallowed as a deduction for the year by reason of this section, may nonetheless result in a negative adjustment to the basis of an owning member's stock in the subsidiary or create (or increase) an excess loss account.
(e)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the examples in this paragraph (e). In each example, the stock ownership requirement of section 465(a)(1)(B) is met for the stock of the parent (P), and each affiliated group files a consolidated return on a calendar year basis and comprises only the members described.
(1)
Example 1.
In 2022, P forms S with a contribution of $200 in exchange for all of S's stock. During the year, S borrows $400 from a commercial lender and P guarantees $100 of the loan. S uses $500 of its funds to acquire a motion picture film. S incurs a loss of $120 for the year with respect to the film. At the close of 2022, the amount P is at risk in S's activity is $300 ($200 contribution plus $100 guarantee). If S has no gain or loss in 2023, and there are no contributions from or distributions to P, at the close of 2023 P's amount at risk in S's activity will be $180.
(2)
Example 2.
P forms S-1 with a capital contribution of $1 on January 1, 2023. On February 1, 2023. S-1 borrows $100 with full recourse and contributes all $101 to its newly formed subsidiary S-2. S-2 uses the proceeds to explore for natural oil and gas resources. S-2 incurs neither gain nor loss from its explorations during the taxable year. As of December 31, 2023, P is at risk in the exploration activity of S-2 only to the extent of $1.
(f)
Applicability date.
This section applies to consolidated return years for which the due date of the income tax
return (without regard to extensions) is after December 30, 2024.
[T.D. 10018, 89 FR 106872, Dec. 30, 2024]
§ 1.1502-47
Consolidated returns by life-nonlife groups.
(a)
Scope
—(1)
In general.
Under section 1504(b)(2), insurance companies that are taxed under section 801 (relating to life insurance companies) are not treated as includible corporations for purposes of determining under section 1504(a) the existence of an affiliated group and the composition of its membership. Section 1504(c)(2) provides an election whereby certain life insurance companies may be treated as includible corporations, and thus members, of a group composed of other includible corporations. This section provides regulations for the making of this election and for the determination of an electing group's composition, its consolidated taxable income (or loss), and its consolidated tax liability.
(2)
General method of consolidation
—(i)
Subgroup method.
The regulations adopt a subgroup method to determine consolidated taxable income. One subgroup is the group's nonlife companies. The other subgroup is the group's life insurance companies. Initially, the nonlife subgroup computes nonlife consolidated taxable income and the life subgroup computes consolidated LICTI. A subgroup's income may in effect be reduced by a loss of the other subgroup, subject to the limitations in sections 172 and 1503(c). The life subgroup losses consist of life consolidated net operating loss, consolidated operations loss carryovers from taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018 (consolidated operations loss carryovers), and life consolidated net capital loss. The nonlife subgroup losses consist of nonlife consolidated net operating loss and nonlife consolidated net capital loss. Consolidated taxable income is therefore defined in pertinent part as the sum of nonlife consolidated taxable income and consolidated LICTI, reduced by life subgroup losses and/or nonlife subgroup losses.
(ii)
Subgroup loss.
A subgroup loss does not actually affect the computation of nonlife consolidated taxable income or consolidated LICTI. It merely constitutes a bottom-line adjustment in reaching consolidated taxable income. Furthermore, the amount of a subgroup's loss, if any, that is eligible to be carried back to a prior taxable year first must be carried back against income of the same subgroup before it may be used as a setoff against the other subgroup's income in the taxable year the loss arose. (See sections 172(b)(1) and 1503(c)(1); see also § 1.1502-21(b).) The carryback of losses from one subgroup may not be used to offset income of the other subgroup in the year to which the loss is to be carried. This carryback of one subgroup's loss may “bump” the other subgroup's loss that, in effect, previously reduced the income of the first subgroup. The subgroup's loss that is bumped in appropriate cases may, in effect, reduce a succeeding year's income of either subgroup. This approach gives the group the tax savings of the use of losses, but the bumping rule assures that, insofar as possible, life deductions will be matched against life income and nonlife deductions against nonlife income.
(iii)
Carryover of subgroup loss.
A subgroup's loss may be used in a succeeding year, but in any particular succeeding year the loss must be used to reduce the income of the same subgroup before it may be used as a setoff against the other subgroup's income.
(3)
Other provisions.
The provisions of the consolidated return regulations apply unless this section provides otherwise. Further, unless otherwise indicated in this section, a term used in this section has the same meaning as in sections 801-848.
(b)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section:
(1)
Life company.
The term
life company
means a life insurance company as defined in section 816 and subject to tax under section 801. Section 816 applies to each company separately.
(2) Nonlife
insurance company.
The term
nonlife insurance company
has the meaning provided in § 1.1502-1(k).
(3)
Life insurance company taxable income.
The term
life insurance company taxable income
or
LICTI
has the meaning provided in section 801(b).
(4)
Group.
The term
group
has the meaning provided in § 1.1502-1(a). Unless otherwise indicated in this section,
a group's composition is determined without regard to section 1504(b)(2).
(5)
Member.
The term
member
has the meaning provided in § 1.1502-1(b). A life company is tentatively treated as a member for any taxable year for purposes of determining if it is an eligible corporation under paragraph (b)(12) of this section and, therefore, if it is an includible corporation under section 1504(c)(2). If such a company is eligible and includible (under section 1504(c)(2)), it will actually be treated as a member of the group.
(6)
Life member.
A life member is a member of the group that is a life company.
(7)
Nonlife member.
A nonlife member is a member of the group that is not a life company.
(8)
Life subgroup.
A life subgroup is composed of those members that are life members. If the group has only one life member, it constitutes a life subgroup.
(9)
Nonlife subgroup.
A nonlife subgroup is composed of those members that are nonlife members. If the group has only one nonlife member, it constitutes a nonlife subgroup.
(10)
Separate return year.
The term
separate return year
has the meaning provided in § 1.1502-1(e). For purposes of this paragraph (b)(10), the term
group
is defined with regard to section 1504(b)(2) for years in which an election under section 1504(c)(2) is not in effect. Thus, a separate return year includes a taxable year for which that election is not in effect.
(11)
Separate return limitation year.
Section 1.1502-1(f)(2) provides exceptions to the definition of the term separate return limitation year. For purposes of applying those exceptions to this section, the term
group
is defined without regard to section 1504(b)(2), and the definition in this paragraph (b)(11) applies separately to the nonlife subgroup in determining nonlife consolidated taxable income under paragraph (f) of this section and to the life subgroup in determining consolidated LICTI under paragraph (g) of this section. Paragraph (h)(3)(ix) of this section defines the term separate return limitation year for purposes of determining whether the losses of one subgroup may be used against the income of the other subgroup.
(12)
Eligible corporations
—(i)
In general.
A corporation is an eligible corporation for a taxable year of a group only if, throughout every day of the base period the corporation:
(A) Was in existence and a member of the group determined without the exclusions in section 1504(b)(2) (see paragraphs (b)(12) (iii) through (vi) of this section),
(B) Was engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business (“active business”),
(C) Did not experience a change in tax character (see paragraph (b)(12)(vii) of this section), and
(D) Did not undergo disproportionate asset acquisitions (see paragraph (b)(12)(viii) of this section).
(ii)
Base period.
The base period consists of the common parent's five taxable years immediately preceding the group's taxable year for which the consolidated return and the determination of eligibility are made. Eligibility is determined for each consolidated return year beginning with the first year for which the election under section 1504(c)(2) is effective.
(iii)
In existence.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(12) (v) and (vi) of this section, a corporation organized after the base period begins is not eligible even though it is a member of the group immediately after its organization. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(12)(iii), a corporation that was a party to a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(F) shall be treated as the same entity both before and after the reorganization.
(iv)
Membership period.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(12) (v) and (vi) of this section, a corporation must have been a member of the group throughout the base period to be eligible. Thus, an ineligible corporation includes one whose stock was acquired from outside the group at any time during the base period or one which was a member of a different group (whether by application of reverse acquisition rules in § 1.1502-75(d)(3) or otherwise) at any time during the base period. For purposes of this subdivision (iv), the common parent of a group is treated as constituting a group (and
hence is a member) during any period when it was not a member of an affiliated group within the meaning of section 1504(a) (applied without section 1504(b)(2)).
(v)
Tacking rule.
The period during which an old corporation is in existence and a member of the group engaged in active business is included in (or tacks onto) the period for the new corporation if the following four conditions listed in this paragraph (b)(12)(v) are met. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(12)(v), a new corporation is a corporation (whether or not newly organized) during the period its eligibility depends upon the tacking rule. The four conditions are as follows—
(A) The first condition is that, at any time, 80 percent or more of the new corporation's assets it acquired (other than in the ordinary course of its trade or business) were acquired from the old corporation in one or more transactions described in section 351(a) or 381(a). This asset test is applied by using the fair market values of assets on the date they were acquired and without regard to liabilities. Assets acquired in the ordinary course of business will be excluded from total assets only if they were acquired after the new corporation became a member of the group (determined without section 1504(b)(2)). In addition, assets that the old corporation acquired from outside the group in transactions not conducted in the ordinary course of its trade or business are not included in the 80 percent (but are included in total assets) if the old corporation acquired those assets within five calendar years before the date of their transfer to the new corporation.
(B) The second condition is that at the end of the taxable year during which the first condition is first met, the old corporation and the new corporation must both have the same tax character. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(12), a corporation's tax character is the section under which it would be taxed (for example, section 11, section 801, or section 831) if it filed a separate return. If the old corporation is not in existence (or adopts a plan of complete liquidation) at the end of that taxable year, this paragraph (b)(12)(v)(B) will apply to the old corporation's taxable year immediately preceding the beginning of the taxable year during which the first condition is first met.
(C) The third condition is that, at the end of the taxable year during which the first condition is first met, the new corporation does not undergo a disproportionate asset acquisition under paragraph (b)(12)(viii) of this section.
(D) The fourth condition is that, if there is more than one old corporation, the first two conditions apply to all of the corporations. Thus, the second condition (tax character) must be met by all of the old corporations transferring assets taken into account in meeting the test in paragraph (b)(12)(v)(A) of this section.
(vi)
Old group remaining in existence.
If the common parent of a group (or a new common parent) became the common parent in a transaction described in § 1.1502-75 (d)(2) or (d)(3) where a group remained in existence, then paragraph (b)(12) (ii) through (iv) of this section apply by treating that common parent as if it were also the previous common parent of the group that remains in existence. If this paragraph (b)(12)(vi) applies to a transaction, the tacking rule in paragraph (b)(12)(v) of this section does not apply to the transaction.
(vii)
Change in tax character.
A corporation must not experience during the base period a change in tax character (as defined in paragraph (b)(12)(v)(B) of this section) if the change is attributable to an acquisition of assets from outside the group in transactions not conducted in the ordinary course of its trade or business. However, if a new corporation relies on the tacking rules in paragraph (b)(12)(v) of this section, this paragraph (b)(12)(vii) shall apply during the base period and the current consolidated return year even if the change in tax character is attributable to an asset acquisition from within the group.
(viii)
Disproportionate asset acquisition.
To be eligible, a corporation must not undergo during the base period disproportionate asset acquisitions which are attributable to an acquisition (or a series of acquisitions) of assets from outside the group in transactions not conducted in the ordinary course of its
trade or business (special acquisition). Whether special acquisitions are disproportionate is determined at the end of each base period. Whether an acquisition results in a disproportionate asset acquisition depends on all of the facts and circumstances including the following factors and rules:
(A) One factor is the portion of the insurance reserves (that is, total reserves in section 816(c), as modified by section 816(h)) of the acquiring company at the end of the base period which is attributable to special acquisitions.
(B) A second factor is the portion of the fair market value of the assets (without reduction for liabilities) of the acquiring company at the end of the base period that is attributable to special acquisitions.
(C) A third factor is the portion of the premiums generated during the last taxable year of the base period which are attributable to special acquisitions.
(D) A corporation will not experience a disproportionate asset acquisition unless 75 percent of one factor (whether or not listed in this paragraph (b)(12)(viii)) is attributable to special acquisitions.
(E) Money or other property contributed to a corporation by a shareholder that is not a member of the group (without section 1504(b)(2)) is not a special acquisition.
(F) If a new corporation relies on the tacking rules in paragraph (b)(12)(v) of this section, this paragraph (b)(12)(viii) applies to that corporation during a consolidated return year. Thus, if at any time during a consolidated return year, a new corporation undergoes a disproportionate asset acquisition, the corporation becomes ineligible at that time.
(13)
Ineligible corporation.
A corporation that is not an eligible corporation is ineligible. If a life company is ineligible, it is not treated under section 1504(c)(2) as an includible corporation. Losses of a nonlife member arising in years when it is ineligible may not be used under section 1503(c)(2) and paragraph (g) of this section to set off the income of a life member. If a life company is ineligible and is the common parent of the group (without regard to section 1504(b)(2)), the election under section 1504(c)(2) may not be made.
(14)
Examples
The following examples illustrate this paragraph (b). In each example, L indicates a life company, another letter indicates a nonlife company, and each corporation uses the calendar year as its taxable year.

P has owned all of the stock of S since 2012. On January 1, 2018, P purchased all of the stock of L
1
which owns all of the stock of L
2
and S
2
. L
1
and L
2
are treated as members for purposes of determining if they are eligible for 2020. However, for 2020, L
1
, L
2
, and S
2
are ineligible because none of them has been a member of the group for P's five taxable years preceding 2020. For 2020, L
1
and L
2
may elect to file a consolidated return because they constitute an affiliated group under section 1504(c)(1), and P and S may file a consolidated return. S
2
must file its own separate return for 2020.
(ii)
Example 2.
Since 2012, L1 has been a life company owning all the stock of L2. In 2018, L1 transfers assets to S1, a new nonlife insurance company subject to taxation under section 831(a). For 2020, only L1 and L2 are eligible corporations. The tacking rule in paragraph (b)(12)(v) of this section does not apply in 2020 because the old corporation (L1) and the new corporation (S1) do not have the same tax character.
(iii)
Example 3.
Since 2012, L has owned all the stock of L
1,
which has owned all the stock of S
1
, a nonlife insurance company. L
1
writes some accident and health insurance business. In 2018, L
1
transfers this business, and S
1
transfers some of its business, to a new nonlife insurance company, S
2
, in a transaction described in section 351(a). The property transferred to S
2
by L
1
had a fair market value of $50 million. The property transferred by S
1
had a fair market value of $40 million. S
2
is ineligible for 2020 because the tacking rule in paragraph (b)(12)(v) of this section does not apply. The old corporations (L
1
and S
1
) and the new corporation (S
2
) do not all have the same tax character.
See
paragraph (b)(12)(v)(B) and (D) of this section. The result would be the same if L
1
transferred other property (for example, stock and securities) with the same value, rather
than accident and health insurance contracts, to S
2.
(iv)
Example 4.
Since 2012, P has owned all the stock of S and L
1
. L
1
is a large life company engaged in active business since 2012. On January 1, 2020, L
1
transfers in a section 351 (a) transaction assets (not acquired from outside the group) to a new life company, L
2
. For 2020, L
2
is eligible because under paragraph (b)(12)(v) of this section, L
2
is considered to have been in existence and a member of the group engaged in the active business since 2012 which is the period L
1
, the old corporation, was in existence and a member of the group so engaged.
(v)
Example 5.
The facts are the same as in example (4). Assume that the fair market value of the assets L
1
transferred to L
2
was $10 million on January 1, 2020 and that L
2
acquired no other assets prior to June 30, 2021. Assume further that on January 1, 2021, L
1
acquires (other than in the ordinary course of its trade or business) assets having a fair market value of $40 million from L
3
, an unrelated life company. On June 30, 2021, L
1
transfers those assets to L
2
. L
2
becomes ineligible on June 30, 2021. Since by fair market values, 80 percent (in other words, 40/50) of L
2
's assets are attributable to special acquisitions, L
2
has undergone a disproportionate asset acquisition at that time. See paragraph (b)(12)(viii)(B), (D), and (F) of this section.
(vi)
Example 6.
The facts are the same as in example (5) except that L
1
transfers assets (other than life insurance contracts) having a fair market value of $40 million to L
2
and L
2
purchases the assets of L
3
on June 30, 2021. the result of the 2021 acquisition is the same as in example (5).
(vii)
Example 7.
The facts are the same as in example (5) except the acquired assets acquired by L
2
in 2021 from L
1
have a fair market value of $20 million. In 2021, L
2
had $1 million of premiums on its pre-existing contracts but premiums generated by the acquired business for the entire year would have been $2 million. L
2
is eligible in 2021 because it did not experience a disproportionate asset acquisition on June 30, 2021.
(viii)
Example 8.
Since 2012, L, a State A corporation, has owned all of the stock of L
1
and S
1
. On January 1, 2020, L merges into L
3
, a smaller State B corporation, which owns the stock of S
2
. The transaction is a reverse acquisition described in § 1.1502-75(d)(3) and the group of which L was the common parent remains in existence. Under paragraph (b)(12)(vi) of this section, L
3
is eligible for 2020. However, S
2
is ineligible in 2020 under paragraph (b)(12)(iv) of this section.
(ix)
Example 9.
The facts are the same as in example (8) except that L acquires the stock of L
3
. L
3
and S
2
are both ineligible for 2020. On January 1, 2021, the fair market value of L
3
's assets are $5 million (without liabilities) and on that date L transfers assets (not acquired from outside the group) having a fair market value of $95 million (without liabilities) to L
3
. L and L
3
are life companies at the end of 2021. L
3
is eligible in 2021 under the tacking rule in paragraph (b)(12)(v) of this section. S
2
is ineligible in that year. The result would be the same if L
3
was not a life company prior to January 1, 2021. See paragraph (b)(12)(v)(B) of this section.
(x)
Example 10.
Since 2012, X, a foreign corporation, has owned all the stock of S
2
and S
1
, and S
1
has owned all of the stock of L
1
. On January 1, 2020, X incorporates a new U.S. company P, and transfers the stock of S
1
and S
2
to P. Assume that under § 1.1502-75(d)(3) (relating to reverse acquisitions), the S
1
-L
1
affiliated group remains in existence. Under paragraph (b)(12)(vi) of this section, P, S
1
, and L
1
are eligible but S
2
is ineligible. The result would be the same if X were an individual.
(xi)
Example 11.
The facts are the same as in
Example (10)
except that X owns all of the stock of S
1
, L
1
, and S
2
. In addition, on January 1, 2020, X transfers the stock of S
1
and S
2
to L
1
. L
1
is eligible in 2020 under paragraph (b)(12)(iv) of this section. L
1
would still be eligible even if it owned a subsidiary during the base period but sold the subsidiary prior to January 1, 2020. S
1
and S
2
are ineligible in 2020.
(xii)
Example 12.
Since 2012, S
1
has owned all of the stock of L
1
. S
2
, an unrelated company, has owned all of the stock of L
2
and S
3
for 10 years. S
1
and
S
2
are active nonlife insurance companies and not holding companies. On January 1, 2020, S
1
and S
2
merge into a new nonlife insurance company, S, in a transaction described in § 1.1502-75(d)(3) so that the group of which S
1
was the common parent remains in existence. S and L
1
are eligible in 2020 under paragraph (b)(12)(vi) of this section. L
2
and S
3
are ineligible.
(xiii)
Example 13.
The facts are the same as in
Example (12)
except that S
2
(the first corporation in § 1.1502-75(d)(3)) acquires the stock of S
1
in exchange for the stock of S
2
. The result is that only S
2
, S
1
, and L
1
are eligible in 2020.
(c)
Election
—(1)
In general.
The election under section 1504(c)(2) may not be made if the group's common parent is an ineligible life company. The election under section 1504(c)(2) may only be made by the common parent of the group (as defined in section 1504(c)(2) without the exclusions in section 1504(b)(2)). For example, assume that P owns all of the stock of L
1
, an eligible life company, which owns the stock of S
1
. Assume further that P also owns the stock of L
2
, an ineligible life member, which (for more than five years) has owned the stock of a nonlife company, S
2
. Only P may make the election and, if it does so, P, L
1
, and S
1
may file a consolidated return under this section. L
2
may not make the election under section 1504(c)(2) and may not file a consolidated return with S
2
.
(2)
How election is made
—(i)
General rule.
The election under section 1504(c)(2) is generally made by the group's common parent in the same manner (and it has the same effect) as the election to file a consolidated return is made under § 1.1502-75 (a) and (b) for a group which did not file a consolidated return for the immediately preceding taxable year. The procedure for making the election under section 1504(c)(2) is the same whether or not a consolidated return was filed by the life members or the nonlife members for the immediately preceding taxable year.
(ii)
Special rule.
Notwithstanding the general rule, however, if the nonlife members in the group filed a consolidated return for the immediately preceding taxable year and had executed and filed a Form 1122 (or successor form) that is effective for the preceding year, then such members will be treated as if they filed a Form 1122 (or successor form) when they join in the filing of a consolidated return under section 1504(c)(2) and they will be deemed to consent to the regulations under this section. However, an affiliation schedule (Form 851, or any successor form) must be filed by the group and the life members must execute a Form 1122 (or successor form) in the manner prescribed in § 1.1502-75(h)(2).
(3)
Irrevocability.
Except as provided in § 1.1502-75(c), the election under section 1504(c)(2) is irrevocable.
(4)
Cross reference.
If an election is made under section 1504(c)(2), see § 1.1502-75 (e) and (f) for rules that apply for not including (or including) a member or a nonmember in the consolidated return.
(d)
Effect of election.
If the common parent makes the election under section 1504(c)(2), the following rules apply:
(1)
Termination of group.
A mere election under section 1504(c)(2) will not cause the creation of a new group or the termination of an affiliated group that files a consolidated return in the immediately preceding taxable year.
(2)
Effect of eligibility.
If a life member is eligible after an election under section 1504(c)(2), it may not be included as a member of an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(c)(1).
(3)
Eligible and ineligible life companies.
If any life company was a member of an affiliated group of life companies (as defined in section 1504(c)(1)) but is ineligible for a taxable year for which the election under section 1504(c)(2) is effective, that year is not a separate return year merely by reason of the election under section 1504(c)(2) in applying §§ 1.1502-13 and 1.1502-19 to transactions occurring in prior consolidated return years of that affiliated group. In addition, if more than one ineligible life member of the group (as defined in section 1504(c)(1)) joined in the filing of a consolidated return in the taxable year immediately preceding the year for which the election under section
1504(c)(2) is effective and, solely as a result of the election, one of the ineligible life members becomes the common parent of such a group (section 1504(c)(1)), the group must continue to file a consolidated return. For example, assume that L
1
owns all of the stock of S
1
and all of the stock of L
2
. L
2
owns the stock of L
3
. L
1
, L
2
, and L
3
are life companies and S
1
is a nonlife company. Assume further that in 2019, L
1
, L
2
, and L
3
file a consolidated return but L
1
makes the election under section 1504(c)(2) for 2020 and L
2
and L
3
are ineligible. L
2
and L
3
must continue to file a consolidated return in 2020. Moreover, L
2
could elect in 2020 to file a consolidated return (section 1504(c)(1)) with L
3
even if they did not file a consolidated return in 2019 with L
1
.
(4)
Inclusion of life company.
If a life company is ineligible in the consolidated return year for which the election is effective, it will be treated as an includible corporation for the common parent's first taxable year in which the company becomes eligible.
(5)
Dividends received deduction
—(i)
Dividends received by an includible insurance company.
Dividends received by an includible member insurance company, taxed under either section 801 or section 831, from another includible member of the group are treated for Federal income tax purposes as if the group did not file a consolidated return. See sections 818(e)(2) and 805(a)(4) for rules regarding a member taxed under section 801, and see sections 832(g) and 832(b)(5)(B) through (E) for rules regarding a member taxed under section 831.
(ii)
Other dividends.
Dividends received from a life company member of the group that are not subject to paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section are not included in gross income of the distributee member. See section 1504(c)(2)(B)(i). If the distributee corporation is a nonlife insurance company subject to tax under section 831, the rules of section 832(b)(5)(B) through (E) apply.
(6)
Controlled group.
Sections 1563 (a)(4), (b)(2)(D), and (b)(3)(C) (insofar as it applies to corporations described in section 1563(b)(2)(D)) do not apply to any eligible or ineligible life company that is a member of the group for a taxable year during which the election is effective.
(7)
Consolidated tax.
The tax liability of a group for a consolidated return year (before application of credits against that tax) is computed on a consolidated basis by adding together the following taxes:
(i) The tax imposed under section 11 on consolidated taxable income (as determined under paragraph (e) of this section). The taxes imposed under sections 801(a) and 831(a) will each be treated as a tax imposed under section 11.
(ii) Any taxes described in § 1.1502-2 (other than in § 1.1502-2(a)(1), (a)(6), and (a)(7)).
(e)
Consolidated taxable income.
The consolidated taxable income is the sum of the following two amounts:
(1)
Nonlife consolidated taxable income.
The nonlife consolidated taxable income (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section) of the nonlife subgroup, as set off by the life subgroup losses as provided in paragraph (j) of this section. The amount in this paragraph (e)(1) may not be less than zero.
(2)
Consolidated LICTI.
The consolidated LICTI (as defined in paragraph (g)(1) of this section) of the life subgroup, as set off by the nonlife subgroup losses as provided in paragraph (h) of this section. The amount in this paragraph (e)(2) may not be less than zero.
(f)
Nonlife consolidated taxable income
—(1)
In general.
Nonlife consolidated taxable income is the consolidated taxable income of the nonlife subgroup, computed under § 1.1502-11 as modified by this paragraph (f). For this purpose, separate taxable income of a member includes insurance company taxable income (as defined in section 832).
(2)
Nonlife consolidated net operating loss deduction
—(i)
In general.
In applying § 1.1502-21, the rules in this paragraph (f)(2) apply in determining for the nonlife subgroup the nonlife net operating loss and the portion of the nonlife net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to the taxable year.
(ii)
Nonlife CNOL.
The nonlife consolidated net operating loss is determined under § 1.1502-21(e) by treating the nonlife subgroup as the group.
(iii)
Carrybacks.
The portion of the nonlife consolidated net operating loss for the nonlife subgroup described in paragraph (f)(2)(vi) of this section, if any, that is eligible to be carried back to prior taxable years under § 1.1502-21 is carried back to the appropriate years (whether consolidated or separate) before the nonlife consolidated net operating loss may be used as a nonlife subgroup loss under paragraphs (e)(2) and (h) of this section to set off consolidated LICTI in the year the loss arose. The election under section 172(b)(3) to relinquish the entire carryback period for the net operating loss of the nonlife subgroup may be made by the agent for the group within the meaning of § 1.1502-77.
(iv)
Subgroup rule.
In determining the portion of the nonlife consolidated net operating loss that is absorbed when the loss is carried back to a consolidated return year, § 1.1502-21 is applied by treating the nonlife subgroup as the group. Therefore, the absorption is determined without taking into account any life subgroup losses that were previously reported on a consolidated return as setting off nonlife consolidated taxable income for the year to which the nonlife subgroup loss is carried back.
(v)
Carryover.
The portion of the nonlife consolidated net operating loss that is not absorbed in a prior year as a carryback, or as a nonlife subgroup loss that set off consolidated LICTI for the year the loss arose, constitutes a nonlife carryover under this paragraph (f)(2) to reduce nonlife consolidated taxable income before that portion may constitute a nonlife subgroup loss that sets off consolidated LICTI for a particular year. For limitations on the use of nonlife carryovers to offset nonlife consolidated taxable income or consolidated LICTI, see § 1.1502-21.
(vi)
Portion of nonlife consolidated net operating loss that is carried back to prior taxable years.
The portion of the nonlife consolidated net operating loss that (absent an election to waive carrybacks) is carried back to the two preceding taxable years is the sum of the nonlife subgroup's farming loss (within the meaning of section 172(b)(1)(B)(ii)) and the amount of the subgroup's net operating loss that is attributable to nonlife insurance companies (as determined under § 1.1502-21). For rules governing the absorption of net operating loss carrybacks, including limitations on the amount of net operating loss carrybacks that may be absorbed in prior taxable years, see § 1.1502-21(b).
(vii)
Example.
P, a holding company that is not an insurance company, owns all of the stock of S, a nonlife insurance company, and L1, a life insurance company. L1 owns all of the stock of L2, a life insurance company. Both L1 and L2 satisfy the eligibility requirements of § 1.1502-47(b)(12). Each corporation uses the calendar year as its taxable year, and no corporation has incurred farming losses (within the meaning of section 172(b)(1)(B)(ii)). For 2021, the group first files a consolidated return for which the election under section 1504(c)(2) is effective. P and S filed consolidated returns for 2019 and 2020. In 2021, the P-S group sustains a nonlife consolidated net operating loss that is attributable entirely to S (see § 1.1502-21(b)). The election in 2021 under section 1504(c)(2) does not result under paragraph (d)(1) of this section in the creation of a new group or the termination of the P-S group. The loss is carried back to the consolidated return years 2019 and 2020 of P and S. Pursuant to § 1.1502-21(b), the loss may be used to offset S's income in 2019 and 2020 without limitation, and the loss may be used to offset P's income in those years, subject to the limitation in section 172(a) (see § 1.1502-21(b)). The portion of the loss not absorbed in 2019 and 2020 may serve as a nonlife subgroup loss in 2021 that may set off the consolidated LICTI of L1 and L2 under paragraphs (e)(2) and (h) of this section.
(3)
Nonlife consolidated capital gain net income or loss
—(i)
In general.
In applying § 1.1502-22, the rules in this paragraph (f)(3) apply in determining for the nonlife subgroup the nonlife consolidated capital gain net income or loss and the portion of the nonlife net capital loss carryovers and carrybacks to the taxable year. In particular, the nonlife consolidated capital gain net income and nonlife consolidated net capital loss are determined under the
principles of § 1.1502-22 by treating the nonlife subgroup as the group.
(ii)
Additional principles.
In applying § 1.1502-22 to nonlife consolidated net capital loss carryovers and carrybacks, the principles set forth in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) through (v) of this section for applying § 1.1502-21 to nonlife consolidated net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks also apply, without regard to the limitation in paragraph (f)(2)(vi) of this section.
(iii)
Special rules.
The nonlife consolidated net capital loss is reduced, for purposes of determining the carryovers and carrybacks under § 1.1502-22(b) by the lesser of:
(A) The aggregate of the additional capital loss deductions allowed under section 832(c)(5), or
(B) The nonlife consolidated taxable income computed without capital gains and losses.
(g)
Consolidated LICTI
—(1)
General rule.
Consolidated LICTI is the consolidated taxable income of the life subgroup, computed under § 1.1502-11 as modified by this paragraph (g).
(2)
Life consolidated net operating loss deduction
—(i)
In general.
In applying § 1.1502-21, the rules in this paragraph (g)(2) apply in determining for the life subgroup the life net operating loss and the portion of the life net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to the taxable year.
(ii)
Life CNOL.
The life consolidated net operating loss is determined under § 1.1502-21(e) by treating the life subgroup as the group.
(iii)
Carrybacks
—(A)
General rule.
The portion of the life consolidated net operating loss for the life subgroup, if any, that is eligible to be carried back under § 1.1502-21 is carried back to the appropriate years (whether consolidated or separate) before the life consolidated net operating loss may be used as a life subgroup loss under paragraphs (e)(1) and (j) of this section to set off nonlife consolidated taxable income in the year the loss arose. The election under section 172(b)(3) to relinquish the entire carryback period for the consolidated net operating loss of the life subgroup may be made by the agent for the group within the meaning of § 1.1502-77.
(B)
Special rule for life consolidated net operating losses arising in 2018, 2019, or 2020.
If a life consolidated net operating loss arising in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2021, is carried back to a life insurance company taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, then such life consolidated net operating loss is treated as an operations loss carryback (within the meaning of section 810, as in effect prior to its repeal) of such company to such taxable year.
(iv)
Subgroup rule.
In determining the portion of the life consolidated net operating loss that is absorbed when the loss is carried back to a consolidated return year, § 1.1502-21 is applied by treating the life subgroup as the group. Therefore, the absorption is determined without taking into account any nonlife subgroup losses that were previously reported on a consolidated return as setting off life consolidated taxable income for the year to which the life subgroup loss is carried back.
(v)
Carryovers.
The portion of the life consolidated net operating loss that is not absorbed in a prior year as a carryback, or as a life subgroup loss that set off nonlife consolidated taxable income for the year the loss arose, constitutes a life carryover under this paragraph (g)(2) to reduce consolidated LICTI before that portion may constitute a life subgroup loss that sets off nonlife consolidated taxable income for that particular year. For limitations on the use of life carryovers to offset nonlife consolidated taxable income or consolidated LICTI, see § 1.1502-21(b).
(3)
Life consolidated capital gain net income or loss
—(i) [Reserved].
(ii)
Life consolidated net capital loss carryovers and carrybacks.
The life consolidated net capital loss carryovers and carrybacks for the life subgroup are determined by applying the principles of § 1.1502-22 as modified by the following rules in this paragraph (g)(3)(ii):
(A) Life consolidated net capital loss is first carried back (or apportioned to the life members for separate return years) to be absorbed by life consolidated capital gain net income without regard to any nonlife subgroup capital losses and before the life consolidated
net capital loss may serve as a life subgroup capital loss that sets off nonlife consolidated capital gain net income in the year the life consolidated net capital loss arose.
(B) If a life consolidated net capital loss is not carried back or is not a life subgroup loss that sets off nonlife consolidated capital gain net income in the year the life consolidated net capital loss arose, then it is carried over to the particular year under this paragraph (g)(3)(ii) first against life consolidated capital gain net income before it may serve as a life subgroup capital loss that sets off nonlife consolidated capital gain net income in that particular year.
(h)
Consolidated LICTI setoff by nonlife subgroup losses
—(1)
In general.
The nonlife subgroup losses consist of the nonlife consolidated net operating loss and the nonlife consolidated net capital loss. Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, consolidated LICTI is set off by the amounts of these two consolidated losses specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. The setoff is subject to the rules and limitations in paragraph (h)(3) of this section.
(2)
Amount of setoff
—(i)
Current year.
Consolidated LICTI for the current taxable year is set off by the portion of the nonlife consolidated net operating loss and nonlife consolidated net capital loss arising in that year that cannot be carried back under paragraph (f) of this section to prior taxable years (whether consolidated or separate return years) of the nonlife subgroup.
(ii)
Carryovers.
The portion of the offsettable nonlife consolidated net operating loss or nonlife consolidated net capital loss that has not been used as a nonlife subgroup loss setoff against consolidated LICTI in the year it arose may be carried over to succeeding taxable years under the principles of § 1.1502-21 (relating to net operating loss deduction) or § 1.1502-22 (as appropriate) (relating to net capital loss carryovers). However, in any particular succeeding year, the losses will be used under paragraph (f) of this section in computing nonlife consolidated taxable income before being used in that year as a nonlife subgroup loss that sets off consolidated LICTI. Additionally, the amount of consolidated LICTI that may be offset by nonlife consolidated net operating loss carryovers may be subject to limitation (see section 172 and § 1.1502-21).
(3)
Nonlife subgroup loss rules and limitations.
The nonlife subgroup losses are subject to the following operating rules and limitations:
(i)
Separate return years.
The carryovers in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section may include net operating losses and net capital losses of the nonlife members arising in separate return years, that may be carried over to a succeeding year under the principles (including limitations) of §§ 1.1502-21 and 1.1502-22.
But see
paragraph (h)(3)(ix) of this section.
(ii)
Capital loss.
Nonlife consolidated net capital loss sets off consolidated LICTI only to the extent of life consolidated capital gain net income (as determined under paragraph (g)(3) of this section) and this setoff applies before any nonlife consolidated net operating loss sets off consolidated LICTI.
(iii)
Capital gain.
Life consolidated capital gain net income is zero in any taxable year in which the life subgroup has a life consolidated net operating loss and, in any taxable year, it may not exceed consolidated LICTI.
(iv)
Ordering rule.
Consolidated LICTI for a consolidated return year is set off by nonlife subgroup losses for that year before being set off (under paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section) by a carryover of a nonlife subgroup loss to that year. The amount of consolidated LICTI that may be offset by nonlife consolidated net operating loss carryovers may be subject to limitation (see section 172 and § 1.1502-21).
(v)
Setoff at bottom line.
The setoff of nonlife subgroup losses against consolidated LICTI does not affect life member deductions that depend in whole or in part on taxable income. Thus, the setoff does not affect the amount of consolidated LICTI for any for any taxable year but it merely constitutes an adjustment in arriving at the group's consolidated taxable income under paragraph (e) of this section.
(vi)
Ineligible nonlife member.
(A) The offsetable nonlife consolidated net operating loss that arises in any consolidated return year (that may be set off
against consolidated LICTI in the current taxable year or in a succeeding taxable year) is the amount computed under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section reduced by the ineligible NOL. For purposes of this paragraph (h)(3), the “ineligible NOL” is in the year the loss arose the amount of the separate net operating loss (determined under §§ 1.1502-21(b) of any nonlife member that is ineligible in that year (and not the portion of the nonlife consolidated net operating loss attributable under §§ 1.1502-21(b) to such a member).
(B) The carryovers of offsetable nonlife net operating losses under paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section do not include an ineligible NOL arising in a consolidated return year or a loss attributable to an ineligible member arising in a separate return year. See section 1503(c)(2). (C) For absorption within the nonlife subgroup of an ineligible NOL arising in a consolidated return year or a loss of an ineligible member arising in a separate return year which is not a separate return limitation year under paragraph (h)(3)(ix) of this section, see paragraph (h)(3)(vii) of this section.
(vii)
Absorption of ineligible NOL.
(A) If all or a portion of a nonlife member's ineligible NOL (determined under paragraph (h)(3)(vi)(A) of this section) may be carried back or carried over under paragraph (f)(2) of this section to a particular consolidated return year of the nonlife subgroup (absorption year), then notwithstanding § 1.1502-21(b), the amount carried to the absorption year will be absorbed by that member's contribution (to the extent thereof) to nonlife consolidated taxable income for that year, subject to the limitation in section 172(a).
(B) For purposes of paragraph (h)(3)(vii)(A) of this section, a member's contribution to nonlife consolidated taxable income for an absorption year is the amount of such income (computed without the portion of the nonlife consolidated net operating loss deduction attributable to taxable years subsequent to the year the loss arose), minus such consolidated taxable income recomputed by excluding both that member's items of income and deductions for the absorption year. The deductions of the member include the prior application of this paragraph (h)(3)(vii) to the absorption of the nonlife consolidated net operating loss deduction for losses arising in taxable years prior to the particular loss year.
(viii)
Election to relinquish carryback.
The offsetable nonlife consolidated net operating loss does not include the amount that could be carried back under paragraph (f)(2) of this section but for the election by the agent for the group (within the meaning of § 1.1502-77) under section 172(b)(3) to relinquish the carryback. See section 1503(c)(1).
(ix)
Separate return limitation year.
The offsetable nonlife consolidated net operating and capital loss carryovers do not include any losses attributable to a nonlife member that were sustained (A) in a separate return limitation year (determined without section 1504(b)(2)) of that member (or a predecessor), or (B) in a separate return year, in which an election was in effect under neither section 1504(c)(2) nor section 243(b)(3).
(x)
Percentage limitation.
The offsetable nonlife consolidated net operating losses that may be set off against consolidated LICTI in a particular year may not exceed a percentage limitation. This limitation is the applicable percentage in section 1503(c)(1) of the lesser of two amounts—
(A) The first amount is the sum of the offsetable nonlife consolidated net operating losses under paragraph (h)(2) of this section that may serve in the particular year (determined without this limitation) as a setoff against consolidated LICTI.
(B) The second amount is consolidated LICTI in the particular year reduced by any nonlife consolidated net capital loss that sets off consolidated LICTI in that year.
(xi)
Further limitation.
Any offsetable nonlife consolidated net operating loss remaining after applying the percentage limitation that is carried over to a succeeding taxable year may not be set off against the consolidated LICTI attributable to a life member that was not an eligible life member in the year the loss arose. See section 1503(c)(2).
(xii)
Restoration rule.
The carryback of a life consolidated net operating loss or life consolidated net capital loss
under paragraph (g) of this section that reduces consolidated LICTI (or life consolidated capital gain net income) for a prior year may reduce the amount of nonlife subgroup losses that would offset consolidated LICTI in that prior year. Thus, that amount may be carried over under paragraph (f)(2) or (3) of this section from that prior year in determining nonlife consolidated taxable income in a succeeding year or serve as offsetable nonlife subgroup losses in a succeeding year.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (h). In the examples, L indicates a life company, S is a nonlife insurance company, another letter indicates a nonlife company that is not an insurance company, no company has farming losses (within the meaning of section 172(b)(1)(B)(ii)), and each corporation uses the calendar year as its taxable year.
(i)
Example 1.
P owns all of the stock of L and S. S owns all of the stock of I, a nonlife member that is an ineligible corporation for 2021 under paragraph (b)(13) of this section. For 2021, the group elects under section 1504(c)(2) to file a consolidated return. For 2021, assume that any nonlife consolidated net operating loss may not be carried back to a prior taxable year. Other facts are summarized in the following table.
Separate taxable income (loss)
P
$100
S
(100)
I
(100)
Nonlife consolidated net operating loss
(100)
Under paragraph (h)(3)(vi) of this section, P's separate income is considered to absorb the loss of S, an eligible member, first and the offsetable nonlife consolidated net operating loss is zero, that is, the consolidated net operating loss ($100) reduced by I's loss ($100). The consolidated net operating loss ($100) may be carried over, but since it is entirely attributable to I (an ineligible member that is not a nonlife insurance company) its use is subject to the restrictions in paragraph (h)(3)(vi) of this section and section 172(a). The result would be the same if the group contained two additional members, S
1
, an eligible member, and I
1
, an ineligible member, where S
1
had a loss of ($100) and I
1
had income of $100.
(ii)
Example 2.
(A) The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section (
Example 1
), except that, for 2021, S's separate net operating loss is $200. Assume further that L's consolidated LICTI is $200. Under paragraph (h)(3)(vi) of this section, the offsetable nonlife consolidated net operating loss is $100 (the nonlife consolidated net operating loss computed under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section ($200), reduced by the separate net operating loss of I ($100)). The offsetable nonlife consolidated net operating loss that may be set off against consolidated LICTI in 2021 is $35 (35 percent of the lesser of the offsetable $100 or consolidated LICTI of $200).
See
section 1503(c)(1) and paragraph (h)(3)(x) of this section. S carries over a loss of $65, and I carries over a loss of $100, to 2022 under paragraph (f)(2) of this section to be used against nonlife consolidated taxable income (consolidated net operating loss ($200) less amount used in 2021 ($35)). Under paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section, the offsetable nonlife consolidated net operating loss that may be carried to 2022 is $65 ($100 minus $35). The facts and results are summarized in the following table.

Example 3.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section (
Example 2
), with the following additions for 2022. The nonlife subgroup has nonlife consolidated taxable income of $50 (all of which is attributable to I) before the nonlife consolidated net operating loss deduction under paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Consolidated LICTI is $100. Under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, $50 of the nonlife consolidated net operating loss carryover ($165) is used in 2022 and, under paragraph (h)(3)(vi) and (vii) of this section, the portion used in 2022 is attributable to I, the ineligible nonlife member. Accordingly, the offsetable nonlife consolidated net operating loss from 2021 under paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section is $65, the unused loss from 2021. The offsetable nonlife consolidated net operating loss in 2022 is $22.75 (35 percent of the lesser of the offsetable loss of $65 or consolidated LICTI of $100). Accordingly, under paragraph (e) of this section, consolidated taxable income is $77.25 (consolidated LICTI of $100 minus the offsetable loss of $22.75).
(iv)
Example 4.
P owns all of the stock of S and L. For 2021, all corporations are eligible corporations, and the group elects under section 1504(c)(2) to file a consolidated return, the nonlife consolidated net operating loss is $100, and the nonlife consolidated net capital loss is $50. Assume that the losses may not be carried back and the capital losses are not attributable to built-in deductions under paragraph (h)(3)(ix) of this section. Other facts and the results are set forth in the following table:
P-S
L
1. Nonlife consolidated net operating loss

Accordingly, under paragraph (e) of this section consolidated taxable income is $32.5, that is, line 3 minus line 5(c).
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Nonlife consolidated taxable income set off by life subgroup losses
—(1) In
general.
The life subgroup losses consist of the life consolidated net operating loss and consolidated operations loss carryovers and the life consolidated net capital loss. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, nonlife consolidated taxable income is set off by the amounts of these two consolidated losses specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, subject to the rules and limitations in paragraph (j)(3) of this section.
(2)
Amount of setoff.
The portion of the life consolidated net operating loss and consolidated operations loss carryovers or life consolidated net capital loss that may be set off against nonlife consolidated taxable income (determined under paragraph (f) of this section) is determined by applying the rules prescribed in paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section in the following manner:
(i) Substitute the term “life” for “nonlife”, and vice versa.
(ii) Substitute the term “nonlife consolidated taxable income” for “consolidated LICTI”, and vice versa.
(iii) Substitute the term “life consolidated net operating loss and consolidated operations loss carryovers” for “nonlife consolidated net operating loss”, and “paragraph (g)” for “paragraph (f)”.
(iv) Paragraphs (h)(3)(vi), (vii), (x), and (xi) of this section do not apply to a life consolidated net operating loss and consolidated operations loss carryovers.
(v) The setoff of life subgroup losses against nonlife consolidated taxable income does not affect nonlife member deductions that depend in whole or in part on taxable income.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (j). In the examples, L indicates a life company, S is a nonlife insurance company, another letter indicates a
nonlife company that is not an insurance company, no company has farming losses (within the meaning of section 172(b)(1)(B)(ii)), and each corporation uses the calendar year as its taxable year.
(i)
Example 1.
P, S, L1 and L2 constitute a group that elects under section 1504(c)(2) to file a consolidated return for 2021. In 2021, the nonlife subgroup consolidated taxable income is $100 and there is $20 of nonlife consolidated net capital loss that cannot be carried back under paragraph (f) of this section to taxable years (whether consolidated or separate) preceding 2021. The nonlife subgroup has no carryover from years prior to 2021. The life consolidated net operating loss is $150, which under paragraph (g) of this section includes life consolidated capital gain net income of $25. Since life consolidated capital gain net income is zero for 2021 (see paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section), the nonlife capital loss offset is zero (see paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section). However, $100 of life consolidated net operating loss sets off the $100 nonlife consolidated taxable income in 2021. The life subgroup carries under paragraph (g)(2) of this section to 2022 $50 of the life consolidated net operating loss ($150 minus $100). The $50 carryover will be used in 2022 (subject to the limitation in section 172(a)) against life subgroup income before it may be used in 2022 to setoff nonlife consolidated taxable income.
(ii)
Example 2.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this section, except that, for 2021, the nonlife consolidated taxable income is $150 (this amount is entirely attributable to S and includes nonlife consolidated capital gain net income of $50), consolidated LICTI is $200, and a life consolidated net capital loss is $50. The $50 life consolidated net capital loss sets off the $50 nonlife consolidated capital gain net income. Consolidated taxable income under paragraph (e) of this section is $300 (nonlife consolidated taxable income ($150) minus the setoff of the life consolidated net capital loss ($50), plus consolidated LICTI ($200)).
(iii)
Example 3.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(3)(ii) of this section, except that, for 2022, the nonlife consolidated net operating loss is $150. This entire amount is attributable to S; thus, it is eligible to be carried back to 2021 against nonlife consolidated taxable income under paragraph (f)(2) of this section and § 1.1502-21(b). If P, the agent for the group within the meaning of § 1.1502-77, does not elect to relinquish the carryback under section 172(b)(3), the entire $150 will be carried back, reducing 2021 nonlife consolidated taxable income to zero and nonlife consolidated capital gain net income to zero. Under paragraph (h)(3)(xii) of this section, the setoff in 2021 of the nonlife consolidated capital gain net income ($50) by the life consolidated net capital loss ($50) is restored. Accordingly, the 2021 life consolidated net capital loss may be carried over by the life subgroup to 2022. Under paragraph (e) of this section, after the carryback, consolidated taxable income for 2021 is $200 (nonlife consolidated taxable income ($0) plus consolidated LICTI ($200)).
(iv)
Example 4.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this section, except that P elects under section 172(b)(3) to relinquish the carryback of $150 arising in 2022. The setoff in Example 2 is not restored. However, the offsettable nonlife consolidated net operating loss for 2022 (or that may be carried over from 2022) is zero. See paragraph (h)(3)(viii) of this section. Nevertheless, the $150 nonlife consolidated net operating loss may be carried over to be used by the nonlife group.
(v)
Example 5.
P owns all of the stock of S1 and of L1. On January 1, 2017, L1 purchases all of the stock of L2. For 2021, the group elects under section 1504(c)(2) to file a consolidated return. For 2021, L1 is an eligible corporation under paragraph (b)(12) of this section but L2 is ineligible. Thus, L1 but not L2 is a member for 2021. For 2021, L2 sustains a net operating loss, which cannot be carried back (see section 172(b)). For 2021, L2 is treated under paragraph (d)(6) of this section as a member of a controlled group of corporations under section 1563 with P, S, and L1. For 2022, L2 is eligible and is included on the group's consolidated return. L2's net operating loss for 2021 that may be carried to 2022 is not treated under paragraph (b)(11) of this section as having been sustained in a separate return
limitation year for purposes of computing consolidated LICTI of the L1-L2 life subgroup for 2022. Furthermore, the portion of L2's net operating loss not used under paragraph (g)(2) of this section against life subgroup income in 2022 may be included in offsettable life consolidated net operating loss under paragraph (j)(2) and (h)(3)(i) of this section that reduces in 2022 nonlife consolidated taxable income (subject to the limitation in section 172(a)) because L2's loss in 2021 was not sustained in a separate return limitation year under paragraph (j)(2) and (h)(3)(ix)(A) of this section or in a separate return year (2021) when an election was in effect under neither section 1504(c)(2) nor section 243(b)(3).
(k)
Preemption.
The rules in this section preempt any inconsistent rules in other sections of the consolidated return regulations. For example, the rules in paragraph (h)(3)(vi) of this section apply notwithstanding § 1.1502-21.
(l)
Other consolidation principles.
The fact that this section treats the life and nonlife members as separate groups in computing, respectively, consolidated LICTI (or life consolidated net operating loss) and nonlife consolidated taxable income (or loss) does not affect the usual rules in the consolidated return regulations unless this section provides otherwise. Thus, the usual rules in § 1.1502-13 (relating to intercompany transactions) apply to both the life and nonlife members by treating them as members of one affiliated group.
(m)
Filing requirements
—(1)
In general.
To file a consolidated income tax return for a life-nonlife consolidated group, the common parent shall—
(i) File the applicable consolidated corporate income tax return: a Form 1120-L,
U.S. Life Insurance Company Income Tax Return,
where the common parent is a life insurance company; a Form 1120-PC,
U.S. Property and Casualty Insurance Company Income Tax Return,
where the common parent is an insurance company, other than a life insurance company; a Form 1120,
U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return,
where the common parent is any other type of corporation; or any successor form;
(ii) Indicate clearly on the face of this return that such corporate tax return is a life-nonlife return;
(iii) Show any set offs required by paragraphs (e), (h), and (j) of this section;
(iv) Report separately the nonlife consolidated taxable income or loss, determined under paragraph (f) of this section, on a Form 1120 or 1120-PC (or any successor forms) (whether filed by the common parent or as an attachment to the consolidated return), as the case may be, of all nonlife members of the consolidated group; and
(v) Report separately the consolidated Life Insurance Company Taxable Income or life consolidated net operating loss, on a Form 1120-L (or any successor form) (whether filed by the common parent or as an attachment to the consolidated return), of all life members of the consolidated group.
(2)
Cross reference.
See § 1.1502-75(j), regarding the inclusion in a corporate tax return of the required statements and schedules for subsidiaries.
(n)
Effective/applicability dates.
The rules of this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020. However, a taxpayer may choose to apply the rules of this section to taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2020. If a taxpayer makes the choice described in the previous sentence, the taxpayer must apply those rules in their entirety and consistently with the provisions of subchapter L of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to the years at issue.

§ 1.1502-50
Consolidated section 250.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Scope.
This section provides rules for applying section 250 and §§ 1.250-1 through 1.250(b)-6 (the
section 250 regulations
) to a member of a
consolidated group (
member
). Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules for the determination of the amount of the deduction allowed to a member under section 250(a)(1). Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules governing the impact of intercompany transactions on the determination of a member's qualified business asset investment (QBAI) and the effect of intercompany transactions on the determination of a member's foreign-derived deduction eligible income (FDDEI). Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules governing basis adjustments to member stock resulting from the application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Paragraph (e) of this section provides definitions. Paragraph (f) of this section provides examples illustrating the rules of this section. Paragraph (g) of this section provides an applicability date.
(2)
Overview.
The rules of this section ensure that the aggregate amount of deductions allowed under section 250 to members appropriately reflects the income, expenses, gains, losses, and property of all members. Paragraph (b) of this section allocates the consolidated group's overall deduction amount under section 250 to each member on the basis of its contribution to the consolidated foreign-derived deduction eligible income (consolidated FDDEI) and consolidated global intangible low-taxed income (consolidated GILTI). The definitions in paragraph (e) of this section provide for the aggregation of the deduction eligible income (DEI), FDDEI, deemed tangible income return, and global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of all members in order to calculate the consolidated group's overall deduction amount under section 250.
(b)
Allowance of deduction
—(1)
In general.
A member is allowed a deduction for a consolidated return year under section 250. See § 1.250(a)-1(b). The amount of the deduction is equal to the sum of—
(i) The product of the consolidated FDII deduction amount and the member's FDII deduction allocation ratio; and
(ii) The product of the consolidated GILTI deduction amount and the member's GILTI deduction allocation ratio.
(2)
Consolidated taxable income limitation.
For purposes of applying the limitation described in § 1.250(a)-1(b)(2) to the determination of the consolidated FDII deduction amount and the consolidated GILTI deduction amount of a consolidated group for a consolidated return year—
(i) The consolidated foreign-derived intangible income (consolidated FDII) (if any) is reduced (but not below zero) by an amount which bears the same ratio to the consolidated section 250(a)(2) amount that such consolidated FDII bears to the sum of the consolidated FDII and the consolidated GILTI; and
(ii) The consolidated GILTI (if any) is reduced (but not below zero) by the excess of the consolidated section 250(a)(2) amount over the reduction described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
(c)
Impact of intercompany transactions
—(1)
Impact on qualified business asset investment determination
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of determining a member's QBAI, the basis of specified tangible property does not include an amount equal to any gain or loss recognized with respect to such property by another member in an intercompany transaction (as defined in § 1.1502-13(b)(1)) until the time that such gain or loss is no longer deferred under § 1.1502-13. Thus, for example, if a selling member owns specified tangible property with an adjusted basis (within the meaning of section 1011) of $60x and an adjusted basis (for purposes of calculating QBAI) of $80x, and sells it for $50x to the purchasing member (and the intercompany loss remains deferred), the basis of such property for purposes of computing the purchasing member's QBAI is $80x.
(ii)
Partner-specific QBAI basis.
A member's partner-specific QBAI basis (as defined in § 1.250(b)-2(g)(7)) includes a basis adjustment under section 743(b) resulting from an intercompany transaction only at the time, and to the extent, gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the transaction and no longer deferred under § 1.1502-13.
(2)
Impact on foreign-derived deduction eligible income characterization.
For purposes of redetermining attributes of
members from an intercompany transaction as FDDEI, see § 1.1502-13(c)(1)(i) and (c)(7)(ii)(R) (
Example 18).
(d)
Adjustments to the basis of a member.
For adjustments to the basis of a member related to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, see § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(ii)(B).

Example 1: Calculation of deduction attributable to FDII
—(i)
Facts.
P is the common parent of the P group and owns all of the only class of stock of subsidiaries USS1 and USS2. The consolidated return year of all persons is the calendar year. In 2018, P has DEI of $400x, FDDEI of $0, and QBAI of $0; USS1 has DEI of $200x, FDDEI of $200x, and QBAI of $600x; and USS2 has DEI of −$100x, FDDEI of $100x, and QBAI of $400x. The P group has consolidated taxable income that is sufficient to make inapplicable the limitation in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. No member of the P group has GILTI.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Consolidated DEI.
Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the P group's consolidated DEI is $500x, the greater of the sum of the DEI (whether positive or negative) of all members ($400x + $200x−$100x) or zero.
(B)
Consolidated FDDEI.
Under paragraph (e)(5) of this section, the P group's consolidated FDDEI is $300x, the greater of the sum of the FDDEI (whether positive or negative) of all members ($0 + $200x + $100x) or zero.
(C)
Consolidated deemed tangible income return.
Under paragraph (e)(12) of this section, a member's deemed tangible income return is 10 percent of its QBAI. Therefore, P's deemed tangible income return is $0 (0.10 × $0), USS1's deemed tangible income return is $60x (0.10 × $600x), and USS2's deemed tangible income return is $40x (0.10 × $400x). Under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the P group's consolidated deemed tangible income return is $100x, the sum of the deemed tangible income return of all members ($0 + $60x + $40x).
(D)
Consolidated deemed intangible income.
Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the P group's consolidated deemed intangible income is $400x, the excess of its consolidated DEI over its consolidated deemed tangible income return ($500x −$100x).
(E)
Consolidated FDII.
Under paragraph (e)(7) of this section, the P group's consolidated foreign-derived ratio is 0.60, the ratio of its consolidated FDDEI to its consolidated DEI ($300x/$500x). Under paragraph (e)(6) of this section, the P group's consolidated
FDII is $240x, the product of its consolidated deemed intangible income and its consolidated foreign-derived ratio ($400x × 0.60).
(F)
Consolidated FDII deduction amount.
Under paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the P group's consolidated FDII deduction amount is $90x, the product of the FDII deduction rate and the consolidated FDII (0.375 × $240x).
(G)
Member's deduction attributable to consolidated FDII deduction amount.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a member is allowed a deduction equal, in part, to the product of the consolidated FDII deduction amount of the consolidated group to which the member belongs and the member's FDII deduction allocation ratio. Under paragraph (e)(13) of this section, a member's FDII deduction allocation ratio is the ratio of its positive FDDEI to the sum of each member's positive FDDEI for such consolidated return year. As a result, the FDII deduction allocation ratios of P, USS1, and USS2 are 0 ($0/$300x),
2/3
($200x/$300x), and
1/3
($100x/$300x), respectively. Therefore, P, USS1, and USS2 are permitted deductions under paragraph (b)(1) of this section in the amount of $0 (0 × $90x), $60x (
2/3
× $90x), and $30x (
1/3
× $90x), respectively.
(2)
Example 2: Limitation on consolidated foreign-derived deduction eligible income
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section (the facts in

), except that P's FDDEI is $300x.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Consolidated DEI and consolidated deemed tangible income return.
As in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii)(A) and (C) of this section (the analysis in
Example 1
), the P group's consolidated DEI is $500x and the P group's consolidated deemed tangible income return is $100x.
(B)
Consolidated FDDEI.
Under paragraph (e)(5) of this section, the P group's consolidated FDDEI is $600x, the greater of the sum of the FDDEI (whether positive or negative) of all members ($300x + $200x + $100x) or zero.
(C)
Consolidated deemed intangible income and consolidated FDII.
Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the P group's consolidated deemed intangible income is $400x ($500x − $100x). Under paragraph (e)(7) of this section, the P group's consolidated foreign-derived ratio is 1.00 ($600x/$500x, but not in excess of one). Under paragraph (e)(6) of this section, the P group's consolidated FDII is $400x ($400x × 1.00).
(D)
Consolidated FDII deduction amount and member's deduction attributable to consolidated FDII deduction amount.
Under paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the P group's consolidated FDII deduction amount is $150x (0.375 × $400x). Under paragraph (e)(13) of this section, the FDII deduction allocation ratios of P, USS1, and USS2 are
1/2
($300/$600x),
1/3
($200x/$600x), and
1/6
($100x/$600x), respectively. Therefore, P, USS1, and USS2 are permitted deductions under paragraph (b)(1) of this section in the amounts of $75x (
1/2
× $150x), $50x (
1/3
× $150x), and $25x (
1/6
× $150x), respectively.

The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that P's FDDEI is -$100x.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Consolidated DEI and consolidated deemed tangible income return.
As in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii)(A) and (C) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), the P group's consolidated DEI is $500x and the P group's consolidated deemed tangible income return is $100x.
(B)
Consolidated FDDEI.
Under paragraph (e)(5) of this section, the P group's consolidated FDDEI is $200x, the greater of the sum of the FDDEI (whether positive or negative) of all members (−$100x + $200x + $100x) or zero.
(C)
Consolidated deemed intangible income and consolidated FDII.
Under paragraphs (e)(2) and (6) of this section, the P group's consolidated deemed intangible income is $400x ($500x −$100x), and the P group's consolidated FDII is $160x ($400x × ($200x/$500x)).
(D)
Consolidated FDII deduction amount and member's deduction attributable to consolidated FDII deduction amount.
Under paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the P group's consolidated FDII deduction amount is $60x (0.375 × $160x). Under paragraph (e)(13) of this section, the FDII deduction allocation ratios of P, USS1, and USS2 are 0 ($0/$300x),
2/3
($200x/$300x), and
1/3
($100x/$300x), respectively. Therefore, P,
USS1, and USS2 are permitted deductions under paragraph (b)(1) of this section in the amounts of $0 (0 × $60x), $40x (
2/3
× $60x), and $20x (
1/3
× $60x), respectively.
(4)
Example 4: Calculation of deduction attributable to GILTI
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that USS1 owns CFC1 and USS2 owns CFC2. USS1 and USS2 have GILTI of $65x and $20x, respectively, and amounts treated as dividends received under section 78 attributable to their GILTI of $10x and $5x, respectively.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Consolidated GILTI.
Under paragraph (e)(9) of this section, the P group's consolidated GILTI is $85x, the sum of the GILTI of all members ($0 + $65x + $20x).
(B)
Consolidated GILTI deduction amount.
Under paragraph (e)(8) of this section, the P group's consolidated GILTI deduction amount is $50x, the product of the GILTI deduction rate and the sum of its consolidated GILTI and the amounts treated as dividends received by the members under section 78 which are attributable to their GILTI for the consolidated return year (0.50 × ($85x + $10x + $5x)).
(C)
Member's deduction attributable to consolidated GILTI deduction amount.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a member is allowed a deduction equal, in part, to the product of the consolidated GILTI deduction amount of the consolidated group to which the member belongs and the member's GILTI deduction allocation ratio. Under paragraph (e)(16) of this section, a member's GILTI deduction allocation ratio is the ratio of the sum of its GILTI and the amount treated as a dividend received by the member under section 78 which is attributable to its GILTI for the consolidated return year to the sum of the consolidated GILTI and the amounts treated as dividends received by the members under section 78 which are attributable to their GILTI for the consolidated return year. As a result, the GILTI deduction allocation ratios of P, USS1, and USS2 are 0 ($0/($85x + $10x + $5x)),
3/4
(($65x + $10x)/($85x + $10x + $5x)), and
1/4
(($20x + $5x)/($85x + $10x + $5x)), respectively. Therefore, P, USS1, and USS2 are permitted deductions of $0 (0 × $50x), $37.50x (
3/4
× $50x), and $12.50x (
1/4
× $50x), respectively.
(D)
Member's deduction under section 250.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a member is allowed a deduction equal to the sum of the member's deduction attributable to the consolidated FDII deduction amount and the member's deduction attributable to the consolidated GILTI deduction amount. As a result P, USS1, and USS2 are entitled to deductions under paragraph (b)(1) of this section of $0 ($0 + $0), $97.50x ($60x + $37.50x), and $42.50x ($30x + $12.50x), respectively.
(5)
Example 5: Taxable income limitation
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 4
), except that the P group's consolidated taxable income (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(10) of this section) is $300x.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Determination of whether the limitation described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies.
Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, in the case of a consolidated group with a consolidated section 250(a)(2) amount for a consolidated year, the amount of the consolidated FDII and the consolidated GILTI otherwise taken into account in the determination of the consolidated FDII deduction amount and the consolidated GILTI deduction amount are subject to reduction. As in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(E) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), the P group's consolidated FDII is $240x. As in paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(A) of this section (the analysis in
Example 4
), the P group's consolidated GILTI is $85x. The P group's consolidated taxable income is $300x. Under paragraph (e)(10) of this section, the P group's consolidated section 250(a)(2) amount is $25x (($240x + $85x) − $300x), the excess of the sum of the consolidated FDII and the consolidated GILTI, over the P group's consolidated taxable income. Therefore, the limitation described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies.
(B)
Allocation of reduction.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the P group's consolidated FDII is reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to the consolidated section 250(a)(2) amount as the consolidated FDII bears to the sum of the consolidated FDII and consolidated GILTI, and the P
group's consolidated GILTI is reduced by the excess of the consolidated section 250(a)(2) amount over the reduction described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Therefore, for purposes of determining the P group's consolidated FDII deduction amount and consolidated GILTI deduction amount, its consolidated FDII is reduced to $221.54x ($240x −($25x × ($240x/$325x))) and its consolidated GILTI is reduced to $78.46x ($85x −($25x −($25x × ($240x/$325x)))).
(C)
Calculation of consolidated FDII deduction amount and consolidated GILTI deduction amount.
Under paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the P group's consolidated FDII deduction amount is $83.08x ($221.54x × 0.375). Under paragraph (e)(8) of this section, the P group's consolidated GILTI deduction amount is $46.73x (($78.46x + 10x + 5x) × 0.50).
(D)
Member's deduction attributable to the consolidated FDII deduction amount.
As in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(G) of this section (the analysis in
Example 1
), the FDII deduction allocation ratios of P, USS1, and USS2 are 0,
2/3
, and
1/3
, respectively. Therefore, P, USS1, and USS2 are permitted deductions attributable to the consolidated FDII deduction amount of $0 (0 × $83.08x), $55.39x (
2/3
× $83.08x), and $27.69x (
1/3
× $83.08x), respectively.
(E)
Member's deduction attributable to the consolidated GILTI deduction amount.
As in paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(C) of this section (the analysis in
Example 4
), the GILTI deduction allocation ratios of P, USS1, and USS2 are 0,
3/4
, and
1/4
, respectively. Therefore, P, USS1, and USS2 are permitted deductions attributable to the consolidated GILTI deduction amount of $0 (0 × $46.73x), $35.05x (
3/4
× $46.73x), and $11.68x (
1/4
× $46.73x), respectively.
(F)
Member's deduction pursuant section 250.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a member is allowed a deduction equal to the sum of the member's deduction attributable to the consolidated FDII deduction amount and the member's deduction attributable to the consolidated GILTI deduction amount. As a result, P, USS1, and USS2 are entitled to deductions under paragraph (b)(1) of this section of $0 ($0 + $0), $90.44x ($55.39x + $35.05x), and $39.37 × ($27.69x + $11.68x), respectively.
(g)
Applicability date.
This section applies to consolidated return years beginning on or after January 1, 2021. A taxpayer that chooses to apply the rules in §§ 1.250(a)-1 and 1.250(b)-1 through 1.250(b)-6 to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2021, pursuant to § 1.250-1(b), must also apply the rules of this section in their entirety to consolidated return years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2021.

Example 1: Calculation of net CFC tested income within a consolidated group when all CFCs are wholly owned by a member
—(i)
Facts.
USS1 owns all of the single class of stock of CFC1. USS2 owns all of the single class of stock of each of CFC2 and CFC3. USS3 owns all of the single class of stock of CFC4. In Year 1, CFC1 has tested loss of $100x, CFC2 has tested income of $200x, CFC3 has tested loss of $200x, and CFC4 has tested income of $600x. None of CFC1, CFC2, CFC3, or CFC4 has qualified business asset investment in Year 1.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Consolidated tested income and GILTI allocation ratio.
USS1 has no aggregate tested income; USS2's aggregate tested income is $200x, its pro rata share (determined under § 1.951A-1(d)(2)) of CFC2's tested income; and USS3's aggregate tested income is $600x, its pro rata share (determined under § 1.951A-1(d)(2)) of CFC4's tested income. Therefore, under paragraph (e)(6) of this section, the P consolidated group's consolidated tested income is $800x ($200x + $600x). As a result, the GILTI allocation ratios of USS1, USS2, and USS3 are 0 ($0/$800x), 0.25 ($200x/$800x), and 0.75 ($600x/$800x), respectively.
(B)
Consolidated tested loss.
Under paragraph (e)(7) of this section, the P consolidated group's consolidated tested loss is $300x ($100x + $200x), the sum of USS1's aggregate tested loss, which is equal to its pro rata share (determined under § 1.951A-1(d)(4)) of CFC1's tested loss ($100x), and USS2's aggregate tested loss, which is equal to its pro rata share (determined under § 1.951A-1(d)(4)) of CFC3's tested loss ($200x). Under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, a member's allocable share of the consolidated tested loss is the product of the consolidated tested loss of the member's consolidated group and the member's GILTI allocation ratio. Therefore, the allocable shares of the consolidated tested loss of USS1, USS2, and USS3 are $0 (0 × $300x), $75x (0.25 × $300x), and $225x (0.75 × $300x), respectively.
(C)
Calculation of net CFC tested income.
Under paragraph (e)(12) of this section, a member's net CFC tested income is the excess (if any) of the member's aggregate tested income over the member's allocable share of the consolidated tested loss. As a result, the net CFC tested income of USS1, USS2, and USS3 are $0 ($0−$0), $125x ($200x−$75x), and $375x ($600x−$225x), respectively.

—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that USS2 and USS3 each own 50% of the single class of stock of CFC3.
(ii)
Analysis.
As in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(A) of this section (paragraph
(A) of the analysis in
Example 1
), USS1 has no aggregate tested income and a GILTI allocation ratio of 0, USS2 has $200x of aggregate tested income and a GILTI allocation ratio of 0.25, and USS3 has $600x of aggregate tested income and a GILTI allocation ratio of 0.75. Additionally, the P consolidated group's consolidated tested loss is $300x (the aggregate of USS1's aggregate tested loss, which is equal to its pro rata share (determined under § 1.951A-1(d)(4)) of CFC1's tested loss ($100x); USS2's aggregate tested loss, which is equal to its pro rata share (determined under § 1.951A-1(d)(4)) of CFC3's tested loss ($100x); and USS3's aggregate tested loss, which is equal to its pro rata share (determined under § 1.951A-1(d)(4)) of CFC3's tested loss ($100x)). As a result, under paragraph (e)(12) of this section, as in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(C) of this section (paragraph (C) of the analysis in
Example 1
), the net CFC tested income of USS1, USS2, and USS3 are $0 ($0−$0), $125x ($200x−$75x), and $375x ($600x−$225x), respectively.

Example 3: Calculation of GILTI inclusion amount
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that CFC2 and CFC4 have qualified business asset investment of $500x and $2,000x, respectively, for Year 1. In Year 1, CFC1 and CFC4 each have tested interest expense (within the meaning of § 1.951A-4(b)(1)) of $25x, and none of CFC1, CFC2, CFC3, and CFC4 have tested interest income (within the meaning of § 1.951A-4(b)(2)). CFC1's tested loss of $100x and CFC4's tested income of $600x take into account the tested interest expense.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
GILTI allocation ratio.
As in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(A) of this section (paragraph (A) of the analysis in
Example 1
), the GILTI allocation ratios of USS1, USS2, and USS3 are 0 ($0/$800x), 0.25 ($200x/$800x), and 0.75 ($600x/$800x), respectively.
(B)
Consolidated QBAI.
Under paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the P consolidated group's consolidated QBAI is $2,500x ($500x + $2,000x), the aggregate of USS2's pro rata share (determined under § 1.951A-1(d)(3)) of the qualified business asset investment of CFC2 and USS3's pro rata share (determined under § 1.951A-1(d)(3)) of the qualified business asset investment of CFC4. Under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, a member's allocable share of consolidated QBAI is the product of the consolidated QBAI of the member's consolidated group and the member's GILTI allocation ratio. Therefore, the allocable shares of the consolidated QBAI of each of USS1, USS2, and USS3 are $0 (0 × $2,500x), $625x (0.25 × $2,500x), and $1,875x (0.75 × $2,500x), respectively.
(C)
Consolidated specified interest expense
—(
1
)
Pro rata share of tested interest expense.
USS1's pro rata share (determined under § 1.951A-1(d)(5)) of the tested interest expense of CFC1 is $25x, the amount by which the tested interest expense increases USS1's pro rata share of CFC1's tested loss (from $75x to $100x) for Year 1. USS3's pro rata share (determined under § 1.951A-1(d)(5)) of the tested interest expense of CFC4 is also $25x, the amount by which the tested interest expense decreases USS3's pro rata share of CFC4's tested income (from $625x to $600x).
(

)
Consolidated specified interest expense.
Under paragraph (e)(5) of this section, the P consolidated group's consolidated specified interest expense is $50x, the excess of the sum of each member's pro rata share of the tested interest expense of each controlled foreign corporation ($50x, $25x from USS1 + $25x from USS3), over the sum of each member's pro rata share of tested interest income ($0). Under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, a member's allocable share of consolidated specified interest expense is the product of the consolidated specified interest expense of the member's consolidated group and the member's GILTI allocation ratio. Therefore, the allocable shares of consolidated specified interest expense of USS1, USS2, and USS3 are $0 (0 × $50x), $12.50x (0.25 × $50x), and $37.50x (0.75 × $50x), respectively.
(D)
Calculation of deemed tangible income return.
Under paragraph (e)(9) of this section, a member's deemed tangible income return means 10 percent of the member's allocable share of the consolidated QBAI. As a result, the deemed tangible income returns of USS1, USS2, and USS3 are $0 (0.1 × $0), $62.50x (0.1 × $625x), and $187.50x (0.1 × $1,875x), respectively.
(E)
Calculation of net deemed tangible income return.
Under paragraph (e)(13) of this section, a member's net deemed tangible income return means the excess (if any) of a member's deemed tangible income return over the member's allocable share of the consolidated specified interest expense. As a result, the net deemed tangible income returns of USS1, USS2, and USS3 are $0 ($0−$0), $50x ($62.50x−$12.50x), and $150x ($187.50x−$37.50x), respectively.
(F)
Calculation of GILTI inclusion amount.
Under paragraph (b) of this section, a member's GILTI inclusion amount for a U.S. shareholder inclusion year is the excess (if any) of the member's net CFC tested income for the U.S. shareholder inclusion year, over the shareholder's net deemed tangible income return for the U.S. shareholder inclusion year. As described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(C) of this section (paragraph (C) of the analysis in
Example 1
), the net CFC tested income of USS1, USS2, and USS3 are $0, $125x, and $375x, respectively. As described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(E) of this section (paragraph (E) of the analysis in this example), the net deemed tangible income returns of USS1, USS2, and USS3 are $0, $50x, and $150x, respectively. As a result, under paragraph (b) of this section, the GILTI inclusion amounts of USS1, USS2, and USS3 are $0 ($0−$0), $75x ($125x−$50x), and $225x ($375x−$150x), respectively.
(g)
Applicability date
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (g), this section applies to taxable years of United States shareholders for which the due date (without extensions) of the consolidated return is after June 21, 2019. However, a consolidated group may apply the rules of this section in their entirety to all taxable years of its members that are described in § 1.951A-7(a). In such a case, the consolidated group must apply the rules of this section to all taxable years described in § 1.951A-7(a) and with respect to all members.

Computational rules
—(

)
Member's contribution to the consolidated section 53(c) limitation.
Except as provided in the special rule of paragraph (h)(4)(iii)(B)(
2
) of this section, a member's contribution to the consolidated section 53(c) limitation for a consolidated return year equals the member's share of the consolidated net regular tax liability minus its share of consolidated tentative minimum tax. The group computes the member's shares by applying to the respective consolidated amounts the principles of section 1552 and the percentage method under § 1.1502-33(d)(3), assuming a 100% allocation of any decreased tax liability. The group makes proper adjustments so that taxes and credits not taken into account in computing the limitation under section 53(c) are not taken into account in computing the member's share of the consolidated net regular tax, etc. (See, for example, the taxes described in section 26(b) that are disregarded in computing regular tax liability.)
(
2
)
Adjustment for year in which alternative minimum tax is paid.
For a consolidated return year for which consolidated tentative minimum tax is greater than consolidated regular tax liability, the group reduces the member's share of the consolidated tentative minimum tax by the member's share of
the consolidated alternative minimum tax for the year. The group determines the member's share of consolidated alternative minimum tax for a year using the same method it uses to determine the member's share of the consolidated minimum tax credits for the year.
(

)
Years included in computation.
For purposes of computing the limitation under this paragraph (h)(4)(iii), the consolidated return years of the group include only those years, including the year to which a credit is carried, that the member has been continuously included in the group's consolidated return, but exclude any years after the year to which the credit is carried.
(

)
Subgroup principles.
The SRLY subgroup principles under § 1.1502-21(c)(2) apply for purposes of this paragraph (h)(4)(iii). The predecessor and successor principles under § 1.1502-21(f) also apply for purposes of this paragraph (h)(4)(iii).
(

)
Overlap with section 383.
The principles under § 1.1502-21(g) apply for purposes of this paragraph (h)(4)(iii). For example, an overlap of this paragraph (h)(4)(iii) and the application of section 383 with respect to a credit carryover occurs if a corporation becomes a member of a consolidated group (the SRLY event) within six months of the change date of an ownership change giving rise to a section 383 credit limitation with respect to that carryover (the section 383 event), with the result that the limitation of this paragraph (h)(4)(iii) does not apply. See §§ 1.1502-21(g)(2)(ii)(A) and 1.383-1; see also § 1.1502-21(g)(4) (subgroup rules).
(C)
Effective date—(1) In general.
This paragraph (h)(4)(iii) generally applies to consolidated return years for which the due date of the income tax return (without extensions) is after March 13, 1998. See § 1.1502-3(d)(4) for an optional effective date rule (generally making this paragraph (h)(4)(iii) also applicable to a consolidated return year beginning on or after January 1, 1997, if the due date of the income tax return (without extensions) was on or before March 13, 1998).
(

)
Contribution years.
In general, a group does not take into account a consolidated taxable year for which the due date of the income tax return (without extensions) is on or before March 13, 1998, in determining a member's (or subgroup's) contributions to the consolidated section 53(c) limitation under this paragraph (h)(4)(iii). However, if a consolidated group chooses to apply the optional effective date rule, the consolidated group shall not take into account a consolidated taxable year beginning before January 1, 1997 in determining a member's (or subgroup's) contributions to the consolidated section 53(c) limitation under this paragraph (h)(4)(iii).
(

Special subgroup rule.
In the event that the principles of § 1.1502-21(g)(1) do not apply to a particular credit carryover in the current group, then solely for purposes of applying this paragraph (h)(4)(iii) to determine the limitation with respect to that carryover and with respect to which the SRLY register (the aggregate of the member's or subgroup's contribution to consolidated section 53(c) limitation reduced by the aggregate of the member's or subgroup's minimum tax credits arising and absorbed in all consolidated return years) began in a taxable year for which the due date of the return is on or before May 25, 2000, the principles of § 1.1502-21(c)(2) shall be applied without regard to the phrase “or for a carryover that was subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph (g) of this section or § 1.1502-15(g) with respect to another group (the former group).”

) of this section, only an ownership change to which section 383, as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (100 Stat. 2095), applies and which results in a section 383 credit limitation shall constitute a section 383 event. The optional effective date rule of § 1.1502-3(d)(4) (generally making this paragraph (h)(4)(iii) also applicable to a consolidated return year beginning on or after January 1, 1997, if the due date of the income tax return (without extensions) was on or before March 13, 1998) does not apply with respect to paragraph

§ 1.1502-59A
Application of section 59A to consolidated groups.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides rules for the application of section 59A and the regulations thereunder (the
section 59A regulations
) to consolidated groups and their members (as defined in § 1.1502-1(h) and (b), respectively). Rules in the section 59A regulations apply to consolidated groups except as modified in this section. Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules treating a consolidated group (rather than each member of the group) as a single taxpayer, and a single applicable taxpayer, as relevant, for certain purposes. Paragraph (c) of this section coordinates the application of the business interest stacking rule under § 1.59A-3(c)(4) to consolidated groups. Paragraph (d) of this section addresses how the base erosion minimum tax amount is allocated among members of the consolidated group. Paragraph (e) of this section coordinates the application of this section and § 1.1502-47. Paragraph (f) of this section sets forth definitions. Paragraph (g) of this section provides examples. Paragraph (h) of this section provides the applicability date.
(b)
Consolidated group as the applicable taxpayer
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of determining whether the consolidated group is an applicable taxpayer (within the meaning of § 1.59A-2(b)) and the amount of tax due pursuant to section 59A(a), all members of a consolidated group are treated as a single taxpayer. Thus, for example, members' deductions are aggregated in making the required computations under section 59A. In addition, to ensure that intercompany transactions (as defined in § 1.1502-13(b)(1)(i)) do not affect the consolidated group's base erosion percentage or base erosion minimum tax amount, items resulting from intercompany transactions are not taken into account in making such computations under section 59A. For example, additional depreciation deductions resulting from intercompany asset sales are not taken into account for purposes of applying the base erosion percentage test under § 1.59A-2(e).
(2)
Consolidated group as member of the aggregate group.
The consolidated group is treated as a single member of an aggregate group for purposes of § 1.59A-2(c).
(3)
Related party determination.
For purposes of section 59A and the section 59A regulations, if a person is a related party with respect to any member of a consolidated group, that person is a related party of the group and of each of its members.
(c)
Coordination of section 59A(c)(3) and section 163(j) in a consolidated group
—(1)
Overview.
This paragraph (c) provides rules regarding the application of § 1.59A-3(c)(4) to a consolidated group's section 163(j) interest deduction. The classification rule in paragraph (c)(3) of this section addresses how to determine if, and to what extent, the group's section 163(j) interest deduction is a base erosion tax benefit. These regulations contain a single-entity classification rule with regard to the deduction of the consolidated group's aggregate current year business interest expense (“BIE”), but a separate-entity classification rule for the deduction of the consolidated group's disallowed BIE carryforwards. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section classifies the group's aggregate current year BIE deduction, in conformity with § 1.59A-3(c)(4), as constituting domestic related current year BIE deduction, foreign related current year BIE deduction, or unrelated current year BIE deduction. The allocation rules in paragraph (c)(4) of this section then allocate to specific members of the group the domestic related current year BIE deduction, foreign related current year BIE deduction, and unrelated current year BIE deduction taken in the taxable year. Any member's current year BIE that is carried forward to the succeeding taxable year as a disallowed BIE carryforward is allocated a status as domestic related BIE carryforward, foreign related BIE carryforward, or unrelated BIE carryforward under paragraph (c)(5) of this section. The status of any disallowed BIE carryforward deducted by a member in a later year is classified on a separate-entity basis by the deducting member under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, based on the status allocated to the
member's disallowed BIE carryforward under paragraph (c)(5) of this section. This paragraph (c) also provides rules regarding the consequences of the deconsolidation of a corporation that has been allocated a domestic related BIE carryforward status, a foreign related BIE carryforward status, or an unrelated BIE carryforward status; and the consolidation of a corporation with a disallowed BIE carryforward classified as from payments to a domestic related party, foreign related party, or unrelated party.
(2)
Absorption rule for the group's business interest expense.
To determine the amount of the group's section 163(j) interest deduction, and to determine the year in which the member's business interest expense giving rise to the deduction was incurred or accrued, see §§ 1.163(j)-4(d) and 1.163(j)-5(b)(3).
(3)
Classification of the group's section 163(j) interest deduction
—(i)
In general.
Consistent with § 1.59A-3(c)(4)(i) and paragraph (b) of this section, the classification rule of this paragraph (c)(3) determines whether the consolidated group's section 163(j) interest deduction is a base erosion tax benefit. To the extent the consolidated group's business interest expense is permitted as a deduction under section 163(j)(1) in a taxable year, the deduction is classified first as from business interest expense paid or accrued to a foreign related party and business interest expense paid or accrued to a domestic related party (on a pro-rata basis); any remaining deduction is treated as from business interest expense paid or accrued to an unrelated party.
(ii)
Year-by-year application of the classification rule.
If the consolidated group's section 163(j) interest deduction in any taxable year is attributable to business interest expense paid or accrued in more than one taxable year (for example, the group deducts the group's aggregate current year BIE, the group's disallowed BIE carryforward from year 1, and the group's disallowed BIE carryforward from year 2), the classification rule in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section applies separately to each of those years, pursuant to paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section.
(iii)
Classification of current year BIE deductions.
Current year BIE deductions are classified under the section 59A regulations and this paragraph (c) as if the consolidated group were a single taxpayer that had paid or accrued the group's aggregate current year BIE to domestic related parties, foreign related parties, and unrelated parties. The rules of paragraph (c)(4) of this section apply for allocating current year BIE deductions among members of the consolidated group. To the extent the consolidated group's aggregate current year BIE exceeds its section 163(j) limitation, the rules of paragraph (c)(5) of this section apply.
(iv)
Classification of deductions of disallowed BIE carryforwards.
Each member of the group applies the classification rule in this paragraph (c)(3) to its deduction of any part of a disallowed BIE carryforward from a year, after the group applies paragraph (c)(5) of this section to the consolidated group's disallowed BIE carryforward from that year. Therefore, disallowed BIE carryforward that is actually deducted by a member is classified based on the status of the components of that carryforward, assigned pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
(4)
Allocation of domestic related current year BIE deduction status and foreign related current year BIE deduction status among members of the consolidated group
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (c)(4) applies if the group has domestic related current year BIE deductions, foreign related current year BIE deductions, or both, as a result of the application of the classification rule in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Under this paragraph (c)(4), the domestic related current year BIE, foreign related current year BIE, or both, that is treated as deducted in the current year are deemed to have been incurred pro-rata by all members that have current year BIE deduction in that year, regardless of which member or members actually incurred the current year BIE to a domestic related party or a foreign related party.
(ii)
Domestic related current year BIE deduction
—(A)
Amount of domestic related current year BIE deduction status
allocable to a member.
The amount of domestic related current year BIE deduction status that is allocated to a member is determined by multiplying the group's domestic related current year BIE deduction (determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section) by the percentage of current year BIE deduction allocable to such member in that year.
(B)
Percentage of current year BIE deduction allocable to a member.
The percentage of current year BIE deduction allocable to a member is equal to the amount of the member's current year BIE deduction divided by the amount of the group's aggregate current year BIE deduction.
(iii)
Amount of foreign related current year BIE deduction status allocable to a member.
The amount of foreign related current year BIE deduction status that is allocated to a member is determined by multiplying the group's foreign related current year BIE deduction (determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section) by the percentage of current year BIE deduction allocable to such member (defined in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B) of this section).
(iv)
Treatment of amounts as having unrelated current year BIE deduction status.
To the extent the amount of a member's current year BIE that is absorbed under paragraph (c)(2) of this section exceeds the domestic related current year BIE deduction status and foreign related current year BIE deduction status allocated to the member under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this section, such excess amount is treated as from payments or accruals to an unrelated party.
(5)
Allocation of domestic related BIE carryforward status and foreign related BIE carryforward status to members of the group
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (c)(5) applies in any year the consolidated group's aggregate current year BIE exceeds its section 163(j) limitation. After the application of paragraph (c)(4) of this section, any remaining domestic related current year BIE, foreign related current year BIE, and unrelated current year BIE is deemed to have been incurred pro-rata by members of the group pursuant to the rules in paragraph (c)(5)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section, regardless of which member or members actually incurred the business interest expense to a domestic related party, foreign related party, or unrelated party.
(ii)
Domestic related BIE carryforward
—(A)
Amount of domestic related BIE carryforward status allocable to a member.
The amount of domestic related BIE carryforward status that is allocated to a member equals the group's domestic related BIE carryforward from that year multiplied by the percentage of disallowed BIE carryforward allocable to the member.
(B)
Percentage of disallowed BIE carryforward allocable to a member.
The percentage of disallowed BIE carryforward allocable to a member for a taxable year equals the member's disallowed BIE carryforward from that year divided by the consolidated group's disallowed BIE carryforwards from that year.
(iii)
Amount of foreign related BIE carryforward status allocable to a member.
The amount of foreign related BIE carryforward status that is allocated to a member equals the group's foreign related BIE carryforward from that year multiplied by the percentage of disallowed BIE carryforward allocable to the member (as defined in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section).
(iv)
Treatment of amounts as having unrelated BIE carryforward status.
If a member's disallowed BIE carryforward for a year exceeds the amount of domestic related BIE carryforward status and foreign related BIE carryforward status that is allocated to the member pursuant to paragraphs (c)(5)(ii) and (iii) of this section, respectively, the excess carryforward amount is treated as from payments or accruals to an unrelated party.
(v)
Coordination with section 381.
If a disallowed BIE carryforward is allocated a status as a domestic related BIE carryforward, foreign related BIE carryforward, or unrelated BIE carryforward under the allocation rule of paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the acquiring corporation in a transaction described in section 381(a) will succeed to and take into account the allocated status of the carryforward for purposes of section 59A. See § 1.381(c)(20)-1.
(6)
Member deconsolidates from a consolidated group
—(i)
General rule.
When a
member deconsolidates from a group (the original group), the member's disallowed BIE carryforwards retain their allocated status, pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section, as a domestic related BIE carryforward, foreign related BIE carryforward, or unrelated BIE carryforward (as applicable). Following the member's deconsolidation, the status of the disallowed BIE carryforwards of the remaining members is not redetermined.
(ii)
Gross receipts exception.
This paragraph (c)(6)(ii) applies if the original group had insufficient gross receipts to satisfy the gross receipts test under § 1.59A-2(d) and thus was not an applicable taxpayer in the year in which the deconsolidating member's disallowed BIE carryforward was incurred. If this paragraph (c)(6)(ii) applies, the deconsolidating member may determine the status of its disallowed BIE carryforward from that year by applying the classification rule of § 1.59A-3(c)(4) solely to the interest payments or accruals of the deconsolidating member, rather than by applying § 1.1502-59A(c)(3).
(iii)
Failure to substantiate.
If the deconsolidating member fails to substantiate a disallowed BIE carryforward as a domestic related BIE carryforward, foreign related BIE carryforward, or unrelated BIE carryforward, then the disallowed BIE carryforward is treated as a foreign related BIE carryforward.
(7)
Corporation joins a consolidated group.
If a corporation joins a consolidated group (the acquiring group), and that corporation was allocated a domestic related BIE carryforward status, foreign related BIE carryforward status, or unrelated BIE carryforward status pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section from another consolidated group (the original group), or separately has a disallowed BIE carryforward that is classified as from payments or accruals to a domestic related party, foreign related party, or unrelated party, the status of the carryforward is taken into account in determining the acquiring group's base erosion tax benefit when the corporation's disallowed BIE carryforward is absorbed.
(d)
Allocation of the base erosion minimum tax amount to members of the consolidated group.
For rules regarding the allocation of the base erosion minimum tax amount, see section 1552. Allocations under section 1552 take into account the classification and allocation provisions of paragraphs (c)(3) through (5) of this section.

Examples.
The following examples illustrate the general application of this section. For purposes of the examples, a foreign corporation (FP) wholly owns domestic corporation (P), which in turn wholly owns S1 and S2. P, S1, and S2 are members of a consolidated group. The consolidated group is a calendar year taxpayer.
(1)
Example 1: Computation of the consolidated group's base erosion minimum tax amount.
(i)
The consolidated group is the applicable taxpayer
—(A)
Facts.
The members have never engaged in intercompany transactions. For the 2019 taxable year, P, S1, and S2 were permitted the following amounts of deductions (within the meaning of section 59A(c)(4)), $2,400x, $1,000x, and $2,600x; those deductions include base erosion tax benefits of $180x, $370x, and $230x. The group's consolidated taxable income for the year is $150x. In addition,
the group satisfies the gross receipts test in § 1.59A-2(d).
(B)
Analysis.
Pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the receipts and deductions of P, S1, and S2 are aggregated for purposes of making the computations under section 59A. The group's base erosion percentage is 13% (($180x + $370x + $230x)/($2,400x + $1,000x + $2,600x)). The consolidated group is an applicable taxpayer under § 1.59A-2(b) because the group satisfies the gross receipts test and the group's base erosion percentage (13%) is higher than 3%. The consolidated group's modified taxable income is computed by adding back the members' base erosion tax benefits (and, when the consolidated group has consolidated net operating loss available for deduction, the consolidated net operating loss allowed multiplied by the base erosion percentage) to the consolidated taxable income, $930x ($150x + $180x + $370x + $230x). The group's base erosion minimum tax amount is then computed as 10 percent of the modified taxable income less the regular tax liability, $61.5x ($930x × 10%−$150x × 21%).
(ii)
The consolidated group engages in intercompany transactions
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
(i)), except that S1 sold various inventory items to S2 during 2019. Such items are depreciable in the hands of S2 (but would not have been depreciable in the hands of S1) and continued to be owned by S2 during 2019.
(B)
Analysis.
The result is the same as paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
(i)). Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, items resulting from the intercompany sale (for example, gross receipts, depreciation deductions) are not taken into account in computing the group's gross receipts under § 1.59A-2(d) and base erosion percentage under § 1.59A-2(e)(3).
(2)
Example 2: Business interest expense subject to section 163(j) and the group's domestic related current year BIE and foreign related current year BIE for the year equals its section 163(j) limitation
—(i)
Facts.
During the current year (Year 1), P incurred $150x of business interest expense to domestic related parties; S1 incurred $150x of business interest expense to foreign related parties; and S2 incurred $150x of business interest expense to unrelated parties. The group's section 163(j) limitation for the year is $300x. After applying the rules in § 1.163(j)-5(b)(3), the group deducts $150x of P's Year 1 business interest expense, and $75x each of S1 and S2's Year 1 business interest expense. Assume the group is an applicable taxpayer for purposes of section 59A.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Application of the absorption rule in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
Following the rules in section 163(j), the group's section 163(j) interest deduction for Year 1 is $300x, and the entire amount is from members' Year 1 business interest expense.
(B)
Application of the classification rule in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the group's aggregate current year BIE deduction of $300x is first classified as payments or accruals to related parties (pro-rata among domestic related parties and foreign related parties), and second as payments or accruals to unrelated parties. For Year 1, the group has $150x of domestic related current year BIE and $150x of foreign related current year BIE, and the group's aggregate current year BIE deduction will be classified equally among the related party expenses. Therefore, $150x of the group's deduction is classified as domestic related current year BIE deduction and $150x is classified as a foreign related current year BIE deduction.
(C)
Application of the allocation rule in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
After the application of the classification rule in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the group has $150x each of domestic related current year BIE deduction and foreign related current year BIE deduction from the group's aggregate current year BIE in Year 1. The domestic related current year BIE deduction and foreign related current year BIE deduction will be allocated to P, S1, and S2 based on each member's deduction of its Year 1 business interest expense.
(

)
Allocations to P.
The percentage of current year BIE deduction attributable to P is 50% (P's deduction of its Year 1 current year BIE, $150x, divided by the group's aggregate current year BIE deduction for Year 1, $300x). Thus, the amount of domestic related current
year BIE deduction status allocated to P is $75x (the group's domestic related current year BIE deduction, $150x, multiplied by the percentage of current year BIE deduction allocable to P, 50%); and the amount of foreign related current year BIE deduction status allocated to P is $75x (the group's foreign related current year BIE deduction, $150x, multiplied by the percentage of current year BIE deduction allocable to P, 50%).
(
2
)
Allocations to S1 and S2.
The percentage of current year BIE deduction attributable to S1 is 25% (S1's deduction of its Year 1 current year BIE, $75x, divided by the group's aggregate current year BIE deduction for Year 1, $300x). Thus, the amount of domestic related current year BIE deduction status allocated to S1 is $37.5x (the group's domestic related current year BIE deduction, $150x, multiplied by the percentage of current year BIE deduction allocable to S1, 25%); and the amount of foreign related current year BIE deduction status allocated to S1 is $37.5x (the group's foreign related current year BIE deduction, $150x, multiplied by the percentage of current year BIE deduction allocable to S1, 25%). Because S2 also deducted $75 of its Year 1 current year BIE, S2's deductions are allocated the same pro-rata status as those of S1 under this paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
).
(D)
Application of the allocation rule in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
Although the group will have disallowed BIE carryforwards after Year 1 (the group's aggregate current year BIE of $450x ($150x + $150x + $150x) exceeds the section 163(j) limitation of $300x), all of the domestic related current year BIE and foreign related current year BIE in Year 1 has been taken into account pursuant to the classification rule in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Thus, under paragraph (c)(5)(iv) of this section, each member's disallowed BIE carryforward is treated as from payments or accruals to unrelated parties.
(3)
Example 3: Business interest expense subject to section 163(j)
—(i)
The group's domestic related current year BIE and foreign related current year BIE for the year exceeds its section 163(j) limitation.
(A)
Facts.
During the current year (Year 1), P incurred $60x of business interest expense to domestic related parties; S1 incurred $40x of business interest expense to foreign related parties; and S2 incurred $80x of business interest expense to unrelated parties. The group's section 163(j) limitation for the year is $60x. After applying the rules in § 1.163(j)-5(b)(3), the group deducts $20x each of P, S1, and S2's current year business interest expense. Assume the group is an applicable taxpayer for purposes of section 59A.

Analysis
—(

)
Application of the absorption rule in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
Following the rules in section 163(j), the group's section 163(j) interest deduction is $60x, and the entire amount is from members' Year 1 business interest expense.
(
2
)
Application of the classification rule in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the group's $60x of aggregate current year BIE deduction is first classified as payments or accruals to related parties (pro-rata among domestic related parties and foreign related parties), and second as payments or accruals from unrelated parties. The group's total related party interest expense in Year 1, $100x (sum of the group's Year 1 domestic related current year BIE, $60x, and the group's Year 1 foreign related current year BIE, $40x), exceeds the group's aggregate current year BIE deduction of $60x. Thus, the group's aggregate current year BIE deduction will be classified, pro-rata, as from payments or accruals to domestic related parties and foreign related parties. Of the group's aggregate current year BIE deduction in Year 1, $36x is classified as a domestic related current year BIE deduction (the group's aggregate current year BIE deduction, $60x, multiplied by the ratio of domestic related current year BIE over the group's total Year 1 related party interest expense ($60x/($60x + $40x))); and $24x of the group's aggregate current year BIE deduction is classified as a foreign related current year BIE deduction (the group's section 163(j) interest deduction, $60x, multiplied by the ratio of foreign related current year BIE over the group's total Year 1 related party interest expense ($40x/($60x + $40x))).

Application of the allocation rule in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
After the
application of the classification rule in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the group has $36x of domestic related current year BIE deduction and $24x of foreign related current year BIE deduction from the group's aggregate current year BIE in Year 1. The domestic related current year BIE deduction and foreign related current year BIE deduction will be allocated to P, S1, and S2 based on each member's current year BIE deduction in Year 1.
(
i
)
Allocation of the group's domestic related current year BIE deduction status.
Because each member is deducting $20x of its Year 1 business interest expense, all three members have the same percentage of current year BIE deduction attributable to them. The percentage of current year BIE deduction attributable to each of P, S1, and S2 is 33.33% (each member's current year BIE deduction in Year 1, $20x, divided by the group's aggregate current year BIE deduction for Year 1, $60x). Thus, the amount of domestic related current year BIE deduction status allocable to each member is $12x (the group's domestic related current year BIE deduction, $36x, multiplied by the percentage of current year BIE deduction allocable to each member, 33.33%).
(
ii
)
Allocations of the group's foreign related current year BIE deduction status.
The amount of foreign related current year BIE deduction status allocable to each member is $8x (the group's foreign related current year BIE deduction, $24x, multiplied by the percentage of current year BIE deduction allocable to each member, 33.33%, as computed earlier in paragraph (f)(3) of this section (
Example 3
).
(

)
Application of the allocation rule in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
In Year 1 the group has $60x of domestic related current year BIE, of which $36x is deducted in the year (by operation of the classification rule). Therefore, the group has $24x of domestic related BIE carryforward. Similarly, the group has $40x of foreign related current year BIE in Year 1, of which $24x is deducted in the year. Therefore, the group has $16x of foreign related BIE carryforward. The $24x domestic related BIE carryforward status and $16x foreign related BIE carryforward status will be allocated to P, S1, and S2 in proportion to the amount of each member's disallowed BIE carryforward.
(
i
)
Allocation to P.
The percentage of disallowed BIE carryforward allocable to P is 33.33% (P's Year 1 disallowed BIE carryforward, $40x ($60x − $20x), divided by the group's Year 1 disallowed BIE carryforward, $120x ($60x + $40x + 80x − $60x)). Thus, the amount of domestic related BIE carryforward status allocated to P is $8x (the group's domestic related BIE carryforward, $24x, multiplied by the percentage of disallowed BIE carryforward allocable to P, 33.33%); and the amount of foreign related BIE carryforward status allocated to P is $5.33x (the group's foreign related BIE carryforward, $16x, multiplied by the percentage of disallowed BIE carryforward allocable to P, 33.33%). Under paragraph (c)(5)(iv) of this section, P's disallowed BIE carryforward that has not been allocated a status as either a domestic related BIE carryforward or a foreign related BIE carryforward will be treated as interest paid or accrued to an unrelated party. Therefore, $26.67x ($40x P's disallowed BIE carryforward −$8x domestic related BIE carryforward status allocated to P −$5.33x foreign related BIE carryforward status allocated to P) is treated as interest paid or accrued to an unrelated party.
(
ii
)
Allocation to S1.
The percentage of disallowed BIE carryforward allocable to S1 is 16.67% (S1's Year 1 disallowed BIE carryforward, $20x ($40x − $20x), divided by the group's Year 1 disallowed BIE carryforward, $120x ($60x + $40x + 80x − $60x). Thus, the amount of domestic related BIE carryforward status allocated to S1 is $4x (the group's domestic related BIE carryforward, $24x, multiplied by the percentage of disallowed BIE carryforward allocable to S1, 16.67%); and the amount of foreign related BIE carryforward status allocated to S1 is $2.67x (the group's foreign related BIE carryforward, $16x, multiplied by the percentage of disallowed BIE carryforward allocable to S1, 16.67%). Under paragraph (c)(5)(iv) of this section, S1's disallowed BIE that has not been allocated a status as either a domestic related BIE carryforward or a foreign related BIE carryforward will be treated as interest paid or accrued to an unrelated party.
Therefore, $13.33x ($20x S1's disallowed BIE carryforward −$4x domestic related BIE carryforward status allocated to S1 − $2.67x foreign related BIE carryforward status allocated to S1) is treated as interest paid or accrued to an unrelated party.
(
iii
)
Allocation to S2.
The percentage of disallowed BIE carryforward allocable to S2 is 50% (S2's Year 1 disallowed BIE carryforward, $60x ($80x − $20x), divided by the group's Year 1 disallowed BIE carryforward, $120x ($60x + $40x + 80x − $60x). Thus, the amount of domestic related BIE carryforward status allocated to S2 is $12x (the group's domestic related BIE carryforward, $24x, multiplied by the percentage of disallowed BIE carryforward allocable to S2, 50%); and the amount of foreign related BIE carryforward status allocated to S2 is $8x (the group's foreign related BIE carryforward, $16x, multiplied by the percentage of disallowed BIE carryforward allocable to S2, 50%). Under paragraph (c)(5)(iv) of this section, S2's disallowed BIE that has not been allocated a status as either a domestic related BIE carryforward or a foreign related BIE carryforward will be treated as interest paid or accrued to an unrelated party. Therefore, $40x ($60x S2's disallowed BIE carryforward −$12x domestic related BIE carryforward status allocated to S2 − $8x foreign related BIE carryforward status allocated to S2) is treated as interest paid or accrued to an unrelated party.

The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A) of this section (the facts in

Application of the absorption rule in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
Following the rules in section 163(j), each member of the group is deducting $10x of its disallowed BIE carryforward from Year 1. Therefore, the group's section 163(j) deduction for Year 2 is $30x.

Application of the classification rule in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
Under paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section, to the extent members are deducting their Year 1 disallowed BIE carryforward in Year 2, the classification rule will apply to the deduction in Year 2 after the allocation rule in paragraph (c)(5) of this section has allocated the related and unrelated party status to the member's disallowed BIE carryforward in Year 1. The allocation required under paragraph (c)(5) of this section is described in paragraph (f)(3)(i)(B)(

) of this section.

)
Use of P's allocated domestic related BIE carryforward status and foreign related BIE carryforward status.
P has $40x of Year 1 disallowed BIE carryforward, and P was allocated $8x of domestic related BIE carryforward status and $5.33x of foreign related BIE carryforward status. In Year 2, P deducts $10x of its Year 1 disallowed BIE carryforward. Under the classification rule of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, P is treated as deducting pro-rata from its allocated status of domestic related BIE carryforward and foreign related BIE carryforward. Therefore, P is treated as deducting $6x of its allocated domestic related BIE carryforward ($10x × $8x/($8x + $5.33x)), and $4x of its allocated foreign related BIE carryforward ($10x × $5.33x/$8x + $5.33x)). After Year 2, P has remaining $30x of Year 1 disallowed BIE carryforward, of which $2x has a status of domestic related BIE carryforward, $1.33x has the status of foreign related BIE carryforward, and $26.67x of interest treated as paid or accrued to unrelated parties.

)
Use of S1's allocated domestic related BIE carryforward status and foreign related BIE carryforward status.
S1 has $20x of Year 1 disallowed BIE carryforward, and S1 was allocated $4x of domestic related BIE carryforward status and $2.67x of foreign related BIE carryforward status. In Year 2, S2 deducts $10x of its Year 1 disallowed BIE carryforward. Because S2's deduction of its Year 1 disallowed BIE carryforward, $10x, exceeds its allocated domestic related BIE carryforward status ($4x) and foreign related BIE carryforward status ($2.67x), all of the allocated related party status are used up. After Year 2, all of S1's Year 1 disallowed BIE
carryforward, $10x, is treated as interest paid or accrued to an unrelated party.
(

)
Use of S2's allocated domestic related BIE carryforward status and foreign related BIE carryforward status.
S2 has $60x of Year 1 disallowed BIE carryforward, and S2 was allocated $12x of domestic related BIE carryforward status and $8x of foreign related BIE carryforward status. In Year 2, S2 deducts $10x of its Year 1 disallowed BIE carryforward. Under the classification rule of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, S2 is treated as deducting $6x of its allocated domestic related BIE carryforward ($10x × $12x/($12x + $8x)), and $4x of its allocated foreign related BIE carryforward ($10x × $8x/$8x + $12x)). After Year 2, P has remaining $50x of Year 1 disallowed BIE carryforward, of which $6x has a status of domestic related BIE carryforward, $4x has the status of foreign related BIE carryforward, and $40x of interest treated as paid or accrued to unrelated parties.

Solely for purposes of applying § 1.168(k)-2(b)(3)(iii)(A)(
1
), if a member of a consolidated group acquires depreciable property in which the group had a depreciable interest at any time within the lookback period, the member is treated as having a depreciable interest in the property prior to the acquisition. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), a consolidated group is treated as having a depreciable interest in property during the time any current or previous member of the group had a depreciable interest in the property while a member of the group. For special rules that apply when a member of a consolidated group acquires depreciable property in an intercompany transaction (as defined in § 1.1502-13(b)(1)(i)) and then leaves the group pursuant to the same series of related transactions, see paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Certain acquisitions pursuant to a series of related transactions (Stock and Asset Acquisition Rule).
Solely for purposes of applying § 1.168(k)-2(b)(3)(iii)(A)(
1
), if a series of related transactions includes one or more transactions in which property is acquired by a member of a consolidated group, and one or more transactions in which a corporation that had a depreciable interest in the property (determined without regard to the application of the Group Prior Use Rule) within the lookback period becomes a member of the group, then the member that acquires the property is treated as having a depreciable interest in the property prior to the acquisition.
(c)
Certain intercompany transfers of eligible property followed by deconsolidation
—(1)
Acquisition of eligible property by a member that leaves the group
—(i)
General rule (Consolidated Asset Acquisition Rule).
This paragraph (c)(1) applies to certain transactions pursuant to which one member of a
consolidated group (transferee member) acquires from another member of the same consolidated group (transferor member) eligible property. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(3) or (4) of this section, if a transaction satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, then § 1.168(k)-2(b)(3)(iii)(C) (providing special rules when depreciable property is acquired as part of a series of related transactions) does not apply to the transaction, and for all Federal income tax purposes—
(A) The transferee member is treated as selling the eligible property to an unrelated person on the day after the deconsolidation date in exchange for an amount of cash equal to the deemed sale amount; and
(B) Immediately after the deemed sale in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section, the transferee member is treated as purchasing deemed replacement property from an unrelated person for an amount of cash equal to the deemed sale amount.
(ii)
Requirements.
A transaction satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (c)(1)(ii) if—
(A) The transferee member's acquisition of the eligible property meets the requirements of § 1.168(k)-2(b)(3)(iii)(A) without regard to section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) or (iii) or the Group Prior Use Rule;
(B) As part of the same series of related transactions that includes the acquisition, the transferee member ceases to be a member of the consolidated group and ceases to be related, within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) or (iii), to the transferor member; and
(C) The acquired eligible property continues to be eligible property on the deconsolidation date and the day after the deconsolidation date.
(2)
Deemed acquisition of eligible property pursuant to an election under section 338 or 336(e) by a member that leaves the group
—(i)
General rule (Consolidated Deemed Acquisition Rule).
This paragraph (c)(2) applies to certain transactions pursuant to which a transferee member acquires from a transferor member the stock of another member of the same consolidated group that holds eligible property (target) in either a qualified stock purchase for which a section 338 election is made or a qualified stock disposition described in § 1.336-2(b)(1) for which a section 336(e) election is made. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(3) or (4) of this section, if a transaction satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, then § 1.168(k)-2(b)(3)(iii)(C) does not apply to the transaction, and for all Federal income tax purposes—
(A) The target is treated as selling the eligible property to an unrelated person on the day after the deconsolidation date in exchange for an amount of cash equal to the deemed sale amount; and
(B) Immediately after the deemed sale in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the target is treated as purchasing deemed replacement property from an unrelated person for an amount of cash equal to the deemed sale amount.
(ii)
Requirements.
A transaction satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii) if:
(A) The target's acquisition of the eligible property meets the requirements of § 1.168(k)-2(b)(3)(iii)(A) without regard to the Group Prior Use Rule;
(B) As part of the same series of related transactions that includes the qualified stock purchase or qualified stock disposition, the transferee member and the target cease to be members of the transferor member's consolidated group and cease to be related, within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) or (iii), to the transferor member; and
(C) The target's eligible property on the acquisition date (within the meaning of § 1.338-2(c)(1)) or the disposition date (within the meaning of § 1.336-1(b)(8)) continues to be eligible property on the deconsolidation date and the day after the deconsolidation date.
(3)
Disposition of depreciable property pursuant to the same series of related transactions.
Paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply if, following the acquisition of eligible property, the transferee member disposes of such property pursuant to the same series of related transactions that includes the property acquisition. Paragraph (c)(2)
of this section does not apply if, following the deemed acquisition of eligible property, the target disposes of such property pursuant to the same series of related transactions that includes the qualified stock purchase or qualified stock disposition. See § 1.168(k)-2(b)(3)(iii)(C) for rules regarding the transfer of property in a series of related transactions. See also § 1.168(k)-2(g)(1) for rules regarding property placed in service and disposed of in the same taxable year. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), the deemed sale of eligible property by the transferee member or the target pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) or (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section is not treated as a “disposition” of such property.
(4)
Election to not apply paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(2)(i) of this section
—(i)
In general.
If a transaction satisfies the requirements of the Consolidated Asset Acquisition Rule or the Consolidated Deemed Acquisition Rule in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) or (c)(2)(ii) of this section, respectively, the transferee member or the target nonetheless may elect not to apply the Consolidated Asset Acquisition Rule or the Consolidated Deemed Acquisition Rule, respectively, to all eligible property that is acquired or deemed acquired in such transaction. If a transferee member or target makes an election under this paragraph (c)(4) with respect to any transaction (designated transaction), then—
(A) The transferee member or target is deemed to have made such an election for all other transactions—
(
1
) That satisfy the requirements of the Consolidated Asset Acquisition Rule or the Consolidated Deemed Acquisition Rule;
(
2
) That are part of the same series of related transactions as the designated transaction; and
(
3
) In which the transferee member or target either is the same transferee member or target as in the designated transaction or is related, within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) or (iii), to the transferee member or target in the designated transaction immediately after the end of the series of related transactions; and
(B) Any eligible property acquired or deemed acquired in the designated transaction and in any transactions described in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) of this section does not satisfy either the original use requirement or the used property acquisition requirements in § 1.168(k)-2(b)(3) and, thus, is not “qualified property” within the meaning of § 1.168(k)-2(b)(1).
(ii)
Time and manner for making election
—(A)
Time to make election.
An election under this paragraph (c)(4) must be made by the due date, including extensions, for the Federal tax return for the taxable year of the transferee member or target that begins on the day after the deconsolidation date.
(B)
Manner of making election.
A transferee member or target, as applicable, makes the election under this paragraph (c)(4) by attaching a statement to its return for the taxable year that begins on the day after the deconsolidation date. The statement must describe the transaction(s) to which the Consolidated Asset Acquisition Rule or Consolidated Deemed Acquisition Rule otherwise would apply and state that the transferee member or the target, as applicable, is not claiming the additional first year depreciation deduction for any eligible property transferred in such transaction(s). If, at the time the election is made, the transferee member or the target is a member of a consolidated group, the statement is made by the agent for the group (within the meaning of § 1.1502-77(a) and (c)) on behalf of the transferee member or the target and is attached to the consolidated return of the group for the taxable year of the group that includes the taxable year of the transferee member or target that begins on the day after the deconsolidation date.
(C)
Additional procedural guidance.
The IRS may publish procedural guidance in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter) that provides alternative procedures for complying with paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.
(iii)
Revocation of election.
An election specified in this paragraph (c)(4), once made, may be revoked only by filing a request for a private letter ruling and obtaining the Commissioner of Internal Revenue's written consent to revoke the election. The Commissioner may
grant a request to revoke the election if the taxpayer acted reasonably and in good faith, and the revocation will not prejudice the interests of the Government. See generally § 301.9100-3 of this chapter. An election specified in this paragraph (c)(4) may not be revoked through a request under section 446(e) to change the taxpayer's method of accounting.
(d)
Examples.
For purposes of the examples in this section, unless otherwise stated: Parent, S, B, Controlled, and T are members of a consolidated group of which Parent is the common parent (Parent group); Parent owns all of the only class of stock of each of S, B, Controlled, and T; X is the common parent of the X consolidated group (X group); no member of the X group is related, within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) or (iii) (Related), to any member of the Parent group; G and U are corporations that are not Related to each other or to any member of the Parent group or the X group; the Equipment in each example is eligible property; no member of the Parent group or the X group has had a depreciable interest in the Equipment within the lookback period; § 1.168(k)-2(b)(3)(iii)(A)(
1
) is referred to as the No Prior Use Requirement; and § 1.168(k)-2(b)(3)(iii)(A)(
2
) is referred to as the Unrelated Party Requirement. The rules of this section are illustrated by the following examples.
(1)
Example 1: Intercompany sale of eligible property
—(i)
Facts.
S has a depreciable interest in Equipment #1. In 2018, S sells Equipment #1 to B, and B places Equipment #1 in service in the same year.
(ii)
Analysis.
B's acquisition of Equipment #1 does not satisfy either the No Prior Use Requirement or the Unrelated Party Requirement. Under the Group Prior Use Rule, B is treated as previously having a depreciable interest in Equipment #1 because B (a member of the Parent group) acquired Equipment #1 and S, while a member of the Parent group, had a depreciable interest in Equipment #1 within the lookback period. In addition, B acquires Equipment #1 from S, and B and S are Related at the time of the acquisition. Accordingly, B is not eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for Equipment #1 in 2018.
(2)
Example 2: Sale outside of the consolidated group followed by a reacquisition within the lookback period
—(i)
Facts.
S has a depreciable interest in Equipment #2. In 2018, S sells Equipment #2 to G. In 2019, in an unrelated transaction, B acquires Equipment #2 from G and places it in service in the same year.
(ii)
Analysis.
B's acquisition of Equipment #2 does not satisfy the No Prior Use Requirement as a result of the Group Prior Use Rule. Pursuant to the Group Prior Use Rule, B is treated as previously having a depreciable interest in Equipment #2 because B is a member of the Parent group and S, while a member of the Parent group, had a depreciable interest in Equipment #2 within the lookback period. Thus, B is not eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for Equipment #2 in 2019. The result would be the same if, after selling Equipment #2 to G, S had ceased to be a member of the Parent group prior to B's acquisition of Equipment #2.
(iii)
Sale outside of the consolidated group followed by a reacquisition beyond the lookback period.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, except that B acquires Equipment #2 and places it in service in 2024 instead of 2019. B's acquisition of Equipment #2 satisfies the No Prior Use Requirement. B would not be treated as previously having a depreciable interest in Equipment #2 under the Group Prior Use Rule because the Parent group did not have a depreciable interest in Equipment #2 within the lookback period. Further, B itself did not have a prior depreciable interest in Equipment #2 within the lookback period. Assuming all other requirements in § 1.168(k)-2 are satisfied, B is eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for Equipment #2 in 2024. The result would be the same if S, rather than B, acquired and placed in service Equipment #2 in 2024.
(3)
Example 3: Acquisition of eligible property by the consolidated group followed by a corporation with a prior depreciable interest joining the group as part of the same series of related transactions
—(i)
Facts.
G has a depreciable interest in Equipment #3. During 2018, G sells Equipment #3 to U. In a series of related transactions that does not include the 2018 sale, Parent acquires all of the stock of G in 2019. Later in 2019, B purchases Equipment #3 from U and places it in service immediately thereafter.
(ii)
Analysis.
B's acquisition of Equipment #3 does not satisfy the No Prior Use Requirement as a result of the Stock and Asset Acquisition Rule. In a series of related transactions, G became a member of the Parent group and B acquired Equipment #3. Because G had a depreciable interest in Equipment #3 within the lookback period, B is treated as having a depreciable interest in Equipment #3 under the Stock and Asset Acquisition Rule. Thus, B is not eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for Equipment #3 in 2019.
(iii)
B purchases Equipment #3 in 2024.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, except that B acquires and places in service Equipment #3 in 2024 instead of 2019. B is not treated under the Stock and Asset Acquisition Rule as having a prior depreciable interest in Equipment #3 because G (which sold Equipment #3 to U in 2018) did not have a depreciable interest in Equipment #3 within the lookback period. In addition, B is not treated under the Group Prior Use Rule as having a prior depreciable interest in Equipment #3 at the time of the purchase because neither G nor any other member of the Parent group had a depreciable interest in Equipment #3 while a member of the Parent group within the lookback period. Further, B itself did not have a depreciable interest in Equipment #3 within the lookback period. Accordingly, B's acquisition of Equipment #3 satisfies the No Prior Use Requirement. Assuming all other requirements in § 1.168(k)-2 are satisfied, B is eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for Equipment #3 in 2024.
(iv)
No series of related transactions.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, except that Parent's acquisition of the G stock and B's purchase of Equipment #3 are not part of the same series of related transactions. Because B's purchase of Equipment #3 and Parent's acquisition of the G stock did not occur pursuant to the same series of related transactions, the Stock and Asset Acquisition Rule does not apply. In addition, B is not treated under the Group Prior Use Rule as having a prior depreciable interest in Equipment #3 at the time of the purchase because neither G nor any other member of the Parent group had a depreciable interest in Equipment #3 while a member of the Parent group within the lookback period. Further, B itself did not have a depreciable interest in Equipment #3 within the lookback period. Accordingly, B's acquisition of Equipment #3 satisfies the No Prior Use Requirement. Assuming all other requirements in § 1.168(k)-2 are satisfied, B is eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for Equipment #3 in 2019.
(4)
Example 4: Termination of the consolidated group
—(i)
Facts.
S owns Equipment #4. In 2018, S sells Equipment #4 to U. In 2019, X acquires all of the stock of Parent in a transaction that causes the Parent group to terminate and Parent, B, and S to become members of the X group. In 2020, in a transaction that is not part of a series of related transactions, B purchases Equipment #4 from U and places it in service in the same year.
(ii)
Analysis.
B's acquisition of Equipment #4 satisfies the No Prior Use Requirement. The Group Prior Use Rule does not apply to treat B as having a prior depreciable interest in Equipment #4 because B is a member of the X group and no member of the X group had a depreciable interest in Equipment #4 while a member of the X group within the lookback period. Further, B itself did not have a prior depreciable interest in Equipment #4 within the lookback period. Assuming all other requirements in § 1.168(k)-2 are satisfied, B is eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for Equipment #4 in 2020.
(iii)
S purchases Equipment #4 in 2020.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, except that S rather than B purchases and places in service Equipment #4 in 2020. S's purchase of Equipment #4 does not satisfy the No Prior Use Requirement because
S had a depreciable interest in Equipment #4 within the lookback period. Thus, S is not eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for Equipment #4 in 2020.
(iv)
Acquisitions are part of the same series of related transactions.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, except that X's acquisition of the Parent stock and B's purchase of Equipment #4 are part of the same series of related transactions. Thus, pursuant to the same series of related transactions, S became a member of the X group and B (another member of the X group) acquired Equipment #4. Because S had a depreciable interest in Equipment #4 within the lookback period, B is treated as having a depreciable interest in Equipment #4 under the Stock and Asset Acquisition Rule. As a result, B's acquisition of Equipment #4 does not satisfy the No Prior Use Requirement, and B is not eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for Equipment #4 in 2020.
(5)
Example 5: Intercompany sale of eligible property followed by sale of B stock as part of the same series of related transactions
—(i)
Facts.
S has a depreciable interest in Equipment #5. On January 1, 2019, B purchases Equipment #5 from S and places it in service. On June 1, 2019, as part of the same series of related transactions that includes B's purchase of Equipment #5, Parent sells all of the stock of B to X. Thus, B leaves the Parent group at the end of the day on June 1, 2019, and B is a member of the X group starting June 2, 2019. See § 1.1502-76(b). As of June 1, 2019, Equipment #5 remains eligible property.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Application of the Consolidated Asset Acquisition Rule.
B was a member of the Parent group when it acquired Equipment #5. Because S, another member of the Parent group, had a depreciable interest in Equipment #5 while a member of the group within the lookback period, B would be treated as having a prior depreciable interest in Equipment #5 under the Group Prior Use Rule and B's acquisition of Equipment #5 would not satisfy the No Prior Use Requirement. However, B's acquisition of Equipment #5 satisfies the requirements of the Consolidated Asset Acquisition Rule in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. First, B's acquisition of Equipment #5 meets the requirements of § 1.168(k)-2(b)(3)(iii)(A) without regard to the related-party tests under section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) or (iii) or the Group Prior Use Rule. Second, as part of the same series of related transactions that includes B's acquisition of Equipment #5, B ceases to be a member of the Parent group and ceases to be Related to S. Third, Equipment #5 continues to be eligible property on the deconsolidation date (June 1, 2019).
(B)
Consequences of the Consolidated Asset Acquisition Rule.
Under the Consolidated Asset Acquisition Rule, B is treated for all Federal income tax purposes as transferring Equipment #5 to an unrelated person on June 2, 2019, in exchange for an amount of cash equal to the deemed sale amount and, immediately thereafter, acquiring deemed replacement property (New Equipment #5) from an unrelated person for an amount of cash equal to the deemed sale amount. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements in § 1.168(k)-2 are satisfied, B is eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation for an amount equal to the deemed sale amount for the taxable year in which it places New Equipment #5 in service.
(iii)
Distribution of B.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, except that, on June 1, 2019, Parent distributes the stock of B to its shareholders (which are not Related to S) in a distribution that qualifies for nonrecognition under section 355(a). Accordingly, the Consolidated Asset Acquisition Rule applies. As in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, assuming all other requirements in § 1.168(k)-2 are satisfied, B is eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for an amount equal to the deemed sale amount for the taxable year in which it places New Equipment #5 in service.
(iv)
Equipment #5 ceases to be eligible property.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, except that, on June 1, 2019, Equipment #5 is no longer eligible property. The Consolidated Asset Acquisition Rule does not apply because B's acquisition
of Equipment #5 fails to satisfy the requirement in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C) of this section that the acquired eligible property continue to be eligible property on the deconsolidation date. Therefore, B's acquisition of Equipment #5 on January 1, 2019, fails to satisfy the No Prior Use Requirement. Under the Group Prior Use Rule, B is treated as having a prior depreciable interest in Equipment #5 because B is a member of the Parent group and S, while a member of the Parent group, had a depreciable interest in Equipment #5 within the lookback period. Accordingly, B is not eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction with respect to Equipment #5 in 2019.
(6)
Example 6: Intercompany sale of member stock for which a section 338(h)(10) election is made followed by sale of B stock as part of a series of related transactions
—(i)
Facts.
S owns all of the stock of T, which has a depreciable interest in Equipment #6. On January 1, 2019, B purchases all of the T stock from S in a qualified stock purchase for which a section 338(h)(10) election is made. On June 1, 2019, as part of the same series of related transactions that includes B's purchase of the T stock, Parent sells all of the stock of B to X. Thus, B and T leave the Parent group at the end of the day on June 1, 2019, and B and T are members of the X group starting June 2, 2019. See § 1.1502-76(b). As of June 1, 2019, Equipment #6 remains eligible property.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Section 338(h)(10) election.
Pursuant to the section 338(h)(10) election, Old T is treated as transferring all of its assets, including Equipment #6, to an unrelated person in a single transaction in exchange for consideration at the close of the acquisition date (January 1, 2019), and New T is treated as acquiring all of its assets, including Equipment #6, from an unrelated person in exchange for consideration. Old T is deemed to liquidate following the deemed asset sale. See § 1.338-1(a)(1).
(B)
Application of the Consolidated Deemed Acquisition Rule.
New T was a member of the Parent group when New T acquired Equipment #6 from an unrelated person. Because Old T, another member of the Parent group, had a depreciable interest in Equipment #6 while a member of the group within the lookback period, New T would be treated as having a prior depreciable interest in Equipment #6 under the Group Prior Use Rule and New T's acquisition of Equipment #6 would not satisfy the No Prior Use Requirement. However, New T's acquisition of Equipment #6 satisfies the requirements of the Consolidated Deemed Acquisition Rule in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. First, New T's acquisition of Equipment #6 meets the requirements of § 1.168(k)-2(b)(3)(iii)(A) without regard to the Group Prior Use Rule. Second, as part of the same series of related transactions that includes B's qualified stock purchase of the T stock, B and New T cease to be members of the Parent group and cease to be Related to S. Third, Equipment #6 continues to be eligible property on the deconsolidation date (June 1, 2019).
(C)
Consequences of the Consolidated Deemed Acquisition Rule.
Under the Consolidated Deemed Acquisition Rule, New T is treated for all Federal income tax purposes as transferring Equipment #6 to an unrelated person on June 2, 2019, in exchange for an amount of cash equal to the deemed sale amount and, immediately thereafter, acquiring deemed replacement property (New Equipment #6) from an unrelated person for an amount of cash equal to the deemed sale amount. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements in § 1.168(k)-2 are satisfied, New T is eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for an amount equal to the deemed sale amount for the taxable year in which it places New Equipment #6 in service.
(iii)
T owns multiple assets.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, except that, in addition to Equipment #6, T also owns Asset A (depreciable real estate that is not eligible property). With respect to Equipment #6, the results are the same as in paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section. However, the Consolidated Deemed Acquisition Rule does not apply to Asset A because it is not eligible property. Accordingly, New T is not treated as transferring Asset A to an unrelated
person on June 2, 2019 and then, immediately thereafter, acquiring deemed replacement property for Asset A. If Equipment #6 had ceased to be eligible property as of June 1, 2019, the Consolidated Deemed Acquisition Rule also would not apply to Equipment #6.
(7)
Example 7: Section 355 transaction following a section 338(h)(10) transaction pursuant to the same series of related transactions
—(i)
Facts.
T has a depreciable interest in Equipment #7. On January 1, 2019, Parent contributes all of the stock of T to B in exchange for common and non-voting preferred stock of B and sells the non-voting preferred stock of B to U pursuant to a binding commitment entered into prior to the contribution (T Exchange). The non-voting preferred stock is not treated as “stock” for purposes of section 1504(a). See section 1504(a)(4). Parent and B jointly make an election under section 338(h)(10) with respect to the T Exchange. On June 1, 2019, as part of the same series of related transactions that includes the T Exchange, Parent contributes the stock of B and assets comprising an active trade or business (within the meaning of section 355(b)) to Controlled in exchange for Controlled common stock and then distributes the Controlled common stock to Parent's shareholders in a distribution qualifying under section 355(a) (Controlled Distribution). In the Controlled Distribution, T and B cease to be Related to Parent. Equipment #7 remains eligible property on June 1, 2019.
(ii)
Section 338(h)(10) election.
Immediately after the Controlled Distribution, Parent and B are not related as determined under section 338(h)(3)(A)(iii). Further, B's basis in the T stock is not determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the adjusted basis of the T stock in the hands of Parent, and the stock is not acquired in an exchange to which section 351, 354, 355, or 356 applies. Accordingly, the T Exchange qualifies as a “purchase” within the meaning of section 338(h)(3). Pursuant to the section 338(h)(10) election, Old T is treated as transferring all of its assets, including Equipment #7, to an unrelated person in a single transaction in exchange for consideration at the close of the acquisition date (January 1, 2019), and New T is treated as acquiring all of its assets, including Equipment #7, from an unrelated person in exchange for consideration. Old T is deemed to liquidate following the deemed asset sale. See § 1.338-1(a)(1).
(iii)
Application of the Consolidated Deemed Acquisition Rule.
New T was a member of the Parent group when New T acquired Equipment #7 from an unrelated person. Because Old T, another member of the Parent group, had a depreciable interest in Equipment #7 while a member of the group within the lookback period, New T would be treated as having a prior depreciable interest in Equipment #7 under the Group Prior Use Rule and New T's acquisition of Equipment #7 would not satisfy the No Prior Use Requirement. However, New T's acquisition of Equipment #7 satisfies the requirements of the Consolidated Deemed Acquisition Rule in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Thus, New T is treated for all Federal income tax purposes as transferring Equipment #7 to an unrelated person on June 2, 2019, in exchange for an amount of cash equal to the deemed sale amount and, immediately thereafter, acquiring deemed replacement property (New Equipment #7) from an unrelated person for an amount of cash equal to the deemed sale amount. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements in § 1.168(k)-2 are satisfied, New T is eligible to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for an amount equal to the deemed sale amount for the taxable year in which it places New Equipment #7 in service.
(e)
Applicability dates
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, this section applies to—
(i) Depreciable property acquired after September 27, 2017, by the taxpayer and placed in service by the taxpayer during or after the taxpayer's taxable year that begins on or after January 1, 2021;
(ii) A specified plant for which the taxpayer properly made an election to apply section 168(k)(5) and that is planted, or grafted to a plant that was previously planted, by the taxpayer during or after the taxpayer's taxable year that begins on or after January 1, 2021; and
(iii) Components acquired or self-constructed after September 27, 2017, of larger self-constructed property described in § 1.168(k)-2(c)(2) and placed in service by the taxpayer during or after the taxpayer's taxable year that begins on or after January 1, 2021.
(2)
Early application of this section and § 1.168(k)-2
—(i)
In general.
Subject to paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section, and provided that all members of a consolidated group consistently apply the same set of rules, a taxpayer may choose to apply both the rules of this section and the rules of § 1.168(k)-2, in their entirety and in a consistent manner, to—
(A) Depreciable property acquired after September 27, 2017, by the taxpayer and placed in service by the taxpayer during a taxable year ending on or after September 28, 2017;
(B) A specified plant for which the taxpayer properly made an election to apply section 168(k)(5) and that is planted, or grafted to a plant that was previously planted, after September 27, 2017, by the taxpayer during a taxable year ending on or after September 28, 2017; and
(C) Components acquired or self-constructed after September 27, 2017, of larger self-constructed property described in § 1.168(k)-2(c)(2) and placed in service by the taxpayer during a taxable year ending on or after September 28, 2017.
(ii)
Early application to certain transactions.
In the case of property described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section that is acquired in a transaction that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) or (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the taxpayer may apply the rules of this section and the rules of § 1.168(k)-2, in their entirety and in a consistent manner, to such property only if those rules are applied, in their entirety and in a consistent manner, by all parties to the transaction (including the transferor member, the transferee member, and the target, as applicable) and the consolidated groups of which they are members, for the taxable year(s) in which the transaction occurs and the taxable year(s) that includes the day after the deconsolidation date.
(iii)
Bound by early application.
Once a taxpayer applies the rules of this section and the rules of § 1.168(k)-2, in their entirety, for a taxable year, the taxpayer must continue to apply the rules of this section and the rules of § 1.168(k)-2, in their entirety, for the taxpayer's subsequent taxable years.

# Administrative Provisions and Other Rules
§ 1.1502-75
Filing of consolidated returns.
(a)
Privilege of filing consolidated returns
—(1)
Exercise of privilege for first consolidated return year.
A group which did not file a consolidated return for the immediately preceding taxable year may file a consolidated return in lieu of separate returns for the taxable year, provided that each corporation which has been a member during any part of the taxable year for which the consolidated return is to be filed consents (in the manner provided in paragraph (b) of this section) to the regulations under section 1502. If a group wishes to exercise its privilege of filing a consolidated return, such consolidated return must be filed not later than the last day prescribed by law (including extensions of time) for the filing of the common parent's return. Such consolidated return may not be withdrawn after such last day (but the group may change the basis of its return at any time prior to such last day).
(2)
Continued filing requirement.
A group which filed (or was required to file) a consolidated return for the immediately preceding taxable year is required to file a consolidated return for the taxable year unless it has an election to discontinue filing consolidated returns under paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
How consent for first consolidated year exercised
—(1)
General rule.
The consent of a corporation referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is made by such corporation joining in the making of the consolidated return for such year. A corporation is deemed to have joined in the making of such return for such year if it files a Form 1122 (or successor form) in the manner
specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
(2)
Consent under facts and circumstances
—(i)
In general.
If a member of the group fails to file Form 1122 (or successor form), the Commissioner may under the facts and circumstances determine that such member has joined in the making of a consolidated return by such group. The following circumstances, among others, will be taken into account in making this determination—
(A) Whether or not the income and deductions of the member were included in the consolidated return;
(B) Whether or not a separate return was filed by the member for that taxable year; and
(C) Whether or not the member was included in the affiliations schedule, Form 851 (or successor form).
(ii)
Treatment of member.
If the Commissioner determines that the member described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section has joined in the making of the consolidated return, such member is treated as if it had filed a Form 1122 (or successor form) for such year for purposes of paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
(3)
Failure to consent due to mistake.
If any member has failed to join in the making of a consolidated return under either paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section, then the tax liability of each member of the group is determined on the basis of separate returns unless the common parent corporation establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the failure of such member to join in the making of the consolidated return was due to a mistake of law or fact, or to inadvertence. In such case, such member is treated as if it had filed a Form 1122 (or successor form) for such year for purposes of paragraph (h)(2) of this section, and thus joined in the making of the consolidated return for such year.
(c)
Election to discontinue filing consolidated returns
—(1)
Good cause
—(i)
In general.
Notwithstanding that a consolidated return is required for a taxable year, the Commissioner, upon application by the common parent, may for good cause shown grant permission to a group to discontinue filing consolidated returns. Any such application must be made through a letter ruling request filed not later than the 90th day before the due date of the consolidated return for the taxable year (including extensions). In addition, if an amendment of the Code, or other law affecting the computation of tax liability, is enacted and the enactment is effective for a taxable year ending before or within 90 days after the date of enactment, then application for such a taxable year may be made not later than the 180th day after the date of enactment, and if the application is approved the permission to discontinue filing consolidated returns will apply to such taxable year notwithstanding that a consolidated return has already been filed for such year.
(ii)
Substantial adverse change in law affecting tax liability.
Ordinarily, the Commissioner will grant a group permission to discontinue filing consolidated returns if the net result of all amendments to the Code or regulations with effective dates commencing within the taxable year has a substantial adverse effect on the consolidated tax liability of the group for such year relative to what the aggregate tax liability would be if the members of the group filed separate returns for such year. Thus, for example, assume P and S filed a consolidated return for the calendar year 1966 and that the provisions of the Code have been amended by a bill which was enacted by Congress in 1966, but which is first effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1967. Assume further that P makes a timely application to discontinue filing consolidated returns. In order to determine whether the amendments have a substantial adverse effect on the consolidated tax liability for 1967, relative to what the aggregate tax liability would be if the members of the group filed separate returns for 1967, the difference between the tax liability of the group computed on a consolidated basis and taking into account the changes in the law effective for 1967 and the aggregate tax liability of the members of the group computed as if each such member filed separate returns for such year (also taking into account such changes) shall be compared with the difference between the tax liability of such group
for 1967 computed on a consolidated basis without regard to the changes in the law effective in such year and the aggregate tax liability of the members of the group computed as if separate returns had been filed by such members for such year without regard to the changes in the law effective in such year.
(iii)
Other factors.
In addition, the Commissioner will take into account other factors in determining whether good cause exists for granting permission to discontinue filing consolidated returns beginning with the taxable year, including:
(
a
) Changes in law or circumstances, including changes which do not affect Federal income tax liability,
(
b
) Changes in law which are first effective in the taxable year and which result in a substantial reduction in the consolidated net operating loss (or consolidated unused investment credit) for such year relative to what the aggregate net operating losses (or investment credits) would be if the members of the group filed separate returns for such year, and
(
c
) Changes in the Code or regulations which are effective prior to the taxable year but which first have a substantial adverse effect on the filing of a consolidated return relative to the filing of separate returns by members of the group in such year.
(2)
Discretion of Commissioner to grant blanket permission
—(i)
(i)
Permission to all groups.
The Commissioner, in the Commissioner's discretion, may grant all groups permission to discontinue filing consolidated returns if any provision of the Code or regulations has been amended and such amendment is of the type which could have a substantial adverse effect on the filing of consolidated returns by substantially all groups, relative to the filing of separate returns. Ordinarily, the permission to discontinue applies with respect to the taxable year of each group which includes the effective date of such an amendment.
(ii)
Permission to a class of groups.
The Commissioner, in the Commissioner's discretion, may grant a particular class of groups permission to discontinue filing consolidated returns if any provision of the Code or regulations has been amended and such amendment is of the type which could have a substantial adverse effect on the filing of consolidated returns by substantially all such groups relative to the filing of separate returns. Ordinarily, the permission to discontinue applies with respect to the taxable year of each group within the class which includes the effective date of such an amendment.
(3)
Time and manner for exercising election.
If, under subparagraph (1) or (2) of this paragraph, a group has an election to discontinue filing consolidated returns for any taxable year and such group wishes to exercise such election, then the common parent must file a separate return for such year on or before the last day prescribed by law (including extensions of time) for the filing of the consolidated return for such year. See section 6081 (relating to extensions of time for filing returns).
(d)
When a group remains in existence
—(1)
General rule.
A group remains in existence for a tax year if the common parent remains as the common parent and at least one subsidiary that was affiliated with it at the end of the prior year remains affiliated with it at the beginning of the year, whether or not one or more corporations have ceased to be subsidiaries at any time after the group was formed. Thus, for example, assume that corporation P acquires the sole outstanding share of stock of S on January 1, year 1, and that P and S file a consolidated return for the year 1 calendar year. On May 1, year 2, P acquires the sole outstanding share of stock of S1 and, on July 1, year 2, P sells the S share. The group (consisting originally of P and S) remains in existence in year 2 because P remained the common parent and, S, a subsidiary that was affiliated with P at the end of year 1, remained affiliated with P at the beginning of year 2.
(2)
Common parent no longer in existence
—(i)
Mere change in identity.
For purposes of this paragraph, the common parent corporation shall remain as the common parent irrespective of a mere change in identity, form, or place of organization of such common parent corporation (see section 368(a)(1)(F)).
(ii)
Transfer of assets to subsidiary.
The group shall be considered as remaining in existence notwithstanding that the common parent is no longer in existence if the members of the affiliated group succeed to and become the owners of substantially all of the assets of such former parent and there remains one or more chains of includible corporations connected through stock ownership with a common parent corporation which is an includible corporation and which was a member of the group prior to the date such former parent ceases to exist. For purposes of applying paragraph (f)(2)(i) of § 1.1502-1 to separate return years ending on or before the date on which the former parent ceases to exist, such former parent, and not the new common parent, shall be considered to be the corporation described in such paragraph.
(iii)
Taxable years.
If a transfer of assets described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph is an acquisition to which section 381(a) applies and if the group files a consolidated return for the taxable year in which the acquisition occurs, then for purposes of section 381:
(
a
) The former common parent shall not close its taxable year merely because of the acquisition, and all taxable years of such former parent ending on or before the date of acquisition shall be treated as taxable years of the acquiring corporation, and
(
b
) The corporation acquiring the assets shall close its taxable year as of the date of acquisition, and all taxable years of such corporation ending on or before the date of acquisition shall be treated as taxable years of the transferor corporation.
(iv)
Exception.
With respect to acquisitions occurring before January 1, 1971, subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph shall not apply if the group, in its income tax return, treats the taxable year of the former common parent as having closed as of the date of acquisition.
(3)
Reverse acquisitions
—(i)
In general.
If a corporation (hereinafter referred to as the “first corporation”) or any member of a group of which the first corporation is the common parent acquires after October 1, 1965:
(
a
) Stock of another corporation (hereinafter referred to as the second corporation), and as a result the second corporation becomes (or would become but for the application of this subparagraph) a member of a group of which the first corporation is the common parent, or
(
b
) Substantially all the assets of the second corporation,
in exchange (in whole or in part) for stock of the first corporation, and the stockholders (immediately before the acquisition) of the second corporation, as a result of owning stock of the second corporation, own (immediately after the acquisition) more than 50 percent of the fair market value of the outstanding stock of the first corporation, then any group of which the first corporation was the common parent immediately before the acquisition shall cease to exist as of the date of acquisition, and any group of which the second corporation was the common parent immediately before the acquisition shall be treated as remaining in existence (with the first corporation becoming the common parent of the group). Thus, assume that corporations P and S comprised group PS (P being the common parent), that P was merged into corporation T (the common parent of a group composed of T and corporation U), and that the shareholders of P immediately before the merger, as a result of owning stock in P, own 90 percent of the fair market value of T's stock immediately after the merger. The group of which P was the common parent is treated as continuing in existence with T and U being added as members of the group, and T taking the place of P as the common parent.
For purposes of determining under (
a
) of this subdivision whether the second corporation becomes (or would become) a member of the group of which the first corporation is the common parent, and for purposes of determining whether the former stockholders of the second corporation own more than 50 percent of the outstanding stock of the first corporation, there shall be taken into account any acquisitions or redemptions of the stock of either corporation which are pursuant to a plan
of acquisition described in (
a
) or (
b
) of this subdivision.
(ii)
Prior ownership of stock.
For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, if the first corporation, and any members of a group of which the first corporation is the common parent, have continuously owned for a period of at least 5 years ending on the date of the acquisition an aggregate of at least 25 percent of the fair market value of the outstanding stock of the second corporation, then the first corporation (and any subsidiary which owns stock of the second corporation immediately before the acquisition) shall, as a result of owning such stock, be treated as owning (immediately after the acquisition) a percentage of the fair market value of the first corporation's outstanding stock which bears the same ratio to (
a
) the percentage of the fair market value of all the stock of the second corporation owned immediately before the acquisition by the first corporation and its subsidiaries as (
b
) the fair market value of the total outstanding stock of the second corporation immediately before the acquisition bears to (
c
) the sum of (
1
) the fair market value, immediately before the acquisition, of the total outstanding stock of the first corporation, and (
2
) the fair market value, immediately before the acquisition, of the total outstanding stock of the second corporation (other than any such stock owned by the first corporation and any of its subsidiaries). For example, assume that corporation P owns stock in corporation T having a fair market value of $100,000, that P acquires the remaining stock of T from individuals in exchange for stock of P, that immediately before the acquisition the total outstanding stock of T had a fair market value of $150,000, and that immediately before the acquisition the total outstanding stock of P had a fair market value of $200,000. Assuming P owned at least 25 percent of the fair market value of T's stock for 5 years, then for purposes of this subparagraph, P is treated as owning (immediately after the acquisition) 40 percent of the fair market value of its own outstanding stock, determined as follows:

# [$150,000/($200,000 + $50,000)] × 662/3% = 40%.
Thus, if the former individual stockholders of T own, immediately after the acquisition more than 10 percent of the fair market value of the outstanding stock of P as a result of owning stock of T, the group of which T was the common parent is treated as continuing in existence with P as the common parent, and the group of which P was the common parent before the acquisition ceases to exist.
(iii)
Election.
The provisions of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph shall not apply to any acquisition occurring in a taxable year ending after October 7, 1969, unless the first corporation elects to have such subdivision apply. The election shall be made by means of a statement, signed by any officer who is duly authorized to act on behalf of the first corporation, stating that the corporation elects to have the provisions of § 1.1502-75(d)(3)(ii) apply and identifying the acquisition to which such provisions will apply. The statement shall be filed, on or before the due date (including extensions of time) of the return for the group's first consolidated return year ending after the date of the acquisition, with the internal revenue officer with whom such return is required to be filed.
(iv)
Transfer of assets to subsidiary.
This subparagraph shall not apply to a transaction to which subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph applies.
(v)
Taxable years.
If, in a transaction described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the first corporation files a consolidated return for the first taxable year ending after the date of acquisition, then:
(
a
) The first corporation, and each corporation which, immediately before the acquisition, is a member of the group of which the first corporation is the common parent, shall close its taxable year as of the date of acquisition, and each such corporation shall, immediately after the acquisition, change to the taxable year of the second corporation, and
(
b
) If the acquisition is a transaction described in section 381(a)(2), then for purposes of section 381:
(
1
) All taxable years ending on or before the date of acquisition, of the first corporation and each corporation which, immediately before the acquisition, is a member of the group of which the first corporation is the common parent, shall be treated as taxable years of the transferor corporation, and
(
2
) The second corporation shall not close its taxable year merely because of such acquisition, and all taxable years ending on or before the date of acquisition, of the second corporation and each corporation which, immediately before the acquisition, is a member of any group of which the second corporation is the common parent, shall be treated as taxable years of the acquiring corporation.
(vi)
Exception.
With respect to acquisitions occurring before April 17, 1968, subdivision (v) of this subparagraph shall not apply if the parties to the transaction, in their income tax returns, treat subdivision (i) as not affecting the closing of taxable years or the operation of section 381.
(4) [Reserved]
(e)
Failure to include subsidiary.
If a consolidated return is required for the taxable year under the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the tax liability of all members of the group for such year shall be computed on a consolidated basis even though:
(1) Separate returns are filed by one or more members of the group, or
(2) There has been a failure to include in the consolidated return the income of any member of the group.
If subparagraph (1) of this paragraph applies, the amounts assessed or paid upon the basis of separate returns shall be considered as having been assessed or paid upon the basis of a consolidated return.
(f)
Inclusion of one or more corporations not members of the group
—(1)
Method of determining tax liability.
If a consolidated return includes the income of a corporation which was not a member of the group at any time during the consolidated return year, the tax liability of such corporation will be determined upon the basis of a separate return (or a consolidated return of another group, if paragraph (a)(2) or (b)(3) of this section applies), and the consolidated return will be considered as including only the income of the corporations which were members of the group during that taxable year. If a consolidated return includes the income of two or more corporations which were not members of the group but which constitute another group, the tax liability of such corporations will be computed in the same manner as if separate returns had been made by such corporations unless the Commissioner upon application approves the making of a consolidated return for the other group or unless under paragraph (a)(2) of this section a consolidated return is required for the other group.
(2)
Allocation of tax liability.
In any case in which amounts have been assessed and paid upon the basis of a consolidated return and the tax liability of one or more of the corporations included in the consolidated return is to be computed in the manner described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the amounts so paid shall be allocated between the group composed of the corporations properly included in the consolidated return and each of the corporations the tax liability of which is to be computed on a separate basis (or on the basis of a consolidated return of another group) in such manner as the corporations which were included in the consolidated return may, subject to the approval of the Commissioner, agree upon or in the absence of an agreement upon the method used in allocating the tax liability of the members of the group under the provisions of section 1552(a).
(g)
Computing periods of limitation
—(1)
Income incorrectly included in consolidated return.
If:
(i) A consolidated return is filed by a group for the taxable year, and
(ii) The tax liability of a corporation whose income is included in such return must be computed on the basis of a separate return (or on the basis of a consolidated return with another group), then for the purpose of computing any period of limitation with respect to such separate return (or such other consolidated return), the filing of such consolidated return by the group shall be considered as the making of a return by such corporation.
(2)
Income incorrectly included in separate returns.
If a consolidated return is required for the taxable year under the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the filing of separate returns by the members of the group for such year shall not be considered as the making of a return for the purpose of computing any period of limitation with respect to such consolidated return unless there is attached to each such separate return a statement setting forth:
(i) The most recent taxable year of the member for which its income was included in a consolidated return, and
(ii) The reasons for the group's belief that a consolidated return is not required for the taxable year.
(h)
Method of filing return and forms
—(1)
Consolidated return made by common parent or agent.
The consolidated return must be made on Form 1120,
U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return
(or any successor form), for the group by the common parent or the agent for the group as provided in § 1.1502-77(c). The consolidated return, with Form 851,
Affiliations Schedule
(or any successor form), attached, must be filed with the service center with which the common parent would have filed a separate return.
(2)
Filing of Form 1122 for first year.
If, under the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a group wishes to file a consolidated return for a taxable year, then a Form 1122 (
Authorization and Consent of Subsidiary Corporation To Be Included in a Consolidated Income Tax Return
) (or successor form) must be executed by each subsidiary. The group must attach either executed Forms 1122 (or successor forms) or unsigned copies of the completed Forms 1122 (or successor forms) to the consolidated return. If the group submits unsigned Forms 1122 (or successor forms) with its return, it must retain the signed originals in its records in the manner required by § 1.6001-1(e). Form 1122 (or any successor form) is not required for a taxable year if a consolidated return was filed (or was required to be filed) by the group for the immediately preceding taxable year.
(3)
Persons qualified to execute returns and forms.
Each return or form required to be made or prepared by a corporation must be executed by the person authorized under section 6062 to execute returns of separate corporations.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Statements and schedules for subsidiaries.
The statement of gross income and deductions and the schedules required by the instructions on the return shall be prepared and filed in columnar form so that the details of the items of gross income, deductions, and credits for each member may be readily audited. Such statements and schedules shall include in columnar form a reconciliation of surplus for each corporation, and a reconciliation of consolidated surplus. Consolidated balance sheets as of the beginning and close of the taxable year of the group, taken from the books of the members, shall accompany the consolidated return and shall be prepared in a form similar to that required for reconciliation of surplus.
(k)
Cross-reference.
See § 1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(7) for special rules regarding filing consolidated returns when a section 338(h)(10) election is made for a target acquired from a selling consolidated group.
(l)
Effective/applicability dates.
Paragraph (d)(1) of this section applies to taxable years for which the due date of the original return (without regard to extensions) is on or after September 17, 2008.

§ 1.1502-76
Taxable year of members of group.
(a)
Taxable year of members of group.
The consolidated return of a group must be filed on the basis of the common parent's taxable year, and each subsidiary must adopt the common parent's annual accounting period for the first consolidated return year for which the subsidiary's income is includible in the consolidated return. If any member is on a 52-53-week taxable year, the rule of the preceding sentence will, with the advance consent of the Commissioner, be deemed satisfied if the taxable years of all members of the
group end within the same 7-day period. Any request for such consent must be requested at the time and in the manner that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue may prescribe by Internal Revenue Service forms and instructions or by publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter).
(b)
Items included in the consolidated return
—(1)
General rules
—(i)
In general.
A consolidated return must include the common parent's items of income, gain, deduction, loss, and credit for the entire consolidated return year, and each subsidiary's items for the portion of the year for which it is a member. If the consolidated return includes the items of a corporation for only a portion of its tax year determined without taking this section into account, items for the portion of the year not included in the consolidated return must be included in a separate return (including the consolidated return of another group). The rules of this paragraph (b) must be applied to prevent the duplication or elimination of the corporation's items.
(ii)
The day a corporation becomes or ceases to be a member
—(A)
End of the day rule.
(
1
)
In general.
If a corporation (S), other than one described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section, becomes or ceases to be a member during a consolidated return year, it becomes or ceases to be a member at the end of the day on which its status as a member changes, and its tax year ends for all Federal income tax purposes at the end of that day. Appropriate adjustments must be made if another provision of the Internal Revenue Code or the regulations thereunder contemplates the event occurring before or after S's change in status. For example, S's items restored under § 1.1502-13 immediately before it becomes a nonmember are taken into account in determining the basis of S's stock under § 1.1502-32. On the other hand, if a section 338(g) election is made in connection with S becoming a member, the deemed asset sale under that section takes place before S becomes a member. See § 1.338-10(a)(5) (deemed sale excluded from purchasing corporation's consolidated return.)
(
2
)
Special rule for former S corporations.
If S becomes a member in a transaction other than in a qualified stock purchase for which an election under section 338(g) is made, and immediately before becoming a member an election under section 1362(a) was in effect, then S will become a member at the beginning of the day the termination of its S corporation election is effective. S's tax year ends for all Federal income tax purposes at the end of the preceding day.
(B)
Next day rule.
If, on the day of S's change in status as a member, a transaction occurs that is properly allocable to the portion of S's day after the event resulting in the change, S and all persons related to S under section 267(b) immediately after the event must treat the transaction for all Federal income tax purposes as occurring at the beginning of the following day. A determination as to whether a transaction is properly allocable to the portion of S's day after the event will be respected if it is reasonable and consistently applied by all affected persons. In determining whether an allocation is reasonable, the following factors are among those to be considered—
(
1
) Whether income, gain, deduction, loss, and credit are allocated inconsistently (e.g., to maximize a seller's stock basis adjustments under § 1.1502-32);
(
2
) If the item is from a transaction with respect to S stock, whether it reflects ownership of the stock before or after the event (e.g., if a member transfers encumbered land to nonmember S in exchange for additional S stock in a transaction to which section 351 applies and the exchange results in S becoming a member of the consolidated group, the applicability of section 357(c) to the exchange must be determined under § 1.1502-80(d) by treating the exchange as occurring after the event; on the other hand, if S is a member but has a minority shareholder and becomes a nonmember as a result of its redemption of stock with appreciated property, S's gain under section 311 is treated as from a transaction occurring before the event);
(
3
) Whether the allocation is inconsistent with other requirements under
the Internal Revenue Code and regulations promulgated thereunder (e.g., if a section 338(g) election is made in connection with a group's acquisition of S, the deemed asset sale must take place before S becomes a member and S's gain or loss with respect to its assets must be taken into account by S as a nonmember (but see § 1.338-1(d)), or if S realizes discharge of indebtedness income that is excluded from gross income under section 108(a) on the day it becomes a nonmember, the discharge of indebtedness income must be treated as realized by S as a member (see § 1.1502-28(b)(11))); and

) Whether other facts exist, such as a prearranged transaction or multiple changes in S's status, indicating that the transaction is not properly allocable to the portion of S's day after the event resulting in S's change.
(C)
Successor corporations.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii), any reference to a corporation includes a reference to a successor or predecessor as the context may require. A corporation is a successor if the basis of its assets is determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of the assets of another corporation (the predecessor). For example, if a member forms S, S is treated as a member from the beginning of its existence.
(iii)
Group structure changes.
If the common parent ceases to be the common parent but the group remains in existence, adjustments must be made in accordance with the principles of § 1.1502-75(d)(2) and (3).
(2)
Determination of items included in separate and consolidated returns
—(i)
In general.
The returns for the years that end and begin with S becoming (or ceasing to be) a member are separate tax years for all Federal income tax purposes. The returns are subject to the rules of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to short periods, as if S ceased to exist on becoming a member (or first existed on becoming a nonmember). For example, cost recovery deductions under section 168 must be allocated for short periods. On the other hand, annualization under section 443 is not required of S solely because it has a short year as a result of becoming a member. (Similarly, section 443 applies with respect to a consolidated return only to the extent that the group's return is for a short period and section 443 applies without taking this paragraph (b) into account.)
(ii)
Ratable allocation of a year's items
—(A)
Application.
Although the periods ending and beginning with S's change in status are different tax years, items (other than extraordinary items) may be ratably allocated between the periods if—
(
1
) S is not required to change its annual accounting period or its method of accounting as a result of its change in status (e.g., because its stock is sold between consolidated groups that have the same annual accounting periods); and
(
2
) An irrevocable ratable allocation election is made under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) of this section.
(B)
General rule
—(
1
)
Allocation within original year.
Under a ratable allocation election, paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies by allocating to each day of S's original year (S's tax year determined without taking this section into account) an equal portion of S's items taken into account in the original year, except that extraordinary items must be allocated to the day that they are taken into account. All persons affected by the election must take into account S's extraordinary items and the ratable allocation of S's remaining items in a manner consistent with the election.
(
2
)
Items to be allocated.
Under ratable allocation, the items to be allocated and their timing, location, character, and source are generally determined by treating the original year as a single tax year, and the items are not subject to the rules of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to short periods (unless the original year is a short period). However, the years ending and beginning with S's change in status are treated as different tax years (and as short periods) with respect to any item carried to or from these years (e.g., a net operating loss carried under section 172) and with respect to the application of section 481.
(
3
)
Multiple applications.
If this paragraph (b) applies more than once with
respect to an original year, adjustments must be made in accordance with the principles of this paragraph (b). For example, if S becomes a member of two different consolidated groups during the same original year and ratable allocation is elected with respect to both groups, ratable allocation is generally determined for both groups by treating the original year as a single tax year; however, if ratable allocation is elected only with respect to the first group, the ratable allocation is determined by treating the original year as a short period that does not include the period that S is a member of the second group. Ratable allocation is not a method of accounting, and ratable allocation with respect to one application of this paragraph (b) to S does not require ratable allocation to be subsequently applied with respect to S.
(C)
Extraordinary items.
An extraordinary item is—
(
1
) Any item from the disposition or abandonment of a capital asset as defined in section 1221 (determined without the application of any other rules of law);
(
2
) Any item from the disposition or abandonment of property used in a trade or business as defined in section 1231(b) (determined without the application of any holding period requirement);
(
3
) Any item from the disposition or abandonment of an asset described in section 1221(1), (3), (4), or (5), if substantially all the assets in the same category from the same trade or business are disposed of or abandoned in one transaction (or series of related transactions);
(
4
) Any item from assets disposed of in an applicable asset acquisition under section 1060(c);
(
5
) Any item carried to or from any portion of the original year (e.g., a net operating loss carried under section 172), and any section 481(a) adjustment;
(
6
) The effects of any change in accounting method initiated by the filing of the appropriate form after S's change in status;
(
7
) Any item from the discharge or retirement of indebtedness (e.g., cancellation of indebtedness income or a deduction for retirement at a premium);
(
8
) Any item from the settlement of a tort or similar third-party liability;
(
9
) Any compensation-related deduction in connection with S's change in status (including, for example, deductions from bonus, severance, and option cancellation payments made in connection with S's change in status);
(
10
) Any dividend income from a nonmember that S controls within the meaning of section 304 at the time the dividend is taken into account;
(
11
) Any deemed income inclusion from a foreign corporation, or any deferred tax amount on an excess distribution from a passive foreign investment company under section 1291;
(
12
) Any interest expense allocable under section 172(h) to a corporate equity reduction transaction causing this paragraph (b) to apply;
(
13
) Any credit, to the extent it arises from activities or items that are not ratably allocated (e.g., the rehabilitation credit under section 47, which is based on placement in service); and
(
14
) Any item which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, would, if ratably allocated, result in a substantial distortion of income in any consolidated return or separate return in which the item is included.
(D)
Election
—(
1
)
Statement.
The election to ratably allocate items under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) must be made in a separate statement entitled, “THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER § 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) TO RATABLY ALLOCATE THE YEAR'S ITEMS OF [INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OF THE MEMBER].” The election must be filed by including a statement on or with the returns including the items for the years ending and beginning with S's change in status. If two or more members of the same consolidated group, as a consequence of the same plan or arrangement, cease to be members of that group and remain affiliated as members of another consolidated group, an election under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(
1
) may be made only if it is made by each such member. Each statement must also indicate that an agreement, as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(
2
) of this section, has been
entered into. Each party signing the agreement must retain either the original or a copy of the agreement as part of its records. See § 1.6001-1(e).
(
2
)
Agreement.
For each election under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii), the member and the common parent of each affected group must sign and date an agreement. The agreement must—
(
i
) Identify the extraordinary items, their amounts, and the separate or consolidated returns in which they are included;
(
ii
) Identify the aggregate amount to be ratably allocated, and the portion of the amount included in the separate and consolidated returns; and
(
iii
) Include the name and employer identification number of the common parent (if any) of each group that must take the items into account.
(iii)
Ratable allocation of a month's items.
If ratable allocation under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section is not elected (e.g., because S is required to change its annual accounting period), this paragraph (b)(2)(iii) may be applied to ratably allocate only S's items taken into account in the month of its change in status, but only if the allocation is consistently applied by all affected persons. The ratable allocation is made by applying the principles of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section under any reasonable method. For example, S may close its books both at the end of the preceding month and at the end of the month of the change, and allocate only its items (other than extraordinary items) from the month of the change. See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section for factors to be considered in determining whether the method is reasonable.
(iv)
Taxes.
To the extent properly taken into account during the member's tax year (determined without the application of this paragraph (b)), Federal, state, local, and foreign taxes are allocated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section on the basis of the items or activities to which the taxes relate. Thus, income tax is allocated based on the inclusion of the income (determined under the principles of this paragraph (b)) to which the tax relates. For example, if a calendar-year domestic corporation has $100 of foreign source dividend income (determined in accordance with United States tax accounting principles but without taking this paragraph (b) into account) that is passive income for purposes of section 904, and $60 of the income is allocated under this paragraph (b) to the period of the calendar year after it becomes a member of a consolidated group, then 60% of the corporation's deemed paid foreign tax credit associated with its dividend income for the calendar year is taken into account in computing the group's passive basket consolidated foreign tax credit. Similarly, property taxes relate to the ownership of property and are allocated over the period that the property is owned. This paragraph (b)(2)(iv) applies without regard to any determination or allocation by another taxing jurisdiction.
(v)
Acquisition of S corporation.
If a corporation is acquired in a transaction to which paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section applies, then paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section do not apply and items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit are assigned to each short taxable year on the basis of the corporation's normal method of accounting as determined under section 446.
(vi)
Passthrough entities
—(A)
In general.
If S is a partner in a partnership or an owner of a similar interest with respect to which items of the entity are taken into account by S, S is treated, solely for purposes of determining the year to which the entity's items are allocated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, as selling or exchanging its entire interest in the entity immediately before S's change in status.
(B)
Treatment as a conduit.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), if a member (together with other members) would be treated under section 318(a)(2) as owning an aggregate of at least 50% of any stock owned by the passthrough entity, the method that is used to determine the inclusion of the entity's items in the consolidated or separate return must be the same method that is used to determine the inclusion of the member's items in the consolidated or separate return.
(C)
Exception for certain foreign entities.
This paragraph (b)(2)(v) does not apply to any foreign corporation generating the deemed inclusion of income,
or to any passive foreign investment company generating a deferred tax amount on an excess distribution under section 1291.
(3)
Anti-avoidance rule.
If any person acts with a principal purpose contrary to the purposes of this paragraph (b), to substantially reduce the Federal income tax liability of any person, adjustments must be made as necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.
(4)
Determination of due date for separate return.
Paragraph (c) of this section contains rules for the filing of the separate return referred to in this paragraph (b). In applying paragraph (c) of this section, the due date for the filing of S's separate return shall also be determined without regard to the ending of the tax year under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section or the deemed cessation of its existence under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
(5)
Examples.
For purposes of the examples in this paragraph (b), unless otherwise stated, P and X are common parents of calendar-year consolidated groups, P owns all of the only class of T's stock, T owns no stock of lower-tier members, all persons use the accrual method of accounting, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, all transactions are between unrelated persons, tax liabilities are disregarded, and any election required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section is properly made. The principles of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1. Items allocated between consolidated and separate returns.
(a)
Facts.
P and S are the only members of the P group. P sells all of S's stock to individual A on June 30, and therefore S becomes a nonmember on July 1 of Year 2.
(b)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the P group's consolidated return for Year 2 includes P's income for the entire tax year and S's income for the period from January 1 to June 30, and S must file a separate return for the period from July 1 to December 31.
(c)
Acquisition of another subsidiary before end of tax year.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 1,
except that on July 31 P acquires all the stock of T (which filed a separate return for its year ending on November 30 of Year 1) and T therefore becomes a member on August 1 of Year 2. Under § 1.1502-75(d) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the P group's consolidated return for Year 2 includes P's income for the entire year, S's income from January 1 to June 30, and T's income from August 1 to December 31. S must file a separate return that includes its income from July 1 to December 31, and T must file a separate return that includes its income from December 1 of Year 1 to July 31 of Year 2. (If P had acquired T after December 31, the P group that included S is a different group from the P group that includes T, and, for example, the P group that includes T must make a separate election under section 1501 and § 1.1502-75 if consolidated returns are to be filed.)

# Example 2. Group structure change.
(a)
Facts.
P owns all of the stock of S and T. Shortly after the beginning of Year 1, P merges into T in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(A) (and in section 368(a)(1)(D)), and P's shareholders receive T's stock in exchange for all of P's stock. The P group is treated under § 1.1502-75(d)(2)(ii) as remaining in existence with T as its common parent.
(b)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the P group's return must include the common parent's items for the entire consolidated return year and, if the common parent ceases to be the common parent but the group remains in existence, appropriate adjustments must be made. Consequently, although P did not exist for all of Year 1, P's items for the portion of Year 1 ending with the merger are treated as the items of the common parent that must be included in the P group's return for Year 1.
(c)
Reverse acquisition.
Assume instead that X acquires all of P's assets in exchange for more than 50% of X's stock in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D). The reorganization constitutes a reverse acquisition under § 1.1502-75(d)(3), with the X group terminating and the P group surviving with X as its common parent. Consequently, P's items for the portion of Year 1 ending with the acquisition are treated as the items of the common parent that must be included in the P group's return for Year 1, and X's items are treated for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section as the items of a subsidiary included in the P group's return for the portion of Year 1 for which X is a member.

# Example 3. Ratable allocation.
(a)
Facts.
P sells all of T's stock to X, and T becomes a nonmember on July 1 of Year 1. T engages in the production and sale of merchandise throughout Year 1 and is required to use inventories. The sale is treated as causing T's tax year to end on June 30, and the periods beginning and ending with the sale are treated as two tax years for Federal income tax purposes.
(b)
Analysis.
If ratable allocation under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section is not elected, T must perform an inventory valuation as of the acquisition and also as of the
end of Year 1. If ratable allocation is elected, T must perform an inventory valuation only as of the close of Year 1, and T's income from inventory is ratably allocated, along with T's other items that are not extraordinary items, between the P and X consolidated returns.
(c)
Merger into nonmember.
Assume instead that T merges into a wholly owned subsidiary of X in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(2)(D), and P receives 10% of X's stock in exchange for all of T's stock. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, because T's tax year ends on June 30 under section 381(b)(1), T's original year determined without taking paragraph (b) of this section into account also ends on June 30. Consequently, a ratable allocation under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section is the same as an allocation based on closing the books.

# Example 4. Net operating loss.
P sells all of T's stock to X, T becomes a nonmember on June 30 of Year 1, and ratable allocation under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section is elected. Under ratable allocation, the X group has a $100 consolidated net operating loss for Year 1, all of which is attributable to T. However, because of extraordinary items, T has $100 of income for the portion of Year 1 that T is a member of the P group. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section, T's loss may be carried back from the X group to the portion of Year 1 that T was a member of the P group. See also section 172 and § 1.1502-21(b). Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C)(
5
) of this section, any item carried to or from any portion of the original year is an extraordinary item, and the loss therefore is not taken into account again in determining the ratable allocation under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.

# Example 5. Employee benefit plans.
(a)
Facts.
P sells all of T's stock to X, and T becomes a nonmember on June 30 of Year 1. On March 15 of Year 2, T contributes $100 to its retirement plan, which is a qualified plan under section 401(a). T is not required to make quarterly contributions to the plan for Year 1 under section 412(m). The contribution is made on account of T's taxable period beginning on July 1 of Year 1, and is deemed in accordance with section 404(a)(6) to have been made on the last day of T's taxable period beginning on July 1 of Year 1. Ratable allocation under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section is not elected.
(b)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b) of this section, the sale is treated as causing T's tax year to end on June 30, and the period beginning on July 1 is treated as a separate annual accounting period for all Federal income tax purposes. T's income from January 1 to June 30 is included in the P group's Year 1 return, and T's income from July 1 to December 31 is included in the X group's Year 1 return. Thus, the $100 contribution is deductible by T for the period of Year 1 that it is a member of the X group, subject to the applicable limitations of section 404, if a contribution on the last day of that period would otherwise be deductible.
(c) The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 5,
except that, in accordance with section 404(a)(6), $40 of the $100 contribution is made on account of T's taxable period beginning on January 1 of Year 1 and is deemed to be made on the last day of T's taxable period beginning on January 1 of Year 1. The remaining $60 is made on account of T's taxable period beginning on July 1 of Year 1 and is deemed to be made on the last day of T's taxable period beginning on July 1 of Year 1. As in paragraph (b) of this
Example 5,
under paragraph (b) of this section, the sale is treated as causing T's tax year to end on June 30, and the period beginning on July 1 is treated as a separate annual accounting period for all Federal income tax purposes. The $40 portion of the contribution is deductible by T for the period of Year 1 that it is a member of the P group, subject to the applicable limitations of section 404 and provided that a $40 contribution on the last day of that period would otherwise be deductible for that period, and the $60 portion is deductible by T for the period of Year 1 that it is a member of the X group, subject to the same conditions.
(d)
Ratable allocation.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 5,
except that P, T, and X elect ratable allocation under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section and T's deduction for the retirement plan contribution is not an extraordinary item. T's deduction may be ratably allocated, subject to the applicable limitations of section 404, and is allowable only if a contribution on the last day of Year 1 otherwise would be deductible for any period in the year. (The results would be the same if S were an unaffiliated corporation when acquired by X, and the due date of its last separate return (including extensions) were before the pension contribution was made on March 15 of Year 2.)

# Example 6. Allocation of partnership items.
(a)
Facts.
P sells all of T's stock to X, and T becomes a nonmember on June 30 of Year 1. T has a 10% interest in the capital and profits of a calendar-year partnership.
(b)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(vi)(A) of this section, T is treated, solely for purposes of determining T's tax year in which the partnership's items are included, as selling or exchanging its entire interest in the partnership as of P's sale of T's stock. Thus, the deemed disposition is not taken into account under section 708, it does not result in gain or loss being recognized by T, and T's holding period is unaffected. However, under section 706(a), in determining T's income, T is required to include its distributive share of partnership items for the partnership's year ending within or with T's tax year.
Under section 706(c)(2), the partnership's tax year is treated as closing with respect to T for this purpose as of P's sale of T's stock. The allocation of T's distributive share of partnership items must be made under § 1.706-1(c)(2)(ii).
(c)
Controlled partnership.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 6,
except that T has a 75% interest in the capital and profits of the partnership. Under paragraph (b)(2)(vi)(B) of this section, T's distributive share of the partnership items is treated as T's items for purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Thus, if ratable allocation under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section is not elected, T's distributive share of the partnership's items must be determined under § 1.706-1(c)(2)(ii) by an interim closing of the partnership's books. Similarly, if ratable allocation is elected for T's items that are not extraordinary items, T's distributive share of the partnership's nonextraordinary items must also be ratably allocated under § 1.706-1(c)(2)(ii).

# Example 7. Acquisition of S corporation.
(a)
Facts.
Z is a small business corporation for which an election under section 1362(a) was in effect at all times since Year 1. At all times, Z had only 100 shares of stock outstanding, all of which were owned by individual A. On July 1 of Year 3, P acquired all of the Z stock. P does not make an election under section 338(g) with respect to its purchase of the Z stock.
(b)
Analysis.
As a result of P's acquisition of the Z stock, Z's election under section 1362(a) terminates. See sections 1361(b)(1)(B) and 1362(d)(2). Z is required to join in the filing of the P consolidated return. See § 1.1502-75. Z's tax year ends for all Federal income tax purposes on June 30 of Year 3. If no extension of time is sought, Z must file a separate return for the period from January 1 through June 30 of Year 3 on or before March 15 of Year 4. See paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Z will become a member of the P consolidated group as of July 1 of Year 3. See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section. P group's Year 3 consolidated return will include Z's items from July 1 to December 31 of Year 3.
(6)
Applicability date.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A)(
2
) and (b)(2)(v) of this section, this paragraph (b) applies to corporations becoming or ceasing to be members of consolidated groups on or after January 1, 1995.
(c)
Time for making separate returns for periods not included in consolidated return
—(1)
Consolidated return filed by due date for separate return.
If the group has filed a consolidated return on or before the due date for the filing of a subsidiary's separate return (including extensions of time and determined without regard to any change of its taxable year required under paragraph (a) of this section), then the separate return for any portion of the subsidiary's taxable year for which its income is not included in the consolidated return of the group must be filed no later than the due date of such consolidated return (including extensions of time).
(2)
Consolidated return not filed by due date for separate return.
If the group has not filed a consolidated return on or before the due date for the filing of a subsidiary corporation's separate return (including extensions of time and determined without regard to any change of its taxable year required under paragraph (a) of this section), then on or before such due date such subsidiary shall file a separate return either for the portion of its taxable year for which its income would not be included in a consolidated return if such a return were filed, or for its complete taxable year. However, if a separate return is filed for such portion of its taxable year and the group subsequently does not file a consolidated return, such subsidiary corporation shall file a substituted return for its complete taxable year not later than the due date (including extensions of time) prescribed for the filing of the common parent's return. On the other hand, if the return is filed for the subsidiary's complete taxable year and the group later files a consolidated return, such subsidiary must file an amended return not later than the due date (including extensions of time) for the filing of the consolidated return of the group. Such amended return shall be for that portion of such subsidiary's taxable year which is not included in the consolidated return. If, under this subparagraph, a substituted return must be filed, then the return previously filed shall not be considered a return within the meaning of section 6011. If, under this subparagraph, a substituted or amended return must be filed, then, for purposes of sections 6513(a) and 6601(a), the last date prescribed for payment of tax shall be the due date (not including extensions of time) for the filing of the subsidiary's separate return (determined without regard to this subparagraph and without regard to any
change of its taxable year required under paragraph (a) of this section).
(3)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (c) may be illustrated by the following examples:
(i)
Example 1.
Corporation P, which filed a separate return for the calendar year 2022, acquires all of the stock of corporation S as of the close of December 31, 2022. Corporation S reports its income on the basis of a fiscal year ending March 31. On July 15, 2023, the due date for the filing of a separate return by S (assuming no extensions of time), a consolidated return has not been filed for the group (P and S). On such date S may either file a return for the period April 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022, or it may file a return for the complete fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. If S files a return for the short period ending December 31, 2022, and if the group elects not to file a consolidated return for the calendar year 2023, S, on or before April 15, 2024 (the due date of P's return, assuming no extensions of time), must file a substituted return for the complete fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, in lieu of the return previously filed for the short period. Interest is computed from July 15, 2023. If, however, S files a return for the complete fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, and the group elects to file a consolidated return for the calendar year 2023, then S must file an amended return covering the period from April 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022, in lieu of the return previously filed for the complete fiscal year. Interest is computed from July 15, 2023.
(ii)
Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section (
Example 1
), except that corporation P acquires all of the stock of corporation S at the close of September 30, 2023, and P files a consolidated return for the group for 2023 on April 15, 2024 (not having obtained any extensions of time). Since a consolidated return has been filed on or before the due date (July 15, 2024) for the filing of the separate return for the taxable year ending March 31, 2024, the return of S for the short taxable year beginning April 1, 2023, and ending September 30, 2023, should be filed no later than April 15, 2024.
(d)
Applicability date
—(1)
Taxable years of members of group applicability date.
Paragraph (a) of this section applies to any original consolidated Federal income tax return due (without extensions) after July 20, 2007.
(2)
Election to ratably allocate items applicability date.
Paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) of this section applies to any original consolidated Federal income tax return due (without extensions) after July 20, 2007.

Except as provided in paragraphs (e) and (f)(2) of this section, one entity (the agent) is the sole agent that is authorized to act in its own name regarding all matters relating to the federal income tax liability for the consolidated return year for each member of the group and any successor or transferee of a member (and any subsequent successors and transferees thereof). The identity of that agent is determined under the rules of paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Agent for each consolidated return year.
Agency for the group is established for each consolidated return year and is not affected by the status or membership of the group in later years. Thus, subject to the rules of paragraph (c) of this section, the agent will generally remain agent for that consolidated return year regardless of whether one or more subsidiaries later cease to be members of the group, whether the group files a consolidated return for any subsequent year, whether the agent ceases to be the agent or a member of the group in any subsequent year, or whether the group continues pursuant to § 1.1502-75(d) with a new common parent in any subsequent year.
(3)
Communications under this section.
Any designation, notification, objection, request, or other communication made to or by the Commissioner pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (f)(2) of this section must be made in accordance
with procedures prescribed by the Commissioner in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter), forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance.
(b)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this section only—
(1)
Successor.
A
successor
is an individual or entity (including a disregarded entity as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) that is primarily liable, pursuant to applicable law (including, for example, by operation of a state or federal merger statute), for the tax liability of a corporation that was a member of the group but is no longer in existence under applicable law. The determination of tax liability is made without regard to § 1.1502-1(f)(4) or § 1.1502-6(a). (For inclusion of a successor in references to a subsidiary or member, see paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section.)
(2)
Entity.
The term
entity
includes any corporation, limited liability company, or partnership formed under any state, federal, or foreign jurisdiction. The term entity includes a disregarded entity (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section). The term entity does not include an entity that has terminated even if it is in a winding up period under the law under which it is organized.
(3)
Disregarded entity.
The term
disregarded entity
includes any of the following types of entities that are disregarded as separate from their owners—
(i) Qualified real estate investment trust subsidiaries (within the meaning of section 856(i)(2));
(ii) Qualified subchapter S subsidiaries (within the meaning of section 1361(b)(3)(B)); and
(iii) Eligible entities with a single owner (within the meaning of § 301.7701-3 of this chapter).
(4)
Default successor.
A successor to the agent is the
default successor
if it is an entity (whether domestic or foreign) that is the sole successor to the agent. A partnership is treated as a sole successor with primary liability notwithstanding that one or more partners may also be primarily liable by virtue of being partners.
(5)
Member or subsidiary.
All references to a member or subsidiary for a consolidated return year include—
(i) Each corporation that was a member of the group during any part of such year (except that any reference to a subsidiary does not include the common parent);
(ii) Each corporation whose income was included in the consolidated return for such year, notwithstanding that the tax liability of such corporation should have been computed on the basis of a separate return, or as a member of another consolidated group, under the provisions of § 1.1502-75; and
(iii) Except as indicated otherwise, a successor of any of the foregoing corporations.
(6)
Completed year.
A
completed year
is a consolidated return year that has ended, or will end at the time of the referenced event.
(7)
Current year.
A
current year
is a consolidated return year that is not a completed year.
(c)
Identity of the agent
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the agent for a current year is the common parent and the agent for a completed year is the common parent at the close of the completed year or its default successor, if any. Except as specifically provided otherwise in this paragraph (c), any entity that is an agent pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section (agent following group structure change), paragraph (c)(5) of this section (agent designated by agent terminating without default successor), paragraph (c)(6) of this section (agent designated by Commissioner), or paragraph (c)(7) of this section (agent designated by resigning agent), or any entity subsequently serving as agent following such agent, acts as an agent for and under the same terms and conditions that apply to a common parent. For example, such an agent would generally be able to designate an agent if it terminates without a default successor; however, an entity that became agent pursuant to a designation by the Commissioner under paragraphs (c)(6)(i)(A)(
2
), (
3
), or (
4
) of this section is not permitted to designate an agent if it terminates without a default successor. Other special rules described in this paragraph (c) apply.
(2)
Purported agent.
If any entity files a consolidated return, or takes any other action related to the tax liability for the consolidated return year, purporting to be the agent but is subsequently determined not to have been the agent with respect to the claimed group, that entity is treated, to the extent necessary to avoid prejudice to the Commissioner, as if it were the agent.
(3)
New common parent after a group structure change.
If the group continues in existence after a group structure change (as described in § 1.1502-33(f)(1)), the former common parent is the agent until the group structure change, and the new common parent becomes the agent after the group structure change. Following the group structure change, the new common parent is the agent with respect to the entire current year (including the period before the group structure change) and the former common parent is no longer the agent for that year. However, actions taken by the former common parent as the agent before the group structure change are not nullified when the new common parent becomes the agent with respect to the entire consolidated return year. Following the group structure change, the new common parent continues as the agent for succeeding years subject to the rules of this section.
(4)
Notification by default successor
—(i)
In general.
Failure to provide notice to the Commissioner pursuant to this paragraph (c)(4)(i) does not invalidate an entity's status as the default successor. However, until the Commissioner receives notification in writing that an entity is the default successor—
(A) Any notice of deficiency or other communication mailed to the predecessor agent, even if no longer in existence, is considered as having been properly mailed to the agent; and
(B) The Commissioner is not required to act on any communication (including, for example, a claim for refund) submitted on behalf of the group by any person (including the default successor) other than the predecessor agent.
(ii)
Conversions and continuances.
For purposes of the notice requirements under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, any entity that results from the agent's conversion or continuance by operation of state law and that qualifies as a default successor under paragraph (b)(4) of this section is treated as a default successor for purposes of the notice provisions of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, even if applicable state or local law may treat the converted or continued entity as not ceasing to exist.
(5)
Designation by terminating agent
—(i)
In general.
Prior to the termination of its existence without a default successor, an agent may designate an entity described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section to act as agent for any completed year. This designation is effective upon the termination of the designating agent's existence. However, this paragraph (c)(5) does not apply to, and no designation can be made by, an agent that was designated by the Commissioner under paragraphs (c)(6)(i)(A)(
2
), (
3
), or (
4
) of this section, or any successor of such an agent; in such a case, the terminating agent should request that the Commissioner designate an agent pursuant to paragraph (c)(6)(i)(B) of this section.
(ii)
Permissible agents
—(A) The terminating agent may designate as agent a member of the group during any part of the completed year, or an entity (whether domestic or foreign) that is a successor of such a member, including an entity that will become a successor at the time the agent's existence terminates.
(B) The terminating agent may not designate as agent any entity that was previously replaced as agent by the Commissioner pursuant to paragraphs (c)(6)(i)(A)(
2
), (
3
), or (
4
) of this section, or any successor of such an agent. However, the terminating agent may submit a request pursuant to paragraph (c)(6)(i)(B) of this section that the Commissioner designate such an entity as agent.
(iii)
Notification of designation.
The terminating agent must notify the Commissioner in writing of its designation of an entity as agent pursuant to paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section and provide a statement executed by the designated entity acknowledging that
it will serve as the agent for each specified completed year for which it is designated as the agent. If the designated entity was not itself a member of the group during any specified year (because it is a successor of a member), the notification must include a statement acknowledging that the designated entity is or will be primarily liable for the tax liability for the specified completed year as a successor of a member.
(iv)
Failure to designate an agent.
If the agent terminates without a default successor, and no agent is designated pursuant to this paragraph (c)(5)—
(A) Any notice of deficiency or other communication mailed to the agent, even if no longer in existence, is considered as having been properly mailed to the agent; and
(B) The Commissioner is not required to act on any communication (including, for example, a claim for refund) submitted on behalf of the group by any person.
(6)
Designation by the Commissioner
—(i)
In general.
The Commissioner has the authority to designate an entity to act as the agent under the circumstances prescribed in this paragraph (c)(6)(i). The designated agent for a completed year must be an entity described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section when the designation becomes effective. The designated agent for a current year must be a member of the group when the designation becomes effective. If, pursuant to this paragraph (c)(6), the Commissioner replaces the common parent or another entity as the agent, the common parent or other entity, or any successor thereof, may not later act as the agent unless so designated by the Commissioner.
(A)
On Commissioner's own accord.
With or without a request from any member of the group, the Commissioner may designate an entity to act as the agent if—
(
1
) The agent's existence terminates, other than in a group structure change, without there being a default successor and without any designation made under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section;
(
2
) An agent previously designated by the Commissioner is no longer a member of the group in the current year and does not have a default successor that is a member of the group;
(
3
) The Commissioner believes that the agent or its default successor exists but such entity has either not timely responded to the Commissioner's notices (sent to the last known address on file for the entity or left at the usual place of business for such entity) or has failed to perform its obligations as agent as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code (Code) or regulations promulgated thereunder; or
(
4
) The agent is or becomes a foreign entity as a result of any action or transaction (including, for example, a continuance into a foreign jurisdiction or certain inversion transactions subject to section 7874 in which a foreign parent is treated as a domestic corporation).
(B)
Written request from any member.
At the request of any member, in a circumstance not described in paragraph (c)(6)(i)(A) of this section, the Commissioner may, but is not required to, replace an agent previously designated under this paragraph (c)(6).
(ii)
Notification by Commissioner.
The Commissioner will notify the designated entity in writing of the Commissioner's designation of the entity as agent pursuant to paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, and the designation will be effective as prescribed by the Commissioner. The designated entity should give notice of the designation by the Commissioner pursuant to paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section to each member of the group during any part of the consolidated return year. However, a failure by the designated entity to notify any such member of the group does not invalidate the designation by the Commissioner.
(iii)
Term and effect of designation.
Unless otherwise provided by the Commissioner in the designation, any agent designated by the Commissioner pursuant to paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section (new agent) is the agent with respect to the entire consolidated return year for which it is designated and successive years, subject to the rules of this section. An agent immediately preceding a new agent (former agent) ceases to be the agent for a particular consolidated return year once the new agent has been designated for that
year, but the designation of the new agent does not nullify actions taken on behalf of the group by the former agent while it was agent. If there is more than one new agent designated by the Commissioner for a consolidated return year, the new agent that is designated last in time by the Commissioner is the agent with respect to the entire consolidated return year. A designation pursuant to this paragraph (c)(6) is effective as prescribed by the Commissioner in such designation or the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter), forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance.
(iv)
Request by member of the group where agent previously designated by the Commissioner is no longer a member.
If an agent at any time after it is designated as agent by the Commissioner pursuant to paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section is no longer a member of the group for any current year, and its default successor, if any, is not a member of the group at that time, a member of the group, including the agent that will cease to be a member, should request, in writing, that the Commissioner designate a member of the group to be the new agent pursuant to paragraph (c)(6)(i)(A)(
2
) of this section. Until such a request is made—
(A) Any notice of deficiency or other communication mailed to the agent, even if no longer a member, is considered as having been properly mailed to the agent; and
(B) The Commissioner is not required to act on any communication (including, for example, a claim for refund) submitted on behalf of the group by any person.
(7)
Agent resigns
—(i)
In general.
The agent may resign for a completed year if—
(A) It provides written notice to the Commissioner that it no longer intends to be the agent for that completed year;
(B) An entity described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section consents, in writing, to be the agent with respect to that completed year;
(C) Immediately after its resignation takes effect, the resigning agent will not be the agent for the current year; and
(D) The Commissioner does not object to the agent's resignation.
(ii)
Notification by agent that replaces agent that resigns.
If the Commissioner does not object to the agent's resignation, the agent that replaces the agent that resigns should give written notice that it is the new agent to each member of the group for any part of the completed year for which it is designated the agent.
(8)
Transactions under the Code.
Notwithstanding section 338(a)(2), a target corporation for which an election is made under section 338 is not deemed to terminate for purposes of this section.
(d)
Examples of matters subject to agency.
With respect to any consolidated return year for which it is the agent—
(1) The agent makes any election (or similar choice of a permissible option) that is available to a subsidiary in the computation of its separate taxable income, and any change in an election (or similar choice of a permissible option) previously made by or for a subsidiary, including, for example, a request to change a subsidiary's method or period of accounting;
(2) All correspondence concerning the income tax liability for the consolidated return year is carried on directly with the agent;
(3) The agent files for all extensions of time, including extensions of time for payment of tax under section 6164, and any extension so filed is considered as having been filed by each member;
(4) The agent gives waivers, gives bonds, and executes closing agreements, offers in compromise, and all other documents, and any waiver or bond so given, or agreement, offer in compromise, or any other document so executed, is considered as having also been given or executed by each member;
(5) The agent files claims for refund, and any refund is made directly to and in the name of the agent and discharges any liability of the Government to any member with respect to such refund;
(6) The agent takes any action on behalf of a member of the group with respect to a foreign corporation including, for example, elections by, and changes to the method of accounting
of, a controlled foreign corporation in accordance with § 1.964-1(c)(3);
(7) Notices of claim disallowance are mailed only to the agent, and the mailing to the agent is considered as a mailing to each member;
(8) Notices of deficiencies are mailed only to the agent (except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section), and the mailing to the agent is considered as a mailing to each member;
(9) Notices of final partnership administrative adjustment under section 6223 with respect to any partnership in which a member of the group is a partner may be mailed to the agent, and, if so, the mailing to the agent is considered as a mailing to each member that is a partner entitled to receive such notice (for other rules regarding partnership proceedings, see paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section);
(10) The agent files petitions and conducts proceedings before the United States Tax Court, and any such petition is considered as also having been filed by each member;
(11) Any assessment of tax may be made in the name of the agent, and an assessment naming the agent is considered as an assessment with respect to each member; and
(12) Notice and demand for payment of taxes is given only to the agent, and such notice and demand is considered as a notice and demand to each member.
(e)
Matters reserved to subsidiaries.
Except as provided in this paragraph (e) and paragraph (f)(2) of this section, no subsidiary (unless it is or becomes an agent pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section) has authority to act for or to represent itself in any matter related to the tax liability for the consolidated return year. The following matters, however, are reserved exclusively to each subsidiary—
(1) The making of the consent required by § 1.1502-75(a)(1);
(2) Any action with respect to the subsidiary's liability for a federal tax other than the income tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code (including, for example, employment taxes under chapters 21 through 25 of the Code, and miscellaneous excise taxes under chapters 31 through 47 of the Code); and
(3) The making of an election to be treated as a Domestic International Sales Corporation under § 1.992-2.
(f)
Dealings with members
—(1)
Identifying members in notice of a lien.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, any notice of a lien, any levy, or any other proceeding to collect the amount of any assessment, after the assessment has been made, must name the entity from which such collection is to be made.
(2)
Direct dealing with a member
—(i)
Several liability.
The Commissioner may, upon issuing to the agent written notice that expressly invokes the authority of this provision, deal directly with any member of the group with respect to its liability under § 1.1502-6 for the consolidated tax of the group, in which event such member has sole authority to act for itself with respect to that liability. However, if the Commissioner believes or has reason to believe that the existence of the agent has terminated without an agent being identified under this section, the Commissioner may, if the Commissioner deems it advisable, deal directly with any member with respect to that member's liability under § 1.1502-6 without issuing notice to any other entity.
(ii)
Information requests.
The Commissioner may, upon issuing to the agent written notice, request information relevant to the consolidated tax liability from any member of the group. However, if the Commissioner believes or has reason to believe that the existence of the agent has terminated without an agent being identified under this section, the Commissioner may request such information from any member of the group without issuing notice to any other entity.
(iii)
Members as partners in partnerships subject to the provisions of the Code.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (f)(2)(iii), the general rule of paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies so that the agent is the agent for any subsidiary member that for any part of the consolidated return year is a partner in a partnership subject to the provisions of sections 6221 through 6234 of the Code (as originally enacted by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 and subsequently amended)
and the accompanying regulations (TEFRA partnership). However—
(A) Any subsidiary or any disregarded entity owned by a subsidiary that is designated as tax matters partner of a TEFRA partnership will act in its own name and perform its responsibilities under sections 6221 through 6234 and the accompanying regulations without requiring any action by the agent (but see paragraph (d)(9) of this section regarding the mailing of a final partnership administrative adjustment to the agent); and
(B) The Commissioner may at any time communicate directly with a subsidiary or a disregarded entity owned by a subsidiary that is a partner in a TEFRA partnership, without having to deal with each member separately pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, whenever the Commissioner determines that such direct communication will facilitate the conduct of an examination, appeal, or settlement with respect to the partnership.
(3)
Copy of notice of deficiency to entity that has ceased to be a member of the group.
A subsidiary that ceases to be a member of the group during or after a consolidated return year may file a written notice of that fact with the Commissioner and request a copy of any notice of deficiency with respect to the tax for a consolidated return year during which it was a member, or a copy of any notice and demand for payment of such deficiency, or both. Such filing does not limit the scope of the agency of the agent provided for in this section. Any failure by the Commissioner to comply with such request does not limit the subsidiary's tax liability under § 1.1502-6.
(g)
Examples.
Unless otherwise indicated, all entities are domestic and have a calendar year taxable year, and each of P, S, S-1, S-2, S-3, T, U, V, W, W-1, Y, Z, and Z-1 is a corporation. For none of the consolidated return years at issue does the Commissioner exercise the authority under paragraph (f)(2) of this section to deal with any member separately. Any surviving entity in a merger is either a successor as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or a default successor as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, as the case may be. Except as otherwise indicated, no agent will be replaced under paragraph (c)(6) of this section or will resign under paragraph (c)(7) of this section, and all communications to and from the Commissioner are made in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Commissioner.
(1)
Example 1
—
Disposition of all group members where the agent remains the agent.
(i)
Facts.
As of January 1 of Year 1, P is the common parent and agent for the P consolidated group, consisting of P and its two subsidiaries, S and S-1. P files consolidated returns for the P group in Years 1 and 2. On December 31 of Year 1, P sells all the stock of S-1 to X. On December 31 of Year 2, P distributes all the stock of S to P's shareholders. P files a separate return for Year 3.
(ii)
Analysis.
Although the consolidated group terminates after Year 2 under § 1.1502-75(d)(1) and P is no longer the common parent nor the agent for years after Year 2, P remains the agent for the P group for Years 1 and 2 under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Accordingly, for as long as P remains in existence, P is the agent for the P group under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) and (c)(1) of this section for Years 1 and 2.
(2)
Example 2
—
Acquisition of the agent by another group where the agent remains the agent.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section (
Example 1
), except on January 1 of Year 3, all of the outstanding stock of P is acquired by Y, which is the common parent and agent of the Y consolidated group. P thereafter joins in the Y group's consolidated return as a member of the Y group.
(ii)
Analysis.
Although P is a member of the Y group in Year 3 and succeeding years, P remains the agent for the P group for Years 1 and 2 under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Accordingly, for as long as P remains in existence, P is the agent for the P group under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) and (c)(1) of this section for Years 1 and 2.
(3)
Example 3
—
Reverse triangular merger of the agent where the agent remains the agent.
(i)
Facts.
As of January 1 of Year 1, P is the common parent and agent for the P consolidated group consisting of P and its two subsidiaries, S and S-1. P files consolidated returns
for the P group in Years 1 and 2. On March 1 of Year 3, W-1, a subsidiary of W, merges into P in a reverse triangular merger qualifying as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(E). P survives the merger with W-1. The transaction constitutes a reverse acquisition under § 1.1502-75(d)(3)(i) because P's shareholders receive more than 50 percent of W's stock in exchange for all of P's stock. The transaction is therefore a group structure change as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because the transaction constitutes a reverse acquisition that results in a group structure change, the P group is treated as remaining in existence with W as its common parent and agent. Under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) and (c)(1) of this section, P remains the agent for the P group for Years 1 and 2 for as long as P remains in existence, even though the P group continues with W as its new common parent pursuant to § 1.1502-75(d)(3)(i). Until the merger of W-1 and P on March 1 of Year 3, P is the agent for the P group for Year 3. From the time of that merger, W, as common parent of the P group, becomes the agent for the P group with respect to all of Year 3 (including the period through March 1) and succeeding consolidated return years. The actions taken by P before the merger as agent for the P group for Year 3 are not nullified by the fact that W becomes the agent for all of Year 3.
(4)
Example 4
—
Reverse triangular merger of the agent—subsequent distribution of agent where the agent remains the agent.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section (
Example 3
), except that on April 1 of Year 4, in a transaction unrelated to the March 1, Year 3 reverse acquisition, P distributes the stock of its subsidiaries S and S-1 to W, and W then distributes the stock of P to the W shareholders.
(ii)
Analysis.
Although P is no longer a member of the P group after the Year 4 distribution, P remains the agent for the P group under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) and (c)(1) of this section for Years 1 and 2 for as long as P remains in existence.
(5)
Example 5
—
Agent Resigns.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(4) of this section (
Example 4
), except that on August 1 of Year 4, P provides written notice to the Commissioner that it resigns as the agent for Years 1 and 2. Included with the written notice is a statement executed by either S or S-1 consenting to be the agent for the P group for Years 1 and 2.
(ii)
Analysis.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(7) of this section, because P is not the agent in Year 4, the current year, it will not be the agent immediately after its resignation takes effect. Accordingly, if the Commissioner does not object to P's resignation, P may resign with respect to Years 1 and 2, both of which are completed years, and either S or S-1, each an entity described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, can be the agent for the P group for Years 1 and 2 if it consents in writing. W cannot be the agent for the P group for Years 1 and 2 because it is not an entity described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section with respect to the P group for Years 1 and 2.
(6)
Example 6
—
Qualified stock purchase and section 338 election where the agent remains the agent.
(i)
Facts.
As of January 1 of Year 1, P is the common parent and agent for the P consolidated group consisting of P and its two subsidiaries, S and S-1. P files consolidated returns for the P group in Years 1 and 2. On March 31 of Year 2, V purchases the stock of P in a qualified stock purchase (within the meaning of section 338(d)(3)), and V makes a timely election pursuant to section 338(g) with respect to P.
(ii)
Analysis.
Although section 338(a)(2) provides that P is treated as a new corporation as of the beginning of the day after the acquisition date for purposes of subtitle A, paragraph (c)(8) of this section provides that P's existence is not deemed to terminate for purposes of this section notwithstanding the general rule of section 338(a)(2). Accordingly, new P is the agent for the P group for Year 1 and the period ending March 31 of Year 2 regardless of the election under section 338(g).
(7)
Example 7
—
Change in the agent's federal income tax classification to a partnership and the resulting partnership continues as the agent.
(i)
Facts.
P, a State M limited liability partnership
with two partners that is formed on January 1 of Year 1, elects pursuant to § 301.7701-3(c) of this chapter to be an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes effective on the date of formation. P is the common parent and agent for the P consolidated group consisting of P and its two subsidiaries, S and S-1. P files consolidated returns for the P group in Years 1 through 6. On January 1 of Year 7, P elects pursuant to § 301.7701-3(c) of this chapter to be treated as a partnership. P remains in existence under applicable law.
(ii)
Analysis.
The P group terminates and P is no longer the common parent of a consolidated group after its election to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Because P remains in existence under applicable law, P is the agent for the P group under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) and (c)(1) of this section for Years 1 through 6. If P merged into a foreign partnership instead of converting to a partnership, the foreign partnership would be P's default successor and agent for the P group for Years 1 through 6. See paragraphs (b)(4) and (c)(1) of this section.
(8)
Example 8
—
Forward triangular merger of agent—successor as default successor.
(i)
Facts.
As of January 1 of Year 1, P is the common parent and agent for the P consolidated group consisting of P and its two subsidiaries, S and S-1. P files a consolidated return for the P group for Year 1. On January 1 of Year 3, P merges with and into Z-1, a subsidiary of Z, in a forward triangular merger qualifying as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(D). The transaction constitutes a reverse acquisition under § 1.1502-75(d)(3)(i) resulting in a group structure change as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section because P's shareholders receive more than 50 percent of Z's stock in exchange for all of P's stock. Z-1, the corporation that survives the merger and the successor of P, is the default successor for the P group for Years 1 and 2.
(ii)
Analysis.
Although Z is the new common parent for the P group (which continues pursuant to § 1.1502-75(d)(3)(i)) for consolidated return years after the merger, and, as a consequence, Z is the new agent as a result of this group structure change, P may not designate an agent for Years 1 or 2 because Z-1 is P's default successor and the agent for the P group for Years 1 and 2. Z-1 must file the P group's consolidated return for Year 2. See paragraphs (b)(4) and (c)(1) of this section.

Example 9
—
Merger of the agent into a disregarded entity in exchange for stock of owner in a transaction qualifying as a reorganization under the Code where successor is the default successor.
(i)
Facts.
As of January 1 of Year 1, P is the common parent and agent for the P consolidated group consisting of P and its two subsidiaries, S and S-1. P files a consolidated return for the P group in Year 1. On January 1 of Year 2, the shareholders of P form Y, a State M corporation. On the same date, Y forms Y-1, a State M limited liability company that is a disregarded entity (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) for federal income tax purposes, and P merges into Y-1 under State M law. In the merger, the P shareholders receive all of the Y stock. Y (through Y-1) is treated as acquiring the assets of P in a transaction qualifying as a reorganization of P into Y under section 368(a)(1)(F), and the P group continues under § 1.1502-75(d)(2) with Y as the common parent and, as a consequence, the transaction is treated as a group structure change as described in paragraph (c)(3) with Y as the P group's agent for Year 2. In Year 4, the Commissioner seeks to extend the period of limitations on assessment with respect to Year 1 of the P group. In Year 5, the Commissioner seeks to extend the period of limitations on assessment with respect to Year 2 of the Y group (formerly the P group).
(ii)
Analysis.
(A)
Year 1 extension.
As a result of the January 1, Year 2 merger, Y-1 is the default successor of P, and the agent for the P group for Year 1. See paragraphs (b)(4) and (c)(1) of this section. Therefore, Y-1 is the only party that can sign the extension with respect to the P group for Year 1.
(B)
Year 2 extension.
Because the January 1, Year 2 merger qualified as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F), the P group remains in existence with Y as the common parent. Therefore, Y, the common parent of the P group
after the merger, is the P group's agent for all of Year 2 (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section) and is the only party that can sign the extension with respect to the P group for that year and in succeeding years. See paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) and (c)(1) of this section.

Example 10
—
Designation of agent where there is no default successor.
(i)
Facts.
P is incorporated under the laws of State X. Fifty percent of its stock is owned at all times by A, an individual, and 50 percent by BCD, a partnership. On January 1 of Year 1, P forms two subsidiaries, S and T, and becomes the common parent of the P group. P files consolidated returns for the P group beginning in Year 1 and is the agent for the P consolidated group beginning on January 1 of Year 1. On November 30 of Year 3, P dissolves under X law. Under X law, A and BCD are primarily liable for the federal income tax liability of dissolved corporation P. State X law allows the officers of a dissolved corporation to perform certain actions incident to the winding up of its affairs after its dissolution, including the filing of tax returns.
(ii)
Analysis.
Upon P's dissolution, there is no default successor to P, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, because there are two successors. Prior to its dissolution on November 30 of Year 3, pursuant to paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, P may designate an agent for the P group for Years 1 and 2 and the short taxable year ending on November 30 of Year 3, to be effective upon P's dissolution. P may designate S or T, pursuant to paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section (because they are members of the former group), or BCD (because it is an entity that is a successor to P pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section). P cannot designate A pursuant to paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, because A is not an entity. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the officers of P cannot designate an agent for the P group after P dissolves on November 30 of Year 3, notwithstanding the winding up provisions of State X law. Accordingly, P should designate an agent prior to its dissolution to ensure that there is an agent authorized to file the short Year 3 consolidated return. If P does not designate an agent prior to dissolution under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, the Commissioner may designate an agent under paragraph (c)(6)(i)(A)(
1
) of this section from among S, T, or BCD, upon their request or otherwise. If any of S, T, A, or BCD realizes that P has dissolved without designating an agent, it should request, in writing, a designation of an agent by the Commissioner as soon as possible.
(11)
Example 11
—
Commissioner designates a new agent.
(i)
Agent fails to fulfill its obligations.
(A)
Facts.
P is the common parent and agent for the P consolidated group consisting of P and its two subsidiaries, S-1 and S-2, each a State Y corporation. P files a consolidated return for the P group in Year 1. In Year 2, S-3, also a State Y corporation, joins the P group. The P group continues as a consolidated group in Years 2, 3, and 4. As of Year 4, P has failed to file the P group consolidated returns for Years 2 and 3.
(B)
Analysis.
(
1
)
Scope of designation.
Because P failed to perform its obligations as agent as prescribed by federal tax law, the Commissioner may, under the authority of paragraph (c)(6)(i)(A)(
3
) of this section, on the Commissioner's own accord, with or without a written request from a member, designate another entity described in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section to act as the agent for not just Years 2 and 3, but any of Years 1 through 4.
(
2
)
Year 1 designation.
The Commissioner may designate either S-1 or S-2, both of which are entities described in paragraphs (c)(6)(i) and (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, to act as the agent for the P group for Year 1. Because S-3 was not a member of the group in Year 1, it is not an entity described in paragraphs (c)(6)(i) and (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section for Year 1 and therefore cannot be the agent for Year 1. Unless otherwise provided in the designation, the designation of either S-1 or S-2 will also be effective for Years 2, 3, and 4 and all succeeding consolidated return years of the group.
(
3
)
Year 2 designation.
The Commissioner may designate either S-1, S-2, or S-3, all of which are entities described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, to act as the agent for the P
group for Year 2. Unless otherwise provided in the designation, the designation of either S-1, S-2, or S-3 will also be effective for Years 3 and 4 and all succeeding consolidated return years of the group.
(
4
)
Year 3 designation.
The Commissioner may designate any of S-1, S-2, or S-3 as the agent for Year 3. Unless otherwise provided in the designation, the designation of either S-1, S-2, or S-3 will also be effective for Year 4 and all succeeding consolidated return years of the group.
(
5
)
Year 4 designation.
The Commissioner may designate any of S-1, S-2, or S-3 as the agent for Year 4. Unless otherwise provided in the designation, the designation of either S-1, S-2, or S-3 will also be effective for all succeeding consolidated return years of the group.
(ii)
Member requests replacement of designated agent.
(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(11)(i)(A) of this section, except that in Year 4 the Commissioner designates S-1 as agent for Years 1 and succeeding years to replace P for P's failure to fulfill its obligations. After receiving notification that S-1 has been designated, S-3 submits a request in Year 4, pursuant to paragraph (c)(6)(i)(B) of this section, that the Commissioner designate S-2 as the agent because S-1 does not have ready access to the group's books and records, which are located in another state and are in the possession of S-2.
(B)
Analysis.
In light of S-3's request, the Commissioner may, under the authority of paragraph (c)(6)(i)(B) of this section, designate either S-2 (for all or any years) or S-3 (for any year or years other than Year 1) as agent in lieu of the previously designated agent, S-1. However, notwithstanding S-3's request, the Commissioner is not required to replace S-1 as agent for any of the consolidated return years for which S-1 was designated.
(12)
Example 12
—
Designated agent ceases to be a member of the group.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(11)(ii)(A) of this section (
Example 11
), except that in Year 4 no member requests that the Commissioner replace S-1, which accordingly continues to be the agent for the P group in Year 5 pursuant to paragraph (c)(6)(iii) of this section. On May 2 of Year 5, S-1 converts under State Y law into S-1 LLC, a limited liability company that is an entity that is treated as a disregarded entity (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) and, as a consequence, is no longer a member of the P group after the conversion.
(ii)
Analysis for completed years.
S-1 LLC, the disregarded entity resulting from the conversion, becomes S-1's default successor. As such, S-1 LLC is the agent for Years 1-4.
(iii)
Analysis for current and succeeding years.
S-1 is an agent designated by the Commissioner pursuant to paragraph (c)(6)(i)(A)(
3
) of this section. Because S-1 is no longer a member of the P group after May 2 of Year 5, S-1 is the agent for the P group for Year 5 only while it remains a member (see paragraphs (c)(6)(i) and (iii) of this section). According to paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, although S-1 LLC is S-1's default successor, it is not a member of the group for the current year and therefore cannot be its agent. Furthermore, S-1 cannot designate an agent for Year 5 under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section because that paragraph pertains only to designations for completed years for which there is no default successor. In addition, S-1 cannot designate an agent for Year 5 under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section because S-1 was previously designated by the Commissioner under paragraph (c)(6)(i)(A)(
3
) of this section.
(iv)
Member's notice to Commissioner for Commissioner to designate a member of the group for a current year.
A member of the group in Year 5 should request that the Commissioner designate, pursuant to paragraphs (c)(6)(i)(A)(
2
) and (c)(6)(iv) of this section, another member of the P group to be the agent of the group for Year 5. The Commissioner may then, pursuant to paragraph (c)(6)(i)(A)(
2
) of this section, designate either S-2, S-3, or P to be the agent for the P group and, once so designated, that member will be, effective on May 3 of Year 5, the agent for all of Year 5 and for succeeding years (subject to the rules of this section) pursuant to paragraph (c)(6)(iii) of this section. No actions taken by S-1 on behalf of the P group through May 2, Year 5, are nullified by the Commissioner's
designation of another agent even though the agent so designated will be the agent for all of Year 5.
(13)
Example 13
—
Fraudulent conveyance of assets.
(i)
Facts.
As of January 1 of Year 1, P is the common parent and agent for the P consolidated group consisting of P and its two subsidiaries, S and S-1. On April 15 of Year 2, P files a consolidated return that includes the income of S and S-1 for Year 1. On December 1 of Year 2, S-1 transfers assets having a fair market value of $100x to U in exchange for $10x. This transfer of assets for less than fair market value constitutes a fraudulent conveyance under applicable state law. On March 1 of Year 5, P executes a waiver extending to December 31 of Year 6 the period of limitations on assessment with respect to the P group's Year 1 consolidated return. On February 1 of Year 6, the Commissioner issues a notice of deficiency to P asserting a deficiency of $30x for the P group's Year 1 consolidated tax liability. P does not file a petition for redetermination in the Tax Court, and the Commissioner makes a timely assessment against the P group. P, S, and S-1 are all insolvent and are unable to pay the deficiency. On February 1 of Year 8, the Commissioner sends a notice of transferee liability to U, which does not file a petition in the Tax Court. On August 1 of Year 8, the Commissioner assesses the amount of the P group's deficiency against U. Under section 6901(c), the Commissioner may assess U's transferee liability within one year after the expiration of the period of limitations against the transferor, S-1. By operation of section 6213(a) and 6503(a), the issuance of the notice of deficiency to P and the expiration of the 90-day period for filing a petition in the Tax Court have the effect of further extending by 150 days the P group's limitations period on assessment from the previously extended date of December 31 of Year 6 to May 30 of Year 7.
(ii)
Analysis.
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the waiver executed by P on March 1 of Year 5 to extend the period of limitations on assessment to December 31 of Year 6 and the further extension of the P group's limitations period to May 30 of Year 7 (by operation of sections 6213(a) and 6503(a)) have the derivative effect of extending the period of limitations on assessment of U's transferee liability to May 30 of Year 8. By operation of section 6901(f), the issuance of the notice of transferee liability to U and the expiration of the 90-day period for filing a petition in the Tax Court have the effect of further extending the limitations period on assessment of U's liability as a transferee by 150 days, from May 30 of Year 8 to October 27 of Year 8. Accordingly, the Commissioner may send a notice of transferee liability to U at any time on or before May 30 of Year 8 and assess the unpaid liability against U at any time on or before October 27 of Year 8. The result would be the same even if S-1 ceased to exist before March 1 of Year 5, the date P executed the waiver.
(14)
Example 14
—
Consent to extend the statute of limitations for a partnership where a member of the consolidated group is a partner of such partnership subject to the provisions of the Code and the tax matters partner is not a member of the group.
(i)
Facts.
P is the common parent and agent for the P consolidated group consisting of P and its two subsidiaries, S and S-1. The P group has a November 30 fiscal year end and P files consolidated returns for the P group for the years ending November 30, Year 1 and November 30, Year 2. S-1 is a partner in the PRS partnership, which is subject to the provisions of sections 6221 through 6234. PRS has a calendar year end and A, an individual, is the tax matters partner of the PRS partnership. PRS files a partnership return for the year ending December 31, Year 1. On January 10, Year 5, A, as the tax matters partner for the PRS partnership, executes a consent to extend the period for assessment of partnership items of PRS for all partners, and the Commissioner co-executes the consent on the same day for the year ending December 31, Year 1.
(ii)
Analysis.
A's consent to extend the statute of limitations for the partnership items of PRS partnership for the year ending December 31, Year 1, extends the statute of limitations with respect to the partnership items for all members of the P group, including P, S, and S-1 for the consolidated return year ending November 30, Year 2. This
is because S-1 is a partner in the PRS partnership for which A, the tax matters partner for the PRS partnership, consents, pursuant to section 6229(b)(1)(B), to extend the statute of limitations for the year ending December 31, Year 1. However, under paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, such agreement with respect to the statute of limitations for the PRS partnership for the year ending December 31, Year 1 does not obviate the need to obtain a consent from P, the agent for the P consolidated group, to extend the statute of limitations for the P consolidated group for the P group's consolidated return years ending November 30, Year 1 and November 30, Year 2 regarding any items other than partnership items or affected items of the PRS partnership.
(15)
Example 15
—
Contacting subsidiary member in order to facilitate the conduct of an examination, appeal, or settlement where a member of the consolidated group is a partner of a partnership subject to the provisions of the Code.
(i)
Facts.
P is the common parent and agent for the P consolidated group consisting of P and its two subsidiaries, S and S-1. The P group has a November 30 fiscal year end, and P files consolidated returns for the P group for the years ending November 30, Year 1 and November 30, Year 2. S-1 is a partner in the PRS partnership, which is subject to the provisions of sections 6221 through 6234. PRS has a calendar year end and A, an individual, is the tax matters partner of the PRS partnership. PRS files a partnership return for the year ending December 31, Year 1. The Commissioner, on January 10, Year 4, in the course of an examination of the PRS partnership for the year ending December 31, Year 1, seeks to obtain information in the course of that examination to resolve the audit.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because the direct contact with a subsidiary member of a consolidated group that is a partner in a partnership subject to the provisions under sections 6221 through 6234 may facilitate the conduct of an examination, appeal, or settlement, the Commissioner, under paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, may communicate directly with either S-1, P, or A regarding the PRS partnership without breaking agency pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. However, if the Commissioner were instead seeking to execute a settlement agreement with respect to S-1 as a partner with respect to its liability as a partner in PRS partnership, P would need to execute such settlement agreement for all members of the group including the partner subsidiary.

§ 1.1502-78
Tentative carryback adjustments.
(a)
General rule.
If a group has a consolidated net operating loss, a consolidated net capital loss, or a consolidated unused business credit for any taxable year, then any application under section 6411 for a tentative carryback adjustment of the taxes for a consolidated return year or years preceding such year shall be made by the common parent corporation for the carryback year (or the agent determined under § 1.1502-77(c) or § 1.1502-77B(d) for the carryback year) to the extent such loss or unused business credit is not apportioned to a corporation for a separate return year pursuant to § 1.1502-21(b), 1.1502-22(b), or 1.1502-79(c). In the case of the portion of a consolidated net operating loss or consolidated net capital loss or consolidated unused business credit to which the preceding sentence does not apply and that is to be carried back to a corporation that was not a member
of a consolidated group in the carryback year, the corporation to which such loss or credit is attributable shall make any application under section 6411. In the case of a net capital loss or net operating loss or unused business credit arising in a separate return year that may be carried back to a consolidated return year, after taking into account the application of § 1.1502-21(b)(4) with respect to any net operating loss arising in another consolidated group, the common parent for the carryback year (or the agent determined under § 1.1502-77(c) or § 1.1502-77B(d) for the carryback year) shall make any application under section 6411.
(b)
Special rules
—(1)
Payment of refund.
Any refund allowable under an application referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall be made directly to and in the name of the corporation filing the application, except that in all cases where a loss is deducted from the consolidated taxable income or a credit is allowed in computing the consolidated tax liability for a consolidated return year, any refund shall be made directly to and in the name of the common parent corporation for the carryback year (or the agent determined under § 1.1502-77(c) or § 1.1502-77B(d) for the carryback year). The payment of any such refund shall discharge any liability of the Government with respect to such refund.
(2)
Several liability.
If a group filed a consolidated return for a taxable year for which there was an adjustment by reason of an application under section 6411, and if a deficiency is assessed against such group under section 6213(b)(3), then each member of such group shall be severally liable for such deficiency including any interest or penalty assessed in connection with such deficiency.
(3)
Groups that include insolvent financial institutions.
For further rules applicable to groups that include insolvent financial institutions, see § 301.6402-7 of this chapter.
(c)
Examples.
The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporations P, S, and S-1 filed a consolidated return for the calendar year 2003. P, S, and S-1 also filed a consolidated return for the calendar year 2006. The group incurred a consolidated net operating loss in 2006 attributable to S-1 which may be carried back to 2003 as a consolidated net operating loss carryback. If a tentative carryback adjustment is desired, P, the common parent for the carryback year, must file an application under section 6411 and any refund will be made to P.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that P, S, and S-1 filed separate returns for the calendar year 2006, even though they were members of the same group for such year. P incurred a net operating loss in 1969 which may be carried back to 2003. If a tentative carryback adjustment is desired, P must file an application under section 6411 and any refund from such application will be made to P.

# Example 3.
Corporations X, Y, and Z filed a consolidated return for the calendar year 2003. Z ceased to be a member of the group in 2004. Z filed a separate return for 2005 while X and Y filed a consolidated return for such year. The group incurred a consolidated net operating loss in 2005 attributable to Y, which may be carried back to 2003. Z also incurred a net operating loss for 2005 which may be carried back to 2003. If a tentative carryback adjustment is claimed with respect to the consolidated net operating loss, X, the common parent, must file an application under section 6411. If a tentative carryback adjustment is desired with respect to Z's loss, X must file an application. Any refunds attributable to either application will be made to X. If an assessment is made under section 6213(b)(3) to recover an excessive tentative allowance made with respect to calendar year 2003, X, Y, and Z are severally liable for such assessment.

# Example 4.
Corporations L and M filed a consolidated return for the calendar year 2003. Corporation N filed a separate return for such year. Later, N became a member of the group and filed a consolidated return with the group for the calendar year 2005. The group incurred a consolidated net operating loss in 2005 attributable to N which may be carried back to N's separate return for 2003. If a tentative carryback adjustment is desired, N must file an application under section 6411 and any refund will be made directly to N.
(d)
Adjustments of overpayments of estimated income tax.
If a group paid its estimated income tax on a consolidated basis, then any application under section 6425 for an adjustment of overpayment of estimated income tax shall be made by the common parent corporation. If the members of a group paid estimated income taxes on a separate
basis, then any application under section 6425 shall be made by the member of the group which claims an overpayment on a separate basis. Any refund allowable under an application under section 6425 shall be made directly to and in the name of the corporation filing the application.
(e)
Time for filing application
—(1)
General rule.
The provisions of section 6411(a) apply to the filing of an application for a tentative carryback adjustment by a consolidated group.
(2)
Special rule for new members
—(i)
New member.
A new member is a corporation that, in the preceding taxable year, did not qualify as a member, as defined in § 1.1502-1(b), of the consolidated group that it now joins.
(ii)
End of taxable year.
Solely for the purpose of complying with the twelve-month requirement for making an application for a tentative carryback adjustment under section 6411(a), the separate return year of a qualified new member shall be treated as ending on the same date as the end of the current taxable year of the consolidated group that the qualified new member joins.
(iii)
Qualified new member.
A new member of a consolidated group qualifies for purposes of the provisions of this paragraph (e)(2) if, immediately prior to becoming a new member, either—
(A) It was the common parent of a consolidated group; or
(B) It was not required to join in the filing of a consolidated return.
(iv)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (e)(2) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Individual A owns 100 percent of the stock of X, a corporation that is not a member of a consolidated group and files separate tax returns on a calendar year basis. On January 31 of year 1, X becomes a member of the Y consolidated group, which also files returns on a calendar year basis. X is a qualified new member as defined in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B) of this section because, immediately prior to becoming a new member of the Y consolidated group, X was not required to join in the filing of a consolidated return. As a result of its becoming a new member of Group Y, X's separate return for the short taxable year (January 1 of year 1 through January 31 of year 1) is due September 15 of year 2 (with extensions). See § 1.1502-76(c). Group Y's consolidated return is also due September 15 of year 2 (with extensions). See § 1.1502-76(c). Solely for the purpose of complying with the twelve-month requirement for making an application for a tentative carryback adjustment under section 6411(a), X's taxable year for the separate return year is treated as ending on December 31 of year 1. X's application for a tentative carryback adjustment is therefore due on or before December 31 of year 2.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that immediately prior to becoming a new member of Group Y, X was a member of the Z consolidated group. Because X was required to join in the filing of the consolidated return for Group Z, X is not a qualified new member as defined in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section. X's items for the one-month period will be included in the consolidated return for Group Z. Group Z's application for a tentative carryback adjustment, if any, continues to be due within 12 months of the end of its taxable year, which is not affected by X's change in status as a new member of Group Y.
(f)
Applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years to which a loss or credit may be carried back and for which the due date (without extensions) of the original return is after June 28, 2002, except that the provisions of paragraph (e)(2) of this section apply for applications by new members of consolidated groups for tentative carryback adjustments resulting from net operating losses, net capital losses, or unused business credits arising in separate return years of new members that begin on or after January 1, 2001.
(2)
Prior law.
For taxable years to which a loss or credit may be carried back and for which the due date (without extensions) of the original return is on or before June 28, 2002,

§ 1.1502-79
Separate return years.
(a)
Carryover and carryback of consolidated net operating losses to separate return years.
For rules regarding the carryover and carryback of consolidated net operating losses to separate return years,
see
§ 1.1502-21(b).
(b)
Carryover and carryback of consolidated net capital loss to separate return years.
For rules regarding the carryover and carryback of consolidated net capital losses to separate return years,
see
§ 1.1502-22(b).
(c)
Carryover and carryback of consolidated unused investment credit to separate return years
—(1)
In general.
If a consolidated unused investment credit can be carried under the principles of section 46(b) and paragraph (b) of § 1.1502-3 to a separate return year of a corporation (or could have been so carried if such corporation were in existence) which was a member of the group in the year in which such unused credit arose, then the portion of such consolidated unused credit attributable to such corporation (as determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) shall be apportioned to such corporation (and any successor to such corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies) under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b) (or §§ 1.1502-79A(a)(1) and (2), as appropriate) and shall be an investment credit carryover or carryback to such separate return year.
(2)
Portion of consolidated unused investment credit attributable to a member
—(i)
Investment credit carryback.
In the case of a consolidated unused credit which is an investment credit carryback, the portion of such consolidated unused credit attributable to a member of the group is an amount equal to such consolidated unused credit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the credit earned of such member for the consolidated unused credit year, and the denominator of which is the consolidated credit earned for such unused credit year.
(ii)
Investment credit carryover.
In the case of a consolidated unused credit which is an investment credit carryover, the portion of such consolidated unused credit attributable to a member of the group is an amount equal to such consolidated unused credit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the credit earned with respect to any section 38 property placed in service in the consolidated unused credit year and owned by such member (whether or not placed in service by such member) at the close of the last day as of which the taxable income of such member is included in a consolidated return filed by the group, and the denominator of which is the consolidated credit earned for such unused credit year.
(d)
Carryover and carryback of consolidated unused foreign tax
—(1)
In general.
If a consolidated unused foreign tax can be carried under the principles of section 904(c) and § 1.1502-4(d) to a separate return year of a corporation (or could have been so carried if such corporation were in existence) that was a member of the group in the year in which the unused foreign tax arose, then the portion of the consolidated unused foreign tax attributable to the corporation (as determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section) is apportioned to the corporation (and any successor to that corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies) under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b) and is deemed paid or accrued in such separate return year to the extent provided in section 904(c).
(2)
Portion of consolidated unused foreign tax attributable to a member.
The portion of a consolidated unused foreign tax for any year attributable to a member is an amount equal to the consolidated unused foreign tax multiplied by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the foreign taxes paid or accrued by the member for the year (including those taxes deemed paid or accrued, other than by reason of section 904(c)). The denominator of the fraction is the aggregate of all such taxes paid or accrued for the year (including those taxes deemed paid or accrued, other than by reason of section 904(c)) by all members of the group.
(e)
Carryover of consolidated excess charitable contributions to separate return years
—(1)
In general.
If the consolidated excess charitable contributions for any taxable year can be carried under the principles of section 170(b)(2) and § 1.1502-24(b) to a separate return year of a corporation (or could have
been so carried if such corporation were in existence) which was a member of the group in the year in which such excess contributions arose, then the portion of such consolidated excess charitable contributions attributable to such corporation (as determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section) is apportioned to such corporation (and any successor to such corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies) under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b) and is a charitable contribution carryover to such separate return year.
(2)
Portion of consolidated excess charitable contributions attributable to a member.
The portion of the consolidated excess charitable contributions for any year attributable to a member is an amount equal to the consolidated excess contributions multiplied by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the charitable contributions paid by the member for the year. The denominator of the fraction is the aggregate of all charitable contributions paid for the year by all members of the group.
(f)
Disallowed business interest expense carryforwards.
For the treatment of disallowed business interest expense carryforwards (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(11)) of a member arising in a separate return limitation year, see § 1.163(j)-5(d) and (f).
[T.D. 6894, 31 FR 11794, Sept. 8, 1966, as amended by T.D. 7728, 45 FR 72650, Nov. 3, 1980; T.D. 8294, 55 FR 9438, Mar. 14, 1990; T.D. 8319, 55 FR 49038, Nov. 26, 1990; T.D. 8364, 56 FR 47402, Sept. 19, 1991; T.D. 8597, 60 FR 36710, July 18, 1995; T.D. 8677, 61 FR 33324, 33325, 33334, June 27, 1996; T.D. 8823, 64 FR 36100, July 2, 1999; T.D. 9905, 85 FR 56843, Sept. 14, 2020; T.D. 10018, 89 FR 106876, Dec. 30, 2024]
§ 1.1502-80
Applicability of other provisions of law.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Application of other provisions.
The Internal Revenue Code (Code), or other law, shall be applicable to the group to the extent the regulations do not exclude its application. To the extent not excluded, other rules operate in addition to, and may be modified by, these regulations. Thus, for example, in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, the acquiring corporation will succeed to the tax attributes described in section 381(c). Furthermore, sections 269 and 482 apply for any consolidated return year. However, in a recognition transaction otherwise subject to section 1001, for example, the rules of section 1001 continue to apply, but may be modified by the intercompany transaction regulations under § 1.1502-13.
(2)
No duplicative adjustments.
Nothing in these regulations shall be interpreted or applied to require an adjustment, inclusion, or other item to the extent it would have the effect of duplicating any other adjustment, inclusion, or other item required under the Code or other rule of law, including other provisions of these regulations.
(3)
Application of single-entity principles.
If two or more adjustments, inclusions, or other items are subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the determination of which adjustment, inclusion, or other item is treated as applied or taken into account is made by taking into account the purposes of the provisions and applying single-entity principles as appropriate.
(4)
Effective/applicability dates.
This paragraph (a) is applicable with respect to transactions and determinations on or after September 17, 2008.
(b)
Non-applicability of section 304.
Section 304 does not apply to any acquisition of stock of a corporation in an intercompany transaction or to any intercompany item from such transaction occurring on or after July 24, 1991.
(c)
Deferral of section 165
—(1)
General rule.
Subsidiary stock is not treated as worthless under section 165 until immediately before the earlier of the time—
(i) The stock is worthless within the meaning of § 1.1502-19(c)(1)(iii); or
(ii) The subsidiary for any reason ceases to be a member of the group.
(2)
Cross reference. See
§ 1.1502-36 for additional rules relating to worthlessness of subsidiary stock.
(3)
Effective/applicability date.
This paragraph (c) applies to taxable years for which the original consolidated Federal income tax return is due (without extensions) after July 18, 2007. However, taxpayers may apply this paragraph (c) to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1995.
(d)
Non-applicability of section 357(c)
—(1)
In general.
Section 357(c) does not apply to any transaction to which
§ 1.1502-13, § 1.1502-13T, § 1.1502-14, or § 1.1502-14T applies, if it occurs in a consolidated return year beginning on or after January 1, 1995. For example, P, S, and T are members of a consolidated group, P owns all of the stock of S and T with bases of $30 and $20, respectively, S has a $30 basis in its assets and $40 of liabilities, and S merges into T in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(A) (and in section 368(a)(1)(D)); section 357(c) does not apply to the merger, P's basis in T's stock increases to $50 ($30 plus $20), and T succeeds to S's $30 basis in the assets transferred subject to the $40 liability. Similarly, if S instead transferred its assets and liabilities to a newly formed subsidiary in a transaction to which section 351 applies, section 357(c) does not apply and S's basis in the subsidiary's stock is a $10 excess loss account. This paragraph (d) does not apply to a transaction if the transferor or transferee becomes a nonmember as part of the same plan or arrangement. The transferor (or transferee) is treated as becoming a nonmember once it is no longer a member of a consolidated group that includes the transferee (or transferor). For purposes of this paragraph (d), any reference to a transferor or transferee includes, as the context may require, a reference to a successor or predecessor.
(2)
Prior period transactions.
If, in a tax year beginning before January 1, 1995, a member's stock with an excess loss account is transferred in a transaction to which § 1.1502-13, § 1.1502-13T, § 1.1502-14, or § 1.1502-14T applies, paragraph (d)(1) of this section applies to the stock transfer to the extent that the income, gain, deduction, or loss (if any) is not taken into account in a tax year beginning before January 1, 1995. For example, if P, S, and T, are members of a consolidated group, T's stock has an excess loss account, and P transfers the T stock to S in 1993 in a transaction to which section 351 and § 1.1502-13 apply, section 357(c) applies to the transfer only to the extent P's gain is taken into account in tax years beginning before January 1, 1995.
(e)
Non-applicability of section 163(e)(5).
Section 163(e)(5) does not apply to any intercompany obligation (within the meaning of § 1.1502-13(g)) issued in a consolidated return year beginning on or after July 12, 1995.
(f)
Non-applicability of section 1031.
Section 1031 does not apply to any intercompany transaction occurring in consolidated return years beginning on or after July 12, 1995.
(g)
Special rules for liquidations to which section 332 applies.
Notwithstanding the general rule of section 381, if multiple members (distributee members) acquire assets of a corporation in a liquidation to which section 332 applies (regardless of whether any single member owns stock in the liquidating corporation meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2)), such members succeed to and take into account the items of the liquidating corporation (including items described in section 381(c), but excluding intercompany items under § 1.1502-13) as provided in this paragraph (g) to the extent not otherwise prohibited by any applicable provision of law. This paragraph (g) does not apply to the intercompany items of the liquidating corporation. See § 1.1502-13(j)(2)(ii).
(1)
Income offset items and deferred income.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (g)(1), each distributee member succeeds to and takes into account the items of the liquidating corporation that could be used to offset the income of the group or any member (including deferred deductions, net operating loss carryovers, and capital loss carryovers) (income offset items) to the extent that such items would have been reflected in investment adjustments to the stock of the liquidating corporation owned by such distributee member under § 1.1502-32(c) if, immediately prior to the liquidation, any stock of the liquidating corporation owned by nonmembers had been redeemed and then such items had been taken into account. However, each distributee member succeeds to the full amount of any deferred deduction or deferred income item attributable to the particular property or business operations distributed to such distributee in the liquidation to the extent that such item is not taken into account in the determination of the income or loss of the liquidating corporation with regard to the liquidation under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). If
the liquidating corporation is not a member of the group at the time of the liquidation, the rules of this paragraph (g)(1) are applied as if the liquidating corporation had been a member of the group.
(2)
Accounting for deferred income items.
Solely for the purpose of determining whether deferred income items of a liquidating corporation are taken into account under applicable principles of law as a result of a liquidation to which section 332 applies, the transfer of property to, and the assumption of liabilities by, a distributee member that does not own stock in the liquidating corporation meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2) without regard to the application of § 1.1502-34 immediately prior to the liquidation is not treated as part of a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. In addition, section 332(a) does not apply in determining the recognition or nonrecognition of any income realized by the distributee member under applicable principles of law on account of consideration received (or deemed received) on the assumption of the liquidating corporation's obligation or liability attributable to any deferred income item.
(3)
Credits and earnings and profits.
Each distributee member succeeds to and takes into account a percentage of each credit of the liquidating corporation equal to the value of the stock of the liquidating corporation owned by such distributee at the time of the liquidation divided by the total value of all the stock of the liquidating corporation owned by members of the group at the time of the liquidation. Except to the extent that the distributee member's earnings and profits already reflect the liquidating corporation's earnings and profits, each distributee member succeeds to and takes into account under the principles of § 1.1502-32(c) the earnings and profits, or deficit in earnings and profits, of the liquidating corporation (determined after taking into account the amount of earnings and profits properly applicable to distributions to non-member shareholders under § 1.381(c)(2)-1(c)(2)). If the liquidating corporation is not a member of the group at the time of the liquidation, the rules of this paragraph (g)(3) are applied as if the liquidating corporation had been a member of the group.
(4)
Other items.
With regard to items to which neither paragraph (g)(1) nor (g)(3) of this section applies, a distributee member that, immediately prior to the liquidation, owns stock in the liquidating corporation meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2) without regard to the application of § 1.1502-34 succeeds to the items of the liquidating corporation in accordance with section 381 and other applicable principles. A distributee member that, immediately prior to the liquidation, does not own stock in the liquidating corporation meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2) without regard to the application of § 1.1502-34 succeeds to the items of the liquidating corporation to the extent that it would have succeeded to those items if it had purchased, in a taxable transaction, the assets or businesses of the liquidating corporation that it received in the liquidation and had assumed the liabilities that it assumed in the liquidation.
(5)
Determination of the items of a liquidating subsidiary.
For purposes of this section, the items of a liquidating subsidiary include the amount of any consolidated tax attribute attributable to the liquidating subsidiary that is determined pursuant to the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv). In addition, if the liquidating subsidiary is a member of a separate return limitation year subgroup, the amount of a tax attribute that arose in a separate return limitation year that is attributable to that member shall also be determined pursuant to the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv).
(6)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (g):

# Example 1. Liquidation—80 percent distributee.
(i)
Facts.
X has only common stock outstanding. On January 1 of year 1, X acquired equipment with a 10-year recovery period and elected to depreciate the equipment using the straight-line method of depreciation. On January 1 of year 7, M1 and M2 own 80 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of X's stock. X is a domestic corporation but is not a member of the group that includes M1 and M2. On that date, X distributes all of its assets to M1 and M2 in complete liquidation. The equipment is distributed to M1. Under
section 334(b), M1's basis in the equipment is the same as it would be in X's hands. After computing its tax liability for the taxable year that includes the liquidation, X has net operating losses of $100, business credits of $40, and earnings and profits of $80.
(ii)
Succession to items described in section 381(c).
(A)
Losses.
Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, each distributee member succeeds to X's items that could be used to offset the income of the group or any member to the extent that such items would have been reflected in investment adjustments to the stock of X it owned under § 1.1502-32(c) if, immediately prior to the liquidation, such items had been taken into account. Accordingly, M1 and M2 succeed to $80 and $20, respectively, of X's net operating loss.
(B)
Credits and earnings and profits.
Under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, because, immediately prior to the liquidation, M1 and M2 hold 80 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of the value of the stock of X, M1 and M2 succeed to $32 and $8, respectively, of X's $40 of business credits. In addition, because M1's and M2's earnings and profits do not reflect X's earnings and profits, X's earnings and profits are allocated to M1 and M2 under the principles of § 1.1502-32(c). Therefore, M1 and M2 succeed to $64 and $16, respectively, of X's earnings and profits.
(C)
Depreciation of equipment's basis.
Under paragraph (g)(4) of this section, because M1 owns stock in X meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2) without regard to the application of § 1.1502-34, M1 is required to continue to depreciate the equipment using the straight-line method of depreciation over the remaining recovery period of 4.5 years (assuming X used a half-year convention).

# Example 2. Liquidation-no 80 percent distributee.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that M1 and M2 own 60 percent and 40 percent, respectively, of X's stock. In addition, on January 1 of year 6, X entered into a long-term contract with Y, an unrelated party. The total contract price is $1000, and X estimates the total allocable contract costs to be $500. At the time of the liquidation, X had received $250 in progress payments under the contract and incurred costs of $125. X accounted for the contract under the percentage of completion method described in section 460(b). In the liquidation, M1 assumes X's contract obligations and rights.
(ii)
Succession to items described in section 381(c).
(A)
Losses.
Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, each distributee member succeeds to X's items that could be used to offset the income of the group or any member to the extent that such items would have been reflected in investment adjustments to the stock of X it owned under § 1.1502-32(c) if, immediately prior to the liquidation, such items had been taken into account. Accordingly, M1 and M2 succeed to $60 and $40, respectively, of X's net operating loss.
(B)
Credits and earnings and profits.
Under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, because, immediately prior to the liquidation, M1 and M2 hold 60 percent and 40 percent, respectively, of the value of the stock of X, M1 and M2 succeed to $24 and $16, respectively, of X's $40 of business credits. In addition, because M1's and M2's earnings and profits do not reflect X's earnings and profits, X's earnings and profits are allocated to M1 and M2 under the principles of § 1.1502-32(c). Therefore, M1 and M2 succeed to $48 and $32, respectively, of X's earnings and profits.
(C)
Depreciation of equipment's basis.
Under section 334(a), M1's basis in the equipment is its fair market value at the time of the distribution. Pursuant to section 168(i)(7), to the extent that M1's basis in the equipment does not exceed X's adjusted basis in the equipment at the time of the transfer, M1 is required to continue to depreciate the equipment using the straight-line method of depreciation over the remaining recovery period of 4.5 years (assuming X used a half-year convention). Any portion of M1's basis in the equipment that exceeds X's adjusted basis in the equipment at the time of the transfer is treated as being placed in service by M1 in the year of the transfer. Thus, M1 may choose any applicable depreciation method, recovery period, and convention under section 168 for such excess basis.
(D)
Method of accounting for long-term contract.
Under paragraph (g)(4) of this section, M1 does not succeed to X's method of accounting for the contract. Rather, under § 1.460-4(k)(2), M1 is treated as having entered into a new contract on the date of the liquidation. Under § 1.460-4(k)(2)(iii), M1 must evaluate whether the new contract should be classified as a long-term contract within the meaning of § 1.460-1(b) and account for the contract under a permissible method of accounting.

# Example 3. Liquidation—deferred items.
(i)
Facts.
X has only common stock outstanding, and M1 and M2 (who are members of the same group) own 80 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of X's stock. X operates two divisions, each of which defers prepaid subscription income pursuant to an election under section 455. X distributes all of its assets in complete liquidation. M1 receives all of the assets of Division 1, including prepaid subscription income, and assumes X's liability to furnish or deliver the newspaper, magazine, or other periodical to which the prepaid subscription income received by M1 relates. M2 receives all of the assets of Division 2, including prepaid subscription income, and assumes X's liability to furnish or deliver the newspaper, magazine, or other periodical to which the prepaid subscription income received by M2 relates.
(ii)
Acceleration of deferred income items and succession to other deferred items.
Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, M1 succeeds to the full amount of the deferred prepaid subscription income of X attributable to Division 1. Under applicable law, X does not recognize the deferred prepaid subscription income attributable to Division 1 because X's liability to furnish or deliver the newspaper, magazine, or other periodical ends as a result of a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. Under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, solely for purposes of determining whether the deferred income items of X attributable to Division 2 are taken into account as a result of the liquidation, the distribution of property to M2 is not treated as a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. Therefore, under applicable law, X's deferred prepaid subscription income attributable to Division 2 is taken into account in the determination of X's income or loss with regard to the liquidation. Further, under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, section 332(a) does not apply in determining the recognition or nonrecognition of any income that M2 realizes on account of consideration received (or deemed received) on its assumption of X's liability to furnish or deliver the newspaper, magazine, or other periodical to which the prepaid subscription income relates.
(7)
Effective/applicability date.
This paragraph (g) applies to transactions occurring after April 14, 2008.
(h)
Non-applicability of section 362(e)(2)
—(1)
General rule.
Section 362(e)(2) does not apply to any intercompany transaction occurring on or after September 17, 2008. Taxpayers may apply this paragraph (h) to intercompany transactions occurring on or after October 22, 2004, and in such case, any election made under section 362(e)(2)(C) will have no effect. The purpose of this paragraph (h) is to facilitate the application of the consolidated return provisions addressing the duplication of loss between members of a consolidated group.
(2)
Anti-abuse rule
—(i)
General rule.
If a taxpayer engages in a transaction to which section 362(e)(2) would apply but for the application of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, and acts with a view to prevent the consolidated return provisions from properly addressing loss duplication, appropriate adjustments will be made to clearly reflect the income of the group.
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the principle of the anti-abuse rule in this paragraph (h)(2).

# Example.
(A)
Facts.
P, the common parent of a consolidated group, owns the four outstanding shares of S stock (Share 1 through Share 4) with an aggregate basis of $0 and value of $80. S owns Asset 1 with a basis of $0 and a value of $80. With a view to prevent the consolidated return provisions from addressing the duplication of loss, P transfers Asset 2 with a basis of $100 and a value of $20 to S in exchange for an additional share of S stock (Share 5) in a transaction to which section 351 applies. P later sells Share 5 to X, an unrelated person, for $20 at a time when S's basis in Asset 2 was still $100. The sale is a transfer of a loss share and therefore subject to § 1.1502-36.
(B)
Analysis.
Although the sale would be subject to § 1.1502-36, that section would not prevent the stock loss or reduce S's attributes (to prevent duplication of the stock loss) because neither § 1.1502-36(b) nor § 1.1502-36(c) would adjust the basis of the transferred share (because there are no investment adjustments) and § 1.1502-36(d) would not reduce S's attributes (because S's aggregate inside loss is $0). However, because P acted with a view to prevent the consolidated return provisions from addressing the duplication of the loss on Asset 2, P's transfer of Asset 2 to S is subject to the anti-abuse rule in this paragraph (h)(2). Accordingly, effective immediately before the transfer of Share 5 to X, either P's basis in Share 5 or S's basis in Asset 2 must be adjusted to reflect what it would have been had section 362(e)(2) been applied at the time P transferred Asset 2 to S (taking into account the interim facts and circumstances). Accordingly, S must either reduce its basis in Asset 2 by $80 to $20 (eliminating the duplicated loss) or P must reduce its basis in Share 5 by $80 to $20 (eliminating the duplicated loss).
(C)
Transfer of all S shares.
Assume the same facts as those in paragraph (A) of this
Example,
except that P sells all five S shares to X. Although P's transfer of Asset 2 to S results in the duplication of an $80 loss, because all the shares are transferred, the transaction does not prevent the consolidated return provisions from properly addressing loss duplication. P's $80 duplicated loss is offset by an $80 duplicated gain, and the group recognizes the offsetting stock gain and loss. Accordingly, this paragraph (h)(2) does not apply to P's transfer of Asset 2 to S.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Special rules for application of section 951(a)(2)(B) to distributions to which section 959(b) applies
—(1)
Single United States shareholder treatment.
In determining the amount described in section 951(a)(2)(B) that is attributable to distributions to which section 959(b) applies, members of a group are treated
as a single United States shareholder (within the meaning of section 951(b) (or section 953(c)(1)(A), if applicable)) for purposes of determining the part of the year during which such shareholder did not own (within the meaning of section 958(a)) the stock described in section 951(a)(2)(A). The purpose of this paragraph (j) is to facilitate the clear reflection of income of a consolidated group by ensuring that the location of ownership of stock of a foreign corporation within the group does not affect the amount of the group's income by reason of sections 951(a)(1)(A) and 951A(a).
(2)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (j)(1) of this section. For purposes of the examples in this paragraph (j)(2): M1 and M2 are members of a consolidated group of which P is the common parent (P group); each of CFC1, CFC2, and CFC3 is a controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 957(a)) with the U.S. dollar as its functional currency (within the meaning of section 985); the taxable year of all entities is the calendar year for Federal income tax purposes; and a reference to stock owned means stock owned within the meaning of section 958(a). These examples do not address common law doctrines or other authorities that might apply to recast a transaction or to otherwise affect the tax treatment of a transaction.
(i)
Example 1: Intercompany transfer of stock of a controlled foreign corporation
—(A)
Facts.
Throughout Year 1, M1 directly owns all the stock of CFC1, which directly owns all the stock of CFC2. In Year 1, CFC2 has $100x of subpart F income (as defined in section 952). M1's pro rata share of CFC2's subpart F income for Year 1 is $100x, which M1 includes in its gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A). In Year 2, CFC2 has $80x of subpart F income and distributes $80x to CFC1 (the CFC2 Distribution). Section 959(b) applies to the entire CFC2 Distribution. On December 29, Year 2, M1 transfers all of its CFC1 stock to M2 in an exchange described in section 351(a). As a result, on December 31, Year 2 (the last day of Year 2 on which CFC2 is a controlled foreign corporation), M2 owns 100% of the stock of CFC1, which owns 100% of the stock of CFC2.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, in determining the amount described in section 951(a)(2)(B) that is attributable to the CFC2 Distribution, all members of the P group are treated as a single United States shareholder for purposes of determining the part of Year 2 during which such shareholder did not own the stock of CFC2. Thus, the ratio of the number of days in Year 2 that such United States shareholder did not own the stock of CFC2 to the total number of days in Year 2 is 0/365. The amount described in section 951(a)(2)(B) is $0, M2's pro rata share of CFC2's subpart F income for Year 2 is $80x ($80x-$0), and M2 must include $80x in its gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A).
(ii)
Example 2: Transfer of stock of a controlled foreign corporation between controlled foreign corporations
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(2)(i)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that M1 does not transfer its CFC1 stock to M2. Additionally, throughout Year 1 and from January 1, Year 2, to December 29, Year 2, M2 directly owns all 90 shares of the only class of stock of CFC3. Further, on December 29, Year 2, CFC3 acquires all the CFC2 stock from CFC1 in exchange for 10 newly issued shares of the same class of CFC3 stock in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(B). As a result, on December 31, Year 2, M1 owns 10% of the stock of CFC2, and M2 owns 90% of the stock of CFC2.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, in determining the amount described in section 951(a)(2)(B) that is attributable to the portion of the CFC2 Distribution with respect to each of the CFC2 stock that M1 owns on December 31, Year 2, and the CFC2 stock that M2 owns on that day, all members of the P group are treated as a single United States shareholder for purposes of determining the part of Year 2 during which such shareholder did not own such stock. In each case, the ratio of the number of days in Year 2 that such United States shareholder did not own such stock to the total number of days in Year 2 is 0/365, and the amount described in section
951(a)(2)(B) is $0. M1's and M2's pro rata shares of CFC2's subpart F income for Year 2 are $8x ($8x−$0) and $72x ($72x−$0), respectively, and M1 and M2 must include $8x and $72x in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A), respectively.
(3)
Applicability date.
This paragraph (j) applies to taxable years for which the original consolidated Federal income tax return is due (without extensions) after February 23, 2023.

§ 1.1502-91
Application of section 382 with respect to a consolidated group.
(a)
Determination and effect of an ownership change
—(1)
In general.
This section and §§ 1.1502-92 and 1.1502-93 set forth the rules for determining an ownership change under section 382 for members of consolidated groups and the section 382 limitations with respect to attributes described in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section. These rules generally provide that an ownership change and the section 382 limitation are determined with respect to these attributes for the group (or loss subgroup) on a single entity basis and not for its members separately. Following an ownership change of a loss group (or a loss subgroup) under § 1.1502-92, the amount of consolidated taxable income for any post-change year which may be offset by pre-change consolidated attributes (or pre-change subgroup attributes) shall not exceed the consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation) for such year as determined under § 1.1502-93.
(2)
Special rule for post-change year that includes the change date.
If the post-change year includes the change date, section 382(b)(3)(A) is applied so that the consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation) does not apply to the portion of consolidated taxable income that is allocable to the period in the year on or before the change date. See generally § 1.382-6 (relating to the allocation of income and loss). The allocation of consolidated taxable income for the post-change year that includes the change date must be made before taking into account any consolidated net operating loss deduction (as defined in § 1.1502-21(a)).
(3)
Cross-reference.
See §§ 1.1502-94 and 1.1502-95 for rules that apply section 382 to a corporation that becomes or ceases to be a member of a group or loss subgroup.
(b)
Definitions and nomenclature.
For purposes of this section and §§ 1.1502-92 through 1.1502-99, unless otherwise stated:
(1) The definitions and nomenclature contained in section 382 and the regulations thereunder (including the nomenclature and assumptions relating to
the examples in § 1.382-2T(b)) and this section and §§ 1.1502-92 through 1.1502-99 apply.
(2) In all examples, all groups file consolidated returns, all corporations file their income tax returns on a calendar year basis, the only 5-percent shareholder of a corporation is a public group, the facts set forth the only owner shifts during the testing period, no election is made under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, and each asset of a corporation has a value equal to its adjusted basis.
(c)
Loss group
—(1)
Defined.
A loss group is a consolidated group that—
(i) Is entitled to use a net operating loss carryover to the taxable year that did not arise (and is not treated under § 1.1502-21(c) as arising) in a SRLY;
(ii) Has a consolidated net operating loss for the taxable year in which a testing date of the common parent occurs (determined by treating the common parent as a loss corporation); or
(iii) Has a net unrealized built-in loss (determined under paragraph (g) of this section by treating the date on which the determination is made as though it were a change date).
(2)
Coordination with rule that ends separate tracking.
A consolidated group may be a loss group because a member's losses that arose in (or are treated as arising in) a SRLY are treated as described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. See § 1.1502-96(a).
(3)
Example.
The following example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (c):

# Example. Loss group.
(i) L and L1 file separate returns and each has a net operating loss carryover arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 2. A owns 40 shares and L owns 60 shares of the 100 outstanding shares of L1 stock. At the close of Year 1, L buys the 40 shares of L1 stock from A. For Year 2, L and L1 file a consolidated return. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:
ER02JY99.000
(ii) L and L1 become a loss group at the beginning of Year 2 because the group is entitled to use the Year 1 net operating loss carryover of L, the common parent, which did not arise (and is not treated under § 1.1502-21(c) as arising) in a SRLY. See § 1.1502-94 for rules relating to the application of section 382 with respect to L1's net operating loss
carryover from Year 1 which did arise in a SRLY.
(d)
Loss subgroup
—(1)
Net operating loss carryovers.
Two or more corporations that become members of a consolidated group (the current group) compose a loss subgroup if—
(i) They were affiliated with each other in another group (the former group), whether or not the group was a consolidated group;
(ii) They bear the relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to each other through a loss subgroup parent immediately after they become members of the current group (or are deemed to bear that relationship as a result of an election described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section); and
(iii) At least one of the members carries over a net operating loss that did not arise (and is not treated under § 1.1502-21(c) as arising) in a SRLY with respect to the former group.
(2)
Net unrealized built-in loss.
Two or more corporations that become members of a consolidated group compose a loss subgroup if they—
(i) Have been continuously affiliated with each other for the 5 consecutive year period ending immediately before they become members of the group;
(ii) Bear the relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to each other through a loss subgroup parent immediately after they become members of the current group (or are deemed to bear that relationship as a result of an election described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section); and
(iii) Have a net unrealized built-in loss (determined under paragraph (g) of this section on the day they become members of the group by treating that day as though it were a change date).
(3)
Loss subgroup parent.
A loss subgroup parent is the corporation that bears the same relationship to the other members of the loss subgroup as a common parent bears to the members of a group.
(4)
Election to treat loss subgroup parent requirement as satisfied
—(i)
In general.
Solely for purposes of paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (2)(ii) of this section, two or more corporations that become members of a consolidated group at the same time and that were affiliated with each other immediately before becoming members of the group are deemed to bear a section 1504(a)(1) relationship to each other immediately after they become members of the group if the common parent of that group makes an election under this paragraph (d)(4) with respect to those members. See § 1.1502-96(e) for the time and manner of making the election.
(ii)
Members included.
An election under this paragraph (d)(4) includes all corporations that become members of the current group at the same time and that were affiliated with each other immediately before they become members of the current group.
(iii)
Each member included treated as loss subgroup parent.
If the members to which this election applies are a loss subgroup described in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, then each member is treated as a loss subgroup parent. See § 1.1502-92(b)(1)(iii) for special rules relating to an ownership change of a loss subgroup if the election under this paragraph (d)(4) is made.
(5)
Principal purpose of avoiding a limitation.
The corporations described in paragraphs (d)(1) or (2) of this section do not compose a loss subgroup if any one of them is formed, acquired, or availed of with a principal purpose of avoiding the application of, or increasing any limitation under, section 382. Instead, § 1.1502-94 applies with respect to the attributes of each such corporation. Any member excluded from a loss subgroup, if excluded with a principal purpose of so avoiding or increasing any section 382 limitation, is treated as included in the loss subgroup. This paragraph (d)(5) does not apply solely because, in connection with becoming members of the group, the members of a group (or loss subgroup) are rearranged (or, in the case of the preceding sentence, are not rearranged) to bear a relationship to the other members described in section 1504(a)(1).
(6)
Special rules.
See § 1.1502-95(d) for rules concerning when a corporation ceases to be a member of a loss subgroup, and for certain exceptions that may apply if a member does not continue to satisfy the loss subgroup parent requirement within the current group. See also § 1.1502-96(a) for a special rule regarding the end of separate tracking of SRLY losses of a member
that has an ownership change or that has been a member of a group for at least 5 consecutive years.
(7)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (d):

# Example 1. Loss subgroup.
(i) P owns all the L stock and L owns all the L1 stock. The P group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried to Year 2. On May 2, Year 2, P sells all the stock of L to A, and L and L1 thereafter file consolidated returns. A portion of the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss is apportioned under § 1.1502-21(b) to each of L and L1, which they carry over to Year 2. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:
ER02JY99.001
(ii) (a) L and L1 compose a loss subgroup within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this section because—
(A) They were affiliated with each other in the P group (the former group);
(B) They bear a relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to each other through a
loss subgroup parent (L) immediately after they became members of the L group; and
(C) At least one of the members (here, both L and L1) carries over a net operating loss to the L group (the current group) that did not arise in a SRLY with respect to the P group.
(b) Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, L is the loss subgroup parent of the L loss subgroup.

# Example 2. Loss subgroup—section 1504(a)(1) relationship.
(i) P owns all the stock of L and L1. L owns all the stock of L2. L1 and L2 own 40 percent and 60 percent of the stock of L3, respectively. The P group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 2. On May 22, Year 2, P sells all the stock of L and L1 to P1, the common parent of another consolidated group. The Year 1 consolidated net operating loss is apportioned under § 1.1502-21(b), and each of L, L1, L2, and L3 carries over a portion of such loss to the first consolidated return year of the P1 group ending after the acquisition. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:
ER02JY99.002
(ii) L and L2 compose a loss subgroup within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Neither L1 nor L3 is included in a loss subgroup because neither bears a relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) through a loss subgroup parent to any other member of the former group immediately after becoming members of the P1 group.

# Example 3. Loss subgroup—section 1504(a)(1) relationship.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2,
except that the stock of L1 is transferred to L in connection with the sale of the L stock to P1. L, L1, L2, and L3 compose a loss subgroup within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this section because—
(i) They were affiliated with each other in the P group (the former group);
(ii) They bear a relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to each other through a loss subgroup parent (L) immediately after they become members of the P1 group; and
(iii) At least one of the members (here, each of L, L1, L2, and L3) carries over a net operating loss to the P1 group (the current group).

# Example 4. Loss subgroup—elective section 1504(a)(1) relationship.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2,
except that P1 makes the election under paragraph (d)(4) of this section. The election includes L, L1, L2, and L3 (even though L and L2 would compose a loss subgroup without regard to the election) because they become members of the current group (the P1 group) at the same time and were affiliated with each other in the P group immediately before they became members of the P1 group. As a result of the election, L, L1, L2, and L3 are treated as satisfying the requirement that they bear the relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to each other through a loss subgroup parent immediately after they become members of the P1 group. L, L1, L2, and L3 compose a loss subgroup within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(e)
Pre-change consolidated attribute
—(1)
Defined.
A pre-change consolidated attribute of a loss group is—
(i) Any loss described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section (relating to the definition of loss group) that is allocable to the period ending on or before the change date; and
(ii) Any recognized built-in loss of the loss group.
(2)
Example
—(i)
Facts.
The L group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 2. The L loss group has an ownership change at the beginning of Year 2.
(ii)
Analysis.
The net operating loss carryover of the L loss group from Year 1 is a pre-change consolidated attribute because the L group was entitled to use the loss in Year 2 and therefore the loss was described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the amount of consolidated taxable income of the L group for Year 2 that may be offset by this loss carryover may not exceed the consolidated section 382 limitation of the L group for that year. See § 1.1502-93 for rules relating to the computation of the consolidated section 382 limitation.
(iii)
Business interest expense.
The facts are the same as in the
Example
in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, except that, rather than a consolidated net operating loss, a member of the L group pays or accrues a business interest expense in Year 1 for which a deduction is disallowed in that year under section 163(j) and § 1.163(j)-2(b). The disallowed business interest expense is carried over to Year 2 under section 163(j)(2) and § 1.163(j)-2(c). Thus, the disallowed business interest expense carryforward is a pre-change loss. Under section 163(j), the L loss group is entitled to deduct the carryforward in Year 2; however, the amount of consolidated taxable income of the L group for Year 2 that may be offset by this carryforward may not exceed the consolidated section 382 limitation of the L group for that year. See § 1.1502-98(b) (providing that §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-96 apply section 382 to business interest expense, with appropriate adjustments).
(f)
Pre-change subgroup attribute
—(1)
Defined.
A pre-change subgroup attribute of a loss subgroup is—
(i) Any net operating loss carryover described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section (relating to the definition of loss subgroup); and
(ii) Any recognized built-in loss of the loss subgroup.
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the principle of this paragraph (f):

# Pre-change subgroup attribute.
(i) P is the common parent of a consolidated group. P owns all the stock of L, and L owns all the stock of L1. L2 is not a member of an affiliated group, and has a net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 2. On December 11, Year 2, L1 acquires all the stock of L2, causing an ownership change of L2. During Year 2, the P group has a consolidated net operating loss that is carried over to Year 3. On November 2, Year 3, M acquires all the L stock from P. M, L, L1, and L2 thereafter file consolidated returns. All of the P group Year 2 consolidated net operating loss is apportioned under § 1.1502-21(b) to L and L2, which they carry over to the M group.
(ii)(a) L, L1, and L2 compose a loss subgroup because—
(1) They were affiliated with each other in the P group (the former group);
(2) They bear a relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to each other through a loss subgroup parent (L) immediately after they became members of the L group; and
(3) At least one of the members (here, both L and L2) carries over a net operating loss to the M group (the current group) that is described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.
(b) For this purpose, L2's loss from Year 1 that was a SRLY loss with respect to the P group (the former group) is described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section because L2 had an ownership change on becoming a member of the P group (see § 1.1502-96(a)) on December 11, Year 2. Starting on December 12, Year 2, the P group no longer separately tracked owner shifts of the stock of L1 with respect to the Year 1 loss. M's acquisition results in an ownership change of L, and therefore the L loss subgroup under § 1.1502-92(a)(2). See § 1.1502-93 for rules governing the computation of the subgroup section 382 limitation.
(iii) In the M group, L2's Year 1 loss continues to be subject to a section 382 limitation resulting from the ownership change that occurred on December 11, Year 2. See § 1.1502-96(c).
(g)
Net unrealized built-in gain and loss
—(1)
In general.
The determination whether a consolidated group (or loss subgroup) has a net unrealized built-in gain or loss under section 382(h)(3) is based on the aggregate amount of the separately computed net unrealized built-in gains or losses of each member that is included in the group (or loss subgroup) under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, including items of built-in income and deduction described in section 382(h)(6). Thus, for example, amounts deferred under section 267, or under § 1.1502-13 (other than amounts deferred with respect to the stock of a member (or an intercompany obligation) included in the group (or loss subgroup) under paragraph (g)(2) of this section) are built-in items. The threshold requirement under section 382(h)(3)(B) applies on an aggregate basis and not on a member-by-member basis. The separately computed amount of a member included in a group or loss subgroup does not include any unrealized built-in gain or loss on stock (including stock described in section 1504(a)(4) and § 1.382-2T(f)(18)(ii) and (iii)) of another member included in the group or loss subgroup (or an intercompany obligation). However, a member of a group or loss subgroup includes in its separately computed amount the unrealized built-in gain or loss on stock (but not on an intercompany obligation) of another member not included in the group or loss subgroup. If a member is not included in the determination whether a group (or subgroup) has a net unrealized built-in loss under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) or (iv) of this section, that member is not included in the loss group or loss subgroup. See § 1.1502-94(c) (relating to built-in gain or loss of a new loss member) and § 1.1502-96(a) (relating to the end of separate tracking of certain losses).
(2)
Members included
—(i)
Consolidated group with a net operating loss.
The members included in the determination whether a consolidated group described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section (relating to loss groups with net operating losses) has a net unrealized built-in gain are all members of the consolidated group on the day that the determination is made.
(ii)
Determination whether a consolidated group has a net unrealized built-in loss.
The members included in the determination whether a consolidated group is a loss group described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section are—
(A) The common parent and all other members that have been affiliated with the common parent for the 5 consecutive year period ending on the day that the determination is made;
(B) Any other member that has a net unrealized built-in loss determined under paragraph (g)(1) of this section on the date that the determination is made, and that is neither a new loss member described in § 1.1502-94(a)(1)(ii) nor a member of a loss subgroup described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section;
(C) Any new loss member described in § 1.1502-94(a)(1)(ii) that has a net unrealized built-in gain determined under paragraph (g)(1) of this section on the day that the determination is made; and
(D) The members of a loss subgroup described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section if the members of the subgroup
have, in the aggregate, a net unrealized built-in gain on the day that the determination is made.
(iii)
Loss subgroup with net operating loss carryovers.
The members included in the determination whether a loss subgroup described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section (relating to loss subgroups with net operating loss carryovers) has a net unrealized built-in gain are all members of the loss subgroup on the day that the determination is made.
(iv)
Determination whether subgroup has a net unrealized built-in loss.
The members included in the determination whether a subgroup has a net unrealized built-in loss are those members described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(v)
Separate determination of section 382 limitation for recognized built-in losses and net operating losses.
In determining whether a loss group described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section (relating to loss groups that have net operating loss carryovers) has a net unrealized built-in gain which, if recognized, increases the consolidated section 382 limitation, the group includes, under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, all of its members on the day the determination is made. Under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, however, for purposes of determining whether a group has a net unrealized built-in loss described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, not all members of the consolidated group may be included. Thus, a consolidated group may have recognized built-in gains that increase the amount of consolidated taxable income that may be offset by its pre-change net operating loss carryovers that did not arise (and are not treated as arising) in a SRLY, and also may have recognized built-in losses the absorption of which is limited. Similar results may obtain for loss subgroups under paragraphs (g)(2)(iii) and (iv) of this section. See § 1.1502-93(c)(2) for rules prohibiting the use of recognized built-in gains to increase the amount of consolidated taxable income that can be offset by recognized built-in losses.
(3)
Coordination with rule that ends separate tracking.
See § 1.1502-96(a) for special rules relating to members (or loss subgroups) that have an ownership change within six months before, on, or after becoming a member of the group.
(4)
Acquisitions of built-in gain or loss assets.
A member of a consolidated group (or loss subgroup) may not, in determining its separately computed net unrealized built-in gain or loss, include any gain or loss with respect to assets acquired with a principal purpose to affect the amount of its net unrealized built-in gain or loss. A group (or loss subgroup) may not, in determining its net unrealized built-in gain or loss, include any gain or loss of a member acquired with a principal purpose to affect the amount of its net unrealized built-in gain or loss.
(5)
Indirect ownership.
A member's separately computed net unrealized built-in gain or loss is adjusted to the extent necessary to prevent any duplication of unrealized gain or loss attributable to the member's indirect ownership interest in another member through a nonmember if the member has a 5-percent or greater ownership interest in the nonmember.
(6)
Common parent not common parent for five years.
If the common parent has become the common parent of an existing group within the previous 5 year period in a transaction described in § 1.1502-75(d)(2)(ii) or (3), appropriate adjustments must be made in applying paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section so that corporations that have not been members of the group for five years are not included. In such a case, references to the common parent in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section are to the former common parent. Thus, members of the group remaining in existence (including the new common parent) that have not been affiliated with the former common parent (or that have not been members of that group) for the five consecutive year period ending on the day that the determination is made are not included under paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. See, however, § 1.1502-96(a)(2) for special rules relating to members (or loss subgroups) that have an ownership change within six months before, on, or after the time that the member becomes a member of the group.
(h)
Recognized built-in gain or loss
—(1)
In general.
[Reserved]
(2)
Disposition of stock or an intercompany obligation of a member.
Gain or loss recognized by a member on the disposition of stock (including stock described in section 1504(a)(4) and § 1.382-2T(f)(18)(ii) and (iii)) of another member is treated as a recognized gain or loss for purposes of section 382(h)(2) (unless disallowed) even though gain or loss on such stock was not included in the determination of a net unrealized built-in gain or loss under paragraph (g)(1) of this section. Gain or loss recognized by a member with respect to an intercompany obligation is treated as recognized gain or loss only to the extent (if any) the transaction gives rise to aggregate income or loss within the consolidated group. The first sentence of this paragraph (h)(2) is applicable on or after September 17, 2008.
(3)
Intercompany transactions.
Gain or loss that is deferred under provisions such as section 267 and § 1.1502-13 is treated as recognized built-in gain or loss only to the extent taken into account by the group during the recognition period. See also § 1.1502-13(c)(7)
Example 10.
(4)
Exchanged basis property.
If the adjusted basis of any asset is determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the adjusted basis of another asset held by the member at the beginning of the recognition period, the asset is treated, with appropriate adjustments, as held by the member at the beginning of the recognition period.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Predecessor and successor corporations.
A reference in this section and §§ 1.1502-92 through 1.1502-99 to a corporation, member, common parent, loss subgroup parent, or subsidiary includes, as the context may require, a reference to a predecessor or successor corporation as defined in § 1.1502-1(f)(4). For example, the determination whether a successor satisfies the continuous affiliation requirement of paragraph (d)(2)(i) or (g)(2)(ii) of this section is made by reference to its predecessor.
[T.D. 8824, 64 FR 36129, July 2, 1999, as amended by T.D. 9048, 68 FR 12291, Mar. 14, 2003; T.D. 9187, 70 FR 10326, Mar. 3, 2005; T.D. 9254, 71 FR 13018, Mar. 14, 2006; T.D. 9424, 73 FR 53984, Sept. 17, 2008; T.D. 9905, 85 FR 56844, Sept. 14, 2020; T.D. 10018, 89 FR 106877, Dec. 30, 2024]
§ 1.1502-92
Ownership change of a loss group or a loss subgroup.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides rules for determining if there is an ownership change for purposes of section 382 with respect to a loss group or a loss subgroup. See § 1.1502-94 for special rules for determining if there is an ownership change with respect to a new loss member and § 1.1502-96(b) for special rules for determining if there is an ownership change of a subsidiary.
(b)
Determination of an ownership change
—(1)
Parent change method
—(i)
Loss group.
A loss group has an ownership change if the loss group's common parent has an ownership change under section 382 and the regulations thereunder. Solely for purposes of determining whether the common parent has an ownership change—
(A) The losses described in § 1.1502-91(c) are treated as net operating losses (or a net unrealized built-in loss) of the common parent; and
(B) The common parent determines the earliest day that its testing period can begin by reference to only the attributes that make the group a loss group under § 1.1502-91(c).
(ii)
Loss subgroup.
A loss subgroup has an ownership change if the loss subgroup parent has an ownership change under section 382 and the regulations thereunder. The principles of § 1.1502-95(b) (relating to ceasing to be a member of a consolidated group) apply in determining whether the loss subgroup parent has an ownership change. Solely for purposes of determining whether the loss subgroup parent has an ownership change—
(A) The losses described in § 1.1502-91(d) are treated as net operating losses (or a net unrealized built-in loss) of the loss subgroup parent;
(B) The day that the members of the loss subgroup become members of the group (or a loss subgroup) is treated as
a testing date within the meaning of § 1.382-2(a)(4); and
(C) The loss subgroup parent determines the earliest day that its testing period can begin under § 1.382-2T(d)(3) by reference to only the attributes that make the members a loss subgroup under § 1.1502-91(d).
(iii)
Special rule if election regarding section 1504(a)(1) relationship is made
—(A)
Ownership change of deemed loss subgroup parent is an ownership change of loss subgroup.
If the common parent makes an election under § 1.1502-91(d)(4), each of the members in the loss subgroup is treated as the loss subgroup parent for purposes of determining whether the loss subgroup has an ownership change under section 382 and the regulations thereunder on or after the day the members become members of the group.
(B)
Exception.
Paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section does not apply to cause an ownership change of a loss subgroup if a deemed loss subgroup parent has an ownership change upon (or after) ceasing to be a member of the current group.
(2)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (b):

# Example 1. Loss group—ownership change of the common parent.
(i) A owns all the L stock. L owns 80 percent and B owns 20 percent of the L1 stock. For Year 1, the L group has a consolidated net operating loss that resulted from the operations of L1 and that is carried over to Year 2. The value of the L stock is $1000. The total value of the L1 stock is $600 and the value of the L1 stock held by B is $120. The L group is a loss group under § 1.1502-91(c)(1) because it is entitled to use its net operating loss carryover from Year 1. On August 15, Year 2, A sells 51 percent of the L stock to C. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:
ER02JY99.003
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, section 382 and the regulations thereunder are applied to L to determine whether it (and therefore the L loss group) has an ownership change with respect to its net operating loss carryover from Year 1 attributable to L1 on August 15, Year 2. The sale of the L stock to C causes an ownership change of L under § 1.382-2T and of the L loss group under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. The amount of consolidated taxable income of the L loss group for any post-change taxable year that may be offset by its pre-change consolidated attributes (that is, the net operating loss carryover from Year 1 attributable to L1) may not exceed the consolidated section 382 limitation for the L loss group for the taxable year.

# Example 2. Loss group—owner shifts of subsidiaries disregarded.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that on August 15, Year 2, A sells only 49 percent of the L stock to C and, on December 12, Year 3, in an unrelated transaction, B sells the 20 percent of the L1 stock to D. A's sale of the L stock to C does not cause an ownership change of L under § 1.382-2T nor of the L loss group under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:
ER02JY99.004
(ii) B's subsequent sale of L1 stock is not taken into account for purposes of determining whether the L loss group has an ownership change under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, and, accordingly, there is no ownership change of the L loss group. See paragraph (c) of this section, however, for a supplemental ownership change method that would apply to cause an ownership change if the purchases by C and D were pursuant to a plan or arrangement and certain other conditions are satisfied.

# Example 3. Loss subgroup—ownership change of loss subgroup parent controls.
(i) P owns all the L stock. L owns 80 percent and A owns 20 percent of the L1 stock. The P group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 2. On September 9, Year 2, P sells 51 percent of the L stock to B, and L1 is apportioned a portion of the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss under § 1.1502-21(b), which it carries over to its next taxable year. L and L1 file a consolidated return for their first taxable year ending after the sale to B. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:
ER02JY99.005
(ii) Under § 1.1502-91(d)(1), L and L1 compose a loss subgroup on September 9, Year 2, the day that they become members of the L group. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, section 382 and the regulations thereunder are applied to L to determine whether it (and therefore the L loss subgroup) has an ownership change with respect to the portion
of the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss that is apportioned to L1 on September 9, Year 2. L has an ownership change resulting from P's sale of 51 percent of the L stock to A. Therefore, the L loss subgroup has an ownership change with respect to that loss.

# Example 4. Loss group and loss subgroup—contemporaneous ownership changes.
(i) A owns all the stock of corporation M, M owns 35 percent and B owns 65 percent of the L stock, and L owns all the L1 stock. The L group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 2. On May 19, Year 2, B sells 45 percent of the L stock to M for cash. M, L, and L1 thereafter file consolidated returns. L and L1 are each apportioned a portion of the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss, which they carry over to the M group's Year 2 and Year 3 consolidated return years. The M group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 2 that is carried over to Year 3. On June 9, Year 3, A sells 70 percent of the M stock to C. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:
ER02JY99.006
(ii) Under § 1.1502-91(d)(1), L and L1 compose a loss subgroup on May 19, Year 2, the day they become members of the M group. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, section 382 and the regulations thereunder are applied to L to determine whether L (and therefore the L loss subgroup) has an ownership change with respect to the loss
carryovers from Year 1 on May 19, Year 2, a testing date because of B's sale of L stock to M. The sale of L stock to M results in only a 45 percentage point increase in A's ownership of L stock. Thus, there is no ownership change of L (or the L loss subgroup) with respect to those loss carryovers under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section on that day.
(iii) June 9, Year 3, is also a testing date with respect to the L loss subgroup because of A's sale of M stock to C. The sale results in a 56 percentage point increase in C's ownership of L stock, and L has an ownership change. Therefore, the L loss subgroup has an ownership change on that day with respect to the loss carryovers from Year 1.
(iv) Paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section requires that section 382 and the regulations thereunder be applied to M to determine whether M (and therefore the M loss group) has an ownership change with respect to the net operating loss carryover from Year 2 on June 9, Year 3, a testing date because of A's sale of M stock to C. The sale results in a 70 percentage point increase in C's ownership of M stock, and M has an ownership change. Therefore, the M loss group has an ownership change on that day with respect to that loss carryover.

# Example 5. Deemed subgroup parent.
(i) P owns all the stock of L and L1 and 80 percent of the stock of T. A owns the remaining 20 percent of the stock of T. L1 owns all the stock of L2. P1, which owns 60 percent of the stock of P, acquires, at the beginning of Year 2, the T, L, and L1 stock owned by P, and T, L, L1, and L2 become members of the P1 group. The P group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 2. L, L1, and L2 are each apportioned a portion of the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss under § 1.1502-21(b), which they carry over to the P1 group's Year 2 and Year 3 consolidated return years. P1 makes the election described in § 1.1502-91(d)(4) to treat T, L, L1 and L2 as meeting the section 1504(a)(1) requirement of § 1.1502-91(d)(1)(ii). As a result of the election, T, L, L1 and L2 compose a loss subgroup and T, L, L1, and L2 are each treated as the loss subgroup parent for purposes of this paragraph (b). Because of P1's indirect ownership of T, L, L1, and L2 prior to P1's acquisition of the T, L, and L1 stock, P1's acquisition does not cause an ownership change of the loss subgroup.
(ii) On February 2, Year 3, L1 sells all of the stock of L2 to B. Although L2 is treated as a loss subgroup parent, the determination whether the loss subgroup comprised of T, L, and L1 has an ownership change under this paragraph (b) is made without regard to the sale of L2 because L2's ownership change occurred upon ceasing to be a member of the P1 group. See § 1.1502-95(b) to determine the application of section 382 to L2 when L2 ceases to be a member of the P1 group and the T, L, L1 and L2 loss subgroup.
(iii) On March 26, Year 3, A sells her 20 percent minority stock interest in T to C . C's purchase, together with the 32 percentage point owner shift effected by P1's acquisition of the T stock at the beginning of Year 2, causes an ownership change of T, and therefore of the loss subgroup comprised of T, L, and L1.
(3)
Special adjustments
—(i)
Common parent succeeded by a new common parent.
For purposes of determining if a loss group has an ownership change, if the common parent of a loss group is succeeded or acquired by a new common parent and the loss group remains in existence, the new common parent is treated as a continuation of the former common parent with appropriate adjustments to take into account shifts in ownership of the former common parent during the testing period (including shifts that occur incident to the common parent's becoming the former common parent). A new common parent may be a continuation of the former common parent even if, under § 1.1502-91(g)(2)(ii), the new common parent is not included in determining whether the group has a net unrealized built-in loss.
(ii)
Newly created loss subgroup parent.
For purposes of determining if a loss subgroup has an ownership change, if the member that is the loss subgroup parent has not been the loss subgroup parent for at least 3 years as of a testing date, appropriate adjustments must be made to take into account owner shifts of members of the loss subgroup so that the structure of the loss subgroup does not have the effect of avoiding an ownership change under section 382. (See paragraph (b)(3)(iii),
Example 3
of this section.)
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (b)(3):
(A)
Example 1.
—
New common parent acquires old common parent.
(
1
) A, who owns all the L stock, sells 30 percent of the L stock to B on August 26, Year 1. L owns all the L1 stock. The L group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 3. On July 16, Year 2, A and B transfer their L stock to a newly created holding company, HC, in exchange
for 70 percent and 30 percent, respectively, of the HC stock. HC, L, and L1 thereafter file consolidated returns. Under the principles of § 1.1502-75(d), the L loss group is treated as remaining in existence, with HC taking the place of L as the new common parent of the loss group. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:
ER02JY99.007
(
2
) On November 11, Year 3, A sells 25 percent of the HC stock to B. For purposes of determining if the L loss group has an ownership change under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section on November 11, Year 3, HC is treated as a continuation of L under paragraph
(b)(4)(i) of this section because it acquired L and became the common parent without terminating the L loss group. Accordingly, HC's testing period commences on January 1, Year 1, the first day of the taxable year of the L loss group in which the consolidated net operating loss that is carried over to Year 3 arose (see § 1.382-2T(d)(3)(i)). Immediately after the close of November 11, Year 3, B's percentage ownership interest in the common parent of the loss group (HC) has increased by 55 percentage points over its lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (zero percent). Accordingly, HC and the L loss group have an ownership change on that day.
(B)
Example 2.
—
New common parent in case in which common parent ceases to exist.
(
1
) A, B, and C each own one-third of the L stock. L owns all the L1 stock. The L group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 2 that is carried over to Year 3. On November 22, Year 3, L is merged into P, a corporation owned by D, and L1 thereafter files consolidated returns with P. A, B, and C, as a result of owning stock of L, own 90 percent of P's stock after the merger. D owns the remaining 10 percent of P's stock. The merger of L into P qualifies as a reverse acquisition of the L group under § 1.1502-75(d)(3)(i), and the L loss group is treated as remaining in existence, with P taking the place of L as the new common parent of the L group. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:
ER02JY99.008
(
2
) For purposes of determining if the L loss group has an ownership change on November 22, Year 3, the day of the merger, P is treated as a continuation of L so that the testing period for P begins on January 1, Year 2, the first day of the taxable year of the L loss group
in which the consolidated net operating loss that is carried over to Year 3 arose. Immediately after the close of November 22, Year 3, D is the only 5-percent shareholder that has increased its ownership interest in P during the testing period (from zero to 10 percentage points).
(
3
) The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section (
Example 2
), except that A has held 23
1/3
shares (23
1/3
percent) of L's stock for five years, and A purchased an additional 10 shares of L stock from E two years before the merger. Immediately after the close of the day of the merger (a testing date), A's ownership interest in P, the common parent of the L loss group, has increased by 6
2/3
percentage points over A's lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (23
1/3
percent to 30 percent).
(
4
) The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section (

), except that P has a net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried to the first consolidated return year ending after the day of the merger. Solely for purposes of determining whether the L loss group has an ownership change under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the testing period for P commences on January 1, Year 2. P does not determine the earliest day for its testing period by reference to its net operating loss carryover from Year 1, which §§ 1.1502-1(f)(3) and 1.1502-75(d)(3)(i) treat as arising in a SRLY.
See
§ 1.1502-94 to determine the application of section 382 with respect to P's net operating loss carryover.

Example 3.
—
Newly acquired loss subgroup parent.
(

) P owns all the L stock and L owns all the L1 stock. The P group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 3. On January 19, Year 2, L issues a 20 percent stock interest to B. On February 5, Year 3, P contributes its L stock to a newly formed subsidiary, HC, in exchange for all the HC stock, and distributes the HC stock to its sole shareholder A. HC, L, and L1 thereafter file consolidated returns. A portion of the P group's Year 1 consolidated net operating loss is apportioned to L and L1 under § 1.1502-21(b) and is carried over to the HC group's year ending after February 5, Year 3. HC, L, and L1 compose a loss subgroup within the meaning of § 1.1502-91(d) with respect to the net operating loss carryovers from Year 1. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:
ER02JY99.009
(

) February 5, Year 3, is a testing date for HC as the loss subgroup parent with respect to the net operating loss carryovers of L and L1 from Year 1. See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. For purposes of determining whether HC has an ownership change on the testing date, appropriate adjustments
must be made with respect to the changes in the percentage ownership of the stock of HC because HC was not the loss subgroup parent for at least 3 years prior to the day on which it became a member of the HC loss subgroup (a testing date). The appropriate adjustments include adjustments so that HC succeeds to the owner shifts of other members of the former group. Thus, HC succeeds to the owner shift of L that resulted from the sale of the 20 percent interest to B in determining whether the HC loss subgroup has an ownership change on February 5, Year 3, and on any subsequent testing date that includes January 19, Year 2.
(4)
End of separate tracking of certain losses.
If § 1.1502-96(a) (relating to the end of separate tracking of attributes) applies to a loss subgroup, then, while one or more members that were included in the loss subgroup remain members of the consolidated group, there is an ownership change with respect to their attributes described in § 1.1502-96(a)(2) only if the consolidated group is a loss group and has an ownership change under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section (or such a member has an ownership change under § 1.1502-96(b) (relating to ownership changes of subsidiaries)). If, however, the loss subgroup has had an ownership change before § 1.1502-96(a) applies, see § 1.1502-96(c) for the continuing application of the subgroup's section 382 limitation with respect to its pre-change subgroup attributes.
(c)
Supplemental rules for determining ownership change
—
(1)
Scope.
This paragraph (c) contains a supplemental rule for determining whether there is an ownership change of a loss group (or loss subgroup). It applies in addition to, and not instead of, the rules of paragraph (b) of this section. Thus, for example, if the common parent of the loss group has an ownership change under paragraph (b) of this section, the loss group has an ownership change even if, by applying this paragraph (c), the common parent would not have an ownership change. This paragraph (c) does not apply in determining an ownership change of a loss subgroup for which an election under § 1.1502-91(d)(4) is made.
(2)
Cause for applying supplemental rule.
This paragraph (c) applies to a loss group (or loss subgroup) if—
(i) Any 5-percent shareholder of the common parent (or loss subgroup parent) increases its percentage ownership interest in the stock of both—
(A) A subsidiary of the loss group (or loss subgroup) other than by a direct or indirect acquisition of stock of the common parent (or loss subgroup parent); and
(B) The common parent (or loss subgroup parent);
(ii) Those increases occur within a 3 year period ending on any day of a consolidated return year or, if shorter, the period beginning on the first day following the most recent ownership change of the loss group (or loss subgroup); and
(iii) Either—
(A) The common parent (or loss subgroup parent) has actual knowledge of the increase in the 5-percent shareholder's ownership interest in the stock of the subsidiary (or has actual knowledge of the plan or arrangement described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section) before the date that the group's income tax return is filed for the taxable year that includes the date of that increase; or
(B) At any time during the period described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the 5-percent shareholder of the common parent is also a 5-percent shareholder of the subsidiary (determined without regard to paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section) whose percentage increase in the ownership of the stock of the subsidiary would be taken into account in determining if the subsidiary has an ownership change (determined as if the subsidiary was a loss corporation and applying the principles of § 1.382-2T(k), including the principles relating to duty to inquire).
(3)
Operating rules.
Solely for purposes of this paragraph (c)—
(i) A 5-percent shareholder of the common parent (or loss subgroup parent) is treated as increasing its ownership interest in the stock of a subsidiary to the extent, if any, that another person or persons increases its percentage ownership interest in the stock of a subsidiary pursuant to a plan or arrangement under which the 5-
percent shareholder increases its percentage ownership interest in the common parent (or loss subgroup parent);
(ii) The rules in section 382(l)(3) and §§ 1.382-2T(h) and 1.382-4(d) (relating to constructive ownership) apply with respect to the stock of the subsidiary by treating such stock as stock of a loss corporation; and
(iii) In the case of a loss subgroup, a subsidiary includes any member of the loss subgroup other than the loss subgroup parent. (A loss subgroup parent is, however, a subsidiary of the loss group of which it is a member.)
(4)
Supplemental ownership change rules.
The determination whether the common parent (or loss subgroup parent) has an ownership change is made by applying paragraph (b)(1) of this section as modified by the following additional rules:
(i)
Additional testing dates for the common parent (or loss subgroup parent).
A testing date for the common parent (or loss subgroup parent) also includes—
(A) Each day on which there is an increase in the percentage ownership of stock of a subsidiary as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and
(B) The first day of the first consolidated return year for which the group is a loss group (or the members compose a loss subgroup).
(ii)
Treatment of subsidiary stock as stock of the common parent (or loss subgroup parent).
The common parent (or loss subgroup parent) is treated as though it had issued to the person acquiring (or deemed to acquire) the subsidiary stock an amount of its own stock (by value) that equals the value of the subsidiary stock represented by the percentage increase in that person's ownership of the subsidiary (determined on a separate entity basis). Similar principles apply if the increase in percentage ownership interest is effected by a redemption or similar transaction.
(iii)
Different testing periods.
Stock treated as issued under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section on a testing date is not treated as so issued for purposes of applying the ownership change rules of this paragraph (c) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section in a testing period that does not include that testing date.
(iv)
Disaffiliation of a subsidiary.
If a deemed issuance of stock under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section would not cause the loss group (or loss subgroup) to have an ownership change before the day (if any) on which the subsidiary ceases to be a member of the loss group (or subgroup), then paragraph (c)(4) of this section shall not apply.
(v)
Subsidiary stock acquired first.
If an increase of subsidiary stock described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section occurs before the date that the 5-percent shareholder increases its percentage ownership interest in the stock of the common parent (or loss subgroup parent), then the deemed issuance of stock is treated as occurring on that later date, but in an amount equal to the value of the subsidiary stock on the date it was acquired.
(vi)
Anti-duplication rule.
If two or more 5-percent shareholders are treated as increasing their percentage ownership interests pursuant to the same plan or arrangement described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, appropriate adjustments must be made so that the amount of stock treated as issued is not taken into account more than once.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (c):

# Example 1. Stock of the common parent under supplemental rules.
(i) A owns all the L stock. L is not a member of an affiliated group and has a net operating loss carryover arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 6. On September 20, Year 6, L transfers all of its assets and liabilities to a newly created subsidiary, S, in exchange for S stock. L and S thereafter file consolidated returns. On November 23, Year 6, B contributes cash to L in exchange for a 45 percent ownership interest in L and contributes cash to S for a 20 percent ownership interest in S.
(ii) During the 3 year period ending on November 23, Year 6, B is a 5% shareholder of L and of S that increases its ownership interest in L and S during that period. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the determination whether L (the common parent of a loss group) has an ownership change on November 23, Year 6 (or, subject to paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, on any testing date in the testing period which includes November 23, Year 6), is made by applying paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and by treating the value of B's 20 percent ownership interest in S as if it were L stock issued to B. Because B is a 5% shareholder of both L and S
during the 3 year period ending on November 23, Year 6, and B's increase in its percentage ownership in the stock of S would be taken into account in determining if S (if it were a loss corporation) had an ownership change, it is not relevant whether L has actual knowledge of B's acquisition of S stock.

# Example 2. Plan or arrangement—public offering of subsidiary stock.
(i) A owns all the stock of L and L owns all the stock of L1. The L group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that resulted from the operations of L1 and that is carried over to Year 2. On October 7, Year 2, A sells 49 percent of the L stock to B. As part of a plan that includes the sale of L stock, A causes a public offering of L1 stock on November 6, Year 2. L has actual knowledge of the plan. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:
ER02JY99.010
(ii) A's sale of the L stock to B does not cause an ownership change of the L loss group on October 7, Year 2, under the rules of § 1.382-2T and paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
(iii) Because the issuance of L1 stock to the public occurs as part of the same plan as
B's acquisition of L stock, and L has knowledge of the plan, paragraph (c)(4) of this section applies to determine whether the L loss group has an ownership change on November 6, Year 2 (or, subject to paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, on any testing date for which the testing period includes November 6, Year 2).
(d)
Testing period following ownership change under this section.
If a loss group (or a loss subgroup) has had an ownership change under this section, the testing period for determining a subsequent ownership change with respect to pre-change consolidated attributes (or pre-change subgroup attributes) begins no earlier than the first day following the loss group's (or loss subgroup's) most recent change date.
(e)
Information statements
—(1)
Common parent of a loss group.
The common parent of a loss group must file the information statement required by § 1.382-11(a) for a consolidated return year because of any owner shift, equity structure shift, or other transaction described in § 1.382-2T(a)(2)(i)—
(i) With respect to the common parent and with respect to any subsidiary stock subject to paragraph (c) of this section; and
(ii) With respect to an ownership change described in § 1.1502-96(b) (relating to ownership changes of subsidiaries).
(2)
Abbreviated statement with respect to loss subgroups.
The common parent of a consolidated group that has a loss subgroup during a consolidated return year must file the information statement required by § 1.382-11(a) because of any owner shift, equity structure shift, or other transaction described in § 1.382-2T(a)(2)(i) with respect to the loss subgroup parent and with respect to any subsidiary stock subject to paragraph (c) of this section. Instead of filing a separate statement for each loss subgroup parent, the common parent (which is treated as a loss corporation) may file the single statement described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. In addition to the information concerning stock ownership of the common parent, the single statement must identify each loss subgroup parent and state which loss subgroups, if any, have had ownership changes during the consolidated return year. The loss subgroup parent is, however, still required to maintain the records necessary to determine if the loss subgroup has an ownership change. This paragraph (e)(2) applies with respect to the attributes of a loss subgroup until, under § 1.1502-96(a), the attributes are no longer treated as described in § 1.1502-91(d) (relating to the definition of loss subgroup). After that time, the information statement described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section must be filed with respect to those attributes.
[T.D. 8824, 64 FR 36137, July 2, 1999, as amended by T.D. 9264, 71 FR 30608, May 30, 2006; T.D. 9329, 72 FR 32807, June 14, 2007; T.D. 10018, 89 FR 106877, Dec. 30, 2024]
§ 1.1502-93
Consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation).
(a)
Determination of the consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation)
—(1)
In general.
Following an ownership change, the consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation) for any post-change year is an amount equal to the value of the loss group (or loss subgroup), as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate that applies with respect to the ownership change, and adjusted as required by section 382 and the regulations thereunder. See, for example, section 382(b)(2) (relating to the carryforward of unused section 382 limitation), section 382(b)(3)(B) (relating to the section 382 limitation for the post-change year that includes the change date), section 382(h) (relating to recognized built-in gains and section 338 gains), and section 382(m)(2) (relating to short taxable years). For special rules relating to the recognized built-in gains of a loss group (or loss subgroup), see paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(2)
Coordination with apportionment rule.
For special rules relating to apportionment of a consolidated section 382 limitation (or a subgroup section 382 limitation) or net unrealized built-in gain when one or more corporations cease to be members of a loss group (or a loss subgroup) and to aggregation of amounts so apportioned, see § 1.1502-95(c).
(b)
Value of the loss group (or loss subgroup)
—(1)
Stock value immediately before ownership change.
Subject to any
adjustment under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the value of the loss group (or loss subgroup) is the value, immediately before the ownership change, of the stock of each member, other than stock that is owned directly or indirectly by another member. For this purpose—
(i) Ownership is determined under § 1.382-2T;
(ii) A member is considered to indirectly own stock of another member through a nonmember only if the member has a 5-percent or greater ownership interest in the nonmember; and
(iii) Stock includes stock described in section 1504(a)(4) and § 1.382-2T(f)(18)(ii) and (iii).
(2)
Adjustment to value
—(i)
In general.
The value of the loss group (or loss subgroup), as determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, is adjusted under any rule in section 382 or the regulations thereunder requiring an adjustment to such value for purposes of computing the amount of the section 382 limitation. See, for example, section 382(e)(2) (redemptions and corporate contractions), section 382(l)(1) (certain capital contributions) and section 382(l)(4) (ownership of substantial nonbusiness assets). For purposes of section 382(e)(2), redemptions and corporate contractions that do not effect a transfer of value outside of the loss group (or loss subgroup) are disregarded. For purposes of section 382(l)(1), capital contributions between members of the loss group (or loss subgroup) (or a contribution of stock to a member made solely to satisfy the loss subgroup parent requirement of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) or (2)(ii) of this section), are not taken into account. Also, the substantial nonbusiness asset test of section 382(l)(4) is applied on a group (or subgroup) basis, and is not applied separately to its members.
(ii)
Anti-duplication.
Appropriate adjustments must be made to the extent necessary to prevent any duplication of the value of the stock of a member, even though corporations that do not file consolidated returns may not be required to make such an adjustment. In making these adjustments, the group (or loss subgroup) may apply the principles of § 1.382-8 (relating to controlled groups of corporations) in determining the value of a loss group (or loss subgroup) even if that section would not apply if separate returns were filed. Also, the principles of § 1.382-5(d) (relating to successive ownership changes and absorption of a section 382 limitation) may apply to adjust the consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation) of a loss group (or loss subgroup) to avoid a duplication of value if there are simultaneous (rather than successive) ownership changes.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (b):

# Example 1. Basic case.
(i) L, L1, and L2 compose a loss group. L has outstanding common stock, the value of which is $100. L1 has outstanding common stock and preferred stock that is described in section 1504(a)(4). L owns 90 percent of the L1 common stock, and A owns the remaining 10 percent of the L1 common stock plus all the preferred stock. The value of the L1 common stock is $40, and the value of the L1 preferred stock is $30. L2 has outstanding common stock, 50 percent of which is owned by L and 50 percent by L1. The L group has an ownership change. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:
ER02JY99.011
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the L group does not include the value of the stock of any member that is owned directly or indirectly by another member in computing its consolidated section 382 limitation. Accordingly, the value of the stock of the loss group is $134, the sum of the value of—
(a) The common stock of L ($100);
(b) The 10 percent of the L1 common stock ($4) owned by A; and
(c) The L1 preferred stock ($30) owned by A.

# Example 2. Indirect ownership.
(i) L and L1 compose a consolidated group. L's stock has a value of $100. L owns 80 shares (worth $80) and corporation M owns 20 shares (worth $20) of the L1 stock. L also owns 79 percent of the stock of corporation M. The L group has an ownership change. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:
ER02JY99.012
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, because of L's more than 5 percent ownership interest in M, a nonmember, L is considered to indirectly own 15.8 shares of the L1 stock held by M (79% × 20 shares). The value of the L loss group is $104.20, the sum of the values of—
(a) The L stock ($100); and
(b) The L1 stock not owned directly or indirectly by L (21% × $20, or $4.20).
(c)
Recognized built-in gain of a loss group or loss subgroup
—(1)
In general.
If a loss group (or loss subgroup) has a net unrealized built-in gain, any recognized built-in gain of the loss group (or loss subgroup) is taken into account under section 382(h) in determining the consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation).
(2)
Adjustments.
Appropriate adjustments must be made so that any recognized built-in gain of a member that increases more than one section 382 limitation (whether consolidated, subgroup, or separate) does not effect a duplication in the amount of consolidated taxable income that can be offset by pre-change net operating losses. For example, a consolidated section 382 limitation that is increased by recognized built-in gains is reduced to the extent that pre-change net operating losses of a loss subgroup absorb additional consolidated taxable income because the same recognized built-in gains caused an increase in that loss subgroup's section 382 limitation. In addition, recognized built-in gain may not increase the amount of consolidated taxable income that can be offset by recognized built-in losses.
(d)
Continuity of business
—(1)
In general.
A loss group (or a loss subgroup) is treated as a single entity for purposes of determining whether it satisfies the continuity of business enterprise requirement of section 382(c)(1).
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the principle of this paragraph (d):

# Example. Continuity of business enterprise.
L owns all the stock of two subsidiaries, L1 and L2. The L group has an ownership change. It has pre-change consolidated attributes attributable to L2. Each of the members has historically conducted a separate line of business. Each line of business is approximately equal in value. One year after the ownership change, L discontinues its separate business and the business of L2. The separate business of L1 is continued for the remainder of the 2 year period following the ownership change. The continuity of business enterprise requirement of section 382(c)(1) is met even though the separate businesses of L and L2 are discontinued.
(e)
Limitations of losses under other rules.
If a section 382 limitation for a
post-change year exceeds the consolidated taxable income that may be offset by pre-change attributes for any reason, including the application of the limitation of § 1.1502-21(c), the amount of the excess is carried forward under section 382(b)(2) (relating to the carryforward of unused section 382 limitation).
[T.D. 8824, 64 FR 36153, July 2, 1999]
§ 1.1502-94
Coordination with section 382 and the regulations thereunder when a corporation becomes a member of a consolidated group.
(a)
Scope
—(1)
In general.
This section applies section 382 and the regulations thereunder to a corporation that is a new loss member of a consolidated group. A corporation is a new loss member if it—
(i) Carries over a net operating loss that arose (or is treated under § 1.1502-21(c) as arising) in a SRLY with respect to the current group, and that is not described in § 1.1502-91(d)(1); or
(ii) Has a net unrealized built-in loss (determined under paragraph (c) of this section immediately before it becomes a member of the current group by treating that day as a change date) that is not taken into account under § 1.1502-91(d)(2) in determining whether two or more corporations compose a loss subgroup.
(2)
Successor corporation as new loss member.
A new loss member also includes any successor to a corporation that has a net operating loss carryover arising in a SRLY and that is treated as remaining in existence under § 1.382-2(a)(1)(ii) following a transaction described in section 381(a).
(3)
Coordination in the case of a loss subgroup.
For rules regarding the determination of whether there is an ownership change of a loss subgroup with respect to a net operating loss or a net unrealized built-in loss described in § 1.1502-91(d) (relating to the definition of loss subgroup) and the computation of a subgroup section 382 limitation following such an ownership change, see §§ 1.1502-92 and 1.1502-93.
(4)
End of separate tracking of certain losses.
If § 1.1502-96(a) (relating to the end of separate tracking of attributes) applies to a new loss member, then, while that member remains a member of the consolidated group, there is an ownership change with respect to its attributes described in § 1.1502-96(a)(2) only if the consolidated group is a loss group and has an ownership change under § 1.1502-92(b)(1)(i) (or that member has an ownership change under § 1.1502-96(b) (relating to ownership changes of subsidiaries)). If, however, the new loss member has had an ownership change before § 1.1502-96(a) applies, see § 1.1502-96(c) for the continuing application of the section 382 limitation with respect to the member's pre-change losses.
(5)
Cross-reference.
See section 382(a) and § 1.1502-96(c) for the continuing effect of an ownership change after a corporation becomes or ceases to be a member.
(b)
Application of section 382 to a new loss member
—(1)
In general.
Section 382 and the regulations thereunder apply to a new loss member to determine, on a separate entity basis, whether and to what extent a section 382 limitation applies to limit the amount of consolidated taxable income that may be offset by the new loss member's pre-change separate attributes. For example, if an ownership change with respect to the new loss member occurs under section 382 and the regulations thereunder, the amount of consolidated taxable income for any post-change year that may be offset by the new loss member's pre-change separate attributes shall not exceed the section 382 limitation as determined separately under section 382(b) with respect to that member for such year. If the post-change year includes the change date, section 382(b)(3)(A) is applied so that the section 382 limitation of the new loss member does not apply to the portion of the taxable income for such year that is allocable to the period in such year on or before the change date. See generally § 1.382-6 (relating to the allocation of income and loss).
(2)
Adjustment to value.
Appropriate adjustments must be made to the extent necessary to prevent any duplication of the value of the stock of a member, even though corporations that do not file consolidated returns may not be required to make such an adjustment. For example, the principles of
§ 1.1502-93(b)(2)(ii) (relating to adjustments to value) apply in determining the value of a new loss member.
(3)
Pre-change separate attribute defined.
A pre-change separate attribute of a new loss member is—
(i) Any net operating loss carryover of the new loss member described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and
(ii) Any recognized built-in loss of the new loss member.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (b):

# Example 1. Basic case.
(i) A and P each own 50 percent of the L stock. On December 19, Year 6, P purchases 30 percent of the L stock from A for cash. L has net operating losses arising in Year 1 and Year 2 that it carries over to Year 6 and Year 7. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:
ER02JY99.013
(ii) L is a new loss member because it has net operating loss carryovers that arose in a SRLY with respect to the P group and L is not a member of a loss subgroup under § 1.1502-91(d). Under section 382 and the regulations thereunder, L is a loss corporation on December 19, Year 6, that day is a testing
date for L, and the testing period for L commences on December 20, Year 3.
(iii) P's purchase of L stock does not cause an ownership change of L on December 19, Year 6, with respect to the net operating loss carryovers from Year 1 and Year 2 under section 382 and § 1.382-2T. The use of the loss carryovers, however, is subject to limitation under § 1.1502-21(c).

# Example 2. Multiple new loss members.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
and, on December 31, Year 6, L purchases all the stock of L1 from B for cash. L1 has a net operating loss of $40 arising in Year 3 that it carries over to Year 7. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:
ER02JY99.014
(ii) L1 is a new loss member because it has a net operating loss carryover from Year 3 that arose in a SRLY with respect to the P group and L1 is not a member of a loss subgroup under § 1.1502-91(d)(1).
(iii) L's purchase of all the stock of L1 causes an ownership change of L1 on December 31, Year 6, under section 382 and § 1.382-2T. Accordingly, a section 382 limitation based on the value of the L1 stock immediately before the ownership change limits the amount of consolidated taxable income of the P group for any post-change year that may be offset by L1's loss from Year 3.
(iv) L1's ownership change upon becoming a member of the P group is an ownership change described in § 1.1502-96(a). Thus, starting on January 1, Year 7, the P group no longer separately tracks owner shifts of the stock of L1 with respect to L1's loss from Year 3, and the P group is a loss group because L1's Year 3 loss is treated as a loss described in § 1.1502-91(c).

# Example 3. Ownership changes of new loss members.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 2, and, on July 30, Year 7, C purchases all the stock of P for cash.
(ii) L is a new loss member on July 30, Year 7, because its Year 1 and Year 2 losses arose in SRLYs with respect to the P group and it is not a member of a loss subgroup under § 1.1502-91(d)(1). The testing period for L commences on August 1, Year 4. C's purchase of all the P stock causes an ownership change of L on July 30, Year 7, under section 382 and § 1.382-2T with respect to its Year 1 and Year 2 losses. Accordingly, a section 382 limitation based on the value of the L stock immediately before the ownership change limits the amount of consolidated taxable income of the P group for any post-change year that may be offset by L's Year 1 and Year 2 losses. See § 1.1502-21(c) for rules relating to an additional limitation.
(iii) The P group is a loss group on July 30, Year 7, because it is entitled to use L1's loss from Year 3, and such loss is no longer treated as a loss of a new loss member starting the day after L1's ownership change on December 31, Year 6. See §§ 1.1502-96(a) and 1.1502-91(c)(2). C's purchase of all the P stock causes an ownership change of P, and therefore the P loss group, on July 30, Year 7, with respect to L1's Year 3 loss. Accordingly, a consolidated section 382 limitation based on the value of the P stock immediately before the ownership change limits the amount of consolidated taxable income of the P group for any post-change year that may be offset by L1's Year 3 loss.
(c)
Built-in gains and losses.
As the context may require, the principles of §§ 1.1502-91(g) and (h) and 1.1502-93(c) (relating to built-in gains and losses) apply to a new loss member on a separate entity basis. See § 1.1502-91(g)(4). See § 1.1502-13 (including
Example 10
of § 1.1502-13(c)(7)) for rules relating to the treatment of intercompany transactions.
(d)
Information statements.
The common parent of a consolidated group that has a new loss member subject to paragraph (b)(1) of this section during a consolidated return year must file the information statement required by § 1.382-11(a) because of any owner shift, equity structure shift, or other transaction described in § 1.382-2T(a)(2)(i). Instead of filing a separate statement for each new loss member, the common parent may file a single statement described in § 1.382-11(a) with respect to the stock ownership of the common parent (which is treated as a loss corporation). In addition to the information concerning stock ownership of the common parent, the single statement must identify each new loss member and state which new loss members, if any, have had ownership changes during the consolidated return year. The new loss member is, however, required to maintain the records necessary to determine if it has an ownership change. This paragraph (d) applies with respect to the attributes of a new loss member until an event occurs which ends separate tracking under § 1.1502-96(a). After that time, the information statement described in § 1.1502-92(e)(1) must be filed with respect to these attributes.
[T.D. 8824, 64 FR 36155, July 2, 1999, as amended by T.D. 9264, 71 FR 30608, May 30, 2006; T.D. 9329, 72 FR 32807, June 14, 2007]
§ 1.1502-95
Rules on ceasing to be a member of a consolidated group (or loss subgroup).
(a)
In general
—(1)
Consolidated group.
This section provides rules for applying section 382 on or after the day that a member ceases to be a member of a consolidated group (or loss subgroup). The rules concern how to determine whether an ownership change occurs with respect to losses of the member, and how a consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation) and a loss group's (or loss subgroup's) net unrealized built-in gain or loss is apportioned to the member. As the context requires, a reference in this section to a loss group, a member, or a corporation also includes a reference to a loss subgroup, and a reference to a consolidated section 382 limitation also
includes a reference to a subgroup section 382 limitation.
(2)
Election by common parent.
Only the common parent (not the loss subgroup parent) may make the election under paragraph (c) of this section to apportion a consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation) or a loss group's (or loss subgroup's) net unrealized built-in gain.
(3)
Coordination with §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-93.
For rules regarding the determination of whether there is an ownership change of a loss subgroup and the computation of a subgroup section 382 limitation following such an ownership change, see §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-93.
(b)
Separate application of section 382 when a member leaves a consolidated group
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-93 (relating to rules applicable to loss groups and loss subgroups), section 382 and the regulations thereunder apply to a corporation on a separate entity basis after it ceases to be a member of a consolidated group (or loss subgroup). Solely for purposes of determining whether a corporation has an ownership change—
(i) Any portion of a consolidated net operating loss that is apportioned to the corporation under § 1.1502-21(b) is treated as a net operating loss of the corporation beginning on the first day of the taxable year in which the loss arose;
(ii) The testing period may include the period during which (or before which) the corporation was a member of the group (or loss subgroup); and
(iii) Except to the extent provided in § 1.1502-96(d) (relating to reattributed losses), the day it ceases to be a member of a consolidated group is treated as a testing date of the corporation within the meaning of § 1.382-2(a)(4).
(2)
Effect of a prior ownership change of the group.
If a loss group has had an ownership change under § 1.1502-92 before a corporation ceases to be a member of a consolidated group (the former member)—
(i) Any pre-change consolidated attribute that is subject to a consolidated section 382 limitation continues to be treated as a pre-change loss with respect to the former member after it is apportioned to the former member and, if any net unrealized built-in loss is allocated to the former member under paragraph (e) of this section, any recognized built-in loss of the former member is a pre-change loss of the member;
(ii) The section 382 limitation with respect to such pre-change attribute is zero unless the common parent, under paragraph (c) of this section, apportions to the former member all or part of the consolidated section 382 limitation applicable to such attribute. The limitation applicable to a pre-change attribute other than a recognized built-in loss may be increased to the extent that the common parent has apportioned all or part of the loss group's net unrealized built-in gain to the former member, and the former member recognizes built-in gain during the recognition period;
(iii) The testing period for determining a subsequent ownership change with respect to such pre-change attribute (or such net unrealized built-in loss, if any) begins no earlier than the first day following the loss group's most recent change date; and
(iv) As generally provided under section 382, an ownership change of the former member that occurs on or after the day it ceases to be a member of a loss group may result in an additional, lesser limitation amount with respect to such losses.
(3)
Application in the case of a loss subgroup.
If two or more former members are included in the same loss subgroup immediately after they cease to be members of a consolidated group, the principles of paragraphs (b), (c) and (e) of this section apply to the loss subgroup. Therefore, for example, an apportionment by the common parent under paragraph (c) of this section is made to the loss subgroup rather than separately to its members. If the common parent of the consolidated group apportions all or part of a limitation (or net unrealized built-in gain) separately to one or more former members that are included in a loss subgroup because the common parent of the acquiring group makes an election under § 1.1502-91(d)(4) with respect to those members, the aggregate of those separate amounts is treated as the amount
apportioned to the loss subgroup. Such separate apportionment may occur, for example, because the election under § 1.1502-91(d)(4) has not been filed at the time that the election of apportionment is made under paragraph (f) of this section.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (b):
(i)
Example 1: Treatment of departing member as a separate corporation throughout the testing period.
(A) A owns all the L stock. L owns all the stock of L1 and L2. The L group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 3. On January 12, Year 2, A sells 30 percent of the L stock to B. On February 7, Year 3, L sells 40 percent of the L2 stock to C, and L2 ceases to be a member of the group. A portion of the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss is apportioned to L2 under § 1.1502-21(b) and is carried to L2's first separate return year, which ends December 31, Year 3. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:
ER02JY99.015
(B) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, L2 is a loss corporation on February 7, Year 3. Under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, February 7, Year 3, is a testing date. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the testing period for L2 with respect to this testing date commences on January 1,
Year 1, the first day of the taxable year in which the portion of the consolidated net operating loss apportioned to L2 arose. Therefore, in determining whether L2 has an ownership change on February 7, Year 3, B's purchase of 30 percent of the L stock and C's purchase of 40 percent of the L2 stock are each owner shifts. L2 has an ownership change under section 382(g) and § 1.382-2T because B and C have increased their ownership interests in L2 by 18 and 40 percentage points, respectively, during the testing period.
(ii)
Example 2: Effect of prior ownership change of loss group.
(A) L owns all the L1 stock and L1 owns all the L2 stock. The L loss group had an ownership change under § 1.1502-92 in Year 2 with respect to a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 and carried over to Year 2 and Year 3. The consolidated section 382 limitation computed solely on the basis of the value of the stock of L is $100. On December 31, Year 2, L1 sells 25 percent of the stock of L2 to B. L2 is apportioned a portion of the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss which it carries over to its first separate return year ending after December 31, Year 2. L2's separate section 382 limitation with respect to this loss is zero unless L elects to apportion all or a part of the consolidated section 382 limitation to L2. (See paragraph (c) of this section for rules regarding the apportionment of a consolidated section 382 limitation.) L apportions $50 of the consolidated section 382 limitation to L2, and the remaining $50 of the consolidated section 382 limitation stays with the loss group composed of L and L1.
(B) On December 31, Year 3, L1 sells its remaining 75 percent stock interest in L2 to C, resulting in an ownership change of L2. L2's section 382 limitation computed on the change date with respect to the value of its stock is $30. Accordingly, L2's section 382 limitation for post-change years ending after December 31, Year 3, with respect to its pre-change losses, including the consolidated net operating losses apportioned to it from the L group, is $30, adjusted for a short taxable year, carryforward of unused limitation, or any other adjustment required under section 382. The analysis would be similar if the L loss group had an ownership change under § 1.1502-92 in Year 2 with respect to disallowed business interest expense paid or accrued by L2 in Year 1 and carried forward under section 163(j)(2) to Year 2 and Year 3. See § 1.1502-98(b) (providing that §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-96 apply section 382 to business interest expense, with appropriate adjustments).
(c)
Apportionment of a consolidated section 382 limitation
—(1)
In general.
The common parent may elect to apportion all or any part of a consolidated section 382 limitation to a former member (or loss subgroup). The common parent also may elect to apportion all or any part of the loss group's net unrealized built-in gain to a former member (or loss subgroup).
(2)
Amount which may be apportioned
—(i)
Consolidated section 382 limitation.
The common parent may apportion all or part of each element of the consolidated section 382 limitation determined under § 1.1502-93. For this purpose, the consolidated section 382 limitation consists of two elements—
(A) The value element, which is the element of the limitation determined under section 382(b)(1) (relating to value multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate) without regard to such adjustments as those described in section 382(b)(2) (relating to the carryforward of unused section 382 limitation), section 382(b)(3)(B)(relating to the section 382 limitation for the post-change year that includes the change date), section 382(h)(relating to built-in gains and section 338 gains), and section 382(m)(2)(relating to short taxable years); and
(B) The adjustment element, which is so much (if any) of the limitation for the taxable year during which the former member ceases to be a member of the consolidated group that is attributable to a carryover of unused limitation under section 382(b)(2) or to recognized built-in gains under 382(h).
(ii)
Net unrealized built-in gain.
The aggregate amount of the loss group's net unrealized built-in gain that may be apportioned to one or more former members that cease to be members during the same consolidated return year cannot exceed the loss group's excess, immediately after the close of
that year, of net unrealized built-in gain over recognized built-in gain, determined under section 382(h)(1)(A)(ii) (relating to a limitation on recognized built-in gain). For this purpose, net unrealized built-in gain apportioned to former members in prior consolidated return years is treated as recognized built-in gain in those years.
(3) Effect of apportionment on the consolidated group—(i) Consolidated section 382 limitation. The value element of the consolidated section 382 limitation for any post-change year ending after the day that a former member (or loss subgroup) ceases to be a member(s) is reduced to the extent that it is apportioned under this paragraph (c). The consolidated section 382 limitation for the post-change year in which the former member (or loss subgroup) ceases to be a member(s) is also reduced to the extent that the adjustment element for that year is apportioned under this paragraph (c).
(ii)
Net unrealized built-in gain.
The amount of the loss group's net unrealized built-in gain that is apportioned to the former member (or loss subgroup) is treated as recognized built-in gain for a prior taxable year ending in the recognition period for purposes of applying the limitation of section 382(h)(1)(A)(ii) to the loss group's recognition period taxable years beginning after the consolidated return year in which the former member (or loss subgroup) ceases to be a member.
(4)
Effect on corporations to which an apportionment is made
—(i)
Consolidated section 382 limitation.
The amount of the value element that is apportioned to a former member (or loss subgroup) is treated as the amount determined under section 382(b)(1) for purposes of determining the amount of that corporation's (or loss subgroup's) section 382 limitation for any taxable year ending after the former member (or loss subgroup) ceases to be a member(s). Appropriate adjustments must be made to the limitation based on the value element so apportioned for a short taxable year, carryforward of unused limitation, or any other adjustment required under section 382. The adjustment element apportioned to a former member (or loss subgroup) is treated as an adjustment under section 382(b)(2) or section 382(h), as appropriate, for the first taxable year after the member (or members) ceases to be a member (or members).
(ii)
Net unrealized built-in gain.
For purposes of determining the amount by which the former member's (or loss subgroup's) section 382 limitation for any taxable year beginning after the former member (or loss subgroup) ceases to be a member(s) is increased by its recognized built-in gain—
(A) The amount of net unrealized built-in gain apportioned to a former member (or loss subgroup) is treated as if it were an amount of net unrealized built-in gain determined under section 382(h)(1)(A)(i)(without regard to the threshold of section 382(h)(3)(B)) with respect to such member or loss subgroup, and that amount is not reduced under section 382(h)(1)(A)(ii) by the loss group's recognized built-in gain;
(B) The former member's (or loss subgroup's) 5 year recognition period begins on the loss group's change date;
(C) In applying section 382(h)(1)(A)(ii), the former member (or loss subgroup) takes into account only its prior taxable years that begin after it ceases to be a member of the loss group; and
(D) The former member's (or loss subgroup's) recognized built-in gain on the disposition of an asset is determined under section 382(h)(2)(A), treating references to the change date in that section as references to the loss group's change date.
(5)
Deemed apportionment when loss group terminates.
If a loss group terminates, to the extent the consolidated section 382 limitation or net unrealized built-in gain is not apportioned under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the consolidated section 382 limitation or net unrealized built-in gain is deemed to be apportioned to the loss subgroup that includes the common parent, or, if there is no loss subgroup that includes the common parent immediately after the loss group terminates, to the common parent. A loss group terminates on the first day of the first taxable year that is a separate return year with respect to each member of the former loss group.
(6)
Appropriate adjustments when former member leaves during the year.
Appropriate adjustments are made to the consolidated section 382 limitation for the consolidated return year during which the former member (or loss subgroup) ceases to be a member(s) to reflect the inclusion of the former member in the loss group for a portion of that year.
(7)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (c):

# Example 1. Consequence of apportionment.
(i) L owns all the L1 stock and L1 owns all the L2 stock. The L group has a $200 consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 2. At the close of December 31, Year 1, the group has an ownership change under § 1.1502-92. The ownership change results in a consolidated section 382 limitation of $10 based on the value of the stock of the group. On August 29, Year 2, L1 sells 30 percent of the stock of L2 to A. L2 is apportioned $90 of the group's $200 consolidated net operating loss under § 1.1502-21(b). L, the common parent, elects to apportion $6 of the consolidated section 382 limitation to L2. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:
ER02JY99.016
(ii) For its separate return years ending after December 31, Year 2, L2's section 382 limitation with respect to the $90 of the group's net operating loss apportioned to it is $6, adjusted, as appropriate, for any short taxable year, unused section 382 limitation, or other adjustment. For its consolidated return year ending December 31, Year 2 the L group's consolidated section 382 limitation with respect to the remaining $110 of pre-change consolidated attribute is $4 ($10 minus the $6 value element apportioned to L2), adjusted, as appropriate, for any short taxable year, unused section 382 limitation, or other adjustment.
(iii) For the L group's consolidated return year ending December 31, Year 2, the value element of its consolidated section 382 limitation is increased by $4 (rounded to the nearest dollar), to account for the period during which L2 was a member of the L group ($6, the consolidated section 382 limitation apportioned to L2, times 241/365, the ratio of the number of days during Year 2 that L2 is a member of the group to the number of days in the group's consolidated return year). See paragraph (c)(6) of this section. Therefore, the value element of the consolidated section 382 limitation for Year 2
of the L group is $8 (rounded to the nearest dollar).
(iv) The section 382 limitation for L2's short taxable year ending December 31, Year 2, is $2 (rounded to the nearest dollar), which is the amount that bears the same relationship to $6, the value element of the consolidated section 382 limitation apportioned to L2, as the number of days during that short taxable year, 124 days, bears to 365. See § 1.382-5(c).

# Example 2. Consequence of no apportionment.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that L does not elect to apportion any portion of the consolidated section 382 limitation to L2. For its separate return years ending after August 29, Year 2, L2's section 382 limitation with respect to the $90 of the group's pre-change consolidated attribute apportioned to L2 is zero under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. Thus, the $90 consolidated net operating loss apportioned to L2 cannot offset L2's taxable income in any of its separate return years ending after August 29, Year 2. For its consolidated return years ending after August 29, Year 2, the L group's consolidated section 382 limitation with respect to the remaining $110 of pre-change consolidated attribute is $10, adjusted, as appropriate, for any short taxable year, unused section 382 limitation, or other adjustment.

# Example 3. Apportionment of adjustment element.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that L2 ceases to be a member of the L group on August 29, Year 3, and the L group has a $4 carryforward of an unused consolidated section 382 limitation (under section 382(b)(2)) to the Year 3 consolidated return year. The carryover of unused limitation increases the consolidated section 382 limitation for the Year 3 consolidated return year from $10 to $14. L may elect to apportion all or any portion of the $10 value element and all or any portion of the $4 adjustment element to L2.
(d)
Rules pertaining to ceasing to be a member of a loss subgroup
—(1)
In general.
A corporation ceases to be a member of a loss subgroup on the earlier of—
(i) The first day of the first taxable year for which it files a separate return; or
(ii) The first day that it ceases to bear a relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to the loss subgroup parent (treating for this purpose the loss subgroup parent as the common parent described in section 1504(a)(1)(A)).
(2)
Exceptions.
Paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section does not apply to a member of a loss subgroup while that member remains a member of the current group—
(i) If an election under § 1.1502-91(d)(4)(relating to treating the subgroup parent requirement as satisfied) applies to the members of the loss subgroup;
(ii) Starting on the day after the change date (but not earlier than the date the loss subgroup becomes a member of the group), if there is an ownership change of the loss subgroup within six months before, on, or after becoming members of the group; or
(iii) Starting the day after the period of 5 consecutive years following the day that the loss subgroup become members of the group during which the loss subgroup has not had an ownership change.
(3)
Examples.
The principles of this paragraph (d) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1. Basic case.
(i) P owns all the L stock, L owns all the L1 stock and L1 owns all the L2 stock. The P group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 2. On December 11, Year 2, P sells all the stock of L to corporation M. Each of L, L1, and L2 is apportioned a portion of the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss, and thereafter each joins with M in filing consolidated returns. Under § 1.1502-92, the L loss subgroup has an ownership change on December 11, Year 2. The L loss subgroup has a subgroup section 382 limitation of $100. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:
ER02JY99.017
(ii) On May 22, Year 3, L1 sells 40 percent of the L2 stock to A. L2 carries over a portion of the P group's net operating loss from Year 1 to its separate return year ending December 31, Year 3. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, L2 ceases to be a member of the L loss subgroup on May 22, Year 3, which is both (1) the first day of the first taxable year
for which it files a separate return and (2) the day it ceases to bear a relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to the loss subgroup parent, L. The net operating loss of L2 that is carried over from the P group is treated as a pre-change loss of L2 for its separate return years ending after May 22, Year 3. Under paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(2) of this section, the separate section 382 limitation with respect to this loss is zero unless M elects to apportion all or a part of the subgroup section 382 limitation of the L loss subgroup to L2.

# Example 2. Formation of a new loss subgroup.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that A purchases 40 percent of the L1 stock from L rather than purchasing L2 stock from L1. L1 and L2 file a consolidated return for their first taxable year ending after May 22, Year 3, and each of L1 and L2 carries over a part of the net operating loss of the P group that arose in Year 1. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, L1 and L2 cease to be members of the L loss subgroup on May 22, Year 3. The net operating losses carried over from the P group are treated as pre-change subgroup attributes of the loss subgroup composed of L1 and L2. The subgroup section 382 limitation with respect to those losses is zero unless M elects to apportion all or part of the subgroup section 382 limitation of the L loss subgroup to the L1 loss subgroup. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:
ER02JY99.018

# Example 3. Ownership change upon becoming members of the group.
(i) A owns all the stock of P, and P owns all the stock of L1 and L2. The P group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 3 and Year 4. Corporation M acquires all the stock of P on November 11, Year 3, and P, L1, and L2 thereafter file consolidated
returns with M. M's acquisition results in an ownership change of the P loss subgroup under § 1.1502-92(b)(1)(ii).
(ii) P distributes the L2 stock to M on October 7, Year 4, and L2 ceases to bear the relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to P, the P loss subgroup parent. However, under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, L2 does not cease to be a member of the P loss subgroup because the P loss subgroup had an ownership change upon becoming members of the M group and L2 remains in the M group.

# Example 4. Ceasing to bear a section 1504 (a)(1) to the loss subgroup parent.
(i) A owns all the stock of P, and P owns all the stock of L1 and L2. The P group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 7. At the close of Year 2, X acquires all of the stock of P, causing an ownership change of the loss subgroup composed of P, L1 and L2 under § 1.1502-92(b)(1)(ii). In Year 4, M, which is owned by the same person that owns X, acquires all of the stock of P, and the M acquisition does not cause a second ownership change of the P loss subgroup.
(ii) P distributes the L2 stock to M on February 3, Year 6 (less than 5 years after the P loss subgroup became members of the M group) and L2 ceases to bear the relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to P, the loss subgroup parent. Thus, the section 382 limitation from the Year 2 ownership change that applies with respect to the pre-change attributes attributable to L2 is zero except to the extent M elects to apportion all or part of the P loss subgroup section 382 limitation to L2.

# Example 5. Relationship through a successor.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except that M's acquisition of the P stock does not result in an ownership change of the P loss subgroup, and, instead of P's distributing the stock of L2, L2 merges into L1 on October 7, Year 4. L1 (as successor to L2 in the merger within the meaning of § 1.1502-1(f)(4)) continues to bear a relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to P, the loss subgroup parent. Thus, L2 does not cease to be a member of the P loss subgroup as a result of the merger.

# Example 6. Reattribution of net operating loss carryover under § 1.1502-36(d)(6).
The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except that, instead of distributing the L2 stock to M, P sells that stock to B, and, under § 1.1502-36(d)(6), M reattributes $10 of L2's net operating loss carryover to itself. Under § 1.1502-36(d)(6)(iv)(A), M succeeds to the reattributed loss as if the loss were succeeded to in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. M, as successor to L2, does not cease to be a member of the P loss subgroup.
(e)
Allocation of net unrealized built-in loss
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (e) provides rules for the allocation of a loss group's (or loss subgroup's) net unrealized built-in loss if a member ceases to be a member of a loss group (or loss subgroup). This paragraph (e) applies if—
(i) A loss group (or loss subgroup) has a net unrealized built-in loss on a change date; and
(ii) Immediately after the close of the consolidated return year in which the departing member ceases to be a member, the amount of the loss group's (or loss subgroup's) excess of net unrealized built-in loss over recognized built-in loss, determined under section 382(h)(1)(B)(ii) (relating to a limitation on recognized built-in loss), is greater than zero. (The amount of such excess is referred to as the remaining NUBIL balance.) In applying section 382(h)(1)(B)(ii) for this purpose, net unrealized built-in loss allocated to departing members in prior consolidated return years is treated as recognized built-in loss in those years.
(2)
Amount of allocation
—(i)
In general.
The amount of net unrealized built-in loss allocated to a departing member is equal to the remaining NUBIL balance, multiplied by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the amount of the built-in loss, taken into account on the change date under § 1.1502-91(g), in the assets held by the departing member immediately after the member ceases to be a member of the loss group (or loss subgroup). The denominator of the fraction is the sum of the numerator, plus the amount of the built-in loss, taken into account under § 1.1502-91(g) on the change date, in the assets held by the loss group (or loss subgroup) immediately after the close of the taxable year in which the departing member ceases to be a member. (Fluctuations in value of the assets between the change date and the date that the member ceases to be a member of the group (or loss subgroup), or the close of the taxable year in which the member ceases to be a member of the loss group, are disregarded.) Because the amount of built-in loss on the change date with respect to a departing member's assets is taken into account (rather than that member's separately computed net unrealized built-in loss
on the change date), a departing member can be apportioned all or part of the loss group's net unrealized built-in loss, even if the departing member had a separately computed net unrealized built-in gain on the change date. Amounts taken into account under section 382(h)(6)(C) (relating to certain deduction items) are treated as if they were assets in determining the numerator and denominator of the fraction.
(ii)
Transferred basis property and deferred gain or loss.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, assets held by the departing member immediately after it ceases to be a member of the group (or by other members immediately after the close of the taxable year) include—
(A) Assets held at that time that are transferred basis property that was held by any member of the group (or loss subgroup) on the change date; and
(B) Assets held at that time by any member of the consolidated group with respect to which gain or loss of the group member or loss subgroup member at issue has been deferred in an intercompany transaction and has not been taken into account.
(iii)
Assets for which gain or loss has been recognized.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, assets held by the departing member immediately after it ceases to be a member of the group (or by other members immediately after the close of the taxable year) do not include assets with respect to which gain or loss has previously been recognized and taken into account during the recognition period (including gain or loss recognized in an intercompany transaction and taken into account immediately before the member leaves the group). Appropriate adjustments must be made if gain or loss on an asset has been only partially recognized and taken into account.
(iv)
Exchanged basis property.
The rules of § 1.1502-91(h) apply for purposes of this paragraph (e) (disregarding stock received from the departing member or another member that is a member immediately after the close of the taxable year).
(v)
Two or more members depart during the same year.
If two or more members cease to be members during the same consolidated return year, appropriate adjustments must be made to the denominator of the fraction for each departing member by treating the other departing members as if they had not ceased to be members during that year and as if the assets held by those other departing members immediately after they cease to be members of the group (or loss subgroup) are assets held by the group immediately after the close of the taxable year.
(vi)
Anti-abuse rule.
If assets are transferred between members or a member ceases to be a member with a principal purpose of causing or affecting the allocation of amounts under this paragraph (e), appropriate adjustments must be made to eliminate any benefit of such acquisition, disposition, or allocation.
(3)
Effect of allocation on the consolidated group.
The amount of the net unrealized built-in loss that is allocated to the former member is treated as recognized built-in loss for a prior taxable year ending in the recognition period for purposes applying the limitation of section 382(h)(1)(B)(ii) to a loss group's (or loss subgroup's) recognition period taxable years beginning after the consolidated return year in which the former member ceases to be a member.
(4)
Effect on corporations to which the allocation is made.
For purposes of determining the amount of the former member's recognized built-in losses in any taxable year beginning after the former member ceases to be a member—
(i) The amount of the loss group's (or loss subgroup's) net unrealized built-in loss that is allocated to the former member is treated as if it were an amount of net unrealized built-in loss determined under section 382(h)(1)(B)(i)(without regard to the threshold of section 382(h)(3)(B)) with respect to such member or loss subgroup, and that amount is not reduced under section 382(h)(1)(B)(ii) by the loss group's (or loss subgroup's) recognized built-in losses;
(ii) The former member's 5 year recognition period begins on the loss group's (or loss subgroup's) change date;
(iii) In applying section 382(h)(1)(B)(ii), the former member
takes into account only its prior taxable years that begin after it ceases to be a member of the loss group (or loss subgroup); and
(iv) The former member's recognized built-in loss on the disposition of an asset is determined under section 382(h)(2)(B), treating references to the change date in that section as references to the loss group's (or loss subgroup's) change date.
(5)
Subgroup principles.
If two or more former members are members of the same consolidated group (the second group) immediately after they cease to be members of the current group, the principles of paragraphs (e)(1), (2) and (4) of this section apply to those former members on an aggregate basis. Thus, for example, the amount of net unrealized built-in loss allocated to those members is based on the assets held by those members immediately after they cease to be members of the current group and the limitation of section 382(h)(1)(B)(ii) on recognized built-in losses is applied by taking into account the aggregate amount of net unrealized built-in loss allocated to the former members and the aggregate recognized losses of those members in taxable years beginning after they cease to be members of the current group. If one or more of such members cease to be members of the second group, the principles of this paragraph (e) are applied with respect to those members to allocate to them all or part of any remaining unrecognized amount of net unrealized built-in loss allocated to the members that became members of the second group.
(6)
Apportionment of consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation)
—(i)
In general.
For rules relating to the apportionment of a consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation) to a former member, see paragraph (c) of this section.
(ii)
Special rule for former members that become members of the same consolidated group.
If recognized built-in losses of one or more former members would be subject to a consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation) if recognized immediately before the member (or members) cease to be members of the group, an apportionment of that limitation may be made, under paragraph (c) of this section, to a loss subgroup that includes such member (or members), and the recognized built-in losses (if any) of that member (or members) will be subject to that apportioned limitation. If two or more of such former members are not included in a loss subgroup immediately after they cease to be members of the group (for example, because they do not have net operating loss carryovers or, in the aggregate, a net unrealized built-in loss), but are members of the same consolidated group, an apportionment of the consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation) may be made to them as if they were a loss subgroup.
(7)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (e):

# Example 1. Basic allocation case.
(i) P owns all of the stock of L1 and L2. On September 4, Year 1, A purchases all of the P stock, causing an ownership change of the P group. On that date P has two assets (other than the L1 and L2 stock), asset 1 with an adjusted basis of $40 and a fair market value of $15 and asset 2 with an adjusted basis of $50 and a fair market value of $100. L1 has two assets, asset 3 , with a fair market value of $50 and an adjusted basis of $100, and asset 4, with an adjusted basis of $125 and a fair market value of $75. L2 has two assets, asset 5, with a fair market value of $150 and an adjusted basis of $100, and asset 6, with an adjusted basis of $90 and a fair market value of $40. Thus, the P loss group has a net unrealized built-in loss of $75.
(ii) On March 19, Year 3, P sells all of the L2 stock to M. At that time, asset 5, which has appreciated in value, has a fair market value of $250 and an adjusted basis of $100. Asset 6, which has declined in value, has an adjusted basis of $90 and a fair market value of $10.
(iii) On April 8, Year 3, P sells asset 1, and has a recognized built-in loss of $25 that is subject to the P group's section 382 limitation. On November 11, Year 4, L2 sells asset 6 for its then fair market value, $10, recognizing a loss of $80. On June 3, Year 5, L1 sells asset 4, recognizing a loss of $50.
(iv) Immediately after the close of Year 3, the P loss group's remaining NUBIL balance is $50 ($75 net unrealized built-in loss reduced by the $25 recognized built-in loss of P). The portion of the remaining NUBIL balance that is allocated to L2 is $17 (rounded to the nearest dollar). Seventeen dollars is the
product obtained by multiplying $50 (the remaining NUBIL balance) by $50/$150. The numerator of the fraction ($50) is the amount of built-in loss in asset 6, taken into account on the change date under § 1.1502-91(g). The denominator ($150) is the sum of the numerator ($50) and the amount of built-in loss in assets 3 and 4, taken into account on the change date under § 1.1502-91(g) ($100). The built-in loss in asset 1 is not included in the denominator of the fraction because it is not held by the P group immediately after the close of Year 3.
(v) Seventeen dollars of L2's $80 loss on the sale of asset 6 is a recognized built-in loss and subject to a section 382 limitation of zero, unless P apportions some or all of the P group's consolidated section 382 limitation to L2 (adjusted for a short taxable year, carryover of unused limitation, or any other adjustment required under section 382).
(vi) Thirty-three dollars of L1's $50 loss on the sale of asset 4 is subject to the P group's consolidated section 382 limitation, reduced by the amount of such limitation apportioned to L2, and adjusted for any short taxable year, a carryforward of unused limitation, or other adjustment. (In applying section 382(h)(1)(B)(ii) with respect to Year 5, the P group's net unrealized built-in loss is reduced by P's $25 recognized built-in loss in Year 3 and the $17 of net unrealized built-in loss allocated to L2, thus limiting the P group's recognized built-in loss in Year 5 to $33.)

# Example 2. Two members depart in the same year.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that P sells all of the stock of L1 to C on November 1, Year 3. The amount of net unrealized built-in loss apportioned to L2 (rounded to the nearest dollar) is $17 ($50 remaining NUBIL balance × $50/$150). The amount of net unrealized built-in loss apportioned to L1 (rounded to the nearest dollar) is $33 ($50 remaining NUBIL balance × $100/$150).
(8)
Reporting requirements
—(i)
Common Parent.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(8)(iii) of this section, if a net unrealized built-in loss is allocated under paragraph (e) of this section, the common parent must include a statement entitled, “STATEMENT OF NET UNREALIZED BUILT-IN LOSS ALLOCATION PURSUANT TO § 1.1502-95(e),” on or with its income tax return for the taxable year in which the former member(s) (or a new loss subgroup that includes that member) ceases to be a member. The statement must include—
(A) The name and employer identification number of the departing member;
(B) The amount of the remaining NUBIL balance for the taxable year in which the member departs;
(C) The amount of the net unrealized built-in loss allocated to the departing member; and
(D) A representation that the common parent has delivered a copy of the statement to the former member (or the common parent of the group of which the former member is a member) on or before the day the group files its income tax return for the consolidated return year that the former member ceases to be a member.
(ii)
Former member.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(8)(iii) of this section, the former member must include a statement on or with its first income tax return (or the first return in which the former member joins) that is filed after the close of the consolidated return year of the group of which the former member (or a new loss subgroup that includes that member) ceases to be a member. The statement will be identical to the statement filed by the common parent under paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section except that instead of including the information described in paragraph (e)(8)(i)(A) of this section the former member must provide the name, employer identification number and tax year of the former common parent, and instead of the representation described in paragraph (e)(8)(i)(D) of this section the former member must represent that it has received and retained the copy of the statement delivered by the common parent as part of its records. See § 1.6001-1(e).
(iii)
Exception.
This paragraph (e)(8) does not apply if the required information (other than the amount of the remaining NUBIL balance) is included in a statement of election under paragraph (f) of this section (relating to apportioning a section 382 limitation).

§ 1.1502-96
Miscellaneous rules.
(a)
End of separate tracking of losses
—(1)
Application.
This paragraph (a) applies to a member (or a loss subgroup) with a net operating loss carryover that arose (or is treated under § 1.1502-21(c) as arising) in a SRLY, or a member (or loss subgroup) with a net unrealized built-in loss determined at the time that the member (or loss subgroup) becomes a member of the consolidated group if there is—
(i) An ownership change of the member (or loss subgroup) within six months before, on, or after becoming a member of the group; or
(ii) A period of 5 consecutive years following the day that the member (or loss subgroup) becomes a member of a group during which the member (or loss subgroup) has not had an ownership change.
(2)
Effect of end of separate tracking
—(i)
Net operating loss carryovers.
If this paragraph (a) applies with respect to a member (or loss subgroup) with a net operating loss carryover, then, starting on the day after the earlier of the change date (but not earlier than the day the member (or loss subgroup) becomes a member of the consolidated group) or the last day of the 5 consecutive year period described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, such loss carryover is treated as described in § 1.1502-91(c)(1)(i). The preceding sentence also applies for purposes of determining whether there is an ownership change with respect to such loss carryover following such change date or 5 consecutive year period. Thus, for example, starting the day after the change date (but not earlier than the day the member (or loss subgroup) becomes a member of the consolidated group) or the end of the 5 consecutive year period—
(A) The consolidated group which includes the new loss member or loss subgroup is no longer required to separately track owner shifts of the stock of the new loss member or subgroup parent to determine if an ownership change occurs with respect to the loss carryover of the new loss member or members included in the loss subgroup;
(B) The group is a loss group because the member's loss carryover is treated as a loss described in § 1.1502-91(c)(1)(i);
(C) There is an ownership change with respect to such loss carryover only if the group has an ownership change; and
(D) If the group has an ownership change, such loss carryover is a pre-change consolidated attribute subject to the loss group's consolidated section 382 limitation.
(ii)
Net unrealized built-in losses.
If this paragraph (a) applies with respect to a new loss member described in § 1.1502-94(a)(1)(ii) (or a loss subgroup described in § 1.1502-91(d)(2)) then, starting on the day after the earlier of the change date (but not earlier than
the day the member (or loss subgroup) becomes a member of the group) or the last day of the 5 consecutive year period described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the member (or members of the loss subgroup) are treated, for purposes of applying § 1.1502-91(g)(2)(ii), as if they have been affiliated with the common parent for 5 consecutive years. Starting on that day, the member's (or the members of the loss subgroup's) separately computed net unrealized built-in loss is included in the determination whether the group has a net unrealized built-in loss, and there is an ownership change with respect to the member's separately computed net unrealized built-in loss only if the group (including the member) has a net unrealized built-in loss and has an ownership change. Thus, for example, starting the day after the change date (but not earlier than the day the member (or loss subgroup) becomes a member of the consolidated group), or the end of the 5 consecutive period
(A) The consolidated group which includes the new loss member or loss subgroup is no longer required to separately track owner shifts of the stock of the new loss member or subgroup parent to determine if an ownership change occurs with respect to the net unrealized built-in loss of the new loss member or members of the loss subgroup;
(B) The group includes the member's (or the loss subgroup members') separately computed net unrealized built-in loss in determining whether it is a loss group under § 1.1502-91(c)(1)(iii);
(C) There is an ownership change with respect to such net unrealized built-in loss only if the group is a loss group and has an ownership change; and
(D) If the group has an ownership change, the member's separately computed net unrealized built-in loss and its assets are taken into account in determining the group's pre-change consolidated attributes described in § 1.1502-91(e)(1) (relating to recognized built-in losses) that are subject to the group's consolidated section 382 limitation.
(iii)
Common parent not common parent for five years.
If the common parent has become the common parent of an existing group within the previous 5-year period in a transaction described in § 1.1502-75(d)(2)(ii) or (3), appropriate adjustments must be made in applying paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (3) of this section. In such a case, as the context requires, references to the common parent are to the former common parent.
(3)
Continuing effect of end of separate tracking
—(i)
In general.
As the context may require, a current group determines which of its members are included in a loss subgroup on any testing date by taking into account the application of this section in the former group. See the example in § 1.1502-91(f)(2). For this purpose, corporations that are treated under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section as having been affiliated with the common parent of the former group for 5 consecutive years are also treated as having been affiliated with any other members that have been (or are treated as having been) affiliated with the common parent. The corporations are treated as having been affiliated with such other members for the same period of time that those members have been (or are treated as having been) affiliated with the common parent. If two or more corporations become members of the group at the same time, but paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to every such corporation, then immediately after the corporations become members of the group, the corporations to which paragraph (a)(1) of this section applied are treated as not having been previously affiliated, for purposes of applying this paragraph (a)(3), with the corporations to which paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section did not apply.
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (a)(3):

# Example.
(i) L has owned all the stock of L1 for three years. At the close of December 31, Year 1, the M group purchases all the L stock, and L and L1 become members of the M group. Other than the stock of L1, L has one asset (the L loss asset) with a net unrealized built-in loss of $200 on this date. L1 has one asset with a net unrealized built-in gain of $50 (the L1 gain asset). L and L1 do not compose a loss subgroup because they do not meet the five year affiliation requirement of § 1.1502-91(d)(2)(i). L is a new loss member, and M's purchase of L causes an
ownership change of L. At the close of December 31, Year 4, at a time when L1 has been affiliated with the M group for three years and has been affiliated with L for six years, the S group purchases all the M stock. On this date, the L loss asset has a net unrealized built-in loss of $300, the L1 gain asset has a net unrealized built-in gain of $80, and M, the common parent of the M group, has one asset with a net unrealized built-in gain of $200.
(ii) Paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies to L because L is a new loss member described in § 1.1502-94(a)(1)(ii) that has an ownership change upon becoming a member of the M group on December 31, Year 1. Accordingly, L is treated as having been affiliated with M for 5 consecutive years, and the L loss asset with a net unrealized built-in loss of $300 is included in the determination whether the M group has a net unrealized built-in loss.
(iii) The S group determines which of its members are included in a loss subgroup by taking into account application of paragraph (a) of this section in the M group. For this purpose, application of paragraph (a) of this section causes L to be treated as having been affiliated with M (or as having been a member of the M group) for 5 consecutive years as of January 1, Year 2. Therefore, the S group includes L in the determination whether the M subgroup acquired by S on December 31, Year 4, has a net unrealized built-in loss.
(iv) Because paragraph (a)(1) of this section applied to L when L became a member of the M group, but did not apply to L1, L is treated as not having been affiliated with L1 before L and L1 joined the M group. Also, L1 is not included in the determination whether the M subgroup has a net unrealized built-in loss because L1 has not been continuously affiliated with members of the M group for the five consecutive year period ending immediately before they become members of the S group. See § 1.1502-91(g)(2).
(4)
Special rule for testing period.
For purposes of determining the beginning of the testing period for a loss group, the member's (or loss subgroup's) net operating loss carryovers (or net unrealized built-in loss) described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section are considered to arise—
(i) In a case described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, in a taxable year that begins not earlier than the later of the day following the change date or the day that the member becomes a member of the group; and
(ii) In a case described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, in a taxable year that begins 3 years before the end of the 5 consecutive year period.
(5)
Limits on effects of end of separate tracking.
The rule contained in this paragraph (a) applies solely for purposes of §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-95 and this section (other than paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section (relating to the definition of pre-change attributes of a subsidiary)) and § 1.1502-98, and not for purposes of other provisions of the consolidated return regulations. However, the rule contained in this paragraph (a) does apply in §§ 1.1502-15(g), 1.1502-21(g) and 1.1502-22(g) for purposes of determining the composition of loss subgroups defined in § 1.1502-91(d). See also paragraph (c) of this section for the continuing effect of an ownership change with respect to pre-change attributes.
(b)
Ownership change of subsidiary
—(1)
Ownership change of a subsidiary because of options or plan or arrangement.
Notwithstanding § 1.1502-92, a subsidiary may have an ownership change for purposes of section 382 with respect to its attributes which a group or loss subgroup includes in making a determination under § 1.1502-91(c)(1) (relating to the definition of loss group) or § 1.1502-91(d) (relating to the definition of loss subgroup). The subsidiary has such an ownership change if it has an ownership change under the principles of § 1.1502-95(b) and section 382 and the regulations thereunder (determined on a separate entity basis by treating the subsidiary as not being a member of a consolidated group) in the event of—
(i) The deemed exercise under § 1.382-4(d) of an option or options (other than an option with respect to stock of the common parent) held by a person (or persons acting pursuant to a plan or arrangement) to acquire more than 20 percent of the stock of the subsidiary; or
(ii) An increase by 1 or more 5-percent shareholders, acting pursuant to a plan or arrangement to avoid an ownership change of a subsidiary, in their percentage ownership interest in the subsidiary by more than 50 percentage points during the testing period of the subsidiary through the acquisition (or deemed acquisition pursuant to § 1.382-4(d)) of ownership interests in the subsidiary and in higher-tier members with respect to the subsidiary.
(2)
Effect of the ownership change
—(i)
In general.
If a subsidiary has an ownership change under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the amount of consolidated taxable income for any post-change year that may be offset by the pre-change losses of the subsidiary shall not exceed the section 382 limitation for the subsidiary. For purposes of this limitation, the value of the subsidiary is determined solely by reference to the value of the subsidiary's stock.
(ii)
Pre-change losses.
The pre-change losses of a subsidiary are—
(A) Its allocable part of any consolidated net operating loss which is attributable to it under § 1.1502-21(b) (determined on the last day of the consolidated return year that includes the change date) that is not carried back and absorbed in a taxable year prior to the year including the change date;
(B) Its net operating loss carryovers that arose (or are treated under § 1.1502-21(c) as having arisen) in a SRLY; and
(C) Its recognized built-in loss with respect to its separately computed net unrealized built-in loss, if any, determined on the change date.
(3)
Coordination with §§ 1.1502-91, 1.1502-92, and 1.1502-94.
If an increase in percentage ownership interest causes an ownership change with respect to an attribute under this paragraph (b) and under § 1.1502-92 on the same day, the ownership change is considered to occur only under § 1.1502-92 and not under this paragraph (b). See § 1.1502-94 for anti-duplication rules relating to value.
(4)
Example.
The following example illustrates paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section:

# Example. Plan to avoid an ownership change of a subsidiary.
(i) L owns all the stock of L1, L1 owns all the stock of L2, L2 owns all the stock of L3, and L3 owns all the stock of L4. The L group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 2. L has assets other than its L1 stock with a value of $900. L1, L2, and L3 own no assets other than their L2, L3, and L4 stock. L4 has assets with a value of $100. During Year 2, A, B, C, and D, acting pursuant to a plan to avoid an ownership change of L4, acquire the following ownership interests in the members of the L loss group: (A) on September 11, Year 2, A acquires 20 percent of the L1 stock from L and B acquires 20 percent of the L2 stock from L1; and (B) on September 20, Year 2, C acquires 20 percent of the stock of L3 from L2 and D acquires 20 percent of the stock of L4 from L3.
(ii) The acquisitions by A, B, C, and D pursuant to the plan have increased their respective percentage ownership interests in L4 by approximately 10, 13, 16, and 20 percentage points, for a total of approximately 59 percentage points during the testing period. This more than 50 percentage point increase in the percentage ownership interest in L4 causes an ownership change of L4 under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(c)
Continuing effect of an ownership change.
A loss corporation (or loss subgroup) that is subject to a limitation under section 382 with respect to its pre-change losses continues to be subject to the limitation regardless of whether it becomes a member or ceases to be a member of a consolidated group. See § 1.382-5(d) (relating to successive ownership changes and absorption of a section 382 limitation).
(d)
Losses reattributed under § 1.1502-36(d)(6)
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (d) contains rules relating to net operating carryovers, capital loss carryovers, and deferred deductions (collectively, loss or losses) that are reattributed to the common parent under § 1.1502-36(d)(6). References in this paragraph (d) to a subsidiary are references to the subsidiary (or lower-tier subsidiary) whose loss is reattributed to the common parent.
(2)
Deemed section 381(a) transaction.
Under § 1.1502-36(d)(6)(iv)(A), the common parent succeeds to the reattributed losses as if the losses were succeeded to in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. In general, §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-95, this section, and § 1.1502-98 are applied to the reattributed losses in accordance with that characterization. See generally, § 1.382-2(a)(1)(ii) (relating to distributor or transferor loss corporations in transactions under section 381), § 1.1502-1(f)(4) (relating to the definition of predecessor and successor) and § 1.1502-91(j) (relating to predecessor and successor corporations). For example, if the reattributed loss is a pre-change attribute subject to a section 382 limitation, it remains subject to that limitation following the reattribution. In certain cases, the limitation applicable
to the reattributed loss is zero unless the common parent apportions all or part of the limitation to itself. (See paragraph (d)(4) of this section.)
(3)
Rules relating to owner shifts
—(i)
In general.
Any owner shift of the subsidiary (including any deemed owner shift resulting from section 382(g)(4)(D) or 382(l)(3)) in connection with the disposition of the stock of the subsidiary is not taken into account in determining whether there is an ownership change with respect to the reattributed loss. However, any owner shift with respect to the successor corporation that is treated as continuing in existence under § 1.382-2(a)(1)(ii) must be taken into account for such purpose if such owner shift is effected by the reattribution and an owner shift of the stock of the subsidiary not held directly or indirectly by the common parent would have been taken into account if such shift had occurred immediately before the reattribution. See paragraph (d)(3)(ii)
Example 2
of this section.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (d)(3):

# Example 1. No owner shift for reattributed loss.
(i)
Facts.
P, the common parent of a consolidated group, owns 60% of the stock of L, and B owns the remaining 40%. L has a net operating loss carryover of $100 from year 1 that it carries over to years 2, 3, and 4. At the beginning of year 2, P purchases 40% of the L stock from B, which does not cause an ownership change of L. On December 31, year 3, P sells all of the L stock to M. Pursuant to § 1.1502-36(d)(6), P reattributes $10 of L's $100 net operating loss carryover to itself, and L carries $90 of its net operating loss carryover to its year 4.
(ii)
Analysis.
The sale of the L stock to M does not cause an owner shift that is taken into account in determining if there is an ownership change with respect to the $10 reattributed loss. Following the reattribution, § 1.1502-94(b) continues to apply to determine if there is an ownership change with respect to the $10 reattributed loss, until, under paragraph (a) of this section, the loss is treated as described in § 1.1502-91(c)(1)(i). In applying § 1.1502-94(b), the 40 percentage point increase by the P shareholders prior to the reattribution is taken into account. The sale of the L stock to M does cause an ownership change of L with respect to the $90 of its net operating loss that it carries over to year 4.

# Example 2. Owner shift for reattributed loss.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that P only purchases 20% of the L stock from B and sells 80% of the L stock to M. L is a new loss member, and, under § 1.1502-94(b)(1), an owner shift of the stock of L not held directly or indirectly by the common parent (the 20% of L stock still held by B) would have been taken into account if such shift had occurred immediately before the reattribution. Following the reattribution, § 1.1502-94(b) continues to apply to determine if there is an ownership change with respect to the $10 reattributed loss, until, under paragraph (a) of this section, the loss is treated as described in § 1.1502-91(c)(1)(i). With respect to the $10 reattributed loss, the P shareholders have increased their percentage ownership interest by 40 percentage points. The P shareholders have increased their ownership interests by 20 percentage points as a result of P's purchase of stock from B, and, under § 1.382-2(a)(1)(ii), are treated as increasing their interests by an additional 20 percentage points as a result of the reattribution. (The acquisition of the L stock by M does not, however, effect an owner shift for the $10 of reattributed loss.) The sale of the L stock to M causes an ownership change of L with respect to the $90 of net operating loss that L carries over to Year 4.
(4)
Rules relating to the section 382 limitation
—(i)
Reattributed loss is a pre-change separate attribute of a new loss member.
If the reattributed loss is a pre-change separate attribute of a new loss member that is subject to a separate section 382 limitation prior to the disposition of subsidiary stock, the common parent's limitation with respect to that loss is zero, except to the extent that the common parent apportions to itself, under paragraph (d)(5) of this section, all or part of such limitation. A separate section 382 limitation is the limitation described in § 1.1502-94(b) that applies to a pre-change separate attribute.
(ii)
Reattributed loss is a pre-change subgroup attribute.
If the reattributed loss is a pre-change subgroup attribute subject to a subgroup section 382 limitation prior to the disposition of subsidiary stock, and, immediately after the reattribution, the common parent is not a member of the loss subgroup, the section 382 limitation with respect to that loss is zero, except to the extent that the common parent apportions to itself, under paragraph (d)(5) of this section, all or part of the subgroup section 382 limitation. See, however,
§ 1.1502-95(d)(3)
Example 6
, for an illustration of a case where the common parent, as successor to the subsidiary, is a member of the loss subgroup immediately after the reattribution.
(iii)
Potential application of section 382(l)(1).
In general, the value of the stock of the common parent is used to determine the section 382 limitation for an ownership change with respect to the reattributed loss that occurs at the time of, or after, the reattribution. For example, if the loss is a pre-change consolidated attribute, the value of the stock of the common parent is used to determine the section 382 limitation, and no adjustment to that value is required because of the deemed section 381(a) transaction. However, if the loss is a pre-change separate attribute of a new loss member (or is a pre-change attribute of a loss subgroup member and the common parent was not the loss subgroup parent immediately before the reattribution), the deemed section 381(a) transaction is considered to constitute a capital contribution with respect to the new loss member (or loss subgroup member) for purposes of section 382(l)(1). Accordingly, if that section applies because the deemed capital contribution is (or is considered under section 382(l)(1)(B) to be) part of a plan described in section 382(l)(1)(A), the value of the stock of the common parent after the deemed section 381(a) transaction must be adjusted to reflect the capital contribution. Ordinarily, this will require the value of the stock of the common parent to be reduced to an amount that represents the value of the stock of the subsidiary (or loss subgroup of which the subsidiary was a member) when the reattribution occurred.
(iv)
Duplication or omission of value.
In determining any section 382 limitation with respect to the reattributed loss and with respect to other pre-change losses, appropriate adjustments must be made so that value is not improperly omitted or duplicated as a result of the reattribution. For example, if the subsidiary has an ownership change upon its departure, and the common parent (as successor) has an ownership change with respect to the reattributed pre-change separate attribute upon its reattribution under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, proper adjustments must be made so that the value of the subsidiary is not taken into account more than once in determining the section 382 limitation for the reattributed loss and the loss that is not reattributed.
(v)
Special rule for continuity of business requirement.
If the reattributed loss is a pre-change attribute of new loss member and the reattribution occurs within the two-year period beginning on the change date, then, starting immediately after the reattribution, the continuity of business requirement of section 382(c)(1) is applied with respect to the business enterprise of the common parent. Similar principles apply if the reattributed loss is a pre-change subgroup attribute and, on the day after the reattribution, the common parent is not a member of the loss subgroup.
(5)
Election to reattribute section 382 limitation
—(i)
Effect of election.
The common parent may elect to apportion to itself all or part of any separate section 382 limitation or subgroup section 382 limitation to which the loss is subject immediately before the reattribution. However, no net unrealized built-in gain of the member (or loss subgroup) whose loss is reattributed can be apportioned to the common parent. The principles of § 1.1502-95(c) apply to the apportionment, treating, as the context requires, references to the former member as references to the common parent, and references to the consolidated section 382 limitation as references to the separate section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation) that is being apportioned. Thus, for example, the common parent can reattribute to itself all or part of the value element or adjustment element of the limitation, and any part of such element that is apportioned requires a corresponding reduction in such element of the separate section 382 limitation of the subsidiary whose loss is reattributed (or in the subgroup section 382 limitation if the reattributed loss is a pre-change subgroup attribute). Appropriate adjustments must be made to the separate section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation) for the consolidated return year in which the reattribution is made
to reflect that the reattributed loss is an attribute acquired by the common parent during the year in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. The election is made by the common parent as part of the election to reattribute the loss. See § 1.1502-36(e)(5)(x) for the time and manner of making the election.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (d)(5):

# Example 1. Consequence of apportionment.
(i) Facts. P, the common parent of a consolidated group, purchases all of the stock of L on December 31, year 1. L carries over a net operating loss arising in year 1 to each of the next 5 taxable years. The purchase of the L stock causes an ownership change of L, and results in a separate section 382 limitation of $10 for L's net operating loss carryover based on the value of the L stock. On July 2, year 3, P sells 30% of the L stock to A. Under § 1.1502-36(d)(6), P elects to reattribute to itself $110 of L's $200 net operating loss carryover. P also elects to apportion to itself $6 of the $10 value element of the separate section 382 limitation.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A)
P's separate section 382 limitation.
For the consolidated return years ending after December 31, year 3, P's separate section 382 limitation with respect to the reattributed net operating loss carryover is $6, adjusted as appropriate for any short taxable year, unused section 382 limitation, or other adjustment. For the P group's consolidated return year ending December 31, year 3, the separate section 382 limitation for L's net operating loss carryover is $8, the sum of $5 and $3. Five dollars of the limitation is the amount that bears the same relationship to $10 as the number of days in the period ending with the deemed section 381(a) transaction, 183 days, bears to 365. Three dollars of the limitation is the amount that bears the same relationship to $6 as the number of days in the period between July 3 and December 31, 182, bears to 365.
(B)
L's separate section 382 limitation.
For L's taxable years ending after December 31, year 3, L's separate section 382 limitation for its $90 of net operating loss carryover that was not reattributed to P is $4, adjusted as appropriate for any short taxable year, unused section 382 limitation, or other adjustment. For L's short taxable year ending December 31, year 3, the section 382 limitation for its $90 of net operating loss carryover is $2, the amount that bears the same relationship to $4 (the portion of the value element that was not apportioned to P), as the number of days during the short taxable year, 182 days, bears to 365. See § 1.382-5(c).

# Example 2. No apportionment required for consolidated pre-change attribute.
(i)
Facts.
P, the common parent of a consolidated group, forms L. For year 1, L has an operating loss of $70 that is not absorbed and is included in the group's consolidated net operating loss that is carried over to subsequent years. On January 1 of year 3, A buys all of the P stock and the P group has an ownership change. The consolidated section 382 limitation based on the value of the P stock is $10.
(ii)
Analysis.
On April 13 of year 4, P sells all of the stock of L to B and, under § 1.1502-36(d)(6), elects to reattribute to itself $45 of L's net operating loss carryover. Following the reattribution, the $45 portion of the year 1 net operating loss carryover retains its character as a pre-change consolidated attribute, and remains subject to so much of the $10 consolidated section 382 limitation as P does not elect to apportion to L under § 1.1502-95(c).
(e)
Time and manner of making election under § 1.1502-91(d)(4)
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (e) prescribes the time and manner of making the election under § 1.1502-91(d)(4), relating to treating two or more corporations as treating the section 1504(a)(1) requirement of § 1.1502-91(d)(1)(ii) and (d)(2)(ii) as satisfied.
(2)
Election statement.
An election under § 1.1502-91(d)(4) must be made by the common parent. The election must be made in the form of the following statement: “THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER § 1.1502-91(d)(4) TO TREAT THE FOLLOWING CORPORATIONS AS MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF § 1.1502-91 (d)(1)(ii) AND (d)(2)(ii) IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEY BECAME MEMBERS OF THE GROUP.” [List separately the name of each corporation, its E.I.N., and the date that it became a member of the group]. If separate elections are being made for corporations that became members at different times or that were acquired from different affiliated groups, provide a separate statement and list for each election.
(3) The election statement must be filed by the common parent with its income tax return for the consolidated return year in which the members with respect to which the election is made become members of the group. Such election must be filed on or before the due date for such income tax return, including extensions.
(4) An election made under this paragraph (e) is irrevocable.

Special rules under section 382 for members under the jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or similar case. [Reserved]
§ 1.1502-98
Coordination with sections 383 and 163(j).
(a)
Coordination with section 383.
The rules contained in §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-96 also apply for purposes of section 383, with appropriate adjustments to reflect that section 383 applies to credits and net capital losses. For example, subgroups with respect to the carryover of general business credits, minimum tax credits, unused foreign tax, and net capital loss are determined by applying the principles of § 1.1502-91(d)(1). Similarly, in the case of net capital losses, general business credits, and excess foreign taxes that are pre-change attributes, § 1.383-1 applies the principles of §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-96. For example, if a loss group has an ownership change under § 1.1502-92 and has a carryover of unused general business credits from a pre-change consolidated return year to a post-change consolidated return year, the amount of the group's regular tax liability for the post-change year that can be offset by the carryover cannot exceed the consolidated section 383 credit limitation for that post-change year, determined by applying the principles of §§ 1.383-1(c)(6) and 1.1502-93 (relating to the computation of the consolidated section 382 limitation).
(b)
Application to section 163(j)
—(1)
In general.
The regulations in this part under sections 163(j), 382, and 383 of the Code contain rules governing the application of section 382 to interest expense governed by section 163(j) and the regulations in this part under section 163(j) of the Code. See, for example, §§ 1.163(j)-11(c), 1.382-2, 1.382-6, 1.382-7, and 1.383-1. The rules contained in §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-96 apply these rules to members of a consolidated group, or corporations that join or leave a consolidated group, with appropriate adjustments. For example, for purposes of §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-96, the term
loss group
includes a consolidated group in which any member is entitled to use a disallowed business interest expense carryforward, as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(11), that did not arise, and is not treated as arising, in a SRLY with regard to that group. Additionally, a reference to net operating loss carryovers in §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-96 generally includes a reference to disallowed business interest expense carryforwards. References to a loss or losses in §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-96 include references to disallowed business interest expense carryforwards or section 382 disallowed business interest carryforwards, within the meaning of § 1.382-2(a)(7), as appropriate.
(2)
Appropriate adjustments.
For purposes of applying the rules in §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-96 to current-year business interest expense (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(9)), disallowed business interest expense carryforwards, and section 382 disallowed business interest carryforwards, appropriate adjustments are required.
[T.D. 8824, 64 FR 36174, July 2, 1999, as amended by T.D. 8884, 65 FR 33760, May 25, 2000; T.D. 9905, 85 FR 56844, Sept. 14, 2020]
§ 1.1502-99
Effective/applicability dates.
(a)
In general.
Sections 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-96 and § 1.1502-98 apply to any testing date that is on or after June 25, 1999. Sections 1.1502-94 through 1.1502-96 also apply to a corporation that becomes a member of a group or ceases to be a member of a group (or loss subgroup) on or after June 25, 1999.
(b)
Reattribution of losses under § 1.1502-36(d)(6).
Section 1.1502-96(d) applies to reattributions of net operating loss carryovers, capital loss carryovers, and deferred deductions in connection with a transfer of stock to which § 1.1502-36 applies, and the election under § 1.1502-96(d)(5) (relating to an election to reattribute section 382 limitation) can be made with an election under § 1.1502-36(d)(6) to reattribute a loss to the common parent that is filed at the time and in the manner provided in § 1.1502-36(e)(5)(x).
(c)
Application to section 163(j)
—(1)
Sections 1.382-2 and 1.382-5.
To the extent the rules of §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-99 effectuate the rules of §§ 1.382-
2 and 1.382-5, the provisions apply with respect to ownership changes occurring on or after November 13, 2020. For loss corporations that have ownership changes occurring before November 13, 2020, see §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-99 as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2019. However, taxpayers and their related parties, within the meaning of sections 267(b) and 707(b)(1), may choose to apply the rules of §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-99 to the extent they apply the rules of §§ 1.382-2 and 1.382-5, to ownership changes occurring during a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, as well as consistently applying the rules of the §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-99 (to the extent they effectuate the rules of §§ 1.382-6 and 1.383-1), the section 163(j) regulations (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(37)), and, if applicable, §§ 1.263A-9, 1.263A-15, 1.381(c)(20)-1, 1.382-7, 1.469-9, 1.469-11, 1.704-1, 1.882-5, 1.1362-3, 1.1368-1, 1.1377-1, 1.1502-13, 1.1502-21, 1.1502-79, and 1.1504-4, to that taxable year.
(2)
Sections 1.382-6 and 1.383-1.
To the extent the rules of §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-98 effectuate the rules of §§ 1.382-6 and 1.383-1, the provisions apply with respect to ownership changes occurring during a taxable year beginning on or after November 13, 2020. For the application of these rules to an ownership change with respect to an ownership change occurring during a taxable year beginning before November 13, 2020, see §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-99 as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2019.
