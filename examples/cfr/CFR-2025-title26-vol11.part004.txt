Interest payments from noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporations.
If interest is received or accrued by a shareholder from a noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation (where the shareholder is a domestic corporation that is a United States shareholder of such noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation), the rules of paragraph (m)(2)(i) of this section apply in determining the portion of the interest payment that is from sources within the United States, except that the related party interest rules of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section do not apply.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (m).
(i)
Example 1
—(A)
Facts.
Controlled foreign corporation CFC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USP, a domestic corporation. In Year 1, CFC pays USP $300x of interest. CFC has no other expenses. In Year 1, CFC has $3,000x of assets that generate $650x of foreign source general category income and a $1,000x loan to an unrelated foreign person that generates $20x of foreign source passive category interest income. CFC also has a $4,000x loan to an unrelated United States person that generates $70x of U.S. source passive category interest income and $4,000x of assets that generate $100x of U.S. source general category income. CFC uses the asset method to allocate interest expense. The following chart summarizes CFC's assets and income:

Analysis.
Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, $90x of the related person interest payment is allocable to CFC's passive category income. Under paragraph (m)(2) of this section, $70x of USP's $90x of passive category interest income is from sources within the United States and $20x is from foreign sources. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(D) of this section, the remaining $210x of the related person interest payment is allocated to general category income. Under paragraph (m)(2) of this section, $120x of the remaining $210x of USP's interest income is treated as general category income from sources within the United States ($120x = $210x × $4,000x/$7,000x) and $90x is treated as general category income from foreign sources ($90x = $210x × $3,000x/$7,000x).
(ii)
Example 2.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (m)(3)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that CFC uses the modified gross income method to allocate interest expense. The first $90x of related person interest expense is allocated to passive category income in the same manner as in paragraph (m)(3)(i) of this section (
Example 1
), $70x to U.S. sources and $20x to foreign sources. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(D) of this section, the remaining $210x of the related person interest expense is allocated to CFC's general category income. Under paragraph (m)(2) of this section, $28x of the remaining $210x of USP's interest income is treated as general category income from U.S. sources ($28x = $210x × $100x/$750x) and $182x is treated as general category income from foreign sources ($182x = $210x × $650x/$750x).
(4)
Treatment of dividend payments
—(i)
Rule.
Any dividend or distribution treated as a dividend under this paragraph (m) (including an amount included in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(B)) that is received or accrued by a United States shareholder from a controlled foreign corporation, or any dividend that is received or accrued by a domestic corporation from a noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation with respect to which the shareholder is a United States shareholder, are treated as income in a separate category derived from sources within the United States in proportion to the ratio of the portion of the earnings and profits of the controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation in the corresponding separate category from U.S. sources to the total amount
of earnings and profits of the controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation in that separate category.
(ii)
Determination of earnings and profits from United States sources.
In order to determine the portions of earnings and profits from United States sources and from foreign sources within each separate category, related person interest shall be allocated to the United States source portion of income in a separate category by applying the rules of paragraph (m)(2) of this section. Other expenses shall be allocated by applying the rules of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section separately to the United States source income and the foreign source income in each category. For example, unrelated person interest expense that is allocated among categories of income based upon the relative amounts of assets in a category must be allocated between United States and foreign source income within each category by applying the rules of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section separately to United States source and foreign source assets in the separate category
(5)
Treatment of inclusions under sections 951(a)(1)(A), 951A and 1293
—(i)
Rule.
Any amount included in the gross income of a United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation under section 951(a)(1)(A), 951A, or in the gross income of a domestic corporation that is a United States shareholder of a noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation described in section 904(d)(2)(E)(i)(II) that is a qualified electing fund under section 1293 is treated as income subject to a separate category that is derived from sources within the United States to the extent the amount is attributable to income of the controlled foreign corporation or qualified electing fund, respectively, in the corresponding category of income from sources within the United States. In order to determine a controlled foreign corporation's taxable income and earnings and profits from sources within the United States in each separate category, the principles of paragraph (m)(4)(ii) of this section shall apply. In order to determine a qualified electing fund's earnings and profits from sources within the United States in each separate category, the principles of paragraph (m)(4)(ii) of this section shall apply, except that the related person interest rule of paragraph (m)(2) of this section shall not apply.
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (m)(5).
(A)
Facts.
Controlled foreign corporation CFC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of domestic corporation, USP. In Year 1, CFC earns $100x of subpart F foreign personal holding company income that is passive category income. Of this amount, $40x is derived from sources within the United States. CFC also earns $50x of subpart F general category income. None of this income is from sources within the United States. Assume that CFC pays no foreign taxes and has no expenses.
(B)
Analysis.
USP must include $150x in gross income under section 951(a). Of this amount, $60x is foreign source passive category income to USP, $40x is U.S. source passive category income to USP, and $50x is foreign source general category income to USP.
(6)
Treatment of section 78 amount.
For purposes of treating taxes deemed paid by a taxpayer under section 960 as a dividend under section 78, taxes that are paid or accrued with respect to United States source income in a separate category shall be treated as United States source income in that separate category.
(7)
Coordination with treaties
—(i)
Rule.
If any amount of income derived from a United States-owned foreign corporation, as defined in section 904(h)(6), would be treated as derived from sources within the United States under section 904(h) and this paragraph (m) and, pursuant to an income tax convention with the United States, the taxpayer chooses to avail itself of benefits of the convention that treat that amount as arising from sources outside the United States under a rule explicitly treating the income as foreign source, then that amount will be treated as foreign source income. However, sections 904 (a), (b), (c), (d), (f), and (g), 907, and 960 shall be applied separately to amounts described in the preceding sentence with respect to each treaty under which the taxpayer has claimed
benefits and, within each treaty, to each separate category of income.
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (m)(7).
(A)
Facts.
Controlled foreign corporation CFC is incorporated in Country A and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USP, a domestic corporation. In Year 1, CFC earns $80x of general category foreign base company sales income in Country A and $40x of passive category U.S. source interest income. CFC incurs $20x of expenses attributable to its sales business. CFC pays USP $40x of interest that is allocated to CFC's U.S. source passive category income under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section and so is U.S. source passive category income to USP under paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (m)(2) of this section. Assume that earnings and profits equal net income. All of CFC's net income of $60x is subpart F income includible in USP's gross income under section 951(a)(1). For Year 1, USP also has $100x of foreign source passive category income derived from investments in Country B. Pursuant to section 904(h)(3) and paragraph (m)(2) of this section, the $40x interest payment from CFC is U.S. source income to USP because it is attributable to U.S. source interest income of CFC. The United States-Country A income tax treaty, however, treats all interest payments by residents of Country A as Country A sourced and USP elects to apply the treaty.
(B)
Analysis.
Pursuant to section 904(h)(10) and this paragraph (m)(7), the entire interest payment will be treated as foreign source income to USP. USP thus has $60x of foreign source general category income, $40x of foreign source Country A treaty category passive income from CFC, and $100x of foreign source passive category income.
(n)
Order of application of section 904(d) and (h).
In order to apply the rules of this section, § 1.904-4 shall first be applied to the controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation to determine the amount of income and earnings and profits derived by the controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation in each separate category. The income and earnings and profits in each separate category that are from United States sources shall then be determined. Section 904(d)(3), (d)(4), and (h) and this section are then applied for purposes of characterizing and sourcing income received, accrued, or included by a United States shareholder of the foreign corporation that is attributable or allocable to income or earnings and profits of the foreign corporation.
(o)
Applicability dates.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (o), this section is applicable for taxable years that both begin after December 31, 2017, and end on or after December 4, 2018. Paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (vi) of this section are applicable for taxable years of foreign corporations ending on or after October 1, 2019, and taxable years of United States persons ending on or after October 1, 2019. For taxable years of foreign corporations ending before October 1, 2019, and taxable years of United States persons ending before October 1, 2019, a taxpayer may apply such provisions to the last taxable year of a foreign corporation beginning before January 1, 2018, and each subsequent taxable year of the foreign corporation, and to taxable years of United States shareholders in which or with which such taxable years of the foreign corporation end, provided that the taxpayer and United States persons that are related (within the meaning of section 267 or 707) to the taxpayer consistently apply such provisions with respect to all foreign corporations. For taxable years of foreign corporations ending before October 1, 2019, and taxable years of United States persons ending before October 1, 2019, where the taxpayer does not apply the provisions of paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (vi) of this section, see paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (vi) of this section as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1, as revised April 1, 2020.

§ 1.904-6
Allocation and apportionment of foreign income taxes.
(a)
In general.
The amount of foreign income taxes paid or accrued with respect to a separate category (as defined in § 1.904-5(a)(4)(v)) of income (including U.S. source income assigned to the separate category) includes only those foreign income taxes that are allocated and apportioned to the separate category under the rules of § 1.861-20 (as modified by this section). In applying the foreign tax credit limitation under sections 904(a) and (d) to general category income described in section 904(d)(2)(A)(ii) and § 1.904-4(d), foreign source income in the general category is a statutory grouping. However, general category income is the residual grouping of income for purposes of assigning foreign income taxes to separate categories. In addition, in determining the numerator of the foreign tax credit limitation under sections 904(a) and (d), where U.S. source income is the residual grouping, the amount of foreign income taxes paid or accrued for which a deduction is allowed, for example, under section 901(k)(7), with respect to foreign source income in a separate category includes only those foreign income taxes that are allocated and apportioned to foreign source income in the separate category under the rules of § 1.861-20 (as modified by this section). For purposes of this section, unless otherwise stated, terms have the same meaning as provided in § 1.861-20(b). For examples illustrating the application of this section, see § 1.861-20(g).
(b)
Assigning an item of foreign gross income to a separate category.
For purposes of assigning an item of foreign gross income to a separate category or categories (or foreign source income in a separate category) under § 1.861-20, the rules of this paragraph (b) apply.
(1)
Base differences.
Any item of foreign gross income that is attributable to a base difference described in § 1.861-20(d)(2)(ii)(B) is assigned to the separate category described in section 904(d)(2)(H)(i), and to foreign source income in that category.
(2)
Disregarded payments
—(i)
In general
—(A)
Assignment of foreign gross income.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, if a taxpayer that is an individual or a domestic corporation includes an item of foreign gross income by reason of the receipt of a disregarded payment by a foreign branch or foreign branch owner (as those terms are defined in § 1.904-4(f)(3)), or a non-branch taxable unit, the foreign gross income item is assigned to a separate category under § 1.861-20(d)(3)(v).
(B)
Definition of non-branch taxable unit.
The term
non-branch taxable unit
means a person or interest that is described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B)(
1
) or (
2
) of this section, respectively.
(
1
)
Persons.
A non-branch taxable unit described in this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B)(
1
) means a person that is not otherwise a foreign branch owner and that is a U.S. individual, a domestic corporation, or a foreign or domestic partnership (or other pass-through entity, as defined in § 1.904-5(a)(4)) an interest in which is owned, directly or indirectly through one or more other partnerships (or other pass-through entities), by a U.S. individual or a domestic corporation.
(
2
)
Interests.
A non-branch taxable unit described in this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B)(
2
) means an interest of a foreign branch owner or an interest of a person described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B)(
1
) of this section that is not otherwise a foreign branch, and that is either a disregarded entity or a branch, as defined in § 1.267A-5(a)(2), including a branch described in § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(iv)(A)(
3
) (modified by substituting the term “person” for “controlled foreign corporation”).
(ii)
Foreign branch group contributions
—(A)
In general.
If a taxpayer includes an item of foreign gross income by reason of a foreign branch group contribution, the foreign gross income is assigned to the foreign branch category, or, in the case of a foreign branch owner that is a partnership, to the partnership's general category income that is attributable to the foreign branch. See, however, §§ 1.861-20(d)(3)(v)(C)(
2
), 1.960-1(d)(3)(ii)(A), and 1.960-1(e) for rules providing that foreign income tax on a disregarded payment that is a contribution from a controlled foreign corporation to a taxable
unit is assigned to the residual grouping and cannot be deemed paid under section 960.
(B)
Foreign branch group contribution.
A foreign branch group contribution is a contribution (as defined in § 1.861-20(d)(3)(v)(E)) made by a member of a foreign branch owner group to a member of a foreign branch group that the payor owns, made by a member of a foreign branch group to another member of that group that the payor owns, or made by a member of a foreign branch group to a member of a different foreign branch group that the payor owns. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B), the terms
foreign branch group
and
foreign branch owner group
have the meanings provided in § 1.904-4(f)(3).
(c)
Allocating and apportioning deductions.
For purposes of applying § 1.861-20(e) to allocate and apportion deductions allowed under foreign law to foreign gross income in the separate categories, before undertaking the steps outlined in § 1.861-20(e), foreign gross income in the passive category is first reduced by any related person interest expense that is allocated to the income under the principles of section 954(b)(5) and § 1.904-5(c)(2)(ii)(C). In allocating and apportioning expenses not specifically allocated under foreign law, the principles of foreign law are applied only after taking into account the reduction of passive income by the application of section 954(b)(5). In allocating and apportioning expenses when foreign law does not provide rules for the allocation or apportionment of expenses, losses or other deductions to particular items of foreign gross income, then the principles of section 954(b)(5), in addition to the principles of the section 861 regulations (as defined in § 1.861-8(a)(1)), apply to allocate and apportion expenses, losses or other foreign law deductions to foreign gross income after reduction of passive income by the amount of related person interest expense allocated to passive income under section 954(b)(5) and § 1.904-5(c)(2)(ii)(C).
(d)
Apportionment of taxes for purposes of applying the high-tax income tests.
If taxes have been allocated and apportioned to passive income under the rules of paragraph (a) this section, the taxes must further be apportioned to the groups of income described in § 1.904-4(c)(3) through (5) for purposes of determining if the group is high-taxed income that is recharacterized as income in another separate category under the rules of § 1.904-4(c). See also § 1.954-1(c)(1)(iii)(B) (defining a single item of passive category foreign personal holding company income by reference to the grouping rules under § 1.904-4(c)(3) through (5)). Taxes are related to income in a particular group under the same rules as those in paragraph (a) of this section except that those rules are applied by apportioning foreign income taxes to the groups described in § 1.904-4(c)(3) through (5) instead of separate categories.
(e)
Allocation and apportionment of deemed paid taxes and certain creditable foreign tax expenditures
—(1)
Taxes deemed paid under section 960(a) or (d).
If a domestic corporation that is a United States shareholder includes any amount in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A) or 951A(a), any foreign tax deemed paid with respect to such amount under section 960(a) or (d) is allocated to the separate category to which the inclusion is assigned.
(2)
Taxes deemed paid under section 960(b)(1).
If a domestic corporation that is a United States shareholder receives a distribution of previously taxed earnings and profits from a first-tier corporation that is excluded from the domestic corporation's income under section 959(a) and § 1.959-1, any foreign tax deemed paid under section 960(b)(1) with respect to such distribution is allocated to the same separate category as the annual PTEP account and PTEP group (as defined in § 1.960-3(c)) from which the distribution is made.
(3)
Taxes deemed paid under section 960(b)(2).
If a controlled foreign corporation receives a distribution of previously taxed earnings and profits from an immediately lower-tier corporation that is excluded from such controlled foreign corporation's gross income under section 959(b) and § 1.959-2, any foreign tax deemed paid under section 960(b)(2) with respect to such distribution is allocated to the same separate category as the annual PTEP account and PTEP group (as defined in § 1.960-
3(c)) from which the distribution is made.
See also
§ 1.960-3(c)(2).
(4)
Creditable foreign tax expenditures
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, creditable foreign tax expenditures (CFTEs) allocated to a partner under § 1.704-1(b)(4)(viii)(
a
) are allocated for purposes of this section to the same separate category as the separate category to which the taxes were allocated in the hands of the partnership under the rules of paragraph (a) of this section.
(ii)
Foreign branch category.
CFTEs allocated to a partner in a partnership under § 1.704-1(b)(4)(viii)(
a
) are allocated and apportioned to the foreign branch category of the partner to the extent that:
(A) The CFTEs are allocated and apportioned by the partnership under the rules of paragraph (a) of this section to the general category;
(B) In the hands of the partnership, the CFTEs are related to general category income attributable to a foreign branch (as described in § 1.904-4(f)(2)) under the principles of paragraph (a) of this section; and
(C) The partner's distributive share of the income described in paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(B) of this section is foreign branch category income of the partner under § 1.904-4(f)(1)(i)(B).
(f)
Treatment of certain foreign income taxes paid or accrued by United States shareholders.
Some or all of the foreign gross income of a United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation, or of a U.S. person that owns the United States shareholder (the “U.S. owner”), that is attributable to foreign law inclusion regime income with respect to a foreign law CFC described in § 1.861-20(d)(3)(iii) or foreign law pass-through income from a reverse hybrid described in § 1.861-20(d)(3)(i)(C) is assigned to the section 951A category if, were the controlled foreign corporation the taxpayer that recognizes the foreign gross income, the foreign gross income would be assigned to the controlled foreign corporation's tested income group (as defined in § 1.960-1(b)(33)) within the general category to which an inclusion under section 951A is attributable. The amount of the United States shareholder's, or the U.S. owner's, foreign gross income that is assigned to the section 951A category (or a specified separate category associated with the section 951A category) is based on the inclusion percentage (as defined in § 1.960-2(c)(2)) of the United States shareholder. For example, if a United States shareholder has an inclusion percentage of 60 percent, then 60 percent of the foreign gross income of a United States shareholder that would be assigned (under § 1.861-20(d)(3)(iii)) to the tested income group within the general category income of a reverse hybrid that is a controlled foreign corporation to which an inclusion under section 951A is attributable is assigned to the section 951A category or the specified separate category for income resourced under a tax treaty, and not to the general category.
(g)
Applicability dates.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (g), this section applies to taxable years that begin after December 31, 2019. Paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies to taxable years that begin after December 31, 2019, and end on or after November 2, 2020.
[T.D. 8214, 53 FR 27029, July 18, 1988, as amended by T.D. 8412, 57 FR 20652, May 14, 1992; T.D. 9141, 69 FR 43308, July 20, 2004; T.D. 9260, 71 FR 24533, Apr. 25, 2006; T.D. 9882, 84 FR 69098, Dec. 17, 2019; T.D. 9922, 85 FR 72059, Nov. 12, 2020; 86 FR 54368, Oct. 1, 2021; T.D. 9959, 87 FR 363, Jan. 4, 2022]
§ 1.904-7
Transition rules.
(a)
Characterization of distributions and section 951(a)(1) (A) (ii) and (iii) and (B) inclusions of earnings of a controlled foreign corporation accumulated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987, during taxable years of both the payor controlled foreign corporation and the recipient which begin after December 31, 1986
—(1)
Distributions and section 951(a)(1) (A) (ii) and (iii) and (B) inclusions.
Earnings accumulated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987, by a foreign corporation that was a controlled foreign corporation when such earnings were accumulated are characterized in that foreign corporation's hands under section 904(d)(1)(A) (separate limitation interest income) or section 904(d)(1)(E) (general limitation income) (prior to their amendment by the Tax Reform Act of 1986
(the Act)) after application of the de minimis rule of former section 904(d)(3)(C) (prior to its amendment by the Act). When, in a taxable year after the effective date of the Act, earnings and profits attributable to such income are distributed to, or included in the gross income of, a United States shareholder under section 951(a)(1) (A) (ii) or (iii) or (B) (hereinafter in this section “inclusions”), the ordering rules of section 904(d)(3)(D) and § 1.904-5(c)(4) shall be applied in determining initially the character of the income of the distributee or United States shareholder. Thus, a proportionate amount of a distribution described in this paragraph initially will be characterized as separate limitation interest income in the hands of the distributee based on the ratio of the separate limitation interest earnings and profits out of which the dividend was paid to the total earnings and profits out of which the dividend was paid. The distribution or inclusions must then be recharacterized in the hands of the distributee or United States shareholder on the basis of the following principles:
(i) Distributions and inclusions that initially are characterized as separate limitation interest income shall be treated as passive income;
(ii) Distributions and inclusions that initially are characterized as old general limitation income shall be treated as general limitation income, unless the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the distribution or inclusion is attributable to:
(A) Earnings and profits accumulated with respect to shipping income, as defined in section 904(d)(2)(D) and § 1.904-4(f); or
(B) In the case of a financial services entity, earnings and profits accumulated with respect to financial services income, as defined in section 904(d)(2)(C)(ii) and § 1.904-4(e)(1); or
(C) Earnings and profits accumulated with respect to high withholding tax interest, as defined in section 904(d)(2)(B) and § 1.904-4(d).
(2)
Limitation on establishing the character of earnings and profits.
In order for a taxpayer to establish that distributions or inclusions that are attributable to general limitation earnings and profits of a particular taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987, are attributable to shipping, financial services or high withholding tax interest earnings and profits, the taxpayer must establish the amounts of foreign taxes paid or accrued with respect to income attributable to those earnings and profits that are to be treated as taxes paid or accrued with respect to shipping, financial services or high withholding tax interest income, as the case may be, under section 904(d)(2)(I). Conversely, in order for a taxpayer to establish the amounts of general limitation taxes paid or accrued in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987, that are to be treated as taxes paid or accrued with respect to shipping, financial services or high withholding tax interest income, as the case may be, the taxpayer must establish the amount of any distributions or inclusions that are attributable to shipping, financial services or high withholding tax interest earnings and profits. For purposes of establishing the amounts of general limitation taxes that are to be treated as taxes paid or accrued with respect to shipping, financial services or high withholding tax interest income, the principles of § 1.904-6 shall be applied.
(b)
Application of look-through rules to distributions (including deemed distributions) and payments by an entity to a recipient when one's taxable year begins before January 1, 1987 and the other's taxable year begins after December 31, 1986
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph provides rules relating to the application of section 904(d)(3) to payments made by a controlled foreign corporation or other entity to which the look-through rules apply during its taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, but received in a taxable year of the recipient beginning before January 1, 1987. The paragraph also provides rules relating to distributions (including deemed distributions) or payments made by a controlled foreign corporation to which section 904(d)(3) (as in effect before the Act) applies during its taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987, and received in a taxable year of the recipient beginning after December 31, 1986.
(2)
Payor of interest, rents, or royalties is subject to the Act and recipient is not
subject to the Act.
If interest, rents, or royalties are paid or accrued on or after the start of the payor's first taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 1987, but prior to the start of the recipient's first taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 1987, such interest, rents, or royalties shall initially be characterized in accordance with section 904(d)(3) and § 1.904-5. To the extent that interest payments in the hands of the recipient are initially characterized as passive income under these rules, they will be treated as separate limitation interest in the hands of the recipient. To the extent that rents or royalties in the hands of the recipient are initially characterized as passive income under these rules, they will be recharacterized as general limitation income in the hands of the recipient.
(3)
Recipient of interest, rents, or royalties is subject to the Act and payor is not subject to the Act.
If interest, rents, or royalties are paid or accrued before the start of the payor's first taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 1987, but on or after the start of the recipient's first taxable year beginning after January 1, 1987, the income in the recipient's hands shall be initially characterized in accordance with former section 904(d)(3) (prior to its amendment by the Act). To the extent interest income is characterized as separate limitation interest income under these rules, that income shall be recharacterized as passive income in the hands of the recipient. Rents or royalties will be characterized as general limitation income.
(4)
Recipient of dividends and subpart F inclusions is subject to the Act and payor is not subject to the Act.
If dividends are paid or accrued or section 951(a)(1) inclusions occur before the start of the first taxable year of a controlled foreign corporation beginning on or after January 1, 1987, but on or after the start of the first taxable year of the distributee or United States shareholder beginning on or after January 1, 1987, the dividends or section 951(a)(1) inclusions in the hands of the distributee or United States shareholder shall be initially characterized in accordance with former section 904(d)(3) (including the ordering rules of section 904(d)(3)(A). Therefore, under former section 904(d)(3)(A), dividends are considered to be paid or derived first from earnings attributable to separate limitation interest income. To the extent the dividend or section 951(a)(1) inclusion is initially characterized under these rules as separate limitation interest income in the hands of the distributee or United States shareholder, the dividend or section 951(a)(1) inclusion shall be recharacterized as passive income in the hands of the distributee or United States shareholder. The portion, if any, of the dividend or section 951(a)(1) inclusion that is not characterized as passive income shall be characterized according to the rules in paragraph (a) of this section. Therefore, a taxpayer may establish that income that would otherwise be characterized as general limitation income is shipping or financial services income. Rules comparable to the rules contained in section 904(d)(2)(I) shall be applied for purposes of characterizing foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to distributions and section 951(a)(1) inclusions covered by this paragraph (b)(4).
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (b).

# Example 1.
P is a domestic corporation that is a fiscal year taxpayer (July 1-June 30). S, a controlled foreign corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of P and has a calendar taxable year. On June l, 1987, S makes a $100 interest payment to P. Because the payment is made after January 1, 1987 (the first day of S's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986), the look-through rules of section 904(d)(3) apply to characterize the payment made by S. To the extent, however, that the interest payment to P is allocable to passive income earned by S, the payment will be included in P's separate limitation for interest as provided in former section 904(d)(1)(A).

# Example 2.
P is a domestic corporation that is a calendar year taxpayer. S, a controlled foreign corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of P and has a July 1-June 30 taxable year. On June 1, 1987, S makes a $100 interest payment to P. Because the payment is made prior to July l, 1987 (the first day of S's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986), the look-through rules of section 904(d)(3) do not apply. Assume that, under
former section 904(d)(3), the interest payment would be characterized as separate limitation interest income. For purposes of determining P's foreign tax credit limitation, the interest payment will be passive income as provided in section 904(d)(1)(A).

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example
2 except that on June 1, 1987, S makes a $100 dividend distribution to P. Because the dividend is paid prior to July l, 1987 (the first day of S's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986), the look-through rules of section 904(d)(3) do not apply. Assume that, under former section 904(d)(3), S's earnings and profits for the taxable year ending June 30, 1987, consist of $200 of earnings attributable to general limitation income and $75 of earnings attributable to separate limitation interest income. The portion of the dividend that is attributable to S's separate limitation interest and is treated as separate limitation interest income under former section 904(d)(3) is $75. The remaining $25 of the dividend is treated as general limitation income under former section 904(d)(3). For purposes of determining P's foreign tax credit limitation, $75 of the dividend will be recharacterized as passive income. The remaining $25 of the dividend will be characterized as general limitation income, unless P can establish that the general limitation portion is attributable to shipping or financial services income.
(c)
Installment sales.
If income is received or accrued by any person on or after the effective date of the Act (as applied to such person) that is attributable to a disposition of property by such person with regard to which section 453 or section 453A applies (installment sale treatment), and the disposition occurred prior to the effective date of the Act, that income shall be characterized according to the rules of §§ 1.904-4 through 1.904-7.
(d)
Special effective date for high withholding tax interest earned by persons with respect to qualified loans described in section 1201(e)(2) of the Act.
For purposes of characterizing interest received or accrued by any person, the definition of high withholding tax interest in § 1.904-4(d) shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, except as provided in section 1201(e)(2) of the Act.
(e)
Treatment of certain recapture income.
Except as otherwise provided, if income is subject to recapture under section 585(c), the income shall be general limitation income. If the income is recaptured by a taxpayer that is a financial services entity, the entity may treat the income as financial services income if the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the deduction to which the recapture amount is attributable is allocable to financial services income. If the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the deduction to which the recapture amount is attributable is allocable to high-withholding tax interest income, the taxpayer may treat the income as high-withholding tax interest.
(f)
Treatment of non-look-through pools of a noncontrolled section 902 corporation or a controlled foreign corporation in post-2002 taxable years
—(1)
Definition of non-look-through pools.
The term
non-look-through pools
means the pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings (as defined in § 1.902-1(a)(9)) that were accumulated, and post-1986 foreign income taxes (as defined in § 1.902-1(a)(8)) paid, accrued, or deemed paid, in and after the first taxable year in which the foreign corporation had a domestic shareholder (as defined in § 1.902-1(a)(1)) but before any such shareholder was eligible for look-through treatment with respect to dividends from the foreign corporation.
(2)
Treatment of non-look-through pools of a noncontrolled section 902 corporation.
Any undistributed earnings in the non-look-through pool that were accumulated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003, by a noncontrolled section 902 corporation as of the last day of the corporation's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2003, shall be treated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002, as if they were accumulated during a period when a dividend paid by the noncontrolled section 902 corporation to a domestic shareholder would have been eligible for look-through treatment under section 904(d)(4) and § 1.904-5. Post-1986 foreign income taxes paid, accrued or deemed paid with respect to such earnings shall be treated as if they were paid, accrued or deemed paid during a period when the related earnings were eligible for look-through treatment. Any such earnings and taxes in the non-look-through pools shall constitute the opening balance of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation's
pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes on the first day of the foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, in accordance with the rules of paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
(3)
Treatment of non-look-through pools of a controlled foreign corporation.
A controlled foreign corporation may have non-look-through pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes that were accumulated and paid in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2003, in which it was a noncontrolled section 902 corporation. Any such undistributed earnings in the non-look-through pool as of the last day of the controlled foreign corporation's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2003, shall be treated in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2003, as if they were accumulated during a period when a dividend paid by the controlled foreign corporation out of such earnings, or an amount included in the gross income of a United States shareholder under section 951 that is attributable to such earnings, would have been eligible for look-through treatment. Any post-1986 foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed paid with respect to such earnings shall be treated in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2003, as if they were paid, accrued, or deemed paid during a period when a dividend or inclusion out of such earnings would have been eligible for look-through treatment. Any such undistributed earnings and taxes in the non-look-through pools shall be added to the pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes of the controlled foreign corporation in the appropriate separate categories on the first day of the controlled foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, in accordance with the rules of paragraph (f)(4) of this section. Similar rules shall apply to characterize any previously-taxed earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1)(A) that are attributable to earnings in the non-look-through pool.
(4)
Substantiation of look-through character of undistributed earnings and taxes in a non-look-through pool
—(i)
Reconstruction of earnings and taxes pools.
In order to substantiate the look-through characterization of undistributed earnings and taxes in a non-look-through pool under section 904(d)(4) and § 1.904-5, the taxpayer shall make a reasonable, good-faith effort to reconstruct the non-look-through pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes (and previously-taxed earnings and profits, if any) on a look-through basis for each year in the non-look-through period, beginning with the first taxable year in which post-1986 undistributed earnings were accumulated in the non-look-through pool. Reconstruction shall be based on reasonably available books and records and other relevant information, and it must account for earnings distributed and taxes deemed paid in these years as if they were distributed and deemed paid pro rata from the amounts that were added to the non-look-through pools during the non-look-through period.
(ii)
Safe harbor method.
A taxpayer that was eligible for look-through treatment with respect to a distribution from the foreign corporation in the taxpayer's first taxable year ending after the first day of the foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, may allocate the undistributed earnings and taxes in the non-look-through pools to the foreign corporation's look-through pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in other separate categories on the first day of the foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, in the same percentages as the taxpayer properly characterizes the stock of the foreign corporation in the separate categories for purposes of apportioning the taxpayer's interest expense in its first taxable year ending after the first day of the foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, under § 1.861-12T(c)(3) or § 1.861-12(c)(4), as the case may be. If the modified gross income method described in § 1.861-9T(j) is used to apportion interest expense of the foreign corporation in its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, the taxpayer must allocate the undistributed earnings and taxes in the non-
look-through pools to the foreign corporation's look-through pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes based on an average of the foreign corporation's modified gross income ratios for the foreign corporation's taxable years beginning in 2003 and 2004. A taxpayer may also use the safe harbor method described in this paragraph (f)(4)(ii) to allocate to separate categories any previously-taxed earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1)(A) that are attributable to the non-look-through pool. A taxpayer may choose to use the safe harbor method on either a timely filed or amended tax return or during an audit. However, a taxpayer that uses the safe harbor method on an amended return or in the course of an audit must make appropriate adjustments to eliminate any duplicate benefits arising from application of the safe harbor method to taxable years that are not open for assessment. A taxpayer's choice to use the safe harbor method is evidenced by employing the method. The taxpayer need not file any separate statement.
(iii)
Inadequate substantiation.
If a taxpayer does not use, or is ineligible to use, the safe harbor method described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section and the Commissioner determines that the look-through characterization of earnings and taxes in the non-look-through pools cannot reasonably be determined based on the available information, the Commissioner shall allocate the undistributed earnings and taxes in the non-look-through pools to the foreign corporation's passive category.
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (f)(4):

# Example 1.
P, a domestic corporation, has owned 50 percent of the voting stock of S, a foreign corporation, at all times since January 1, 1987, and S has been a noncontrolled section 902 corporation with respect to P since that date. P and S use the calendar year as their U.S. taxable year. The first year in which post-1986 undistributed earnings were accumulated in the non-look-through pool of S was 1987. As of December 31, 2002, S had 200u of post-1986 undistributed earnings and $100 of post-1986 foreign income taxes in its non-look-through pools. P does not use the safe harbor method under paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section to allocate the earnings and taxes in the non-look-through pools to S's other separate categories and does not attempt to substantiate the look-through characterization of S's non-look-through pools. The Commissioner, however, reasonably determines, based on information used to characterize S's stock for purposes of apportioning P's interest expense in P's 2003 and 2004 taxable years, that 100u of the earnings and all $100 of the taxes in the non-look-through pools are properly assigned on a look-through basis to the general limitation category, and 100u of earnings and no taxes are properly assigned on a look-through basis to the passive category. Therefore, in accordance with the Commissioner's look-through characterization of the earnings and taxes in S's non-look-through pools, on January 1, 2003, S has 100u of post-1986 undistributed earnings and $100 of post-1986 foreign income taxes in the general limitation category and 100u of post-1986 undistributed earnings and no post-1986 foreign income taxes in the passive category.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that the Commissioner cannot reasonably determine, based on the available information, the proper look-through characterization of the 200u of undistributed earnings and $100 of taxes in S's non-look-through pools. Accordingly, the Commissioner will assign such earnings and taxes to the passive category, so that as of January 1, 2003, S has 200u of post-1986 undistributed earnings and $100 of post-1986 foreign income taxes in the passive category, and the Commissioner will treat S as a passive category asset for purposes of apportioning P's interest expense.
(5)
Treatment of a deficit accumulated in a non-look-through pool.
Any deficit in the non-look-through pool of a noncontrolled section 902 corporation or a controlled foreign corporation as of the end of its last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2003, shall be treated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002, as if the deficit had been accumulated during a period in which a dividend paid by the foreign corporation would have been eligible for look-through treatment. In the case of a noncontrolled section 902 corporation, the deficit and taxes, if any, in the non-look-through pools shall constitute the opening balance of the look-through pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation in the appropriate separate categories on the first day of its first taxable year beginning after
December 31, 2002. In the case of a controlled foreign corporation, the deficit and taxes, if any, in the non-look-through pools shall be added to the balance of the look-through pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes of the controlled foreign corporation in the appropriate separate categories on the first day of its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002. The taxpayer must substantiate the look-through characterization of the deficit and taxes in accordance with the rules of paragraph (f)(4) of this section. If a taxpayer does not use the safe harbor method described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section and the Commissioner determines that the look-through characterization of the deficit and taxes cannot reasonably be determined based on the available information, the Commissioner shall allocate the deficit and taxes, if any, in the non-look-through pools to the foreign corporation's passive category. If, as of the end of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, in which it pays a dividend, the foreign corporation has zero or a deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings (taking into account any earnings or a deficit accumulated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003), the deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings shall be carried back to reduce pre-1987 accumulated profits, if any, on a last-in first-out basis.
See
§ 1.902-2(a)(1). If, as of the end of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, in which the foreign corporation pays a dividend out of current earnings and profits, it has zero or a deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings (taking into account any earnings or a deficit accumulated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003), and the sum of current plus accumulated earnings and profits is zero or less than zero, no foreign taxes shall be deemed paid with respect to the dividend.
See
§ 1.902-1(b)(4).
(6)
Treatment of pre-1987 accumulated profits.
Any pre-1987 accumulated profits (as defined in § 1.902-1(a)(10)) of a controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled section 902 corporation shall be treated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002, as if they were accumulated during a period in which a dividend paid by the foreign corporation would have been eligible for look-through treatment. Any pre-1987 foreign income taxes (as defined in § 1.902-1(a)(10)(iii)) shall be treated as if they were paid, accrued or deemed paid during a year when a dividend out of the related pre-1987 accumulated profits would have been eligible for look-through treatment. The taxpayer must substantiate the look-through characterization of the pre-1987 accumulated profits and pre-1987 foreign income taxes in accordance with the rules of paragraph (f)(4) of this section. If a taxpayer does not use, or is ineligible to use, the safe harbor method described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section and the Commissioner determines that the look-through characterization of the pre-1987 accumulated profits and pre-1987 foreign income taxes cannot reasonably be determined based on the available information, the pre-1987 accumulated profits and pre-1987 foreign income taxes shall be allocated to the foreign corporation's passive category.
(7)
Treatment of post-1986 undistributed earnings or a deficit of a controlled foreign corporation attributable to dividends from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation paid in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003
—(i)
Look-through treatment of post-1986 undistributed earnings at controlled foreign corporation level.
Dividends paid by a noncontrolled section 902 corporation to a controlled foreign corporation in post-1986 taxable years of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation beginning before January 1, 2003, were assigned to a separate category for dividends from that noncontrolled section 902 corporation. Beginning on the first day of the controlled foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning on or after the first day of the lower-tier corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, any post-1986 undistributed earnings, or previously-taxed earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1) or (2), of the controlled foreign corporation in such a separate category shall be treated as if they were accumulated during a period when a dividend paid by the noncontrolled section 902 corporation would have been eligible for look-through treatment. Any post-1986 foreign income taxes in such a separate
category shall also be treated as if they were paid, accrued or deemed paid during a period when such a dividend would have been eligible for look-through treatment. Any such post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in a separate category for dividends from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation shall be added to the opening balance of the controlled foreign corporation's look-through pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in the appropriate separate categories on the first day of the controlled foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning on or after the first day of the lower-tier corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002. Any section 952(c)(2) recapture account with respect to such a separate category shall be allocated in the same manner as the associated post-1986 undistributed earnings. The taxpayer must substantiate the look-through characterization of such earnings and taxes in accordance with the rules of paragraph (f)(7)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Look-through treatment of deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings at controlled foreign corporation level.
If a controlled foreign corporation has a deficit in a separate category for dividends from a lower-tier noncontrolled section 902 corporation that is a member of the controlled foreign corporation's qualified group as defined in section 902(b)(2), such deficit shall be treated in taxable years of the upper-tier corporation beginning on or after the first day of the lower-tier corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, as if the deficit had been accumulated during a period in which a dividend from the lower-tier corporation would have been eligible for look-through treatment. Any post-1986 foreign income taxes in the separate category for dividends from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation shall also be treated as if they were paid, accrued or deemed paid during a period when the dividends were eligible for look-through treatment. The deficit and related post-1986 foreign income taxes, if any, shall be added to the opening balance of the controlled foreign corporation's look-through pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in the appropriate separate categories on the first day of the controlled foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning on or after the first day of the lower-tier corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002. The taxpayer must substantiate the look-through characterization of the deficit and taxes in accordance with the rules of paragraph (f)(7)(iii) of this section.
(iii)
Substantiation required for look-through treatment.
The taxpayer must substantiate the look-through characterization of post-1986 undistributed earnings, previously-taxed earnings and profits, or a deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings in a separate category for dividends paid by a noncontrolled section 902 corporation in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003, by making a reasonable, good-faith effort to reconstruct the earnings (or deficit) and taxes in the separate category at the level of the controlled foreign corporation on a look-through basis, in accordance with the principles of paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section. Alternatively, the taxpayer may allocate the earnings (or deficit) and taxes to the controlled foreign corporation's look-through pools under the safe harbor method described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section at the level of the controlled foreign corporation. If the taxpayer uses the safe harbor method, the earnings (or deficit) and taxes shall be allocated to the controlled foreign corporation's look-through pools in the appropriate separate categories on the first day of the controlled foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning on or after the first day of the lower-tier corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002. The allocation shall be made in the same percentages as the controlled foreign corporation would properly characterize the stock of the lower-tier noncontrolled section 902 corporation in the separate categories for purposes of apportioning the controlled foreign corporation's interest expense in its first taxable year ending after the first day of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002.
Under § 1.861-12T(c)(3), the apportionment ratios properly used by the controlled foreign corporation are in turn based on the apportionment ratios properly used by the noncontrolled section 902 corporation to apportion its interest expense in its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002. In the case of a taxpayer that uses the safe harbor method where the lower-tier noncontrolled section 902 corporation uses the modified gross income method described in § 1.861-9T(j) to apportion interest expense for its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, earnings (or a deficit) and taxes in the separate category for dividends from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation shall be allocated to the look-through pools based on the average of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation's modified gross income ratios for its taxable years beginning in 2003 and 2004. In the case of a controlled foreign corporation that has in its qualified group a chain of lower-tier noncontrolled section 902 corporations, the safe harbor applies first to characterize the stock of the third-tier corporation and then to characterize the stock of the second-tier corporation. Where a taxpayer uses the safe harbor method with respect to a lower-tier noncontrolled section 902 corporation with respect to which the taxpayer did not meet the requirements of section 902(a) as of the end of the upper-tier controlled foreign corporation's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2003, the earnings (or deficit) and taxes in the separate category for dividends from the lower-tier corporation shall be allocated to the upper-tier corporation's look-through pools in the separate categories in the same percentages as the stock of the lower-tier corporation would have been characterized for purposes of apportioning the upper-tier corporation's interest expense in the last year the taxpayer met the ownership requirements of section 902(a) with respect to the lower-tier corporation if the look-through rules had applied in that year. If a taxpayer does not use the safe harbor method described in this paragraph (f)(7)(iii), and the Commissioner determines that the look-through characterization of the earnings (or deficit) and taxes cannot reasonably be determined based on the available information, the Commissioner shall allocate the earnings (or deficit) and associated foreign income taxes to the controlled foreign corporation's passive category.
(8)
Treatment of distributions received by an upper-tier corporation from a lower-tier noncontrolled section 902 corporation, including when the corporations do not have the same taxable years
—(i)
Rule.
In the case of dividends paid by a lower-tier noncontrolled section 902 corporation to an upper-tier corporation where both are members of the same qualified group as defined in section 902(b)(2), the following rules apply. Dividends paid by the lower-tier corporation in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003, are assigned to a separate category for dividends from that corporation, regardless of whether the corresponding taxable year of the recipient corporation began after December 31, 2002. Post-1986 undistributed earnings, previously-taxed earnings and profits, and post-1986 foreign income taxes in such a separate category shall be treated, beginning on the first day of the upper-tier corporation's first taxable year beginning on or after the first day of the lower-tier corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, as if they were accumulated during a period when a dividend paid by the lower-tier corporation would have been eligible for look-through treatment under section 904(d)(4) and § 1.904-5. Dividends paid by a lower-tier corporation in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002, are eligible for look-through treatment when paid, without regard to whether the corresponding taxable year of the recipient upper-tier corporation began after December 31, 2002.
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (f) of this section:

# Example.
M, a domestic corporation, has directly owned 50 percent of the stock of foreign corporation X, and X has directly owned 50 percent of the stock of foreign corporation Y, at all times since X and Y were organized on January 1, 1990. Accordingly, X and Y are noncontrolled section 902 corporations with respect to M, and X and Y are members of the same qualified group. M and Y use the calendar year as their U.S. taxable year, and X uses a taxable year beginning on July 1.
Under § 1.904-4(g) and paragraph (f)(10) of this section, a dividend paid to M by X on January 15, 2003 (during X's last pre-2003 taxable year) is not eligible for look-through treatment in 2003. However, under § 1.861-12(c)(4), M will characterize the stock of X on a look-through basis for purposes of interest expense apportionment in its 2003 taxable year. Under § 1.904-2(h)(1), any unused foreign taxes in M's separate category for dividends from X will be carried over to M's other separate categories on a look-through basis for M's taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2004. Under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, any undistributed earnings and taxes in X's non-look-through pools will be allocated to X's other separate categories on July 1, 2003. Under § 1.904-5(i)(4) and paragraphs (f)(8)(i) and (f)(10) of this section, a dividend paid to X by Y on January 15, 2003 (during Y's first post-2002 taxable year) is eligible for look-through treatment when paid, notwithstanding that it is received in a pre-2003 taxable year of X.

means the separate category described in section 904(d)(1)(E) as in effect for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002, and prior to its repeal by the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA), Public Law 108-357, 118 Stat. 1418 (October 22, 2004).
(ii)
Time, manner, and form of election.
A taxpayer may elect not to apply the provisions of section 403 of the AJCA and to apply the rules of this paragraph (f)(9) to taxable years of noncontrolled section 902 corporations beginning after December 31, 2002, and before January 1, 2005, without regard to whether the corresponding taxable years of the taxpayer or any upper-tier corporation begin before or after such dates. A taxpayer shall be eligible to make such an election provided that—
(A) The taxpayer's tax liability as shown on an original or amended tax return for each of its affected taxable years is consistent with the rules of this paragraph (f)(9), the guidance set forth in Notice 2003-5 (2003-1 CB 294) (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), and the principles of § 1.861-12(c)(4) for each such year for which the statute of limitations does not preclude the filing of an amended return;
(B) The taxpayer makes appropriate adjustments to eliminate any duplicate benefits arising from the application of this paragraph (f)(9) to taxable years that are not open for assessment; and
(C) The taxpayer attaches a statement to its next tax return for which the due date (with extensions) is more than 90 days after April 25, 2006, indicating that the taxpayer elects not to apply the provisions of section 403 of the AJCA to taxable years of its noncontrolled section 902 corporations beginning in 2003 and 2004, and that the taxpayer has filed original returns or will file amended returns reflecting tax liabilities for each affected year that satisfy the requirements described in this paragraph (f)(9)(ii).
(iii)
Treatment of non-look-through pools in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004.
Undistributed earnings (or a deficit) and taxes in the non-look-through pools of a controlled foreign corporation or a noncontrolled section 902 corporation as of the end of its last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2005, shall be treated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004, as if they were accumulated and paid during a period in which a distribution out of earnings in the non-look-through pool would have been eligible for look-through treatment. Such earnings (or deficit) and taxes shall be added to the foreign corporation's pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in the appropriate separate categories on the first day of the foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2004. In accordance with the principles of paragraph (f)(4) of this section, the taxpayer must reconstruct the non-look-through pools or, if the taxpayer chooses to use the safe harbor method, allocate the earnings and taxes in the non-look-through pools to the foreign corporation's look-through pools in the appropriate separate categories on the first day of the foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2004. Under the safe harbor method, this allocation is made in the same percentages as the taxpayer properly characterized the stock of the foreign corporation for purposes of apportioning the taxpayer's interest expense in the taxpayer's first taxable year ending after the first day of the foreign
corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002.
See
§ 1.861-12T(c)(3) and § 1.861-12(c)(4). If a taxpayer does not use the safe harbor method described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section and the Commissioner determines that the look-through characterization of the earnings (or deficit) and taxes cannot reasonably be determined based on the available information, the earnings (or deficit) and taxes shall be allocated to the foreign corporation's passive category.
(iv)
Carryover of unused foreign tax.
To the extent that a taxpayer has unused foreign taxes in the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations, such taxes shall be carried forward to the appropriate separate categories in the taxpayer's taxable years beginning on or after the first day of the relevant noncontrolled section 902 corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2004. Such unused taxes shall be carried forward in the same manner as § 1.904-2(h)(1) provides that unused foreign taxes in the separate categories for dividends from each noncontrolled section 902 corporation are carried over to taxable years beginning on or after the first day of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, in the case of a taxpayer that does not make the election under this paragraph (f)(9). The electing taxpayer shall determine which noncontrolled section 902 corporations paid the dividends to which the unused foreign taxes are attributable and assign the taxes to the appropriate separate categories as if such dividends had been eligible for look-through treatment when paid. Accordingly, the taxpayer must substantiate the look-through characterization of the unused foreign taxes in accordance with paragraph (f)(4) of this section by reconstructing the non-look-through pools or, if the taxpayer uses the safe harbor method, by allocating the unused foreign taxes to other separate categories in the same percentages as the taxpayer properly characterized the stock of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation for purposes of apportioning the taxpayer's interest expense for its first taxable year ending after the first day of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002. The rule described in this paragraph (f)(9)(iv) shall apply only to unused foreign taxes attributable to dividends out of earnings that were accumulated by noncontrolled section 902 corporations in taxable years of such corporations beginning before January 1, 2003, because only unused foreign taxes attributable to distributions out of pre-2003 earnings are included in the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations. To the extent that unused foreign taxes carried forward to the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations under the rules of Notice 2003-5 were either absorbed by low-taxed dividends paid by noncontrolled section 902 corporations out of the non-look-through pool in taxable years of such corporations beginning in 2003 or 2004, or expired unused, the amount of taxes carried forward to the separate categories on a look-through basis will be smaller than the aggregate amount of taxes initially carried forward to the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations. In this case, the unused foreign taxes arising in each taxable year shall be deemed attributable to each noncontrolled section 902 corporation in the same ratio as the dividends included in the separate category that were paid by such corporation in such year bears to all such dividends paid by all noncontrolled section 902 corporations in such year. Unused foreign taxes carried forward from the separate categories for dividends from each noncontrolled section 902 corporation to the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations will similarly be deemed to have been utilized on a pro rata basis. The remaining unused foreign taxes are then assigned to the appropriate separate categories under the rules of paragraph (f)(4) of this section. Unused foreign taxes shall be treated as allocable to general category income to the extent that such taxes would otherwise have been allocable to passive income (based on reconstructed pools or the safe harbor method), or to the extent that, under paragraph
(f)(4)(iii) of this section, the Commissioner determines that the look-through characterization cannot reasonably be determined based on the available information.
(v)
Carryback of unused foreign tax.
To the extent that a taxpayer has unused foreign taxes attributable to a dividend paid by a noncontrolled section 902 corporation that was eligible for look-through treatment under section 904(d)(4) and § 1.904-5, any such unused foreign taxes shall be carried back to prior taxable years within the same separate category and not to the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations or any separate category for dividends from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation. See Notice 2003-5 for rules relating to the carryback of unused foreign taxes in the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations.
(vi)
Recapture of overall foreign loss or separate limitation loss in the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations.
To the extent that a taxpayer has a balance in a separate limitation loss or overall foreign loss account in the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations under section 904(d)(1)(E) (prior to its repeal by the AJCA), at the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2005 (or a later taxable year in which the taxpayer received a dividend subject to the separate limitation for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations), the amount of such balance shall be allocated on the first day of the taxpayer's next taxable year to the taxpayer's other separate categories. The amount of such balance that is attributable to each noncontrolled section 902 corporation shall be allocated in the same percentages as the taxpayer properly characterized the stock of such corporation for purposes of apportioning the taxpayer's interest expense for its first taxable year ending after the first day of such corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, under § 1.861-12T(c)(3) or § 1.861-12(c)(4), as the case may be. To the extent that a taxpayer has a balance in a separate limitation loss account for the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations with respect to another separate category, and the separate limitation loss account would otherwise be assigned to that other category under this paragraph (f)(9)(vi), such balance shall be eliminated.
(vii)
Recapture of separate limitation losses in other separate categories.
To the extent that a taxpayer has a balance in any separate limitation loss account in a separate category with respect to the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations at the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year with or within which ends the last taxable year of the relevant noncontrolled section 902 corporation beginning before January 1, 2005, such loss shall be recaptured in subsequent taxable years as income in the appropriate separate category. The separate limitation loss account shall be deemed attributable on a pro rata basis to those noncontrolled section 902 corporations that paid dividends out of earnings accumulated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003, in the years in which the separate limitation loss in the other separate category arose. The ratable portions of the separate limitation loss account shall be recaptured as income in the taxpayer's separate categories in the same percentages as the taxpayer properly characterized the stock of the relevant noncontrolled section 902 corporation for purposes of apportioning the taxpayer's interest expense in its first taxable year ending after the first day of such corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, under § 1.861-12T(c)(3) or § 1.861-12(c)(4), as the case may be. To the extent that a taxpayer has a balance in any separate limitation loss account in any separate category that would have been recaptured as income in that same category under this paragraph (f)(9)(vii), such balance shall be eliminated.
(viii)
Treatment of undistributed earnings in an upper-tier corporation-level single category for dividends from lower-tier noncontrolled section 902 corporations.
Where a controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled section 902 corporation has a single category for
dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations containing earnings attributable to dividends paid by one or more lower-tier corporations, the following rules apply. The post-1986 undistributed earnings, previously-taxed earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1) or (2), if any, and associated post-1986 foreign income taxes shall be allocated to the upper-tier corporation's other separate categories in the same manner as earnings and taxes in a separate category for dividends from each noncontrolled section 902 corporation maintained by the upper-tier corporation are allocated under paragraph (f)(7) of this section. Accordingly, post-1986 undistributed earnings, previously-taxed earnings and profits, if any, and post-1986 foreign income taxes in the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations shall be treated as if they were accumulated and paid, accrued or deemed paid during a period when a dividend paid by each lower-tier corporation that paid dividends included in the single category would have been eligible for look-through treatment. If the taxpayer uses the safe harbor method described in paragraph (f)(7)(iii) of this section, the earnings and taxes shall be allocated based on the apportionment ratios properly used by the lower-tier corporation to apportion its interest expense for its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002. Any section 952(c)(2) recapture account with respect to the single category shall be allocated in the same manner as the associated post-1986 undistributed earnings. The taxpayer must substantiate the look-through characterization of the earnings and taxes in accordance with the rules of paragraph (f)(7)(iii) of this section. If the taxpayer does not use the safe harbor method and the Commissioner determines that the look-through characterization of the earnings cannot reasonably be determined based on the available information, the earnings and taxes shall be assigned to the upper-tier corporation's passive category.
(ix)
Treatment of a deficit in the single category for dividends from lower-tier noncontrolled section 902 corporations.
Where a controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled section 902 corporation had an aggregate deficit in the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations as of the end of the upper-tier corporation's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2005, such deficit and the associated post-1986 foreign income taxes, if any, shall be allocated to the upper-tier corporation's other separate categories in the same percentages in which the non-look-through pools of each lower-tier corporation to which the deficit is attributable were assigned to such corporation's other separate categories in its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002. If the taxpayer uses the safe harbor method described in paragraph (f)(7)(iii) of this section, the deficit and taxes shall be allocated based on how the taxpayer properly characterized the stock of the lower-tier noncontrolled section 902 corporation for purposes of apportioning the upper-tier corporation's interest expense for the upper-tier corporation's first taxable year ending after the first day of the lower-tier corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002. The taxpayer must substantiate the look-through characterization of the deficit and taxes in accordance with the rules of paragraph (f)(7)(iii) of this section. If the taxpayer does not use the safe harbor method and the Commissioner determines that the look-through characterization of the deficit cannot reasonably be determined based on the available information, the deficit and taxes shall be assigned to the upper-tier corporation's passive category.
(10)
Effective/applicability date.
This paragraph (f) shall apply to dividends from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation that are paid in taxable years of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation ending on or after April 20, 2009.
See
26 CFR § 1.904-7T(f) (revised as of April 1, 2009) for rules applicable, except in the case of a taxpayer that makes the election under paragraph (f)(9) of that section, to dividends from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation that are paid in taxable years of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation beginning after December 31, 2002, and ending before April 20, 2009.
See
26 CFR
1.904-7T(f) (revised as of April 1, 2009) for rules applicable, in the case of a taxpayer that makes the election under paragraph (f)(9) of that section, to dividends from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation that are paid in taxable years of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation beginning after December 31, 2004, and ending before April 20, 2009. However, taxpayers may choose to apply paragraph (f) of this section in its entirety in lieu of 26 CFR 1.904-7T(f) to all dividends paid in periods covered by the temporary regulations, provided that appropriate adjustments are made to eliminate duplicate benefits arising from application of paragraph (f) to taxable years that are not open for assessment.
(g)
Treatment of earnings and foreign taxes of a controlled foreign corporation or a noncontrolled section 902 corporation accumulated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2007
—(1)
Definitions
—(i)
Pre-2007 pools
means the pools in each separate category of post-1986 undistributed earnings (as defined in § 1.902-1(a)(9)) that were accumulated, and post-1986 foreign income taxes (as defined in § 1.902-1(a)(8)) paid, accrued, or deemed paid, in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2007.
(ii)
Pre-2007 separate categories
means the separate categories of income described in section 904(d) as applicable to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2007, and any other separate category of income described in § 1.904-4(m).
(iii)
Post-2006 separate categories
means the separate categories of income described in section 904(d) as applicable to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006, and any other separate category of income described in § 1.904-4(m).
(2)
Treatment of pre-2007 pools of a controlled foreign corporation or a noncontrolled section 902 corporation.
Any post-1986 undistributed earnings in a pre-2007 pool of a controlled foreign corporation or a noncontrolled section 902 corporation shall be treated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006, as if they were accumulated during a period in which the rules governing the determination of post-2006 separate categories applied. Post-1986 foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed paid with respect to such earnings shall be treated as if they were paid, accrued, or deemed paid during a period in which the rules governing the determination of post-2006 separate categories (including the rules of section 904(d)(3)(E)) applied as well. Any such earnings and taxes in pre-2007 pools shall constitute the opening balance of the foreign corporation's post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes on the first day of the foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2006, in accordance with the rules of paragraph (g)(3) of this section. Similar rules shall apply to characterize any deficits in the pre-2007 pools and previously-taxed earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1) and (2) that are attributable to earnings in the pre-2007 pools. Any section 952(c)(2) recapture account with respect to a separate category shall be allocated in the same manner as the post-1986 undistributed earnings in the associated pre-2007 pool.
(3)
Substantiation of post-2006 character of earnings and taxes in a pre-2007 pool
—(i)
Reconstruction of earnings and taxes pools.
In order to substantiate the post-2006 characterization of post-1986 undistributed earnings (as well as deficits and previously-taxed earnings, if any) and post-1986 foreign income taxes in pre-2007 pools of a controlled foreign corporation or a noncontrolled section 902 corporation, the taxpayer shall make a reasonable, good-faith effort to reconstruct the pre-2007 pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings (as well as deficits and previously-taxed earnings, if any) and post-1986 foreign income taxes following the rules governing the determination of post-2006 separate categories for each taxable year beginning before January 1, 2007, beginning with the first year in which post-1986 undistributed earnings were accumulated in the pre-2007 pool. Reconstruction shall be based on reasonably available books and records and other relevant information. To the extent any pre-2007 separate category includes earnings that would be allocated to more than one post-2006 separate category, the taxpayer must account for earnings distributed and taxes deemed paid in these years for such category as
if they were distributed and deemed paid pro rata from the amounts that were added to that category during each taxable year beginning before January 1, 2007.
(ii)
Safe harbor method
—(A)
In general.
Subject to the rules of paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section, a taxpayer may allocate the post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in pre-2007 pools of a controlled foreign corporation or a noncontrolled section 902 corporation (as well as deficits and previously-taxed earnings, if any) under one of the safe harbor methods described in paragraphs (g)(3)(ii)(B) and (g)(3)(ii)(C) of this section. A taxpayer may choose to use the safe harbor method on a timely filed (original or amended) tax return or during an audit. A taxpayer that uses the safe harbor method on an amended return or in the course of an audit must make appropriate adjustments to eliminate any double benefit arising from application of the safe harbor method to years that are not open for assessment. A taxpayer's choice to use the safe harbor method is evidenced by employing the method. The taxpayer need not file any separate statement.
(B)
General safe harbor method.
(
1
) Any post-1986 undistributed earnings (as well as deficits and previously-taxed earnings, if any) and post-1986 foreign income taxes of a noncontrolled section 902 corporation or a controlled foreign corporation in a pre-2007 separate category for passive income, certain dividends from a DISC or former DISC, taxable income attributable to certain foreign trade income, or certain distributions from a FSC or former FSC shall be allocated to the post-2006 separate category for passive category income.
(
2
) Any post-1986 undistributed earnings (as well as deficits and previously-taxed earnings, if any) and post-1986 foreign income taxes of a noncontrolled section 902 corporation or a controlled foreign corporation in a pre-2007 separate category for financial services income, shipping income or general limitation income shall be allocated to the post-2006 separate category for general category income.
(
3
) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(B)(
4
) of this section, any post-1986 undistributed earnings (as well as deficits and previously-taxed earnings, if any) and post-1986 foreign income taxes of a noncontrolled section 902 corporation or a controlled foreign corporation in a pre-2007 separate category for high withholding tax interest shall be allocated to the post-2006 separate category for passive category income.
(
4
) If a controlled foreign corporation has positive post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in a pre-2007 separate category for high withholding tax interest, such earnings and taxes shall be allocated to the post-2006 separate category for general category income if the earnings would qualify as income subject to high foreign taxes under section 954(b)(4) if the entire amount of post-1986 undistributed earnings were treated as a net item of income subject to the rules of § 1.954-1(d). If the high withholding tax interest earnings would not qualify as income subject to high foreign taxes under section 954(b)(4), then the earnings and taxes shall be allocated to the post-2006 separate category for passive category income.
(C)
Interest apportionment safe harbor.
A taxpayer may allocate the post-1986 undistributed earnings (as well as deficits and previously-taxed earnings, if any) and post-1986 foreign income taxes in pre-2007 pools of a controlled foreign corporation or a noncontrolled section 902 corporation following the principles of paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section.
(iii)
Consistency rule.
The election to apply a safe harbor method under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section in lieu of the rules described in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section may be made on a separate category by separate category basis. However, if a taxpayer elects to apply a safe harbor to allocate pre-2007 pools of more than one pre-2007 separate category of a controlled foreign corporation or a noncontrolled section 902 corporation, such safe harbor (the general safe harbor described in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(B) of this section or the interest apportionment safe harbor described in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(C) of this section) shall apply to allocate
post-1986 undistributed earnings (as well as deficits and previously-taxed earnings, if any) and post-1986 foreign income taxes for the pre-2007 pools in each pre-2007 separate category of the foreign corporation for which the taxpayer elected to apply a safe harbor method in lieu of reconstructing the pre-2007 pools.
(4)
Treatment of pre-1987 accumulated profits.
Any pre-1987 accumulated profits (as defined in § 1.902-1(a)(10)) of a noncontrolled section 902 corporation or a controlled foreign corporation shall be treated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006, as if they had been accumulated during a period in which the rules governing the determination of post-2006 separate categories applied. Foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed paid with respect to such earnings shall be treated as if they were paid, accrued, or deemed paid during a period in which the rules governing the determination of post-2006 separate categories applied as well. The taxpayer must substantiate the post-2006 characterization of the pre-1987 accumulated profits and pre-1987 foreign income taxes in accordance with the rules of paragraph (g)(3) of this section, including the safe harbor provisions. Similar rules shall apply to characterize any deficits or previously-taxed earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1) and (2) that are attributable to pre-1987 accumulated profits.
(5)
Treatment of earnings and foreign taxes in pre-2007 pools of a lower-tier controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled section 902 corporation.
The rules of paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section apply to post-1986 undistributed earnings (as well as deficits and previously-taxed earnings, if any) and post-1986 foreign income taxes in pre-2007 pools, and pre-1987 accumulated profits and pre-1987 foreign income taxes, of a lower-tier controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled section 902 corporation.
(6)
Effective/applicability date.
This paragraph (g) shall apply to taxable years of United States persons and, for purposes of section 906, foreign persons beginning after December 31, 2006 and ending on or after December 21, 2007, and to taxable years of a foreign corporation which end with or within taxable years of its domestic corporate shareholder beginning after December 31, 2006 and ending on or after December 21, 2007.

§ 1.904(b)-1
Special rules for capital gains and losses.
(a)
Capital gains and losses included in taxable income from sources outside the United States
—(1)
Limitation on capital gain from sources outside the United States when the taxpayer has net capital losses from sources within the United States
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, for purposes of section 904 and this section, taxable income from sources outside the United States (in all of the taxpayer's separate categories in the aggregate) shall include capital gain net income from sources outside the United States (determined by considering all of the capital gain and loss items in all of the taxpayer's separate categories in the aggregate) only to the extent of capital gain net income from all sources. Thus, capital gain net income from sources outside the United States (determined by considering all of the capital gain and loss items in all of the taxpayer's separate categories in the aggregate) shall be reduced to the extent such amount exceeds capital gain net income from all sources.
(ii)
Allocation of reduction to separate categories or rate groups
—(A)
In general.
If capital gain net income from sources outside the United States exceeds capital gain net income from all sources, and the taxpayer has capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in only one separate category, such excess is allocated as a reduction to that separate category. If a taxpayer has capital gain net income from foreign sources in two or more separate categories, such excess must be apportioned on a pro rata basis as a reduction to each such separate category. For purposes of the preceding sentence, pro rata means based on the relative amounts of the capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in each separate category.
(B)
Taxpayer with capital gain rate differential.
If a taxpayer with a capital gain rate differential for the year (within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section) has capital gain net income from foreign sources in only one rate group within a separate category, any reduction to such separate category pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section must be allocated to such rate group. If a taxpayer with a capital gain rate differential for the year (within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section) has capital gain net income from foreign sources in two or more rate groups within a separate category, any reduction to such separate category pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section must be apportioned on a pro rata basis among such rate groups. For purposes of the preceding sentence, pro rata means based on the relative amounts of the capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in each rate group within the applicable separate category.
(2)
Exclusivity of rules; no reduction by reason of net capital losses from sources outside the United States in a different separate category.
Capital gains from sources outside the United States in any separate category shall be limited by reason of section 904(b)(2)(A) and the comparable limitation of section 904(b)(2)(B)(i) only to the extent provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section (relating to limitation on capital gain from sources outside the United States when taxpayer has net capital losses from sources within the United States).
(3)
Capital losses from sources outside the United States in the same separate category.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section, taxable income from sources outside the United States in each separate category shall be reduced by any capital loss that is allocable or apportionable to income from sources outside the United States in such separate category to the extent such loss is allowable in determining taxable income for the taxable year.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (a) to taxpayers that do not have a capital gain rate differential for the taxable year. See paragraph (g) of this section for examples that illustrate the application of this paragraph (a) to taxpayers that have a capital gain rate differential for the year. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1.
Taxpayer A, a corporation, has a $3,000 capital loss from sources outside the United States in the general limitation category, a $6,000 capital gain from sources outside the United States in the passive category, and a $2,000 capital loss from sources within the United States. A's capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in the aggregate, from all separate categories, is $3,000 ($6,000 − $3,000). A's capital gain net income from all sources is $1,000 ($6,000 − $3,000 − $2,000). Thus, for purposes of section 904, A's taxable income from sources outside the United States in all of A's separate categories in the aggregate includes only $1,000 of capital gain net income from sources outside the United States. See paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. Pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, A must reduce the $6,000 of capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in the passive category by $2,000 ($3,000 of capital gain net income from sources outside the United States − $1,000 of capital gain net income from all sources). After the adjustment, A has $4,000 of capital gain from sources outside the United States in the passive category and $3,000 of capital loss from sources outside the United States in the general limitation category.

# Example 2.
Taxpayer B, a corporation, has a $300 capital gain from sources outside the United States in the general limitation category and a $200 capital gain from sources outside the United States in the passive category. B's capital gain net income from sources outside the United States is $500 ($300 + $200). B also has a $150 capital loss from sources within the United States and a $50 capital gain from sources within the United States. Thus, B's capital gain net income from all sources is $400 ($300 + $200 − $150 + $50). Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the $100 excess of capital gain net income from sources outside the United States over capital gain net income from all sources ($500 − $400) must be apportioned, as a reduction, three-fifths ($300/$500 of $100, or $60) to the general limitation category and two-fifths ($200/$500 of $100, or $40) to the passive category. Therefore, for purposes of section 904, the general limitation category includes $240 ($300 − $60) of capital gain net income from sources outside the United States and the passive category includes $160 ($200 − $40) of capital gain net income from sources outside the United States.

# Example 3.
Taxpayer C, a corporation, has a $10,000 capital loss from sources outside the United States in the general limitation category, a $4,000 capital gain from sources outside the United States in the passive category, and a $2,000 capital gain from sources within the United States. C's capital gain net income from sources outside the United States is zero, since losses exceed gains. C's capital gain net income from all sources is also zero. C's capital gain net income from sources outside the United States does not exceed its capital gain net income from all sources, and therefore paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not require any reduction of C's passive category capital gain. For purposes of section 904, C's passive category includes $4,000 of capital gain net income. C's general limitation category includes a capital loss of $6,000 because only $6,000 of capital loss is allowable as a deduction in the current year. The entire $4,000 of capital loss in excess of the $6,000 of capital loss that offsets capital gain in the taxable year is carried back or forward under section 1212(a), and none of such $4,000 is taken into account under section 904(a) or (b) for the current taxable year.
(b)
Capital gain rate differential
—(1)
Application of adjustments only if capital gain rate differential exists.
Section 904(b)(2)(B) and paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section apply only for taxable years in which the taxpayer has a capital gain rate differential.
(2)
Determination of whether capital gain rate differential exists.
For purposes of section 904(b) and this section, a capital gain rate differential is considered to exist for the taxable year only if the taxpayer has taxable income (excluding net capital gain and qualified dividend income) for the taxable year, a net capital gain for the taxable year and—
(i) In the case of a taxpayer other than a corporation, tax is imposed on the net capital gain at a reduced rate under section 1(h) for the taxable year; or
(ii) In the case of a corporation, tax is imposed under section 1201(a) on the taxpayer at a rate less than any rate of tax imposed on the taxpayer by section 11, 511, or 831(a) or (b), whichever applies (determined without regard to the last sentence of section 11(b)(1)), for the taxable year.
(3)
Special rule for certain noncorporate taxpayers.
A taxpayer that has a capital gain rate differential for the taxable year under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and is not subject to alternative minimum tax under section 55 for the taxable year may elect not to apply the rate differential adjustments contained in section 904(b)(2)(B) and paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section if the highest rate of tax imposed on such taxpayer's taxable income (excluding net capital gain and any qualified dividend income) for the taxable year under section 1 does not exceed the highest rate of tax in effect under section 1(h) for the taxable year and the amount of the taxpayer's net capital gain from sources outside the United States, plus the amount of the taxpayer's qualified dividend income from sources outside the United States, is less than $20,000. A taxpayer that has a capital gain rate differential for the taxable year under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and is subject to alternative minimum tax under section 55 for the taxable year may make such election if the rate of tax imposed on such taxpayer's alternative minimum taxable income (excluding net capital gain and any qualified dividend income) under section 55 does not exceed 26 percent, the highest rate of tax imposed on such taxpayer's taxable income (excluding net capital gain and any qualified dividend income) for the taxable year under section 1 does not exceed the highest rate of tax in effect under section 1(h) for the taxable year and the amount of the taxpayer's net capital gain from sources outside the United States, plus the amount of the taxpayer's qualified dividend income from sources outside the United States, is less than $20,000. A taxpayer who makes this election shall apply paragraph (a) of this section as if such taxpayer does not have a capital gain rate differential for the taxable year. An eligible taxpayer shall be presumed to have elected not to apply the rate differential adjustments, unless such taxpayer applies the rate differential adjustments contained in section 904(b)(2)(B) and paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section in determining its foreign tax credit limitation for the taxable year.
(c)
Rate differential adjustment of capital gains
—(1)
Rate differential adjustment of capital gains in foreign source taxable income
—(i)
In general.
Subject to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, in determining taxable income from sources outside the United States for purposes of section 904 and this section, capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in each long-term rate group in each separate category (separate category long-term rate group), shall be reduced by the rate differential portion of such capital gain net income. For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, references to capital gain net income are references to capital gain net income remaining after any reduction to such income pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section (
i.e.
, paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies before paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section).
(ii)
Special rule for taxpayers with a net long-term capital loss from sources within the United States.
If a taxpayer has a net long-term capital loss from sources within the United States (
i.e.
, the taxpayer's long-term capital losses from sources within the United States exceed the taxpayer's long-term capital gains from sources within the United States) and also has any short-term capital gains from sources within or without the United States, then capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in each separate category long-term rate group shall be reduced by the rate differential portion of the applicable rate differential amount. The applicable rate differential amount is determined as follows:
(A)
Step 1: Determine the U.S. long-term capital loss adjustment amount.
The U.S. long-term capital loss adjustment amount is the excess, if any, of the net
long-term capital loss from sources within the United States over the amount, if any, by which the taxpayer reduced long-term capital gains from sources without the United States pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(B)
Step 2: Determine the applicable rate differential amount.
If a taxpayer has capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in only one separate category long-term rate group, the applicable rate differential amount is the excess of such capital gain net income over the U.S. long-term capital loss adjustment amount. If a taxpayer has capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in more than one separate category long-term rate group, the U.S. long-term capital loss adjustment amount shall be apportioned on a pro rata basis to each separate category long-term rate group with capital gain net income. For purposes of the preceding sentence, pro rata means based on the relative amounts of capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in each separate category long-term rate group. The applicable rate differential amount for each separate category long-term rate group with capital gain net income is the excess of such capital gain net income over the portion of the U.S. long-term capital loss adjustment amount apportioned to the separate category long-term rate group pursuant to this Step 2.
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. The taxpayers in the examples are assumed to have taxable income (excluding net capital gain and qualified dividend income) subject to a rate of tax under section 1 greater than the highest rate of tax in effect under section 1(h) for the applicable taxable year. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1.
(i) M, an individual, has $300 of long-term capital gain from foreign sources in the passive category, $200 of which is subject to tax at a rate of 15 percent under section 1(h) and $100 of which is subject to tax at a rate of 28% under section 1(h). M has $150 of short-term capital gain from sources within the United States. M has a $100 long-term capital loss from sources within the United States.
(ii) M's capital gain net income from sources outside the United States ($300) does not exceed M's capital gain net income from all sources ($350). Therefore, paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not require any reduction of M's capital gain net income in the passive category.
(iii) Because M has a net long-term capital loss from sources within the United States ($100) and also has a short-term capital gain from U.S. sources ($150), M must apply the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section to determine the amount of the $300 of capital gain net income in the passive category that is subject to a rate differential adjustment. Under
Step 1
, the U.S. long-term capital loss adjustment amount is $100 ($100 − $0). Under
Step 2
, M must apportion this amount to each rate group in the passive category pro rata based on the amount of capital gain net income in each rate group. Thus, $66.67 ($200/$300 of $100) is apportioned to the 15 percent rate group and $33.33 ($100/$300 of $100) is apportioned to the 28 percent rate group. The applicable rate differential amount for the 15 percent rate group is $133.33 ($200 − $66.67). Thus, $133.33 of the $200 of capital gain net income in the 15 percent rate group is subject to a rate differential adjustment pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The remaining $66.67 is not subject to a rate differential adjustment. The applicable rate differential amount for the 28 percent rate group is $66.67 ($100 − $33.33). Thus, $66.67 of the $100 of capital gain net income in the 28 percent rate group is subject to a rate differential adjustment pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The remaining $33.33 is not subject to a rate differential adjustment.

# Example 2.
(i) N, an individual, has $300 of long-term capital gain from foreign sources in the passive category, all of which is subject to tax at a rate of 15 percent under section 1(h). N has $50 of short-term capital gain from sources within the United States. N has a $100 long-term capital loss from sources within the United States.
(ii) N's capital gain net income from sources outside the United States ($300) exceeds N's capital gain net income from all sources ($250). Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, N must reduce the $300 capital gain in the passive category by $50. N has $250 of capital gain remaining in the passive category.
(iii) Because N has a net long-term capital loss from sources within the United States ($100) and also has a short-term capital gain from U.S. sources ($50), N must apply the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section to determine the amount of the $250 of capital gain in the passive category that is subject to a rate differential adjustment. Under
Step 1
, the U.S. long-term capital loss adjustment amount is $50 ($100 − $50). Under
Step 2
, the applicable rate differential
amount is $200 ($250 − $50). Thus, $200 of the capital gain in the passive category is subject to a rate differential adjustment under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The remaining $50 is not subject to a rate differential adjustment.

# Example 3.
(i) O, an individual, has a $100 short-term capital gain from foreign sources in the passive category. O has $300 of long-term capital gain from foreign sources in the passive category, all of which is subject to tax at a rate of 15 percent under section 1(h). O has a $100 long-term capital loss from sources within the United States.
(ii) O's capital gain net income from sources outside the United States ($400) exceeds O's capital gain net income from all sources ($300). Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, O must reduce the $400 capital gain net income in the passive category by $100. Because C has capital gain net income in two or more rate groups in the passive category, O must apportion such amount, as a reduction, to each rate group on a pro rata basis pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. Thus, $25 ($100/$400 of $100) is apportioned to the short-term capital gain and $75 ($300/$400 of $100) is apportioned to the long-term capital gain in the 15 percent rate group. After application of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, O has $75 of short-term capital gain in the passive category and $225 of long-term capital gain in the 15 percent rate group in the passive category.
(iii) Because O has a net long-term capital loss from sources within the United States ($100) and also has a short-term capital gain from foreign sources ($100), O must apply the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section to determine the amount of the $225 of long-term capital gain in the 15 percent rate group that is subject to a rate differential adjustment. Under
Step 1
, the U.S. long-term capital loss adjustment amount is $25 ($100 − $75). Under
Step 2
, the applicable rate differential amount is $200 ($225 − $25). Thus, $200 of the long-term capital gain is subject to a rate differential adjustment under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The remaining $25 of long-term capital gain is not subject to a rate differential adjustment.
(2)
Rate differential adjustment of capital gains in entire taxable income.
For purposes of section 904 and this section, entire taxable income shall include gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets only to the extent of capital gain net income reduced by the sum of the rate differential portions of each rate group of net capital gain.
(d)
Rate differential adjustment of capital losses from sources outside the United States
—(1)
In general.
In determining taxable income from sources outside the United States for purposes of section 904 and this section, a taxpayer with a net capital loss in a separate category rate group shall reduce such net capital loss by the sum of the rate differential portions of the capital gain net income in each long-term rate group offset by such net capital loss. A net capital loss in a separate category rate group is the amount, if any, by which capital losses in a rate group from sources outside the United States included in a separate category exceed capital gains from sources outside the United States in the same rate group and the same separate category.
(2)
Determination of which capital gains are offset by net capital losses from sources outside the United States.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, in order to determine the capital gain net income offset by net capital losses from sources outside the United States, the following rules shall apply in the following order:
(i) Net capital losses from sources outside the United States in each separate category rate group shall be netted against capital gain net income from sources outside the United States from the same rate group in other separate categories.
(ii) Capital losses from sources within the United States shall be netted against capital gains from sources within the United States in the same rate group.
(iii) Net capital losses from sources outside the United States in excess of the amounts netted against capital gains under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section shall be netted against the taxpayer's remaining capital gains from sources within and outside the United States in the following order, and without regard to any net capital losses, from any rate group, from sources within the United States—
(A) First against capital gain net income from sources within the United States in the same rate group;
(B) Next, against capital gain net income in other rate groups, in the order in which capital losses offset capital gains for purposes of determining the taxpayer's taxable income and without regard to whether such capital gain net income derives from sources within or outside the United States, as follows:
(
1
) A net capital loss in the short-term rate group is used first to offset any capital gain net income in the 28 percent rate group, then to offset capital gain net income in the 25 percent rate group, then to offset capital gain net income in the 15 percent rate group, and finally to offset capital gain net income in the 5 percent rate group.
(
2
) A net capital loss in the 28 percent rate group is used first to offset capital gain net income in the 25 percent rate group, then to offset capital gain net income in the 15 percent rate group, and finally to offset capital gain net income in the 5 percent rate group.
(
3
) A net capital loss in the 15 percent rate group is used first to offset capital gain net income in the 5 percent rate group, and then to offset capital gain net income in the 28 percent rate group, and finally to offset capital gain net income in the 25 percent rate group.
(iv) Net capital losses from sources outside the United States in any rate group, to the extent netted against capital gains in any other separate category under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section or against capital gains in the same or any other rate group under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, shall be treated as coming pro rata from each separate category that contains a net capital loss from sources outside the United States in that rate group. For example, assume that the taxpayer has $20 of net capital losses in the 15 percent rate group in the passive category and $40 of net capital losses in the 15 percent rate group in the general limitation category, both from sources outside the United States. Further assume that $50 of the total $60 net capital losses from sources outside the United States are netted against capital gain net income in the 28 percent rate group (from other separate categories or from sources within the United States). One-third of the $50 of such capital losses would be treated as coming from the passive category, and two-thirds of such $50 would be treated as coming from the general limitation category.
(v) In determining the capital gain net income offset by a net capital loss from sources outside the United States pursuant to this paragraph (d)(2), a taxpayer shall take into account any reduction to capital gain net income from sources outside the United States pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section and shall disregard any adjustments to such capital gain net income pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(vi) If at any time during a taxable year, tax is imposed under section 1(h) at a rate other than a rate of tax specified in this paragraph (d)(2), the principles of this paragraph (d)(2) shall apply to determine the capital gain net income offset by any net capital loss in a separate category rate group.
(vii) The determination of which capital gains are offset by capital losses from sources outside the United States under this paragraph (d)(2) is made solely in order to determine the appropriate rate-differential-based adjustments to such capital losses under this section and section 904(b), and does not change the source, allocation, or separate category of any such capital gain or loss for purposes of computing taxable income from sources within or outside the United States or for any other purpose.
(e)
Qualified dividend income
—(1)
In general.
A taxpayer that has taxable income (excluding net capital gain and qualified dividend income) for the taxable year and that qualifies for a reduced rate of tax under section 1(h) on its qualified dividend income (as defined in section 1(h)(11)) for the taxable year shall adjust the amount of such qualified dividend income in a manner consistent with the rules of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) (first sentence) and (c)(2) of this section irrespective of whether such taxpayer has a net capital gain for the taxable year. For purposes of making adjustments pursuant to this paragraph (e), the special rule in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section for taxpayers with a net long-term capital loss from sources within the United States shall be disregarded.
(2)
Exception.
A taxpayer that makes the election provided for in paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall not make adjustments pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Additionally, a taxpayer other than a corporation that does not have a capital gain rate differential for the taxable year within
the meaning of paragraph (b)(2) of this section may elect not to apply paragraph (e)(1) of this section if such taxpayer would have qualified for the election provided for in paragraph (b)(3) of this section had such taxpayer had a capital gain rate differential for the taxable year. Such a taxpayer shall be presumed to make the election provided for in the preceding sentence unless such taxpayer applies the rate differential adjustments provided for in paragraph (e)(1) of this section to the qualified dividend income in determining its foreign tax credit limitation for the taxable year.
(f)
Definitions.
For purposes of section 904(b) and this section, the following definitions apply:
(1)
Alternative tax rate.
The term
alternative tax rate
means, with respect to any rate group, the rate applicable to that rate group under section 1(h) (for taxpayers other than corporations) or section 1201(a) (for corporations). For example, the alternative tax rate for unrecaptured section 1250 gain is 25 percent.
(2)
Net capital gain.
For purposes of this section, net capital gain shall not include any qualified dividend income (as defined in section 1(h)(11)). See paragraph (e) of this section for rules relating to qualified dividend income.
(3)
Rate differential portion.
The term
rate differential portion
with respect to capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in a separate category long-term rate group (or the applicable portion of such amount), net capital gain in a rate group, or capital gain net income in a long-term rate group, as the case may be, means the same proportion of such amount as—
(i) The excess of the highest applicable tax rate (as defined in section 904(b)(3)(E)(ii)) over the alternative tax rate; bears to
(ii) The highest applicable tax rate (as defined in section 904(b)(3)(E)(ii)).
(4)
Rate group.
For purposes of this section, the term
rate group
means:
(i)
Short-term capital gains or losses.
With respect to a short-term capital gain or loss, the rate group is the short-term rate group.
(ii)
Long-term capital gains.
With respect to a long-term capital gain, the rate group is the particular rate of tax to which such gain is subject under section 1(h). Such a rate group is a long-term rate group. For example, the 28 percent rate group of capital gain net income from sources outside the United States consists of the capital gain net income from sources outside the United States that is subject to tax at a rate of 28 percent under section 1(h). Such 28 percent rate group is a long-term rate group. If a taxpayer has long-term capital gains that may be subject to tax at more than one rate under section 1(h) and the taxpayer's net capital gain attributable to such long-term capital gains and any qualified dividend income are taxed at one rate of tax under section 1(h), then all of such long-term capital gains shall be treated as long-term capital gains in that one rate group. If a taxpayer has long-term capital gains that may be subject to tax at more than one rate of tax under section 1(h) and the taxpayer's net capital gain attributable to such long-term capital gains and any qualified dividend income are taxed at more than one rate pursuant to section 1(h), the taxpayer shall determine the rate group for such long-term capital gains from sources within or outside the United States (and, to the extent from sources outside the United States, from each separate category) ratably based on the proportions of net capital gain and any qualified dividend income taxed at each applicable rate. For example, under the section 1(h) rates in effect for tax years beginning in 2004, a long-term capital gain (other than a long-term capital gain described in section 1(h)(4)(A) or (h)(6)) may be subject to tax at 5 percent or 15 percent.
(iii)
Long-term capital losses.
With respect to a long-term capital loss, a loss described in section 1(h)(4)(B)(i) (collectibles loss) or (iii) (long-term capital loss carryover) is a loss in the 28 percent rate group. All other long-term capital losses shall be treated as losses in the highest rate group in effect under section 1(h) for the tax year with respect to long-term capital gains other than long-term capital gains described in section 1(h)(4)(A) or (h)(6). For example, under the section 1(h) rates in effect for tax years beginning in 2004, a long-term capital loss not described in section 1(h)(4)(B)(i) or (iii)
shall be treated as a loss in the 15 percent rate group.
(5)
Terms used in sections 1(h), 904(b) or 1222.
For purposes of this section, any term used in this section and also used in section 1(h), section 904(b) or section 1222 shall have the same meaning given such term by section 1(h), 904(b) or 1222, respectively, except as otherwise provided in this section.
(g)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section. In these examples, the rate differential adjustment is shown as a fraction, the numerator of which is the alternative tax rate percentage and the denominator of which is 35 percent (assumed to be the highest applicable tax rate for individuals under section 1). Finally, all dollar amounts in the examples are abbreviated from amounts in the thousands (for example, $50 represents $50,000). The examples are as follows:

# Example 1.
(i) AA, an individual, has items from sources outside the United States only in the passive category for the taxable year. AA has $1000 of long-term capital gains from sources outside the United States that are subject to tax at a rate of 15 percent under section 1(h). AA has $700 of long-term capital losses from sources outside the United States, which are not described in section 1(h)(4)(B)(i) or (iii). For the same taxable year, AA has $800 of long-term capital gains from sources within the United States that are taxed at a rate of 28 percent under section 1(h). AA also has $100 of long-term capital losses from sources within the United States, which are not described in section 1(h)(4)(B)(i) or (iii). AA also has $500 of ordinary income from sources within the United States. The highest tax rate in effect under section 1(h) for the taxable year with respect to long-term capital gains other than long-term capital gains described in section 1(h)(4)(A) or (h)(6) is 15 percent. Accordingly, AA's long-term capital losses are in the 15 percent rate group.
(ii) AA's items of ordinary income, capital gain and capital loss for the taxable year are summarized in the following table:
U.S.
source
Foreign
source: passive
15% rate group
($100)
$1,000
(700)
28% rate group
800
Ordinary income
500
(iii) AA's capital gain net income from sources outside the United States ($300) does not exceed AA's capital gain net income from all sources ($1,000). Therefore, paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not require any reduction of AA's capital gain net income in the passive category.
(iv) In computing AA's taxable income from sources outside the United States in the numerator of the section 904(a) foreign tax credit limitation fraction for the passive category, AA's $300 of capital gain net income in the 15 rate group in the passive category must be adjusted as required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. AA adjusts the $300 of capital gain net income using 15 percent as the alternative tax rate, as follows: $300 (15%/35%).
(v) In computing AA's entire taxable income in the denominator of the section 904(a) foreign tax credit limitation fraction, AA combines the $300 of capital gain net income from sources outside the United States and the $100 net capital loss from sources within the United States in the same rate group (15 percent). AA must adjust the resulting $200 ($300 − $100) of net capital gain in the 15 percent rate group as required under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, using 15 percent as the alternative tax rate, as follows: $200 (15%/35%). AA must also adjust the $800 of net capital gain in the 28 percent rate group, using 28 percent as the alternative tax rate, as follows: $800 (28%/35%). AA must also include ordinary income from sources outside the United States in the numerator, and ordinary income from all sources in the denominator, of the foreign tax credit limitation fraction.
(vi) AA's passive category foreign tax credit limitation fraction is $128.58/$1225.72, computed as follows:

(ii) BB's capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in the aggregate (zero, since losses exceed gains) does not exceed BB's capital gain net income from all sources ($300). Therefore, paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not require any reduction of BB's capital gain net income in the passive category.
(iii) In computing BB's taxable income from sources outside the United States in the numerators of the section 904(a) foreign tax credit limitation fractions for the passive and general limitation categories, BB must adjust capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in each separate category long-tem rate group and net capital losses from sources outside the United States in each separate category rate group as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) and (d) of this section.
(A) The $100 of capital gain net income in the 15 percent rate group in the passive category is adjusted under paragraph (c)(1) of this section as follows: $100 (15%/35%).
(B) BB must adjust the net capital losses in the 15 percent and 28 percent rate groups in the general limitation category in accordance with the ordering rules contained in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, BB's net capital loss in the 15 percent rate group is netted against capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in other separate categories in the same rate group. Thus, $100 of the $500 net capital loss in the 15 percent rate group in the general limitation category offsets $100 of capital gain net income in the 15 percent rate group in the passive category. Accordingly, $100 of the $500 net capital loss is adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section as follows: $100 (15%/35%).
(C) Next, under paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, BB's net capital losses from sources outside the United States in any separate category rate group are netted against capital gain net income in the same rate group from sources within the United States. Thus, $300 of the $500 net capital loss in the 15 percent rate group in the general limitation category offsets $300 of capital gain net income in the 15 percent rate group from sources within the United States. Accordingly, $300 of the $500 net capital loss is adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section as follows: $300 (15%/35%). Similarly, the $300 of net capital loss in the 28 percent rate group in the general limitation category offsets $300 of capital gain net income in the 28 percent rate group from sources within the United States. The $300 net capital loss is adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section as follows: $300 (28%/35%).
(D) Finally, under paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the remaining net capital losses in a separate category rate group are netted against capital gain net income from other rate groups from sources within and outside the United States. Thus, the remaining $100 of the $500 net capital loss in the 15 percent rate group in the general limitation category offsets $100 of the remaining capital gain net income in the 28 percent rate group from sources within the United States. Accordingly, the remaining $100 of net capital loss is adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section as follows: $100 (28%/35%).
(iv) In computing BB's entire taxable income in the denominator of the section 904(a) foreign tax credit limitation fractions, BB must adjust net capital gain by netting all of BB's capital gains and losses, from sources within and outside the United States, and adjusting any remaining net capital gains, based on rate group, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. BB must also include foreign source ordinary income in the numerators, and ordinary income from all sources in the denominator, of the foreign tax credit limitation fractions. The denominator of BB's foreign tax credit limitation fractions reflects $2,000 of ordinary income from all sources, $100 of net capital gain taxed at the 28% rate and adjusted as follows: $100 (28%/35%), and $200 of net capital gain taxed at the 25% rate and adjusted as follows: $200 (25%/35%).
(v) BB's foreign tax credit limitation fraction for the general limitation category is $8.56/$2222.86, computed as follows:

(ii) CC's capital gain net income from sources outside the United States (zero, since losses exceed gains) does not exceed CC's capital gain net income from all sources ($100). Therefore, paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not require any adjustment.
(iii) In computing CC's taxable income from sources outside the United States in the numerators of the section 904(a) foreign tax credit limitation fractions for the passive and general limitation categories, CC must adjust capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in each separate category long-tem rate group and net capital losses from sources outside the United States in each separate category rate group as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) and (d) of this section.
(A) CC must adjust the $50 of capital gain net income in the 28 percent rate group in the passive category pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section as follows: $50 (28%/35%).
(B) Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, $50 of CC's $150 net capital loss in the 28 percent rate group in the general limitation category offsets $50 of capital gain net income in the 28 percent rate group in the passive category. Thus, $50 of the $150 net capital loss is adjusted as follows: $50 (28%/35%). Next, under paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the remaining $100 of net capital loss in the 28 percent rate group in the general limitation category offsets $100 of capital gain net income in the 28 percent rate group from sources within the United States. Thus, the remaining $100 of net capital loss is adjusted as follows: $100 (28%/35%).
(C) Under paragraphs (d)(2)(iii)(A) and (d)(2)(iv) of this section, the net capital losses in the 15 percent rate group in the passive and general limitation categories offset on a pro rata basis the $300 of capital gain net income in the 15 percent rate group from sources within the United States. The proportionate amount of the $720 net capital loss ($720/$800 of $300, or $270) is adjusted as follows: $270 (15%/35%). The proportionate amount of the $80 net capital loss ($80/$800 of $300, or $30) is adjusted as follows $30 (15%/35%).
(D) Of the remaining $500 of net capital loss in the 15 percent rate group in the general limitation and passive categories, $400 offsets the remaining $400 of capital gain net income in the 28 percent rate group from sources within the United States under paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B)(
3
) of this section. The proportionate amount of the $720 net capital loss ($720/$800 of $400, or $360) is adjusted as follows: $360 (28%/35%). The proportionate amount of the $80 net capital loss ($80/$800 of $400, or $40) is adjusted as follows: $40 (28%/35%).
(E) Under paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B)(
3
) of this section, the remaining $100 of net capital loss in the 15 percent rate group in the general limitation and passive limitation categories offsets $100 of capital gain net income in the 25 percent rate group from sources within the United States. The proportionate amount of the $720 net capital loss ($720/$800 of $100, or $90) is adjusted as follows: $90 (25%/35%). The proportionate amount of the $80 net capital loss ($80/$800 of $100 of $10) is adjusted as follows: $10 (25%/35%).
(iv) In computing CC's entire taxable income in the denominator of the section 904(a) foreign tax credit limitation fractions, CC must adjust capital gain net income by netting all of CC's capital gains and losses, from sources within and outside the United
States, and adjusting any remaining net capital gains, based on rate group, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The denominator of CC's foreign tax credit limitation fractions reflects $2,500 of ordinary income from all sources and $100 of net capital gain taxed at the 25% rate and adjusted as follows: $100 (25%/35%).
(v) CC's foreign tax credit limitation fraction for the general limitation category is $412/$2571.42, computed as follows:

(ii) DD's capital gain net income from outside the United States ($800) exceeds DD's capital gain net income from all sources ($720). Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, DD must apportion the $80 of excess of capital gain net income from sources outside the United States between the general limitation and passive categories based on the amount of capital gain net income in each separate category. Thus, one-half ($400/$800 of $100, or $40) is apportioned to the general limitation category and one-half ($400/$800 of $80, or $40) is apportioned to the passive category. The $40 apportioned to the general limitation category reduces DD's $500 short-term capital gain in the general limitation category to $460. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the $40 apportioned to the passive category must be apportioned further between the capital gain net income in the short-term rate group and the 15 percent rate group based on the relative amounts of capital gain net income in each rate group. Thus, one-fourth ($100/$400 of $40 or $10) is apportioned to the short-term rate group and three-fourths ($300/$400 of $40 or $30) is apportioned to the 15 percent rate group. DD's passive category includes $90 of short-term capital gain and $270 of capital gain net income in the 15% rate group.
(iii) Because DD has a net long-term capital loss from sources within the United States ($80) and also has short-term capital gains, DD must apply the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section to determine the amount of DD's $270 of capital gain net income in the 15% rate group that is subject to a rate differential adjustment under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Under
Step 1
, the U.S. long-term capital loss adjustment amount is $50 ($80-$30). Under
Step 2
, the applicable rate differential amount is the excess of the remaining capital gain net income over the U.S. long-term adjustment amount. Thus, the applicable rate differential amount is $220 ($270 − $50). In computing DD's taxable income from sources outside the United States in the numerator of the section 904(a) foreign tax credit limitation fraction for the passive category, DD must adjust this amount as follows: $220 (15%/35%). DD does not adjust the remaining $50 of capital gain net income in the 15% rate group.
(iv) The amount of capital gain net income in the 15% rate group in the passive category, taking into account the adjustment pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section
and disregarding the adjustment pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, is $270. Under paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (d)(2)(v) of this section, DD's $100 net capital loss in the 15% rate group in the general limitation category offsets capital gain net income in the 15% rate group in the passive category. Accordingly, the $100 of net capital loss is adjusted as follows: $100 (15%/35%).
(v) In computing DD's entire taxable income in the denominator of the section 904(a) foreign tax credit limitation fractions, DD must adjust capital gain net income by netting all of DD's capital gains and losses from sources within and outside the United States, and adjusting the remaining net capital gain in each rate group pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The denominator of DD's foreign tax credit limitation fraction reflects $500 of ordinary income from all sources, $600 of short-term capital gain and $120 of net capital gain in the 15 percent rate group adjusted as follows: $120 (15%/35%).
(vi) DD's foreign tax credit limitation fraction for the general limitation category is $417.14/$1151.43, computed as follows:

(ii) EE's capital gain net income from sources outside the United States ($600) exceeds EE's capital gain net income from all sources ($480). Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the $120 of excess capital gain net income from sources outside the United States is allocated as a reduction to the passive category and must be apportioned pro rata to each rate group within the passive category with capital gain net income. Thus, $20 ($100/$600 of $120) is apportioned to the short-term rate group, $60 ($300/$600 of $120) is apportioned to the 15 percent rate group and $40 ($200/$600 of $120) is apportioned to the 28 percent rate group. After application of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, EE has $80 of capital gain net income in the short-term rate group, $240 of capital gain net income in the 15 percent rate group and $160 of capital gain net income in the 28 percent rate group.
(iii) Because EE has a net long-term capital loss from sources within the United States ($150) and also has short-term capital gains, EE must apply the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section to determine the amount of EE's remaining $400 ($240 + $160) of capital gain net income in long-term rate groups in the passive category that is subject to a rate differential adjustment to a rate differential adjustment. Under
Step 1
, the U.S. long-term capital loss adjustment amount is $50 ($150-$100). Under
Step 2
, EE must apportion this amount pro rata to each long-term rate group within the passive category with capital gain net income. Thus, $30 ($240/$400 of $50) is apportioned to the 15 percent rate group and $20 ($160/$400 of $50) is apportioned to the 28 percent rate group. The applicable rate differential amount for the 15 percent rate group is $210 ($240 − $30). The applicable rate differential amount for the 28 percent rate group is $140 ($160 − $20).
(iv) Pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, EE must adjust $210 of the $240 capital gain in the 15 percent rate group as follows: $210 (15%/35%). EE does not adjust the remaining $30. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, EE must adjust $140 of the $160 capital gain in the 28 percent rate group as follows: $140 (28%/35%). EE does not adjust the remaining $20.
(v) In computing EE's entire taxable income in the denominator of the section 904(a) foreign tax credit limitation fractions, EE must adjust capital gain net income by netting all of EE's capital gains and losses from sources within and outside the United States, and adjusting the remaining net capital gain in each rate group pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The denominator of EE's foreign tax credit limitation fraction reflects $500 of ordinary income from all sources, $130 of short-term capital gain, $150 of net capital gain in the 15 percent rate group adjusted as follows: $150 (15%/35%), and $200 of net capital gain in the 28 percent rate group adjusted as follows: $200 (28%/35%).

Coordination with section 904(f)
—(1)
In general.
Section 904(b) and this section shall apply before the provisions of section 904(f) as follows:
(i) The amount of a taxpayer's separate limitation income or loss in each separate category, the amount of overall foreign loss, and the amount of any additions to or recapture of separate limitation loss or overall foreign loss accounts pursuant to section 904(f) shall be determined after applying paragraphs (a), (c)(1), (d) and (e) of this section to adjust capital gains and losses and qualified dividend income from sources outside the United States in each separate category.
(ii) To the extent a capital loss from sources within the United States reduces a taxpayer's foreign source taxable income under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, such capital loss shall be disregarded in determining the amount of a taxpayer's taxable income from sources within the United States for purposes of computing the amount of any additions to the taxpayer's overall foreign loss accounts.
(iii) In determining the amount of a taxpayer's loss from sources in the United States under section 904(f)(5)(D) (section 904(f)(5)(D) amount), the taxpayer shall make appropriate adjustments to capital gains and losses from sources within the United States to reflect adjustments pursuant to section 904(b)(2) and this section. Therefore, for purposes of section 904, a taxpayer's section 904(f)(5)(D) amount shall be equal to the excess of the taxpayer's foreign source taxable income in all separate categories in the aggregate for the taxable year (taking into account any adjustments pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1), (c)(1), (d) and (e) of this section) over the taxpayer's entire taxable income for the taxable year (taking into account any adjustments pursuant to paragraphs (c)(2) and (e) of this section).

(ii) In computing W's taxable income from sources outside the United States for purposes of section 904 and this section, W must adjust the capital gain net income and net capital loss in each separate category as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) and (d) of this section. Thus, W must adjust the $100 of capital gain net income in the general limitation category and the $400 of net capital loss in the passive category as follows: $100 (15%/35%) and $400 (15%/35%).
(iii) After the adjustment to W's net capital loss in the passive category, W has a $171.43 separate limitation loss in the passive category. After the adjustment to W's capital gain in the general limitation category, W has $142.86 of foreign source taxable income in the general limitation category. Thus, $142.86 of the separate limitation loss reduces foreign source taxable income in the general limitation category. See section 904(f)(5)(B). W adds $142.86 to the separate limitation loss account for the passive category. The remaining $28.57 of the separate limitation loss reduces income from sources within the United States. See section 904(f)(5)(A). Thus, W adds $28.57 to the overall foreign loss account for the passive category.

(ii) X's capital gain net income from sources outside the United States ($700) exceeds X's capital gain net income from all sources ($200). Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, X must reduce the $700 capital gain in the general limitation category by $500. After the adjustment, X has $200 of capital gain net income remaining in the general limitation category. Thus, X has an overall foreign loss attributable to the general limitation category of $800.
(iii) For purposes of computing the amount of the addition to X's overall foreign loss account for the general limitation category, the $500 capital loss from sources within the United States is disregarded and X's taxable income from sources within the United States is $1100. Accordingly, X must increase its overall foreign loss account for the general limitation category by $800.

Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, Y must reduce the $200 capital gain in the passive category by $100. Y has $100 of capital gain net income remaining in the passive category.
(iii) Y is not required to make adjustments pursuant to paragraph (c), (d) or (e) of this section. See paragraphs (b) and (e) of this section. Y's foreign source taxable income in the passive category after the adjustment pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section is $600. Y's entire taxable income for the taxable year is $400.
(iv) Y's section 904(f)(5)(D) amount is the excess of Y's foreign source taxable income in all separate categories in the aggregate for the taxable year after taking into account the adjustment pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section ($600) over Y's entire taxable income for the taxable year ($400). Therefore, Y's section 904(f)(5)(D) amount is $200 and Y's foreign source taxable income in the passive category is reduced to $400. See section 904(f)(5)(D).

(iii) In computing Z's entire taxable income in the denominator of the section 904(d) foreign tax credit limitation fractions, Z must adjust the $100 of net capital gain in the 15 percent rate group pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section as follows: $100 (15%/35%). Thus, Z's entire taxable income for the taxable year, taking into account the adjustment pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, is $442.86.
(iv) Z's section 904(f)(5)(D) amount is the excess of Z's foreign source taxable income in all separate categories in the aggregate for the taxable year ($600) over Z's entire taxable income for the taxable year after the adjustment pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section ($442.86). Therefore, Z's section 904(f)(5)(D) amount is $157.32. This amount must be allocated pro rata to the passive and general limitation categories in accordance with section 904(f)(5)(D).

(ii) In determining O's taxable income from sources outside the United States, O must reduce the $500 capital loss in the general limitation category to $214.29 ($500 × 15%/35%) pursuant to paragraph (d) of this
section. Taking this adjustment into account, O's foreign source taxable income in all of O's separate categories in the aggregate is $1285.71 ($1000 − $214.29 + $500).
(iii) In computing O's entire taxable income in the denominator of the section 904(a) foreign tax credit limitation fraction, O must reduce the $600 of net capital gain for the year to $257.14 ($600 × 15%/35%) pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Taking this adjustment into account, O's entire taxable income for the year is $757.14 ($500 + $257.14).
(iv) Therefore, O's section 904(f)(5)(D) amount is $528.57 ($1285.71 − $757.14). This amount must be allocated pro rata to O's $500 of income in the passive category and O's $785.71 of adjusted income in the general limitation category in accordance with section 904(f)(5)(D).

For purposes of section 904(a), in the case of a domestic corporation which is a United States shareholder with respect to a specified 10-percent owned foreign corporation (as defined in section 245A(b)), the domestic corporation's foreign source taxable income in a separate category and entire taxable income is determined without regard to the following items:
(i) Any dividend for which a deduction is allowed under section 245A;
(ii) Deductions properly allocable or apportioned to gross income in the section 245A subgroup as determined under paragraphs (b) and (c)(1) of this section; and
(iii) Deductions properly allocable or apportioned to stock of specified 10-percent owned foreign corporations in the section 245A subgroup as determined under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(2)
Deductions properly allocable or apportioned to the residual grouping.
Deductions that are properly allocable or apportioned to gross income or stock in the section 245A subgroup of the residual grouping (consisting of U.S. source income) are disregarded solely for purposes of determining entire taxable income under section 904(a).
(b)
Determining properly allocable or apportioned deductions.
The amount of deductions properly allocable or apportioned to gross income or stock described in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (iii)
of this section is determined by subdividing the United States shareholder's gross income and assets in each separate category described in § 1.904-5(a)(4)(v) into a section 245A subgroup and a non-section 245A subgroup. Gross income and assets in the residual grouping for U.S. source income are also subdivided into a section 245A subgroup and a non-section 245A subgroup. Each section 245A subgroup is treated as a statutory grouping under § 1.861-8(a)(4). Deductions properly allocable or apportioned to dividends or stock described in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section only include those deductions that are allocated and apportioned under §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T and 1.861-17 to the section 245A subgroups. The deduction allowed under section 245A(a) for dividends is allocated and apportioned solely among the section 245A subgroups on the basis of the relative amounts of gross income from such dividends in each section 245A subgroup.
(c)
Income and assets in the 245A subgroups
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of applying the section 861 regulations (as defined in § 1.861-8(a)) to the deductions of a United States shareholder, the only gross income included in a section 245A subgroup is dividend income for which a deduction is allowed under section 245A. The only asset included in a section 245A subgroup is the portion of the value of stock of each specified 10-percent owned foreign corporation that is assigned to the section 245A subgroup determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(2)
Assigning stock to a subgroup.
The value of stock of a specified 10-percent owned foreign corporation is characterized as an asset in a separate category described in § 1.904-5(a)(4)(v) or the residual grouping for U.S. source income under the rules of § 1.861-12(c). If the specified 10-percent owned foreign corporation is not a controlled foreign corporation, all of the value of its stock (other than the portion of stock assigned to the statutory groupings for gross section 245(a)(5) income under §§ 1.861-12(c)(4) and 1.861-13) in each separate category and in the residual grouping for U.S. source income is assigned to the section 245A subgroup in such separate category or residual grouping. If the specified 10-percent owned foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation, a portion of the value of stock in each separate category and in the residual grouping for U.S. source income is subdivided between a section 245A and non-section 245A subgroup under § 1.861-13(a)(5).
(d)
Coordination with OFL and ODL rules
—(1)
In general.
Section 904(b)(4) and this section apply before the operation of the overall foreign loss rules in section 904(f) and the overall domestic loss rules in section 904(g).
See
§ 1.904(g)-3(c).
(2)
Net operating losses.
If the taxpayer has a net operating loss in the current taxable year, then solely for purposes of determining the source and separate category of the net operating loss, the overall foreign loss rules in section 904(f) and the overall domestic loss rules in section 904(g) are applied without taking into account the adjustments required under section 904(b) and this section.
(e)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this section.
(1)
Facts
—(i)
Income and assets of USP.
USP is a domestic corporation. USP owns a factory in the United States with a tax book value of $27,000x. USP also directly owns all of the stock of each of the following three controlled foreign corporations: CFC1, CFC2, and CFC3. USP's tax book value in each of CFC1, CFC2, and CFC3 is $10,000x. USP incurs $1,500x of interest expense and earns $1,600x of U.S. source gross income. Under section 951A and the section 951A regulations (as defined in § 1.951A-1(a)(1)), USP's GILTI inclusion amount is $2,200x. USP's deduction under section 250 is $1,100x (“section 250 deduction”), all of which is by reason of section 250(a)(1)(B)(i). No portion of USP's section 250 deduction is reduced by reason of section 250(a)(2)(B). None of the CFCs makes any distributions.
(ii)
Characterization of CFC stock.
After application of § 1.861-13(a), USP determined that $8,000x of the stock of each of CFC1, CFC2, and CFC3 is assigned to the section 951A category (“section 951A category stock”) in the non-section 245A subgroup and the remaining $2,000x of the stock of each of CFC1, CFC2, and CFC3 is assigned to
the general category (“general category stock”) in the section 245A subgroup. Additionally, under § 1.861-8(d)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
), $4,000x of the stock of each of CFC1, CFC2, and CFC3 that is section 951A category stock is an exempt asset. Accordingly, with respect to the stock of its controlled foreign corporations in the aggregate, USP has $12,000x of section 951A category stock in a non-section 245A subgroup; $6,000x of general category stock in a section 245A subgroup; and $12,000x of stock that is an exempt asset.
(iii)
Apportioning of expenses.
Taking into account USP's factory and its stock in CFC1, CFC2, and CFC3, the tax book value of USP's assets for purposes of apportioning expenses is $45,000x (excluding the $12,000x of exempt assets). Under § 1.861-9T(g), USP's $1,500 of interest expense is apportioned as follows: $400x ($1,500x × $12,000x/$45,000x) to section 951A category income, $200x ($1,500x × $6,000x/$45,000x) to general category income, and the remaining $900x ($1,500 × $27,000x/$45,000x) to the residual U.S. source grouping. Under § 1.861-8(e)(14), all of USP's section 250 deduction is allocated and apportioned to section 951A category income.
(2)
Analysis
—(i)
USP's pre-credit U.S. tax.
USP's worldwide taxable income is $1,200x, which equals its GILTI inclusion amount of $2,200x plus its U.S. source gross income of $1,600x, less its deduction under section 250 of $1,100 and its interest expense of $1,500x. For purposes of applying section 904(a), before taking into account any foreign tax credit under section 901, USP's Federal income tax liability is 21% of $1,200x, or $252x.
(ii)
Application of section 904(b)(4).
Under section 904(d)(1), USP applies section 904(a) separately to each separate category of income.
(A)
General category income.
Before application of section 904(b)(4) and the rules in this section, USP's foreign source taxable income in the general category is a loss of $200x, which equals $0 (USP's foreign source general category income) less $200x (interest expense apportioned to general category income), and USP's worldwide taxable income is $1,200. Under paragraph (d) of this section, the rules in section 904(f) and (g) apply after section 904(b)(4) and the rules in this section. Under paragraphs (b) and (c)(1) of this section, USP has no deductions properly allocable or apportioned to gross income in the section 245A subgroup because USP has no dividend income in the general category for which a deduction is allowed under section 245A. Under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, USP has $200x of deductions for interest expense that are properly allocable or apportioned to stock of specified 10-percent owned foreign corporations in the section 245A subgroup because USP's only general category assets are the general category stock of CFC1, CFC2, and CFC3, all of which are in the section 245A subgroup. Therefore, under paragraph (a) of this section, USP's foreign source taxable income in the general category and its worldwide taxable income are determined without regard to the $200x of deductions for interest expense. Accordingly, USP's foreign source taxable income in the general category is $0 and its worldwide taxable income is $1,400x, and therefore, there is no separate limitation loss for purposes of section 904(f). Under section 904(a) and (d)(1) USP's foreign tax credit limitation for the general category is $0.
(B)
Section 951A category income.
Before application of section 904(b)(4) and the rules in this section, USP's foreign source taxable income in the section 951A category is $700x, which equals $2,200x (USP's GILTI inclusion amount) less $1,100x (USP's section 250 deduction) less $400x (interest apportioned to section 951A category income). Under paragraphs (b) and (c)(1) of this section, USP has no deductions properly allocable and apportioned to gross income in a section 245A subgroup of the section 951A category. Under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, USP has no deductions properly allocable and apportioned to stock of specified 10-percent owned foreign corporations in a section 245A subgroup of section 951A category stock because no portion of section 951A category stock is assigned to a section 245A subgroup.
See
§ 1.861-13(a)(5)(v). Therefore, under paragraph (a) of this section no adjustment is made to USP's foreign source taxable income in the section 951A category. However, the adjustments to USP's
worldwide taxable income described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section apply for purposes of calculating USP's foreign tax credit limitation for the section 951A category. Accordingly, USP's foreign source taxable income in the section 951A category is $700x and its worldwide taxable income is $1,400x. Under section 904(a) and (d)(1), USP's foreign tax credit limitation for the section 951A category is $126x ($252x × $700x/$1,400x).

§ 1.904(f)-1
Overall foreign loss and the overall foreign loss account.
(a)(1)
Overview of regulations.
In general, section 904(f) and these regulations apply to any taxpayer that sustains an overall foreign loss (as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section) in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1975. For taxable years ending after December 31, 1984, and beginning before January 1, 1987, there can be five types of overall foreign losses: a loss under each of the five separate limitations contained in former section 904(d)(1)(A) (passive interest limitation), (d)(1)(B) (DISC dividend limitation), (d)(1)(C) (foreign trade income limitation), (d)(1)(D) (foreign sales corporation (FSC) distributions limitation), and (d)(1)(E) (general limitation). For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982, and ending before January 1, 1985, there can be three types of overall foreign losses under former section 904(d)(1)(A) (passive interest limitation), former section 904(d)(1)(B) (DISC dividend limitation) and former section 904(d)(1)(C) (general limitation). For taxpayers subject to section 907, the post-1982 general limitation overall foreign loss account may be further subdivided, as provided in § 1.904(f)-6. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, and before January 1, 1983, taxpayers should have computed overall foreign losses separately under the passive interest limitation, the DISC dividend limitation, the general limitation, and the section 907(b) (FORI) limitation. However, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, and before January 1, 1983, taxpayers may have computed only two types of overall foreign losses: A foreign oil related loss under the FORI limitation and an overall foreign loss computed on a combined basis for the passive interest limitation, the DISC dividend limitation, and the general limitation. A taxpayer that computed overall foreign losses for these years on a combined basis will not be required to amend its return to recompute such losses on a separate basis. If a taxpayer computed its overall foreign losses for these years separately under the passive interest limitation, the DISC dividend limitation, and the general limitation, on returns previously filed, a taxpayer may not amend those returns to compute such overall foreign losses on a combined basis. Section 1.904(f)-1 provides rules for determining a taxpayer's overall foreign losses, for establishing overall foreign loss accounts, and for making additions to and reductions of such accounts for purposes of section 904(f). Section 1.904(f)-2 provides rules for recapturing the balance in any overall foreign loss account under the general recapture rule of section 904(f)(1) and under the special recapture rule of section 904(f)(3) when the taxpayer disposes of property used predominantly outside the United States in a trade or business. Section 1.904(f)-3 provides rules for allocating overall foreign losses that are part of net operating losses or net capital losses to foreign source income in years to which such losses are carried. In addition, § 1.904(f)-3 provides transition rules for the treatment of net operating losses incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982, and carried back to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983, and of net operating losses incurred in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983, and carried forward to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982. Section 1.904(f)-4 provides rules for recapture out of an accumulation distribution of
a foreign trust. Section 1.904(f)-5 provides rules for recapture of overall foreign losses of domestic trusts. Section 1.904(f)-6 provides a transition rule for recapturing a taxpayer's pre-1983 overall foreign losses under the general limitation and the FORI limitation out of taxable income subject to the general limitation in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982. Section § 1.1502-9 provides rules concerning the application of these regulations to corporations filing consolidated returns.
(2)
Application to post-1986 taxable years.
The principles of §§ 1.904(f)-1 through 1.904(f)-5 shall apply to any overall foreign loss sustained in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, modified so as to take into account the effect of statutory amendments.
(b)
Overall foreign loss accounts.
Any taxpayer that sustains an overall foreign loss under paragraph (c) of this section must establish an account for such loss. Separate types of overall foreign losses must be kept in separate accounts. For taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1983, taxpayers that computed losses on a combined basis in accordance with § 1.904(f)-1(c)(1) will keep one overall foreign loss account for such overall foreign loss. The balance in each overall foreign loss account represents the amount of such overall foreign loss subject to recapture by the taxpayer in a given year. From year to year, amounts may be added to or subtracted from the balances in such accounts as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. The taxpayer must report the balances (if any) in its overall foreign loss accounts annually on a Form 1116 or 1118. Such forms must be filed for each taxable year ending after September 24, 1987. The balance in each account does not have to be attributed to the year or years in which the loss was incurred.
(c)
Determination of a taxpayer's overall foreign loss
—(1)
Overall foreign loss defined.
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982, and before January 1, 1987, a taxpayer sustains an overall foreign loss in any taxable year in which its gross income from sources without the United States subject to a separate limitation (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) is exceeded by the sum of the deductions properly allocated and apportioned thereto. Such losses are to be determined separately in accordance with the principles of the separate limitations. Accordingly, income and deductions subject to a separate limitation are not to be netted with income and deductions subject to another separate limitation for purposes of determining the amount of an overall foreign loss. A taxpayer may, for example, have an overall foreign loss under the general limitation in the same taxable year in which it has taxable income under the DISC dividend limitation. The same principles of calculating overall foreign losses on a separate limitation basis apply for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983, except that a taxpayer shall determine its overall foreign losses on a combined basis, except for income subject to the FORI limitation, if the taxpayer filed its pre-1983 returns on such basis. Thus, for taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1983, a taxpayer can net income and losses among the passive interest limitation, the DISC dividend limitation, and the general limitation if the taxpayer calculated its overall foreign losses that way at the time. Taxpayers that computed overall foreign losses separately under each of the separate limitations on their returns filed for taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1983, may not amend such returns to compute their overall foreign losses for pre-1983 years on a combined basis.
(2)
Separate limitation defined.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section and these regulations, the term separate limitation means any of the separate limitations under former section 904(d)(1)(A) (passive interest limitation), (B) (DISC dividend limitation), (C) (foreign trade income limitation), (D) (FSC distributions limitation), and (E) (general limitation) and the separate limitation under section 907(b) (FORI limitation) (for taxable years ending after December 31, 1975, and beginning before January 1, 1983).
(3)
Method of allocation and apportionment of deductions.
In determining its overall foreign loss, a taxpayer shall allocate and apportion expenses, losses,
and other deductions to the appropriate category of gross income in accordance with section 862(b) and § 1.861-8 of the regulations. However, the following deductions shall not be taken into account:
(i) The amount of any net operating loss deduction for such year under section 172(a); and
(ii) To the extent such losses are not compensated for by insurance or otherwise, the amount of any—
(A) Expropriation losses for such year (as defined in section 172(h)), or
(B) Losses for such year which arise from fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty, or from theft.
(d)
Additions to the overall foreign loss account
—(1)
General rule.
A taxpayer's overall foreign loss as determined under paragraph (c) of this section shall be added to the applicable overall foreign loss account at the end of its taxable year to the extent that the overall foreign loss has reduced United States source income during the taxable year or during a year to which the loss has been carried back. For rules with respect to carryovers see paragraph (d)(3) of this section and § 1.904(f)-3.
(2)
Overall foreign losses of another taxpayer.
If any portion of any overall foreign loss of another taxpayer is allocated to the taxpayer in accordance with § 1.904(f)-5 (relating to overall foreign losses of domestic trusts) or § 1.1502-9 (relating to consolidated overall foreign losses), the taxpayer shall add such amount to its applicable overall foreign loss account.
(3)
Additions to overall foreign loss account created by loss carryovers.
Subject to the adjustments under § 1.904(f)-1(d)(4), the taxpayer shall add to each overall foreign loss account—
(i) All net operating loss carryovers to the current taxable year attributable to the same limitation to the extent that overall foreign losses included in the net operating loss carryovers reduced United States source income for the taxable year, and
(ii) All capital loss carryovers to the current taxable year attributable to the same limitation to the extent that foreign source capital loss carryovers reduced United States source capital gain net income for the taxable year.
(4)
Adjustments for capital gains and losses and qualified dividend income.
If a taxpayer has capital gains or losses or qualified dividend income, as defined in section 1(h)(11), the taxpayer shall make adjustments to such capital gains and losses and qualified dividend income to the extent required under section 904(b)(2) and § 1.904(b)-1 before applying the provisions of § 1.904(f)-1. See § 1.904(b)-1(h).
(e)
Reductions of overall foreign loss accounts.
The taxpayer shall subtract the following amounts from its overall foreign loss accounts at the end of its taxable year in the following order, if applicable:
(1)
Pre-recapture reduction for amounts allocated to other taxpayers.
An overall foreign loss account is reduced by the amount of any overall foreign loss which is allocated to another taxpayer in accordance with § 1.904(f)-5 (relating to overall foreign losses of domestic trusts) or § 1.1502-9 (relating to consolidated overall foreign losses).
(2)
Reduction for amounts recaptured.
An overall foreign loss account is reduced by the amount of any foreign source income that is subject to the same limitation as the loss that resulted in the account and that is recaptured in accordance with § 1.904(f)-2 (c) (relating to recapture under section 904(f)(1)); § 1.904(f)-2 (d) (relating to recapture when the taxpayer disposes of certain properties under section 904(f)(3)); and § 1.904(f)-4 (relating to recapture when the taxpayer receives an accumulation distribution from a foreign trust under section 904(f)(4)).
(f)
Illustrations.
The rules of this section are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
X Corporation is a domestic corporation with foreign branch operations in country C. X's taxable income and losses for its taxable year 1983 are as follows:
U.S. Source taxable income
$1,000
Foreign source taxable income (loss) subject to the general limitation
($500)
Foreign source taxable income subject to the passive interest limitation
$200
X has a general limitation overall foreign loss of $500 for 1983 in accordance with paragraph (c) (1) of this section. Since the general limitation overall foreign loss is not
considered to offset income under the separate limitation for passive interest income, it therefore offsets $500 of United States source taxable income. This amount is added to X's general limitation overall foreign loss account at the end of 1983 in accordance with paragraphs (c) (1) and (d) (1) of this section.

# Example 2.
Y Corporation is a domestic corporation with foreign branch operations in Country C. Y's taxable income and losses for its taxable year 1982 are as follows:
U.S. source taxable income
$1,000
Foreign source taxable income (loss) subject to the general limitation
($500)
Foreign source taxable income subject to the passive interest limitation
$250
For its pre-1983 taxable years, Y filed its returns determining its overall foreign losses on a combined basis. In accordance with paragraphs (a) and (c) (1) of this section, Y may net the foreign source income and loss before offsetting the United States source income. Y therefore has a section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss account of $250 at the end of 1982.

# Example 3.
X Corporation is a domestic corporation with foreign branch operations in country C. For its taxable year 1985, X has taxable income (loss) determined as follows:
U.S. source taxable income
$200
Foreign source taxable income (loss) subject to the general limitation
($1,000)
Foreign source taxable income (loss) subject to the passive limitation
$1,800
X has a general limitation overall foreign loss of $1,000 in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The overall foreign loss offsets $200 of United States source taxable income in 1985 and, therefore, X has a $200 general limitation overall foreign loss account at the end of 1985. The remaining $800 general limitation loss is offset by the passive interest limitation income in 1985 so that X has no net operating loss carryover that is attributable to the general limitation loss and no additional amount attributable to that loss will be added to the overall foreign loss account in 1985 or in any other year.
(g)
Effective/applicability date.
Paragraphs (a)(2) and (d)(4) of this section shall apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2012. Taxpayers may choose to apply paragraphs (a)(2) and (d)(4) of this section to other taxable years beginning after December 21, 2007, including periods covered by 26 CFR 1.904(f)-1T (revised as of April 1, 2010).
[T.D. 8153, 52 FR 31994, Aug. 25, 1987; 52 FR 43434, Nov. 12, 1987, as amended by T.D. 9371, 72 FR 72597, Dec. 21, 2007; T.D. 9595, 77 FR 37578, June 22, 2012]
§ 1.904(f)-2
Recapture of overall foreign losses.
(a)
In general.
A taxpayer shall be required to recapture an overall foreign loss as provided in this section. Recapture is accomplished by treating as United States source income a portion of the taxpayer's foreign source taxable income of the same limitation as the foreign source loss that resulted in an overall foreign loss account. As a result, if the taxpayer elects the benefits of section 901 or section 936, the taxpayer's foreign tax credit limitation with respect to such income is decreased. As provided in § 1.904 (f)-1(e)(2), the balance in a taxpayer's overall foreign loss account is reduced by the amount of loss recaptured. Recapture continues until such time as the amount of foreign source taxable income recharacterized as United States source income equals the amount in the overall foreign loss account. As provided in § 1.904 (f)-1(e)(2), the balance in an overall foreign loss account is reduced at the end of each taxable year by the amount of the loss recaptured during that taxable year. Regardless of whether recapture occurs in a year in which a taxpayer elects the benefits of section 901 or in a year in which a taxpayer deducts its foreign taxes under section 164, the overall foreign loss account is recaptured only to the extent of foreign source taxable income remaining after applying the appropriate section 904(b) adjustments, if any, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Determination of taxable income from sources without the United States for purposes of recapture
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of determining the amount of an overall foreign loss subject to recapture, the taxpayer's taxable income from sources without the United States shall be computed with respect to each of the separate limitations described in § 1.904 (f)-1(c)(2) in accordance with the rules set forth in § 1.904 (f)-1(c) (1) and (3). This computation is made without
taking into account foreign source taxable income (and deductions properly allocated and apportioned thereto) subject to other separate limitations. Before applying the recapture rules to foreign source taxable income, the following provisions shall be applied to such income in the following order:
(i) Former section 904(b)(3)(C) (prior to its removal by the Tax Reform Act of 1986) and the regulations thereunder shall be applied to treat certain foreign source gain as United States source gain; and
(ii) Section 904(b)(2) and the regulations thereunder shall be applied to make adjustments in the foreign tax credit limitation fraction for certain capital gains and losses.
(c)
Section 904(f)(1) recapture
—(1)
In general.
In a taxable year in which a taxpayer elects the benefits of section 901 or section 30A, the section 904(f)(1) recapture amount is the amount of foreign source taxable income subject to recharacterization in a taxable year in which recapture of an overall foreign loss is required under paragraph (a) of this section. The section 904(f)(1) recapture amount equals the lesser of the aggregate amount of maximum potential recapture in all overall foreign loss accounts or fifty percent of the taxpayer's total foreign source taxable income. If the aggregate amount of maximum potential recapture in all overall foreign loss accounts exceeds fifty percent of the taxpayer's total foreign source taxable income, foreign source taxable income in each separate category with an overall foreign loss account is recharacterized in an amount equal to the section 904(f)(1) recapture amount, multiplied by the maximum potential recapture in the overall foreign loss account, divided by the aggregate amount of maximum potential recapture in all overall foreign loss accounts. The maximum potential recapture in an overall foreign loss account in a separate category is the lesser of the balance in that overall foreign loss account or the foreign source taxable income for the year in the same separate category as the loss account. If, in any taxable year, in accordance with sections 164(a) and 275(a)(4)(A), a taxpayer deducts rather than credits its foreign taxes, recapture is applied to the extent of the lesser of—
(i) The balance in the overall foreign loss account in each separate category; or
(ii) Foreign source taxable income (net of foreign taxes) in each separate category.
(2)
Election to recapture more of the overall foreign loss than is required under paragraph (c)(1).
In a year in which a taxpayer elects the benefits of sections 901 or 936, a taxpayer may make an annual revocable election to recapture a greater portion of the balance in an overall foreign loss account than is required to be recaptured under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A taxpayer may make such an election or amend a prior election by attaching a statement to its annual Form 1116 or 1118. If an amendment is made to a prior year's election, an amended tax return should be filed. The statement attached to the Form 1116 or 1118 must indicate the percentage and dollar amount of the taxpayer's foreign source taxable income that is being recharacterized as United States source income and the percentage and dollar amount of the balance (both before and after recapture) in the overall foreign loss account that is being recaptured. Except for the special recapture rules for section 936 corporations and for recapture of pre-1983 overall foreign losses determined on a combined basis, the taxpayer that elects to credit its foreign taxes may not elect to recapture an amount in excess of the taxpayer's foreign source taxable income subject to the same limitation as the loss that resulted in the overall foreign loss account.
(3)
Special rule for recapture of losses incurred prior to section 936 election.
If a corporation elects the application of section 936 and at the time of the election has a balance in any overall foreign loss account, such losses will be recaptured from the possessions source income of the electing section 936 corporation that qualifies for the section 936 credit, including qualified possession source investment income as defined in section 936(d)(2), even though the overall foreign loss to be recaptured may not be attributable to a loss in an income category of a type that
would meet the definition of qualified possession source investment income. For purposes of recapturing an overall foreign loss incurred by a consolidated group including a corporation that subsequently elects to use section 936, the electing section 936 corporation's possession source income that qualifies for the section 936 credit, including qualified possession source investment income, shall be used to recapture the section 936 corporation's share of previously incurred overall foreign loss accounts. Rules for determining the section 936 corporation's share of the consolidated groups overall foreign loss accounts are provided in § 1.1502-9(c).
(4)
Recapture of pre-1983 overall foreign losses determined on a combined basis.
If a taxpayer computed its overall foreign losses on a combined basis in accordance with § 1.904(f)-1(c)(1) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983, any losses recaptured in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982, shall be recaptured from income subject to the general limitation, subject to the rules in § 1.904(f)-6 (a) and (b). Ordering rules for recapture of these losses are provided in § 1.904(f)-6(c).
(5)
Illustrations.
The rules of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by the following examples, all of which assume a United States corporate tax rate of 50 percent unless otherwise stated.

# Example 1.
X Corporation is a domestic corporation that does business in the United States and abroad. On December 31, 1983, the balance in X's general limitation overall foreign loss account is $600, all of which is attributable to a loss incurred in 1983. For 1984, X has United States source taxable income of $500 and foreign source taxable income subject to the general limitation of $500. For 1984, X pays $200 in foreign taxes and elects section 901. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, X is required to recapture $250 (the lesser of $600 or 50 percent of $500) of its overall foreign loss. As a consequence, X's foreign tax credit limitation under the general limitation is $250/$1,000 × $500, or $125, instead of $500/$1,000 × $500, or $250. The balance in X's general limitation overall foreign loss account is reduced by $250 in accordance with § 1.904(f)-1(e)(2).

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example 1 except that X makes an election to recapture its overall foreign loss to the extent of 80 percent of its foreign source taxable income subject to the general limitation (or $400) in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. As a result of recapture, X's 1984 foreign tax credit limitation for income subject to the general limitation is $100/$1,000 × $500, or $50, instead of $500/$1,000 × $500, or $250. X's general limitation overall foreign loss account is reduced by $400 in accordance with § 1.904(f)-1(e)(2).

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example 1 except that X does not elect the benefits of section 901 in 1984 and instead deducts its foreign taxes paid. In 1984, X recaptures $300 of its overall foreign loss, the difference between X's foreign source taxable income of $500 and $200 of foreign taxes paid. The balance in X's general limitation overall foreign loss account is reduced by $300 in accordance with § 1.904(f)-1(e)(2).

# Example 4.
Y Corporation is a domestic corporation that does business in the United States and abroad. On December 31, 2007, the balance in Y's general category overall foreign loss account is $500, all of which is attributable to a loss incurred in 2007. Y has no other loss accounts subject to recapture. For 2008, Y has U.S. source taxable income of $400 and foreign source taxable income of $300 in the general category and $900 in the passive category. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the amount of Y's general category income subject to recharacterization is the lesser of the aggregate maximum potential recapture or 50% of the total foreign source taxable income. In this case, Y's aggregate maximum potential recapture is $300 (the lesser of the $500 balance in the general category overall foreign loss account or $300 foreign source income in the general category for the year), which is less than 50% of Y's total foreign source taxable income ($1200 × 50% = $600). Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, $300 of foreign source income in the general category is recharacterized as U.S. source income. The balance in Y's general category overall foreign loss account is reduced to $200 in accordance with § 1.904(f)-1(e)(2).

# Example 5.
On December 31, 1980, V, a domestic corporation that does business in the United States and abroad, has a balance in its section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss account of $600. V also has a balance in its FORI limitation overall foreign loss account of $900. For 1981, V has foreign source taxable income subject to the general limitation of $500 and $500 of United States source income. V also has foreign source taxable income subject to the FORI limitation of $800. V is required to recapture $250 of its section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss account (the lesser of $600 or 50% of $500) and its general limitation foreign tax credit limitation is $250/$1,800 × $900, or $125 instead of $500/$1,800 × $900, or $250. V is also required to recapture $400 of its FORI limitation overall foreign loss account (the lesser of $900 or 50% of $800). V's foreign tax credit limitation for FORI is $400/$1,800 × $900, or $200, instead of $800/$1,800 × $900, or $400. The balance in V's
FORI limitation overall foreign loss account is reduced to $500 and the balance in V's section 904(d)(1)(A-C) account is reduced to $350, in accordance with § 1.904(f)-1(e)(2).

# Example 6.
This example assumes a United States corporate tax rate of 46 percent (under section 11(b)) and an alternative rate of tax under section 1201(a) of 28 percent. W is a domestic corporation that does business in the United States and abroad. On December 31, 1984, W has $350 in its general limitation overall foreign loss account. For 1985, W has $500 of United States source taxable income, and has foreign source income subject to the general limitation as follows:
Foreign source taxable income other than net capital gain
$720
Foreign source net capital gain
$460
Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, foreign source taxable income for purposes of recapture includes foreign source capital gain net income, reduced, under section 904(b)(2), by the rate differential portion of foreign source net capital gain, which adjusts for the reduced tax rate for net capital gain under section 1201(a):
Foreign source capital gain net income
$460
Rate differential portion of foreign source net capital gain (18/46 of $460)
−180
Foreign source capital gain included in foreign source taxable income
$280
The total foreign source taxable income of W for purposes of recapture in 1985 is $1,000 ($720 + $280). Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, W is required to recapture $350 (the lesser of $350 or 50 percent of $1,000), and W's general limitation overall foreign loss account is reduced to zero. W's foreign tax credit limitation for income subject to the general limitation is $650/$1,500 × $690 ((.46) (500 + 720) + (.28) (460)), or $299, instead of $1,000/$1,500 × $690, or $460.
(d)
Recapture of overall foreign losses from dispositions under section 904(f)(3)
— (1)
In general.
If a taxpayer disposes of property used or held for use predominantly without the United States in a trade or business during a taxable year and that property generates foreign source taxable income subject to a separate limitation to which paragraph (a) of this section applies, the applicable overall foreign loss account shall be recaptured as provided in paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(4) of this section. See paragraph (d)(5) of this section for definitions. See the ordering rules under § 1.904(g)-3(f) and (i) for coordination with other loss recapture under section 904(f) and (g).
(2)
Treatment of net capital gain.
If the gain from a disposition of property to which this paragraph (d) applies is treated as net capital gain, all references to such gain in paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section shall mean such gain as adjusted under paragraph (b) of this section. The amount by which the overall foreign loss account shall be reduced shall be determined from such adjusted gain.
(3)
Dispositions where gain is recognized irrespective of section 904 (f)(3)
—(i)
Foreign source gain.
If a taxpayer recognizes foreign source gain in a separate category on the disposition of property described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and there is a balance in a taxpayer's overall foreign loss account that is attributable to a loss in such separate category after applying paragraph (c) of this section, an additional portion of such balance shall be recaptured in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. The amount recaptured shall be the lesser of such balance or the full amount of the foreign source gain recognized on the disposition that was not previously recharacterized.
(ii)
U.S. source gain.
If a taxpayer recognizes U.S. source gain on the disposition of property described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and there is a balance in a taxpayer's overall foreign loss account that is attributable to a loss in the separate category to which the income generated by such property is assigned after applying paragraph (c) of this section, an amount of the gain shall be treated as foreign source and an additional portion of such balance equal to that amount shall be recaptured in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. The amount of gain treated as foreign source and the amount of overall foreign loss recaptured shall be the lesser of the balance in the overall foreign loss account or the full amount of the gain recognized on the disposition.
(4)
Dispositions in which gain would not otherwise be recognized
—(1)
Recognition of gain to the extent of the overall foreign loss account.
If a taxpayer makes a disposition of property described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section in which any amount of gain otherwise would not be recognized in the year of the disposition, and such property was used or held for use to generate foreign source taxable income
subject to a separate limitation under which the taxpayer had a balance in its overall foreign loss account (including a balance that arose in the year of the disposition), the taxpayer shall recognize foreign source taxable income in an amount equal to the lesser of:
(A) The sum of the balance in the applicable overall foreign loss account (but only after such balance has been increased by amounts added to the account for the year of the disposition or has been reduced by amounts recaptured for the year of the disposition under paragraph (c) and paragraph (d)(3) of this section) plus the amount of any overall foreign loss that would be part of a net operating loss for the year of the disposition if gain from the disposition were not recognized under section 904(f)(3), plus the amount of any overall foreign loss that is part of a net operating loss carryover from a prior year, or
(B) The excess of the fair market value of such property over the taxpayer's adjusted basis in such property.
The excess of the fair market value of such property over its adjusted basis shall be determined on an asset by asset basis. Losses from the disposition of an asset shall not be recognized. Any foreign source taxable income deemed received and recognized under this paragraph (d)(4)(i) will have the same character as if the property had been sold or exchanged in a taxable transaction and will constitute gain for all purposes.
(ii)
Basis adjustment.
The basis of the property received in an exchange to which this paragraph (d)(4) applies shall be increased by the amount of gain deemed recognized, in accordance with applicable sections of subchapters C (relating to corporate distributions and adjustments), K (relating to partners and partnerships), O (relating to gain or loss on the disposition of property), and P (relating to capital gains and losses). If the property to which this paragraph (d)(4) applies was transferred by gift, the basis of such property in the hands of the donor immediately preceding such gift shall be increased by the amount of the gain deemed recognized.
(iii)
Recapture of overall foreign loss to the extent of amount recognized.
The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be applied to the extent of 100 percent of the foreign source taxable income which is recognized under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section. However, amounts of foreign source gain that would not be recognized except by application of section 904(f)(3) and paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, and which are treated as United States source gain by application of section 904(b)(3)(C) (prior to its removal by the Tax Reform Act of 1986) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section, shall reduce the overall foreign loss account (subject to the adjustments described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) if such gain is net capital gain, notwithstanding the fact that such amounts would otherwise not be recaptured under the ordering rules in paragraph (b) of this section.
(iv)
Priorities among dispositions in which gain is deemed to be recognized.
If, in a single taxable year, a taxpayer makes more than one disposition to which this paragraph (d)(4) is applicable, the rules of this paragraph (d)(4) shall be applied to each disposition in succession starting with the disposition which occurred earliest, until the balance in the applicable overall foreign loss account is reduced to zero. If the taxpayer simultaneously makes more than one disposition to which this paragraph (d)(4) is applicable, the rules of paragraph (d)(4) shall be applied so that the balance in the applicable overall foreign loss account to be recaptured will be allocated pro rata among the assets in proportion to the excess of the fair market value of each asset over the adjusted basis of each asset.
(5)
Definitions
—(i)
Disposition.
A disposition to which this paragraph (d) applies includes a sale; exchange; distribution; gift; transfer upon the foreclosure of a security interest (but not a mere transfer of title to a creditor upon creation of a security interest or to a debtor upon termination of a security interest); involuntary conversion; contribution to a partnership, trust, or corporation; transfer at death; or any other transfer of property whether or not gain or loss is recognized under other provisions of the Code. However, a disposition to which this paragraph (d) applies does not include:
(A) A distribution or transfer of property to a domestic corporation described in section 381 (a) (provided that paragraph (d)(6) of this section applies);
(B) A disposition of property which is not a material factor in the realization of income by the taxpayer (as defined in paragraph (d)(5)(iv) of this section);
(C) A transaction in which gross income is not realized; or
(D) The entering into of a unitization or pooling agreement (as defined in § 1.614-8(b)(6) of the regulations) containing a valid election under section 761(a)(2), and in which the source of the entire gain from any disposition of the interest created by the agreement would be determined to be foreign source under section 862(a)(5) if the disposition occurred presently.
(ii)
Property used in a trade or business.
Property is used in a trade or business if it is held for the principal purpose of promoting the present or future conduct of the trade or business. This generally includes property acquired and held in the ordinary course of a trade or business or otherwise held in a direct relationship to a trade or business. In determining whether an asset is held in a direct relationship to a trade or business, principal consideration shall be given to whether the asset is used in the trade or business. Property will be treated as held in a direct relationship to a trade or business if the property was acquired with funds generated by that trade or business or if income generated from the asset is available for use in that trade or business. Property used in a trade or business may be tangible or intangible, real or personal property. It includes property, such as equipment, which is subject to an allowance for depreciation under section 167 or cost recovery under section 168. Property may be considered used in a trade or business even if it is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. However, stock of another corporation shall not be considered property used in a trade or business if a substantial investment motive exists for acquiring and holding the stock. On the other hand, stock acquired or held to assure a source of supply for a trade or business shall be considered property used in that trade or business. Inventory is generally not considered property used in a trade or business. However, when disposed of in a manner not in the ordinary course of a trade or business, inventory will be considered property used in the trade or business. A partnership interest will be treated as property used in a trade or business if the underlying assets of the partnership would be property used in a trade or business. For purposes of section 904(f) (3) and § 1.904(f)-2 (d) (1) and (5), a disposition of a partnership interest to which this section applies will be treated as a disposition of a proportionate share of each of the assets of the partnership. For purposes of allocating the purchase price of the interest and the seller's basis in the interest to those assets, the principles of § 1.751-1(a) will apply.
(iii)
Property used predominantly outside the United States.
Property will be considered used predominantly outside the United States if for a 3-year period ending on the date of the disposition (or, if shorter, the period during which the property has been used in the trade or business) such property was located outside the United States more than 50 percent of the time. An aircraft, railroad rolling stock, vessel, motor vehicle, container, or other property used for transportation purposes is deemed to be used predominantly outside the United States if, during the 3-year (or shorter) period, either such property is located outside the United States more than 50 percent of the time or more than 50 percent of the miles traversed in the use of such property are traversed outside the United States.
(iv)
Property which is a material factor in the realization of income.
For purposes of this section, property used in a trade or business will be considered a material factor in the realization of income unless the taxpayer establishes that it is not (or, if the taxpayer did not realize income from the trade or business in the taxable year, would not be expected to be) necessary to the realization of income by the taxpayer.
(6)
Carryover of overall foreign loss accounts in a corporate acquisition to which section 381(a) applies.
In the case of a distribution or transfer described in section 381(a), an overall foreign loss
account of the distributing or transferor corporation shall be treated as an overall foreign loss account of the acquiring or transferee corporation as of the close of the date of the distribution or transfer. If the transferee corporation had an overall foreign loss account under the same separate limitation prior to the distribution or transfer, the balance in the transferor's account must be added to the transferee's account. If not, the transferee must adopt the transferor's overall foreign loss account. An overall foreign loss of the transferor will be treated as incurred by the transferee in the year prior to the year of the transfer.
(7)
Illustrations.
The rules of this paragraph (d) are illustrated by the following examples which assume that the United States corporate tax rate is 50 percent (unless otherwise stated). For purposes of these examples, none of the foreign source gains are treated as net capital gains (unless so stated).

# Example 1.
X Corporation has a balance in its general limitation overall foreign loss account of $600 at the close of its taxable year ending December 31, 1984. In 1985, X sells assets used predominantly outside the United States in a trade or business and recognizes $1,000 of gain on the sale under section 1001. This gain is subject to the general limitation. This sale is a disposition within the meaning of paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, and to which this paragraph (d) applies. X has no other foreign source taxable income in 1985 and has $1,000 of United States source taxable income. Under paragraph (c), X is required to recapture $500 (the lesser of the balance in X's general limitation overall foreign loss account ($600) or 50 percent of $1,000) of its overall foreign loss account. The balance in X's general limitation overall foreign loss account is reduced to $100 in accordance with § 1.904(f)-1(e)(2). In addition, under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, X is required to recapture $100 (the lesser of the remaining balance in its general limitation overall foreign loss account ($100) or 100 percent of its foreign source taxable income recognized on such disposition that has not been previously recharacterized ($500)). The total amount recaptured is $600. X's foreign tax credit limitation for income subject to the general limitation in 1985 is $200 ($400/$2,000 × $1,000) instead of $500 ($1,000/$2,000 × $1,000). The balance in X's general limitation overall foreign loss account is reduced to zero in accordance with § 1.904(f)-1(e)(2).

# Example 2.
On December 31, 1984, Y Corporation has a balance in its general limitation overall foreign loss account of $1,500. In 1985, Y has $500 of United States source taxable income and $200 of foreign source taxable income subject to the general limitation. Y's foreign source taxable income is from the sale of property used predominantly outside of the United States in a trade or business. This sale is a disposition to which this paragraph (d) is applicable. In 1985, Y also transferred property used predominantly outside of the United States in a trade or business to another corporation. Under section 351, no gain was recognized on this transfer. Such property had been used to generate foreign source taxable income subject to the general limitation. The excess of the fair market value of the property transferred over Y's adjusted basis in such property was $2,000. In accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, Y is required to recapture $100 (the lesser of $1,500, the amount in Y's general limitation overall foreign loss account, or 50 percent of $200, the amount of general limitation foreign source taxable income for the current year) of its general limitation overall foreign loss. Y is then required to recapture an additional $100 of its general limitation overall foreign loss account under paragraph (d)(3) of this section out of the remaining gain recognized on the sale of assets, because 100 percent of such gain is subject to recapture. The balance in Y's general limitation overall foreign loss account is reduced to $1,300 in accordance with § 1.904(f)-1(e)(2). Y corporation is then required to recognize $1,300 of foreign source taxable income on its section 351 transfer under paragraph (d)(4) of this section. The remaining $700 of potential gain associated with the section 351 transfer is not recognized. Under paragraph (d)(4), 100 percent of the $1,300 is recharacterized as United States source taxable income, and Y's general limitation overall foreign loss account is reduced to zero. Y's entire taxable income for 1985 is:
U.S. source taxable income
$500
Foreign source taxable income subject to the general limitation that is recharacterized as U.S. source income by paragraphs (c) and (d)(3) of this section
200
Gain recognized under section 904(f)(3) and paragraph (d)(4) of this section, and recharacterized as U.S. source income
1,300
Total
$2,000
Y's foreign tax credit limitation for 1985 for income subject to the general limitation is $0 ($0/$2,000 × $1,000) instead of $100 ($200/$700 × $350).

# Example 3.
W Corporation is a calendar year domestic corporation with foreign branch operations in country C. As of December 31, 1984, W has no overall foreign loss accounts and has no net operating loss carryovers. W's entire taxable income in 1985 is:
U.S. source taxable income
$800
Foreign source taxable income (loss) subject to the general limitation
($1,000)
W cannot carry back its 1985 NOL to any earlier year. As of December 31, 1985, W therefore has $800 in its general limitation overall foreign loss account. In 1986, W earns $400 United States source taxable income and has an additional $1,000 loss from the operations of the foreign branch. Income in the loss category would be subject to the general limitation. Also in 1986, W disposes of property used predominately outside the United States in a trade or business. Such property generated income subject to the general limitation. The excess of the property's fair market value over its adjusted basis is $3,000. The disposition is of a type described in § 1.904 (f)-2(d)(4)(i). W has no other income in 1986. Under § 1.904 (f)-2(d)(4)(i), W is required to recognize foreign source taxable income on the disposition in an amount equal to the lesser of $2,000 ($800 (the balance in the general limitation overall foreign loss account as of 1985) + $400 (the increase in the general limitation overall foreign loss account attributable to the disposition year) + $600 (the general limitation overall foreign loss that is part of the NOL from 1986) + $200 (the general limitation overall foreign loss that is part of the NOL from 1985)) or $3,000. The $2,000 foreign source income required to be recognized under section 904(f)(3) is reduced to $1,200 by the remaining $600 loss in 1986 and the $200 net operating loss carried forward from 1985. This $1,200 of income is subject to the general limitation. In computing foreign tax credit limitation for general limitation income, the $1,200 of foreign source income is treated as United States source income and, therefore, W's foreign tax credit limitation for income subject to the general limitation is zero. W's overall foreign loss account is reduced to zero.

# Example 4.
Z Corporation has a balance in its FORI overall foreign loss account of $1,500 at the end of its taxable year 1980. In 1981, Z has $1,600 of foreign oil related income subject to the separate limitation for FORI income and no United States source income. In addition, in 1981, Z makes two dispositions of property used predominantly outside the United States in a trade or business on which no gain was recognized. Such property generated foreign oil related income. The excess of the fair market value of the property transferred in the first disposition over Z's adjusted basis in such property is $575. The excess of the fair market value of the property transferred in the second disposition over Z's adjusted basis in such property is $1,000. Under paragraph (c) of this section, Z is required to recapture $800 (the lesser of 50 percent of its foreign oil related income of $1,600 or the balance ($1,500) in its FORI overall foreign loss account) of its foreign oil related loss. In accordance with paragraphs (d)(4) (i) and (iv) of this section, Z is required to recognize foreign oil related income in the amount of $575 on the first disposition and, since the foreign oil related loss account is now reduced by $1,375 (the $800 and $575 amounts previously recaptured), Z is required to recognize foreign oil related income in the amount of $125 on the second disposition. In accordance with paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section, the entire amount recognized is treated as United States source income and the balance in the FORI overall foreign loss account is reduced to zero under § 1.904 (f)-1 (e)(2). Z's foreign tax credit limitation for FORI is $400 ($800/$2,300 × $1,150) instead of $800 ($1,600/$1,600 × $800).

# Example 5.
The facts are the same as in example 4, except that the gain from the two dispositions of property is treated as net capital gain and the United States corporate tax rate is assumed to be 46 percent. As in example 4, Z is required to recapture $800 of its foreign oil related loss from its 1981 ordinary foreign oil related income. In accordance with paragraph (d)(4) (i) and (iv) of this section, Z is first required to recognize foreign oil related income (which is net capital gain) on the first disposition in the amount of $575. Under paragraphs (b) and (d) (2) of this section, this net capital gain is adjusted by subtracting the rate differential portion of such gain from the total amount of such gain to determine the amount by which the foreign oil related loss account is reduced, which is $350 ($575− ($575 × 18/46)). The balance remaining in Z's foreign oil related loss account after this step is $350. Therefore, this process will be repeated, in accordance with paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section, to recapture that remaining balance out of the gain deemed recognized on the second disposition, resulting in reduction of the foreign oil related loss account to zero and net capital gain required to be recognized from the second disposition in the amount of $575, which must also be adjusted by subtracting the rate differential portion to determine the amount by which the foreign oil related loss account is reduced (which is $350). The $575 of net capital gain from each disposition is recharacterized as United States source net capital gain. Z's section 907 (b) foreign tax credit limitation is the same as in example 4, and Z has $1,150 ($575 + $575) of United States source net capital gain.

§ 1.904(f)-4
Recapture of foreign losses out of accumulation distributions from a foreign trust.
(a)
In general.
If a taxpayer receives a distribution of foreign source taxable income subject to a separate limitation in which the taxpayer had a balance in an overall foreign loss account and that income is treated under section 666 as having been distributed by a foreign trust in a preceding taxable year, a portion of the balance in the taxpayer's applicable overall foreign loss account shall be subject to recapture under this section. The amount subject to recapture shall be the lesser of the balance in the taxpayer's overall foreign loss account (after applying §§ 1.904(f)-1, 1.904(f)-2, 1.904(f)-3, and 1.904(f)-6 to the taxpayer's other income or loss in the current taxable year) or the entire amount of foreign source taxable income deemed distributed in a preceding year or years under section 666.
(b)
Effect of recapture on foreign tax credit limitation under section 667(d).
If paragraph (a) of this section is applicable, then in applying the separate limitation (in accordance with section 667(d)(1) (A) and (C)) to determine the amount of foreign taxes deemed distributed under section 666 (b) and (c) that can be credited against the increase in tax in a computation year, a portion of the foreign source taxable income deemed distributed in such computation year shall be treated as United States source income. Such portion shall be determined by multiplying the amount of foreign source taxable income deemed distributed in the computation year by a fraction. The numerator of this fraction is the balance in the taxpayer's overall foreign loss account (after application of §§ 1.904(f)-1, 1.904(f)-2, 1.904(f)-3, and 1.904(f)-6), and the denominator of the fraction is the entire amount of foreign source taxable income deemed distributed under section 666. However, the numerator of this fraction shall not exceed the denominator of the fraction.
(c)
Recapture if taxpayer deducts foreign taxes deemed distributed.
If paragraph (a) of this section is applicable and if, in accordance with section 667(d)(1)(B), the beneficiary deducted rather than credited its taxes in the computation year, the beneficiary shall reduce its overall foreign loss account (but not below zero) by an amount equal to the lesser of the balance in the applicable overall foreign loss account or the amount of the actual distribution deemed distributed in the computation year (without regard to the foreign taxes deemed distributed).
(d)
Illustrations.
The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
X Corporation is a domestic corporation that has a balance of $10,000 in its general limitation overall foreign loss account on December 31, 1980. For its taxable year beginning January 1, 1981, X's only income is an accumulation distribution from a foreign trust of $20,000 of general limitation foreign source taxable income. Under section 666, the amount distributed and the foreign taxes paid on such amount ($4,000) are deemed distributed in two prior taxable years. In determining the partial tax on such distribution under section 667(b), the amount added to each computation year is $12,000 (the sum of the actual distribution plus the taxes deemed distributed ($24,000) divided by the number of accumulation years (2)). Of that amount, $5,000 ($10,000/$24,000 × $12,000) is treated as United States source taxable income in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Assuming the United States tax rate is 50 percent, X's separate foreign tax credit limitation against the increase in tax in each computation year is $3,500 ($7,000/$12,000 × $6,000) instead of $6,000 ($12,000/$12,000 × $6,000). X's overall foreign loss account is reduced to zero in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that X deducted rather than credited its foreign taxes in the computation years. In 1979, the amount added to X's income is $12,000 under section 667(b), $2,000 of
which is deductible under section 667(d)(1)(B). X must reduce its overall foreign loss account by $10,000, the amount of the actual distribution that is deemed distributed in 1979 (without regard to the $2,000 foreign taxes also deemed distributed). The entire overall foreign loss account is therefore reduced to $0 in 1979.

§ 1.904(f)-5
Special rules for recapture of overall foreign losses of a domestic trust.
(a)
In general.
Except as provided in this section, the rules contained in §§ 1.904(f)-1, 1.904(f)-2, 1.904(f)-3, 1.904(f)-4, and 1.904(f)-6 apply to domestic trusts.
(b)
Recapture of trust's overall foreign loss.
In taxable years in which a trust has foreign source taxable income subject to a separate limitation in which the trust has a balance in its overall foreign loss account, the balance in the trust's overall foreign loss account shall be recaptured as follows:
(1)
Trust accumulates income.
If the trust accumulates all of its foreign source taxable income subject to the same limitation as the loss that created the balance in the overall foreign loss account, its overall foreign loss shall be recaptured out of such income in accordance with §§ 1.904(f)-1, 1.904(f)-2, 1.904(f)-3, 1.904(f)-4, and 1.904(f)-6.
(2)
Trust distributes income.
If the trust distributes all of its foreign source taxable income subject to the same limitation as the loss that created the overall foreign loss account, the amount of the overall foreign loss that would be subject to recapture by the trust under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be allocated to the beneficiaries in proportion to the amount of such income which is distributed to each beneficiary in that year.
(3)
Trust accumulates and distributes income.
If the trust accumulates part of its foreign source taxable income subject to the same limitation as the loss that created the overall foreign loss account and distributes part of such income, the portion of the overall foreign loss that would be subject to recapture by the trust under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the distributed income were accumulated shall be allocated to the beneficiaries receiving income distributions. The amount of overall foreign loss to be allocated to such beneficiaries shall be the same portion of the total amount of such overall foreign loss that would be recaptured as the amount of such income which is distributed to each beneficiary bears to the total amount of such income of the trust for such year. That portion of the overall foreign loss subject to recapture in such year that is not allocated to the beneficiaries in accordance with this paragraph (b)(3) shall be recaptured by the trust in accordance with paragraph (b)(1).
(c)
Amounts allocated to beneficiaries.
Amounts of a trust's overall foreign loss allocated to any beneficiary in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section shall be added to the beneficiary's applicable overall foreign loss account and treated as an overall foreign loss of the beneficiary incurred in the taxable year preceding the year of such allocation. Such amounts shall be recaptured in accordance with §§ 1.904(f)-1, 1.904(f)-2, 1.904(f)-3, 1.904(f)-4, and 1.904(f)-6 out of foreign source taxable income distributed by the trust which is subject to the same separate limitation.
(d)
Section 904(f)(3) dispositions to which § 1.904(f)-2(d)(4)(i) is applicable.
Foreign source taxable income recognized by a trust under § 1.904(f)-2(d)(4) on a disposition of property used in a trade or business outside the United States shall be deemed to be accumulated by the trust. All such income shall be used to recapture the trust's overall foreign loss in accordance with § 1.904(f)-2(d)(4).
(e)
Illustrations.
The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
T, a domestic trust, has a balance of $2,000 in a general limitation overall foreign loss account on December 31, 1983. For its taxable year ending on December 31, 1984, T has foreign source taxable income subject to the general limitation of $1,600, all of which it accumulates. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, T is required to recapture $800 in 1984 (the lesser of the overall foreign loss or 50 percent of the foreign source taxable income). This amount is treated as United States source income for purposes of taxing T in 1984 and upon subsequent distribution to T's beneficiaries. At the end of its 1984 taxable year, T has a balance of $1,200 in its overall foreign loss account.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example 1. In 1985, T has general limitation foreign source taxable income of $1,000, which it distributes to its beneficiaries as follows: $500 to A, $250 to B, and $250 to C. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, T would have been required to recapture $500 of its overall foreign loss if it had accumulated all of such income. Therefore, under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, T must allocate $500 of its overall foreign loss to A, B, and C as follows: $250 to A ($500 × $500/$1,000), $125 to B ($500 × $250/$1,000), and $125 to C ($500 × $250/$1,000). Under paragraph (c) of this section and § 1.904(f)-1(d)(4), A, B, and C must add the amounts of general limitation overall foreign loss allocated to them from T to their overall foreign loss accounts and treat such amounts as overall foreign losses incurred in 1984. A, B, and C must then apply the rules of §§ 1.904(f)-1, 1.904(f)-2, 1.904(f)-3, 1.904(f)-4, and 1.904(f)-6 to recapture their overall foreign losses. T's overall foreign loss account is reduced in accordance with § 1.904(f)-1(e)(1) by the $500 that is allocated to A, B, and C. At the end of 1985, T's general limitation overall foreign loss account has a balance of $700.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example 2, including an overall foreign loss account at the end of 1984 of $1,200, except that in 1985 T's general limitation foreign source taxable income is $1,500 instead of $1,000, and T accumulates the additional $500. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, T would be required to recapture $750 of its overall foreign loss if it accumulated all of the $1,500. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, T must allocate $500 of its overall foreign loss to A, B, and C as follows: $250 to A ($750 × $500/$1,500) and $125 each to B and C (750 × $250/$1,500). T must also recapture $250 of its overall foreign loss, which is the amount subject to recapture in 1985 that is not allocated to the beneficiaries ($750−$500 = $250). Under § 1.904(f)-1(e)(1), T reduces its general limitation overall foreign loss account by $500. Under § 1.904(f)-1(e)(2), T reduces its general limitation overall foreign loss account by $250. At the end of 1985 there is a balance in the general limitation overall foreign loss account of $450 (($1,200−$500)−$250).
[T.D. 8153, 52 FR 32002, Aug. 25, 1987; 52 FR 43434, Nov. 12, 1987]
§ 1.904(f)-6
Transitional rule for recapture of FORI and general limitation overall foreign losses incurred in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983, from foreign source taxable income subject to the general limitation in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982.
(a)
General rule.
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982, foreign source taxable income subject to the general limitation includes foreign oil related income (as defined in section 907(c)(2) prior to its amendment by section 211 of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982). However, for purposes of recapturing general limitation overall foreign losses incurred in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983 (pre-1983) out of foreign source taxable income subject to the general limitation in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982 (post-1982), the taxpayer shall make separate determinations of foreign oil related income and other general limitation income (as if the FORI limitation under “old section 907(b)” (prior to its amendment by section 211 of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982) were still in effect), and shall apply the rules set forth in this section. The taxpayer shall maintain separate accounts for its pre-1983 FORI limitation overall foreign losses, its pre-1983 general limitation overall foreign losses (or its pre-1983 section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign losses if such losses were computed on a combined basis), and its post-1982 general limitation overall foreign losses. The taxpayer shall continue to maintain such separate accounts, make such separate determinations, and apply the rules of this section separately to each account until the earlier of—
(1) Such time as the taxpayer's entire pre-1983 FORI limitation overall foreign loss account and pre-1983 general limitation overall foreign loss account (or, if the taxpayer determined pre-1983 overall foreign losses on a combined basis, the section 904(d)(1)(A-C) account) have been recaptured, or
(2) The end of the taxpayer's 8th post-1982 taxable year, at which time the taxpayer shall add any remaining balance in its pre-1983 FORI limitation account and pre-1983 general limitation overall foreign loss account (or the section 904(d)(1)(A-C) account) to its post-1982 general limitation overall foreign loss account.
(b)
Recapture of pre-1983 FORI and general limitation overall foreign losses from post-1982 income.
A taxpayer having a balance in its pre-1983 FORI limitation overall foreign loss account or its pre-1983 general limitation overall
foreign loss account (or its pre-1983 section 904(d)(1)(A-C) account) in a post-1982 taxable year shall recapture such overall foreign loss as follows:
(1)
Recapture from income subject to the same limitation.
The taxpayer shall first apply the rules of §§ 1.904(f)-1 through 1.904(f)-5 to the taxpayer's separately determined foreign oil related income to recapture the pre-1983 FORI limitation overall foreign loss account, and shall apply such rules to the taxpayer's separately determined general limitation income (exclusive of foreign oil related income) to recapture the pre-1983 general limitation overall foreign loss account (or the section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss account. Rules for determining the recapture of the pre-1983 section 904 (d)(1)(A-C) losses are contained in § 1.904(f)-2(c)(4).
(2)
Recapture from income subject to the other limitation.
The taxpayer shall next apply the rules of §§ 1.904(f)-1 through 1.904(f)-5 to the taxpayer's separately determined foreign oil related income to recapture the pre-1983 general limitation overall foreign loss account (or the section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss account) and shall apply such rules to the taxpayer's separately determined general limitation income to recapture foreign oil related losses to the extent that—
(i) The amount recaptured from such separately determined income under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is less than 50 percent (or such larger percentage as the taxpayer elects) of such separately determined income, and
(ii) The amount recaptured from such separately determined income under this paragraph (b)(2) does not exceed an amount equal to 12
1/2
percent of the balance in the taxpayer's pre-1983 FORI limitation overall foreign loss account or the pre-1983 general limitation overall foreign loss account (or the section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss account) at the beginning of the taxpayer's first post-1982 taxable year, multiplied by the number of post-1982 taxable years (including the year to which this rule is being applied) which have elapsed, less the amount (if any) recaptured in prior post-1982 taxable years under this paragraph (b)(2) from such separately determined income.
The taxpayer may elect to recapture a pre-1983 overall foreign loss from post-1982 income subject to the general limitation at a faster rate than is required by this paragraph (b)(2). This election shall be made in the same manner as an election to recapture more than 50 percent of the income subject to recapture under section 904(f)(1), as provided in § 1.904(f)-2(c)(2).
(c)
Coordination of recapture of pre-1983 and post-1982 overall foreign losses.
A taxpayer incurring a general limitation overall foreign loss in any post-1982 taxable year in which the taxpayer has a balance in a pre-1983 FORI limitation or its pre-1983 general limitation overall foreign loss account (or the section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss account) shall establish a separate overall foreign loss account for such loss. The taxpayer shall recapture its overall foreign losses in succeeding taxable years by first applying the rules of this section to recapture its pre-1983 overall foreign losses, and then applying the rules of §§ 1.904(f)-1 through 1.904(f)-5 to recapture its post-1982 general limitation overall foreign loss. A post-1982 general limitation overall foreign loss is required to be recaptured only to the extent that the amount of foreign source taxable income recharacterized under paragraph (b) of this section is less than 50 percent of the taxpayer's total general limitation foreign source taxable income (including foreign oil related income)) for such taxable year (except as required by section 904(f)(3)). However, a taxpayer may elect to recapture at a faster rate.

Illustrations.
The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
X Corporation is a domestic corporation which has the calendar year as its taxable year. On December 31, 1982, X has a balance of $1,000 in its section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss account. X does not have a balance in a FORI limitation overall foreign loss account. For 1983, X has income of $1,200, which was subject to the general limitation and includes foreign oil related income of $1,000 and other general limitation income of $200. In 1983, X is required to recapture $225 of its pre-1983 section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss account computed as follows:
Amount recaptured under paragraph
(b)(1) of this section
$100
The amount recaptured from general limitation income exclusive of foreign oil related income is the lesser of $1,000 (the pre-1983 loss reflected in the section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss account) or 50 percent of $200 (the separately determined general limitation income (exclusive of foreign oil related income).
Amount recaptured under paragraph (b)(2) of this section
$125
The amount recaptured from foreign oil related income is the lesser of $900 (the remaining pre-1983 section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss account after recapture under paragraph (b)(1) of this section) or 50 percent of $1,000 (the separately determined foreign oil related income), but as limited by paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section to (12
1/2
percent of $1,000 × 1)−$0, which is $125.
Total amount recaptured in 1983

The facts are the same as in example 1, except that X has general limitation income of $50 for 1984 and $600 for 1985, all of which is foreign oil related income. X is required to recapture $25 in 1984 and $225 in 1985 of its pre-1983 section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss account computed as follows:
Amount recaptured under paragraph (b)(2) of this section in 1984
$25
The amount recaptured from foreign oil related income is the lesser of $775 (the remaining pre-1983 section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss account or 50 percent of $50 (the separately determined foreign oil related income).This amount is within the limitation of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, (12
1/2
percent of $1,000 × 2)−$125, which is $125.
Amount recaptured under paragraph (b)(2) of this section in 1985
$225
The amount recaptured from foreign oil related income is the lesser of $750 (the remaining pre-1983 section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss account) or 50 percent of $600 (the separately determined foreign oil related income), but as limited by paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section to (12
1/2
percent of $1,000 × 3)-($125 + $25), which is $225. ($125 is the amount recaptured in 1983 under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and $25 is the amount recaptured in 1984 under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.)

# Example 3.
Y Corporation is a domestic corporation which has the calendar year as its taxable year. On December 31, 1982, Y has a balance of $400 in its section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss account. Y does not have a balance in a FORI overall foreign loss account. For 1983, Y has a general limitation overall foreign loss of $200. For 1984, Y has general limitation income of $1,200, all of which is foreign oil related income. In 1984, Y is required to recapture a total of $300 computed as follows:
Amount of pre-1983 overall foreign loss recaptured under paragraph (b)(2) of this section
$100
The amount of the pre-1983 section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss account attributable to a general limitation loss recaptured from foreign oil related income is the lesser of $400 (the loss) or 50 percent of $1,200 (the separately determined foreign oil related income), but as limited by paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section to (12
1/2
percent of $400 × 2) − $0, which is $100.
Amount of post-1982 overall foreign loss recaptured under paragraph (c) of this section
$200
The amount of post-1982 general limitation overall foreign loss recaptured is the amount computed under § 1.904 (f)−2(c)(1), which is the lesser of $200 (the post-1982 loss) or 50 percent of $1,200 (the income), but only to the extent that the amount of pre-1983 loss recaptured under paragraph (b) of this section is less than 50 percent of such income ((50 percent of $1,200)—$100 recaptured under paragraph (b) = $500).
Total amount recaptured in 1984
$300
At the end of 1984, Y has a balance in its pre-1983 section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss account of $300, and has reduced its post-1982 general limitation overall foreign loss account to zero.

# Example 4.
Z is a domestic corporation which has the calendar year as its taxable year. On December 31, 1982, Z has a balance of $400 in its section 904 (d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss account, and a balance of $1,000 in its FORI limitation overall foreign loss account. For 1983, Z has general limitation income of $2,000, which includes foreign oil related income of $1,000 and other general limitation income of $1,000. Keeping these amounts separate for purposes of this section, Z is required to recapture a total of $1,000 in 1983, computed as follows:
Amount recaptured under paragraph (b)(1) of this section
$900
The amount of pre-1983 section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss account recaptured from general limitation income exclusive of foreign oil related income, in accordance with § 1.904 (f)-2(c)(1), is the lesser of $400 (the section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss) or 50 percent of $1,000, the general limitation income exclusive of foreign oil related income), which is $400.
The amount of pre-1983 FORI overall foreign loss recaptured from foreign oil related income, in accordance with § 1.904(f)-2(c)(1), is the lesser of $1,000 (the FORI overall foreign loss) or 50 percent of $1,000 (the foreign oil related income), which is $500.
Amount recaptured under paragraph (b)(2) of this section
$100
The amount of pre-1983 FORI 907(b) overall foreign loss recaptured from section general
limitation income exclusive of foreign oil related income is the lesser of $500 (the remaining balance in that loss account) or 50 percent of $1,000 (the general limitation income exclusive of foreign oil related income), but only to the extent that the amount recaptured from such income under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is less than 50 percent of such income, or $100 (50 percent of $1,000)—$400 recaptured due to section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss account, and only up to the amount permitted by paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, which is (12
1/2
percent of $1,000 × 1)−$0, or $125.
Total amount recaptured in 1983
$1,000
At the end of 1983, Z has reduced its pre-1983 section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss account to zero, and has a balance in its pre-1983 FORI overall foreign loss account of $400.

§ 1.904(f)-7
Separate limitation loss and the separate limitation loss account.
(a)
Overview of regulations.
This section provides rules for determining a taxpayer's separate limitation losses, for establishing separate limitation loss accounts, and for making additions to and reducing such accounts for purposes of section 904(f). Section 1.904(f)-8 provides rules for recharacterizing the balance in any separate limitation loss account under the general recharacterization rule of section 904(f)(5)(C).
(b)
Definitions.
The definitions in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section apply for purposes of this section and §§ 1.904(f)-8 and 1.904(g)-3.
(1)
Separate category
means each separate category of income described in section 904(d) and any other category of income described in § 1.904-4(m). For example, income subject to section 901(j) or section 904(h)(10) is income in a separate category.
(2)
Separate limitation income
means, with respect to any separate category, the taxable income from sources outside the United States, separately computed for that category for the taxable year. Separate limitation income shall be determined by taking into account any adjustments for capital gains and losses and qualified dividend income, as defined in section 1(h)(11), under section 904(b)(2) and § 1.904(b)-1. See § 1.904(b)-1(h)(1)(i).
(3)
Separate limitation loss
means, with respect to any separate category, the amount by which the foreign source gross income in that category is exceeded by the sum of expenses, losses and other deductions (not including any net operating loss deduction under section 172(a) or any expropriation loss or casualty loss described in section 907(c)(4)(D)(iii)) properly apportioned or allocated to that separate category for the taxable year. Separate limitation losses shall be determined by taking into account any adjustments for capital gains and losses and qualified dividend income under section 904(b)(2) and § 1.904(b)-1. See § 1.904(b)-1(h)(1)(i).
(c)
Separate limitation loss account.
Any taxpayer that sustains a separate limitation loss that is allocated to reduce separate limitation income in one or more other separate categories of the taxpayer under the rules of § 1.904(g)-3 must establish a separate limitation loss account for the loss with respect to each such other separate category. The balance in any separate limitation loss account represents the amount of such separate limitation loss that is subject to recapture in a given taxable year pursuant to § 1.904(f)-8 and section 904(f)(5)(F). From year to year, amounts may be added to or subtracted from the balance in such loss accounts, as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.
(d)
Additions to separate limitation loss accounts
—(1)
General rule.
A taxpayer's separate limitation loss as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall be added to the applicable separate limitation loss accounts at the end of its taxable year to the extent that the separate limitation loss reduces separate limitation income in one or more other separate categories in that taxable year or in a year to which the loss has been carried back. For rules with respect to net operating loss carryovers, see paragraph (d)(3) of this section and § 1.904(g)-3.
(2)
Separate limitation losses of another taxpayer.
If any portion of any separate limitation loss account of another taxpayer is allocated to the taxpayer in accordance with § 1.1502-9 (relating to consolidated separate limitation losses) the taxpayer shall add such
amount to its applicable separate limitation loss account.
(3)
Additions to separate limitation loss account created by loss carryovers.
The taxpayer shall add to each separate limitation loss account all net operating loss carryovers to the current taxable year to the extent that separate limitation losses included in the net operating loss carryovers reduced foreign source income in one or more other separate categories for the taxable year.
(e)
Reductions of separate limitation loss accounts.
The taxpayer shall subtract the following amounts from its separate limitation loss accounts at the end of its taxable year in the following order as applicable:
(1)
Pre-recapture reduction for amounts allocated to other taxpayers.
A separate limitation loss account is reduced by the amount of any separate limitation loss account that is allocated to another taxpayer in accordance with § 1.1502-9 (relating to consolidated separate limitation losses).
(2)
Reduction for offsetting loss accounts.
A separate limitation loss account is reduced to take into account any netting of separate limitation loss accounts under § 1.904(g)-3(d)(1).
(3)
Reduction for amounts recaptured.
A separate limitation loss account is reduced by the amount of any separate limitation income that is earned in the same separate category as the separate limitation loss and that is recharacterized in accordance with § 1.904(f)-8 (relating to recapture of separate limitation losses) or section 904(f)(5)(F) (relating to recapture of separate limitation loss accounts out of gain realized from certain dispositions).
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to taxpayers that sustain separate limitation losses in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2012. Taxpayers may choose to apply this section to separate limitation losses sustained in other taxable years beginning after December 21, 2007, including periods covered by 26 CFR 1.904(f)-7T (revised as of April 1, 2010). For rules relating to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, and on or before December 21, 2007, see section 904(f)(5).
[T.D. 9595, 77 FR 37579, June 22, 2012]
§ 1.904(f)-8
Recapture of separate limitation loss accounts.
(a)
In general.
A taxpayer shall recapture a separate limitation loss account as provided in this section. If the taxpayer has a separate limitation loss account or accounts in any separate category (the “loss category”) and the loss category has income in a subsequent taxable year, the income shall be recharacterized as income in that other category or categories. The amount of income recharacterized shall not exceed the aggregate balance in all separate limitation loss accounts for the loss category as determined under § 1.904(f)-7. If the taxpayer has more than one separate limitation loss account in a loss category, and there is not enough income in the loss category to recapture all of the loss accounts, then separate limitation income in the loss category shall be recharacterized as separate limitation income in the other separate categories on a proportionate basis. This is determined by multiplying the total separate limitation income subject to recharacterization by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount in a particular separate limitation loss account and the denominator of which is the total amount in all separate limitation loss accounts for the loss category.
(b)
Effect of recharacterization of separate limitation income on associated taxes.
Recharacterization of income under paragraph (a) of this section shall not result in the recharacterization of any tax. The rules of § 1.904-6, including the rules that the taxes are allocated on an annual basis and that foreign taxes paid on U.S. source income shall be allocated to the separate category that includes that U.S. source income (see § 1.904-6(a)), shall apply for purposes of allocating taxes to separate categories. Allocation of taxes pursuant to § 1.904-6 shall be made before the recapture of any separate limitation loss accounts of the taxpayer pursuant to the rules of this section.
(c)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to taxpayers that sustain separate limitation losses in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2012. Taxpayers may choose to apply this section to separate limitation losses sustained in other taxable
years beginning after December 21, 2007, including periods covered by 26 CFR § 1.904(f)-8T (revised as of April 1, 2010). For rules relating to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, and on or before December 21, 2007, see section 904(f)(5).

§ 1.904(f)-12
Transition rules.
(a)
Recapture in years beginning after December 31, 1986, of overall foreign losses incurred in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987
—(1)
In general.
If a taxpayer has a balance in an overall foreign loss account at the end of its last taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987 (pre-effective date years), the amount of that balance shall be recaptured in subsequent years by recharacterizing income received in the income category described in section 904(d) as in effect for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986 (post-effective date years), that is analogous to the income category for which the overall foreign loss account was established, as follows:
(i) Interest income as defined in section 904(d)(1)(A) as in effect for pre-effective date taxable years is analogous to passive income as defined in section 904(d)(1)(A) as in effect for post-effective date years;
(ii) Dividends from a DISC or former DISC as defined in section 904(d)(1)(B) as in effect for pre-effective date taxable years is analogous to dividends from a DISC or former DISC as defined in section 904(d)(1)(F) as in effect for post-effective date taxable years;
(iii) Taxable income attributable to foreign trade income as defined in section 904(d)(1)(C) as in effect for pre-effective date taxable years is analogous to taxable income attributable to foreign trade income as defined in section 904(d)(1)(G) as in effect for post-effective date years;
(iv) Distributions from a FSC (or former FSC) as defined in section 904(d)(1)(D) as in effect for pre-effective date taxable years is analogous to distributions from a FSC (or former FSC) as defined in section 904(d)(1)(H) as in effect for post-effective date taxable years;
(v) For general limitation income as described in section 904(d)(1)(E) as in effect for pre-effective date taxable years, see the special rule in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(2)
Rule for general limitation losses
—(i)
In general.
Overall foreign losses incurred in the general limitation category of section 904(d)(1)(E), as in effect for pre-effective date taxable years, that are recaptured in post-effective date taxable years shall be recaptured from the taxpayer's general limitation income, financial services income, shipping income, and dividends from each noncontrolled section 902 corporation. If the sum of the taxpayer's general limitation income, financial services income, shipping income and dividends from each noncontrolled section 902 corporation for a taxable year subject to recapture exceeds the overall foreign loss to be recaptured, then the amount of each type of separate limitation income that will be treated as U.S. source income shall be determined as follows:
EC07OC91.043
This recapture shall be made after the allocation of separate limitation losses pursuant to section 904(f)(5)(B) and before the recharacterization of post-effective date separate limitation income pursuant to section 904(f)(5)(C).
(ii)
Exception.
If a taxpayer can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the district director that an overall foreign loss in the general limitation category of section 904(d)(1)(E), as in effect for
pre-effective date taxable years, is attributable, in sums certain, to losses in one or more separate categories of section 904(d)(1) (including for this purpose the passive income category and the high withholding tax interest category), as in effect for post-effective date taxable years, then the taxpayer may recapture the loss (in the amounts demonstrated) from those separate categories only.
(3)
Priority of recapture of overall foreign losses incurred in pre-effective date taxable years.
An overall foreign loss incurred by a taxpayer in pre-effective date taxable years shall be recaptured to the extent thereof before the taxpayer recaptures an overall foreign loss incurred in a post-effective date taxable year.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (a).

# Example 1.
X corporation is a domestic corporation which operates a branch in Country Y. For its taxable year ending December 31, 1988, X has $800 of financial services income, $100 of general limitation income and $100 of shipping income. X has a balance of $100 in its general limitation overall foreign loss account which resulted from an overall foreign loss incurred during its 1986 taxable year. X is unable to demonstrate to which of the income categories set forth in section 904(d)(1) as in effect for post-effective date taxable years the loss is attributable. In addition, X has a balance of $100 in its shipping overall foreign loss account attributable to a shipping loss incurred during its 1987 taxable year. X has no other overall foreign loss accounts. Pursuant to section 904(f)(1), the full amount in each of X corporation's overall foreign loss accounts is subject to recapture since $200 (the sum of those amounts) is less than 50% of X's foreign source taxable income for its 1988 taxable year, or $500. X's overall foreign loss incurred during its 1986 taxable year is recaptured before the overall foreign loss incurred during its 1987 taxable year, as follows: $80 ($100 × 800/1000) of X's financial services income, $10 ($100 × 100/1000) of X's general limitation income, and $10 (100 × 100/1000) of X's shipping income will be treated as U.S. source income. The remaining $90 of X corporation's 1988 shipping income will be treated as U.S. source income for the purpose of recapturing X's 100 overall foreign loss attributable to the shipping loss incurred in 1987. $10 remains in X's shipping overall foreign loss account for recapture in subsequent taxable years.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example
1 except that X has $800 of financial services income, $100 of general limitation income, a $100 dividend from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation and a ($100) shipping loss for its taxable year ending December 31, 1988. Separate limitation losses are allocated pursuant to the rules of section 904(f)(5) before the recapture of overall foreign losses. Therefore, the ($100) shipping loss incurred by X will be allocated to its separate limitation income as follows: $80 ($100 × 800/1000) will be allocated to X's financial services income, $10 ($100 × 100/1000) will be allocated to its general limitation income and $10 ($100 × 100/1000) will be allocated to X's dividend from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation. Accordingly, after allocation of the 1988 shipping loss, X has $720 of financial services income, $90 of general limitation income, and a $90 dividend from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation. Pursuant to section 904(f)(1), the full amount in each of X corporation's overall foreign loss accounts is subject to recapture since $200 (the sum of those amounts) is less than 50% of X's net foreign source taxable income for its 1988 taxable year, or $450. X's overall foreign loss incurred during its 1986 taxable year is recaptured as follows: $80 ($100 × 720/900) of X's financial services income, $10 ($100 × 90/900) of its general limitation income and $10 ($100 × 90/900) of its dividend from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation will be treated as U.S. source income. Accordingly, after application of section 904(f), X has $100 of U.S. source income, $640 of financial services income, $80 of general limitation income and a $80 dividend from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation for its 1988 taxable year. X must establish a separate limitation loss account for each portion of the 1988 shipping loss that was allocated to its financial services income, general limitation income and dividends from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation. X's overall foreign loss account for the 1986 general limitation loss is reduced to zero. X still has a $100 balance in its overall foreign loss account that resulted from the 1987 shipping loss.

# Example 3.
Y is a domestic corporation which has a branch operation in Country Z. For its 1988 taxable year, Y has $5 of shipping income, $15 of general limitation income and $100 of financial services income. Y has a balance of $100 in its general limitation overall foreign loss account attributable to its 1986 taxable year. Y has no other overall foreign loss accounts. Pursuant to section 904(f)(1), $60 of the overall foreign loss is subject to recapture since 50% of Y's foreign source income for 1988 is less than the balance in its overall foreign loss account. Y can demonstrate that the entire $100 overall foreign loss was attributable to a shipping limitation loss incurred in 1986. Accordingly, only Y's $5 of shipping limitation income received in 1988 will be treated as U.S. source income, Because Y can demonstrate that the 1986 loss
was entirely attributable to a shipping loss, none of Y's general limitation income or financial services income received in 1988 will be treated as U.S. source income.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in
Example
3 except that Y can only demonstrate that $50 of the 1986 overall foreign loss account was attributable to a shipping loss incurred in 1986. Accordingly, Y's $5 of shipping limitation income received in 1988 will be treated as U.S. source income. The remaining $50 of the 1986 overall foreign loss that Y cannot trace to a particular separate limitation will be recaptured and treated as U.S. source income as follows: $43 ($50 × 100/115) of Y's financial services income will be treated as U.S. source income and $7 ($50 × 15/115) of Y's general limitation income will be treated as U.S. source income. Y has $45 remaining in its overall foreign loss account to be recaptured from shipping income in a future year.
(b)
Treatment of overall foreign losses that are part of net operating losses incurred in pre-effective date taxable years which are carried forward to post-effective date taxable years
—(1)
Rule.
An overall foreign loss that is part of a net operating loss incurred in a pre-effective date taxable year which is carried forward, pursuant to section 172, to a post-effective date taxable year will be carried forward under the rules of section 904(f)(5) and the regulations under that section.
See also
Notice 89-3, 1989-1 C.B. 623. For this purpose the loss must be allocated to income in the category analogous to the income category set forth in section 904(d) as in effect for pre-effective date taxable years in which the loss occurred. The analogous category shall be determined under the rules of paragraph (a) of this section.
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rule of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

# Example.
Z is a domestic corporation which has a branch operation in Country D. For its taxable year ending December 31, 1988, Z has $100 of passive income and $200 of general limitation income. Z also has a $60 net operating loss which was carried forward pursuant to section 172 from its 1986 taxable year. The net operating loss resulted from an overall foreign loss attributable to the general limitation income category. Z can demonstrate that the loss is a shipping loss. Therefore, the net operating loss will be treated as a shipping loss for Z's 1988 taxable year. Pursuant to section 904(f)(5), the shipping loss will be allocated as follows: $20 ($60 × 100/300) will be allocated to Z's passive income and $40 ($60 × 200/300) will be allocated to Z's general limitation income. Accordingly, after application of section 904(f), Z has $80 of passive income and $160 of general limitation income for its 1988 taxable year. Although no addition to Z's overall foreign loss account for shipping income will result from the NOL carry forward, shipping income earned by Z in subsequent taxable years, will be subject to recharacterization as a passive income and general limitation income pursuant to the rules set forth in section 904(f)(5).
(c)
Treatment of overall foreign losses that are part of net operating losses incurred in post-effective date taxable years which are carried back to pre-effective date taxable years
—(1)
Allocation to analogous income category.
An overall foreign loss that is part of a net operating loss incurred by the taxpayer in a post-effective date taxable year which is carried back, pursuant to section 172, to a pre-effective date taxable year shall be allocated first to income in the pre-effective date income category analogous to the income category set forth in section 904(d) as in effect for post-effective date taxable years in which the loss occurred. Except for the general limitation income category, the pre-effective date income category that is analogous to a post-effective date income category shall be determined under paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section. The general limitation income category for pre-effective date years shall be treated as the income category that is analogous to the post-effective date categories for general limitation income, financial services income, shipping income, dividends from each noncontrolled section 902 corporation and high withholding tax interest income. If the net operating loss resulted from separate limitation losses in more than one post-effective date income category and more than one loss is carried back to pre-effective date general limitation income, then the losses shall be allocated to the pre-effective date general limitation income based on the following formula:
EC07OC91.044
(2)
Allocation to U.S. source income.
If an overall foreign loss is carried back to a pre-effective date taxable year and the loss exceeds the foreign source income in the analogous category for the carry back year, the remaining loss shall be allocated against U.S. source income as set forth in § 1.904(f)-3. The amount of the loss that offsets U.S. source income must be added to the taxpayer's overall foreign loss account. An addition to an overall foreign loss account resulting from the carry back of a net operating loss incurred by a taxpayer in a post-effective date taxable year shall be treated as having been incurred by the taxpayer in the year in which the loss arose and shall be subject to recapture pursuant to section 904(f) as in effect for post-effective date taxable years.
(3)
Allocation to other separate limitation categories.
To the extent that an overall foreign loss that is carried back as part of a net operating loss exceeds the separate limitation income to which it is allocated and the U.S. source income of the taxpayer for the taxable year to which the loss is carried, the loss shall be allocated pro rata to other separate limitation income of the taxpayer for the taxable year. However, there shall be no recharacterization of separate limitation income pursuant to section 904(f)(5) as a result of the allocation of such a net operating loss to other separate limitation income of the taxpayer.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (c) of this section.

# Example 1.
X is a domestic corporation which has a branch operation in Country A. For its taxable year ending December 31, 1987, X has a $60 net operating loss which is carried back pursuant to section 172 to its taxable year ending December 31, 1985. The net operating loss resulted from a shipping loss; X had no U.S. source income in 1987. X had $20 of general limitation income, $40 of DISC limitation income and $10 of U.S. source income for its 1985 taxable year. The $60 NOL is allocated first to X's 1985 general limitation income to the extent thereof ($20) since the general limitation income category of section 904(d) as in effect for pre-effective date taxable years is the income category that is analogous to shipping income for post-effective date taxable years. Therefore, X has no general limitation income for its 1985 taxable year. Next, pursuant to section 904(f) as in effect for pre-effective date taxable years, the remaining $40 of the NOL is allocated first to X's $10 of U.S. source income and then to $30 of X's DISC limitation income for its 1985 taxable year. Accordingly, X has no U.S. source income and $10 of DISC limitation income for its 1985 taxable year after allocation of the NOL. X has a $10 balance in its shipping overall foreign loss account which is subject to recapture pursuant to section 904(f) as in effect for post-effective date taxable years. X will not be required to recharacterize, pursuant to section 904(f)(5), subsequent shipping income as DISC limitation income.

Y is a domestic corporation which has a branch operation in Country B. For its taxable year ending December 31, 1987, X has a $200 net operating loss which is carried back pursuant to section 172 to its taxable year ending December 31, 1986. The net operating loss resulted from a ($100) general limitation loss and a ($100) shipping loss. Y had $100 of general limitation income and $200 of U.S. source income for its taxable year ending December 31, 1986. The separate limitation losses for 1987 are allocated pro rata to Y's 1986 general limitation income as follows: $50 of the ($100) general limitation loss ($100 × 100/200) and $50 of the ($100) shipping loss ($100 × 100/200) is allocated to Y's $100 of 1986 general limitation income. The remaining $50 of Y's general limitation loss and the remaining $50 of Y's shipping loss are allocated to Y's 1986 U.S. source income. Accordingly, Y has no foreign source income and $100 of U.S. source income for its 1986 taxable year. Y has a $50 balance in its general limitation overall foreign loss account and a $50 balance in its shipping overall foreign loss account, both of which will be subject to recapture pursuant to section 904(f) as in effect for post-effective date taxable years.
(d)
Recapture of FORI and general limitation overall foreign losses incurred in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983.
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, and before January 1, 1991, the rules set forth in § 1.904 (f)-6 shall apply for purposes of recapturing general limitation and foreign oil related income (FORI) overall foreign losses incurred in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983 (pre-1983). For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1990, the rules set forth in this section shall apply for purposes of recapturing pre-1983 general limitation and FORI overall foreign losses.
(e)
Recapture of pre-1983 overall foreign losses determined on a combined basis.
The rules set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall apply for purposes of recapturing overall foreign losses incurred in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983, that were computed on a combined basis in accordance with § 1.904 (f)-1(c) (1).
(f)
Transition rules for taxable years beginning before December 31, 1990.
For transition rules for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1990, see 26 CFR 1.904 (f)-13T as it appeared in the Code of Federal Regulations revised as of April 1, 1990.
(g)
Recapture in years beginning after December 31, 2002, of separate limitation losses and overall foreign losses incurred in years beginning before January 1, 2003, with respect to the separate category for dividends from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation
—(1)
Recapture of separate limitation loss or overall foreign loss in a separate category for dividends from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation.
To the extent that a taxpayer has a balance in any separate limitation loss or overall foreign loss account in a separate category for dividends from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation under section 904(d)(1)(E) (prior to its repeal by Public Law 108-357, 118 Stat. 1418 (October 22, 2004)) at the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2003 (or a later taxable year in which the taxpayer received a dividend subject to a separate limitation for dividends from that noncontrolled section 902 corporation), the amount of such balance shall be allocated on the first day of the taxpayer's next taxable year to the taxpayer's other separate categories. The amount of such balance shall be allocated in the same percentages as the taxpayer properly characterized the stock of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation for purposes of apportioning the taxpayer's interest expense for its first taxable year ending after the first day of such corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, under § 1.861-12T(c)(3) or § 1.861-12(c)(4), as the case may be. To the extent a taxpayer has a balance in any separate limitation loss account in a separate category for dividends from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation with respect to another separate category, and the separate limitation loss would otherwise be assigned to that other category under this paragraph (g)(1), such balance shall be eliminated.
(2)
Recapture of separate limitation loss in another separate category.
To the extent that a taxpayer has a balance in any separate limitation loss account in a separate category with respect to a separate category for dividends from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation under section 904(d)(1)(E) (prior to its repeal by Public Law 108-357, 118 Stat. 1418 (October 22, 2004)) at the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year with or within which ends the last taxable year of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation beginning before January 1, 2003, such loss shall be recaptured in subsequent taxable years as income in the appropriate separate categories. The separate limitation loss shall be recaptured as income in other separate categories in the same percentages as the taxpayer properly characterizes the stock of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation for purposes of apportioning the taxpayer's interest expense in its first taxable year ending after the first day of the foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, under § 1.861-12T(c)(3) or § 1.861-12(c)(4), as the case may be. To the extent a taxpayer has a balance in a separate limitation loss account in a separate category that would have been recaptured as income in that same category under this paragraph (g)(2), such balance shall be eliminated.
(3)
Exception.
Where a taxpayer formerly met the stock ownership requirements of section 902(a) with respect to a foreign corporation, but did not meet the requirements of section 902(a) on December 20, 2002 (or on the first day of the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, in the case of a transaction that was the subject of a binding contract in effect on December 20, 2002), if the taxpayer has a balance in any separate limitation loss or overall foreign loss account for a separate category for dividends from that foreign corporation under section 904(d)(1)(E) (prior to its repeal by Public Law 108-357, 118 Stat. 1418 (October 22, 2004)) at the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2003, then the amount of such balance shall not be subject to recapture under section 904(f) and this section. If a separate limitation loss or overall foreign loss account for such category is not subject to recapture under this paragraph (g)(3), the taxpayer cannot carry over any unused foreign taxes in such separate category to any other limitation category. However, a taxpayer may elect to recapture the balances of all separate limitation loss and overall foreign loss accounts for all separate categories for dividends from such formerly-owned noncontrolled section 902 corporations under the rules of paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section. If a taxpayer so elects, it may carry over any unused foreign taxes in these separate categories to the appropriate separate categories as provided in § 1.904-2(h).
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (g):

# Example 1.
X is a domestic corporation that meets the ownership requirements of section 902(a) with respect to Y, a foreign corporation the stock of which X owns 50 percent. Therefore, Y is a noncontrolled section 902 corporation with respect to X. Both X and Y use the calendar year as their taxable year. As of December 31, 2002, X had a $100 balance in its separate limitation loss account for the separate category for dividends from Y, of which $60 offset general limitation income and $40 offset passive income. For purposes of apportioning X's interest expense for its 2003 taxable year, X properly characterized the stock of Y as a multiple category asset (80% general and 20% passive). Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, on January 1, 2003, $80 ($100 × 80/100) of the $100 balance in the separate limitation loss account is assigned to the general limitation category. Of this $80 balance, $32 ($80 × 40/100) is with respect to the passive category, and $48 ($80 × 60/100) is with respect to the general limitation category and therefore is eliminated. The remaining $20 balance ($100 × 20/100) of the $100 balance is assigned to the passive category. Of this $20 balance, $12 ($20 × 60/100) is with respect to the general limitation category, and $8 ($20 × 40/100) is with respect to the passive category and therefore is eliminated.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
, except that as of December 31, 2002, X had a $30 balance in its separate limitation loss account in the general limitation category, and a $20 balance in its separate limitation loss account in the passive category, both of which offset income in the separate category for dividends from Y. Under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the separate limitation loss accounts in the general limitation and passive categories with respect to the separate category for dividends from Y will be recaptured on and after January 1, 2003, from income in other separate categories, as follows. Of the $30 balance in X's separate limitation loss account in the general category with respect to the separate category for dividends from Y, $6 ($30 × 20/100) is with respect to the passive category, and $24 ($30 × 80/100) is with respect to the general limitation category and therefore is eliminated. Of the $20 balance in X's separate limitation loss account in the passive category with respect to the separate category for dividends from Y, $16 ($20 × 80/100) will be recaptured out of general limitation income, and $4 ($20 × 20/100) would otherwise be recaptured out of passive income and therefore is eliminated.

Recapture in years beginning after December 31, 2006, of separate limitation losses and overall foreign losses incurred in years beginning before January 1, 2007
—(1)
Losses related to pre-2007 separate categories for passive income, certain dividends from a DISC or former DISC, taxable income attributable to certain foreign trade income or certain distributions from a FSC or former FSC
—(i)
Recapture of separate limitation loss or overall foreign loss incurred in a pre-2007 separate
category for passive income, certain dividends from a DISC or former DISC, taxable income attributable to certain foreign trade income or certain distributions from a FSC or former FSC.
To the extent that a taxpayer has a balance in any separate limitation loss or overall foreign loss account in a pre-2007 separate category (as defined in § 1.904-7(g)(1)(ii)) for passive income, certain dividends from a DISC or former DISC, taxable income attributable to certain foreign trade income or certain distributions from a FSC or former FSC, at the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2007, the amount of such balance, or balances, shall be allocated on the first day of the taxpayer's next taxable year to the taxpayer's post-2006 separate category (as defined in § 1.904-7(g)(1)(iii)) for passive category income.
(ii)
Recapture of separate limitation loss with respect to a pre-2007 separate category for passive income, certain dividends from a DISC or former DISC, taxable income attributable to certain foreign trade income or certain distributions from a FSC or former FSC.
To the extent that a taxpayer has a balance in any separate limitation loss account in any pre-2007 separate category with respect to a pre-2007 separate category for passive income, certain dividends from a DISC or former DISC, taxable income attributable to certain foreign trade income or certain distributions from a FSC or former FSC at the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2007, such loss shall be recaptured in subsequent taxable years as income in the post-2006 separate category for passive category income.
(2)
Losses related to pre-2007 separate categories for shipping, financial services income or general limitation income
—(i)
Recapture of separate limitation loss or overall foreign loss incurred in a pre-2007 separate category for shipping income, financial services income or general limitation income.
To the extent that a taxpayer has a balance in any separate limitation loss or overall foreign loss account in a pre-2007 separate category for shipping income, financial services income or general limitation income at the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2007, the amount of such balance, or balances, shall be allocated on the first day of the taxpayer's next taxable year to the taxpayer's post-2006 separate category for general category income.
(ii)
Recapture of separate limitation loss with respect to a pre-2007 separate category for shipping income, financial services income or general limitation income.
To the extent that a taxpayer has a balance in any separate limitation loss account in any pre-2007 separate category with respect to a pre-2007 separate category for shipping income, financial services income or general limitation income at the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2007, such loss shall be recaptured in subsequent taxable years as income in the post-2006 separate category for general category income.
(3)
Losses related to a pre-2007 separate category for high withholding tax interest
—(i)
Recapture of separate limitation loss or overall foreign loss incurred in a pre-2007 separate category for high withholding tax interest.
To the extent that a taxpayer has a balance in any separate limitation loss or overall foreign loss account in a pre-2007 separate category for high withholding tax interest at the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2007, the amount of such balance shall be allocated on the first day of the taxpayer's next taxable year on a pro rata basis to the taxpayer's post-2006 separate categories for general category and passive category income, based on the proportion in which any unused foreign taxes in the same pre-2007 separate category for high withholding tax interest are allocated under § 1.904-2(i)(1). If the taxpayer, other than a financial services entity as defined in § 1.904-4(e)(3), has no unused foreign taxes in the pre-2007 separate category for high withholding tax interest, then any loss account balance in that category shall be allocated to the post-2006 separate category for passive category income. If the taxpayer is a financial services entity, as defined in § 1.904-4(e)(3), and has no unused foreign taxes in the pre-2007 separate category for high withholding tax interest, then any loss account balance in that category shall be allocated to the post-2006 separate category for general category income.
(ii)
Recapture of separate limitation loss with respect to a pre-2007 separate category for high withholding tax interest.
To the extent that a taxpayer has a balance in a separate limitation loss account in any pre-2007 separate category with respect to a pre-2007 separate category for high withholding tax interest at the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2007, such loss shall be recaptured in subsequent taxable years on a pro rata basis as income in the post-2006 separate categories for general category and passive category income, based on the proportion in which any unused foreign taxes in the pre-2007 separate category for high withholding tax interest are allocated under § 1.904-2(i)(1). If the taxpayer, other than a financial services entity as defined in § 1.904-4(e)(3), has no unused foreign taxes in the pre-2007 separate category for high withholding tax interest, then the loss account balance shall be recaptured in subsequent taxable years solely as income in the post-2006 separate category for passive category income. If the taxpayer is a financial services entity, as defined in § 1.904-4(e)(3), and has no unused foreign taxes in the pre-2007 separate category for high withholding tax interest, then the loss account balance shall be recaptured in subsequent taxable years solely as income in the post-2006 separate category for general category income.
(4)
Elimination of certain separate limitation loss accounts.
After application of paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(3) of this section, any separate limitation loss account allocated to the post-2006 separate category for passive category income for which income is to be recaptured as passive category income, as determined under those same provisions, shall be eliminated. Similarly, after application of paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(3) of this section, any separate limitation loss account allocated to the post-2006 separate category for general category income for which income is to be recaptured as general category income, as determined under those same provisions, shall be eliminated.
(5)
Alternative method.
In lieu of applying the rules of paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(3) of this section, a taxpayer may apply the principles of paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section to determine recapture in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006, of separate limitation losses and overall foreign losses incurred in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2007. A taxpayer may choose to use the alternative method on a timely filed (original or amended) tax return or during an audit. A taxpayer that uses the alternative method on an amended return or in the course of an audit must make appropriate adjustments to eliminate any double benefit arising from application of the alternative method to years that are not open for assessment. A taxpayer's choice to use the alternative method is evidenced by employing the method. The taxpayer need not file any separate statement.
(6)
Effective/applicability date.
This paragraph (h) shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006, and ending on or after December 21, 2007. However, taxpayers may choose to apply 26 CFR 1.904(f)-12T(h) as it appeared in the Code of Federal Regulations as of April 1, 2010, in lieu of this paragraph (h) to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006 and ending on or after December 21, 2007, but ending before April 7, 2011 provided that appropriate adjustments are made to eliminate duplicate benefits arising from application of 26 CFR 1.904(f)-12T(h) to taxable years that are not open for assessment. In addition, if a taxpayer that is a financial services entity (as defined in § 1.904-4(e)(3)) chooses to apply 26 CFR 1.904(f)-12T(h) to taxable years ending before April 7, 2011, then as of the beginning of the taxpayer's first taxable year ending on or after April 7, 2011 any remaining balance in a passive category loss account that is attributable to a loss account in a pre-2007 separate category for high withholding tax interest shall be allocated to the general category or eliminated pursuant to § 1.904(f)-12(h)(4), and any remaining balance in a separate limitation loss account with respect to passive category income that is attributable to a loss account with respect to a pre-2007 separate category for high withholding tax interest will be recaptured in such year and subsequent taxable years as general category income
or eliminated pursuant to § 1.904(f)-12(h)(4).

Allocation of separate limitation loss or overall foreign loss account incurred in a pre-2018 separate category
—(i)
Allocation to the same category.
To the extent that a taxpayer has a balance in any separate limitation loss or overall foreign loss account in a pre-2018 separate category at the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, the amount of such balance is allocated on the first day of the taxpayer's next taxable year to the same post-2017 separate category as the pre-2018 separate category of the separate limitation loss or overall foreign loss account.
(ii)
Exception for general category separate limitation loss or overall foreign loss account
—(A)
In general.
To the extent a taxpayer has a balance in any separate limitation loss or overall foreign loss account in the pre-2018 separate category for general category income at the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, a taxpayer may choose to allocate any such balance to the taxpayer's post-2017 separate category for foreign branch category income to the extent the balance in the loss account would have been allocated to the taxpayer's post-2017 separate category for foreign branch category income if that separate category applied in the year or years the losses giving rise to the account were incurred. Any remaining portion of the balance in the separate limitation loss or overall foreign loss account is allocated to the taxpayer's post-2017 separate category for general category income.
(B)
Safe harbor.
In lieu of applying paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the taxpayer may choose to recapture the balance in any loss account described in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A) of this section from the first available income in the taxpayer's post-2017 separate category for general category income or foreign branch category income. If the sum of taxpayer's general category income and foreign branch category income for a taxable year subject to recharacterization exceeds the amount of the loss account described in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A) of this section that is to be recaptured, then the amount of general category income and foreign branch category income that will be recharacterized under the relevant recapture provisions is determined on a proportionate basis. The recapture under this paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B) of any loss account described in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A) of this section is made before the recapture of any amount by which the balance of the loss account is increased after the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018.
(C)
Rules regarding the exception.
A taxpayer applying the exception described in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section must apply the exception to all balances in any separate limitation loss or overall foreign loss account in a pre-2018 separate category for general category income at the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018. A taxpayer may apply the exception on a timely filed original return (including extensions) or an amended return. A taxpayer that applies the exception on an amended return must make appropriate adjustments to eliminate any double benefit arising from application of the exception to years that are not open for assessment.
(3)
Recapture of separate limitation loss or overall domestic loss that reduced pre-2018 separate category income
—(i)
Recapture as income in the same separate category.
To the extent that at the end of
the taxpayer's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, a taxpayer has a balance in any separate limitation loss or overall domestic loss account which offset pre-2018 separate category income, such loss is recaptured in subsequent taxable years as income in the same post-2017 separate category as the pre-2018 separate category of income that was offset by the loss.
(ii)
Exception for separate limitation loss or overall domestic loss that reduced general category income
—(A)
In general.
To the extent that a taxpayer's separate limitation loss or overall domestic loss account offset pre-2018 separate category income that was general category income, a taxpayer may choose to recapture the balance in the loss account at the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, in subsequent taxable years as income in the post-2017 separate category for foreign branch category income to the extent the balance in the loss account would have offset foreign branch category income had that separate category applied in the year or years the losses were incurred. Any remaining portion of the balance in the loss account is recaptured as income in the taxpayer's post-2017 separate category for general category income.
(B)
Safe harbor.
In lieu of applying paragraph (j)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, a taxpayer that had unused foreign income taxes in a pre-2018 taxable year that were allocated to the foreign branch category under § 1.904-2(j)(1)(iii)(A) or (B) may choose to recapture the balance in any loss account described in paragraph (j)(3)(ii)(A) of this section in subsequent taxable years ratably as income in the taxpayer's post-2017 separate categories for general category and foreign branch category income, based on the proportion in which any unused foreign taxes in the pre-2018 separate category for general category income are allocated under § 1.904-2(j)(1)(iii)(A) or (B).
(C)
Rules regarding the exception.
A taxpayer applying the exception described in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section must apply the exception to the recapture of all balances at the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018 in any separate limitation loss or overall domestic loss account which offset pre-2018 separate category income that was general category income. A taxpayer may apply the exception on a timely filed original return (including extensions) or an amended return. A taxpayer that applies the exception on an amended return must make appropriate adjustments to eliminate any double benefit arising from application of the exception to years that are not open for assessment.
(4)
Treatment of foreign losses that are part of net operating losses incurred in pre-2018 taxable years which are carried forward to post-2017 taxable years
—(i)
Treatment as a loss in the same separate category.
A foreign loss that is part of a net operating loss incurred in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, which is carried forward, pursuant to section 172, to a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, will be carried forward under the rules of § 1.904(g)-3(b)(2). For purposes of applying the rules of § 1.904(g)-3(b)(2), the portion of a net operating loss carryforward that is attributable to a foreign loss from a pre-2018 separate category will be treated as a loss attributable to the same post-2017 separate category as the pre-2018 separate category.
(ii)
Exception for general category foreign losses that are part of net operating losses
—(A)
In general.
A taxpayer may choose to treat the portion of a net operating loss carryforward that is attributable to a foreign loss from the pre-2018 separate category for general category income as attributable to the post-2017 separate category for foreign branch category income to the extent the net operating loss would have been attributable to the taxpayer's post-2017 separate category for foreign branch category income had that separate category applied in the year or years the net operating loss arose. Any remaining portion of the net operating loss carryforward is treated as attributable to the taxpayer's post-2017 separate category for general category income.
(B)
Safe harbor.
In lieu of applying paragraph (j)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, for the post-2017 taxable year in which a net operating loss carryforward described in paragraph (j)(4)(ii)(A) of this
section is used, the taxpayer may choose to treat the net operating loss carryforward as attributable to the taxpayer's post-2017 separate categories for general category income and foreign branch category income to the extent of any general category income and foreign branch category income, respectively, that is available in the carryforward year to be offset by the net operating loss carryforward. To the extent the net operating loss carryforward offsets any other income in the carryforward year, it is treated as attributable to the taxpayer's post-2017 separate category for general category income. If the sum of taxpayer's general category income and foreign branch income in the carryforward year exceeds the amount of the net operating loss carryforward, then the amount of each type of separate income that is offset by the net operating loss carryforward, and therefore the separate category treatment of the net operating loss carryforward, is be determined on a proportionate basis. A general category net operating loss to which the exception is applied is absorbed before any general category net operating loss that is incurred after the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018.
(C)
Rules regarding the exception.
A taxpayer applying the exception described in paragraph (j)(4)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section must apply the exception to all of its net operating losses that are attributable to a foreign loss from the pre-2018 separate category for general category income. A taxpayer may apply the exception on a timely filed original return (including extensions) or an amended return. A taxpayer that applies the exception on an amended return must make appropriate adjustments to eliminate any double benefit arising from application of the exception to years that are not open for assessment.
(5)
Treatment of net operating losses incurred in post-2017 taxable years that are carried back to pre-2018 taxable years
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (j)(5)(ii) of this section, a net operating loss incurred in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017 (a “post-2017 taxable year”), which is carried back, pursuant to section 172, to a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018 (a “pre-2018 carryback year”), will be carried back under the rules of § 1.904(g)-3(b). For purposes of applying the rules of § 1.904(g)-3(b), income in a pre-2018 separate category in the taxable year to which the net operating loss is carried back is treated as if it included only income that would be assigned to the post-2017 general category. Therefore, any separate limitation loss created by reason of a passive category component of a net operating loss from a post-2017 taxable year that is carried back to offset general category income in a pre-2018 carryback year will be recaptured in post-2017 taxable years as general category income, and not as a combination of general, foreign branch, and section 951A category income.
(ii)
Foreign source losses in the post-2017 separate categories for foreign branch category income and section 951A category income.
Net operating losses attributable to a foreign source loss in the post-2017 separate categories for foreign branch category income and section 951A category income are treated as first offsetting general category income in a pre-2018 carryback year to the extent available to be offset by the net operating loss carryback. If the sum of foreign source losses in the taxpayer's separate categories for foreign branch category income and section 951A category income in the year the net operating loss is incurred exceeds the amount of general category income that is available to be offset in the carryback year, then the amount of foreign source loss in each of the foreign branch and section 951A categories that is treated as offsetting general category income under this paragraph (j)(5)(ii), is determined on a proportionate basis. General category income in the pre-2018 carryback year is first offset by foreign source loss in the taxpayer's post-2017 separate category for general category income in the year the net operating loss is incurred before any foreign source loss in that year in the separate categories for foreign branch category income and section 951A category income is carried back to reduce general category income. To the extent a foreign source loss in a post-2017 separate category for
foreign branch category income or section 951A category income offsets general category income in a pre-2018 taxable year under the rules of this paragraph (j)(5)(ii), no separate limitation loss account is created.
(6)
Coordination rule with respect to exceptions.
A taxpayer that applies any exception described in § 1.904-2(j)(1)(iii) or paragraph (j)(2)(ii), (j)(3)(ii), or (j)(4)(ii) of this section must apply all such exceptions and cannot apply any of the general rules described in § 1.904-2(j)(1)(ii) or paragraph (j)(2)(i), (j)(3)(i), or (j)(4)(i) of this section. However, in applying each such exception, the taxpayer may choose to apply the safe harbor provision regardless of whether the safe harbor is applied for purposes of any other exception.
(7)
Applicability date.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (j)(7), this paragraph (j) applies to taxable years ending on or after December 31, 2017. Paragraph (j)(5) of this section applies to carrybacks of net operating losses incurred in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018.

§ 1.904(g)-1
Overall domestic loss and the overall domestic loss account.
(a)
Overview of regulations.
This section provides rules for determining a taxpayer's overall domestic losses, for establishing overall domestic loss accounts, and for making additions to and reducing such accounts for purposes of section 904(g). Section 1.904(g)-2 provides rules for recapturing the balance in any overall domestic loss account under the general recharacterization rule of section 904(g)(1). Section 1.904(g)-3 provides ordering rules for
the allocation of net operating losses, net capital losses, U.S. source losses, and separate limitation losses, and the recapture of separate limitation losses, overall foreign losses and overall domestic losses.
(b)
Overall domestic loss accounts
—(1)
In general.
Any taxpayer that sustains an overall domestic loss under paragraph (c) of this section must establish an overall domestic loss account for such loss with respect to each separate category, as defined in § 1.904(f)-7(b)(1), of the taxpayer in which foreign source income is offset by the domestic loss. The balance in each overall domestic loss account represents the amount of such overall domestic loss subject to recapture in a given taxable year. From year to year, amounts may be added to or subtracted from the balances in such loss accounts as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.
(2)
Taxable year in which overall domestic loss is sustained.
When a domestic loss is carried back or carried forward as part of a net operating loss, and offsets foreign source income in a carryover year, the resulting overall domestic loss is treated as sustained in the later of the year in which the domestic loss was incurred or the year to which the loss was carried. Accordingly, when a taxpayer incurs a domestic loss that is carried back as part of a net operating loss to offset foreign source income in a qualified taxable year, as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the resulting overall domestic loss is treated as sustained in the later year in which the domestic loss was incurred and not in the earlier year in which the loss offset foreign source income. In addition, when a taxpayer incurs a domestic loss that is carried forward as part of a net operating loss and applied to offset foreign source income in a later taxable year, the resulting overall domestic loss is treated as sustained in the later year in which the domestic loss offsets foreign source income and not in the earlier year in which the loss was incurred. For example, if a taxpayer incurs a domestic loss in the 2007 taxable year that is carried back to the 2006 qualified taxable year and offsets foreign source income in 2006, the resulting overall domestic loss is treated as sustained in the 2007 taxable year. If a taxpayer incurs a domestic loss in a pre-2007 taxable year that is carried forward to a post-2006 qualified taxable year and offsets foreign source income in the post-2006 year, the resulting overall domestic loss is treated as sustained in the post-2006 year. An overall domestic loss account is established, or increased under paragraph (d) of this section, at the end of the taxable year in which the overall domestic loss is treated as sustained and will be recaptured from U.S. source income arising in subsequent taxable years.
(c)
Determination of a taxpayer's overall domestic loss
—(1)
Overall domestic loss defined.
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006, a taxpayer sustains an overall domestic loss—
(i) In any qualified taxable year in which its domestic loss for such taxable year offsets foreign source taxable income for the taxable year or for any preceding qualified taxable year by reason of a carryback; and
(ii) In any other taxable year in which the domestic loss for such taxable year offsets foreign source taxable income for any preceding qualified taxable year by reason of a carryback.
(2)
Domestic loss defined.
For purposes of this section and §§ 1.904(g)-2 and 1.904(g)-3, the term
domestic loss
means the amount by which the U.S. source gross income for the taxable year is exceeded by the sum of the expenses, losses, and other deductions properly apportioned or allocated to such income, taking into account any net operating loss carried forward from a prior taxable year, but not any loss carried back. If a taxpayer has any capital gains or losses or qualified dividend income, as defined in section 1(h)(11), the amount of the taxpayer's domestic loss that offsets foreign source income must be determined taking into account adjustments under section 904(b)(2). See § 1.904(g)-1(d)(3) for further guidance.
(3)
Qualified taxable year defined.
For purposes of this section and §§ 1.904(g)-2 and 1.904(g)-3, the term
qualified taxable year
means any taxable year for which the taxpayer chooses the benefits of section 901.
(4)
Method of allocation and apportionment of deductions.
In determining its overall domestic loss, a taxpayer shall allocate and apportion expenses, losses, and other deductions to U.S. source gross income in accordance with sections 861(b) and 865 and the regulations thereunder, including §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T.
(d)
Additions to overall domestic loss accounts
—(1)
General rule.
A taxpayer's overall domestic loss as determined under paragraph (c) of this section shall be added to the applicable overall domestic loss account at the end of its taxable year to the extent that the overall domestic loss either reduces foreign source income for the year (but only if such year is a qualified taxable year) or reduces foreign source income for a qualified taxable year to which the loss has been carried back.
(2)
Overall domestic loss of another taxpayer.
If any portion of any overall domestic loss of another taxpayer is allocated to the taxpayer in accordance with § 1.1502-9 (relating to consolidated overall domestic losses) the taxpayer shall add such amount to its applicable overall domestic loss account.
(3)
Adjustments for capital gains and losses.
If the taxpayer has capital gains or losses or qualified dividend income, the amount by which a domestic loss is considered to reduce foreign source income in a taxable year shall equal the section 904(f)(5)(D) amount determined under § 1.904(b)-1(h)(1)(iii), regardless of the amount of domestic loss that was determined before taking any section 904(b)(2) adjustments into account.
(e)
Reductions of overall domestic loss accounts.
The taxpayer shall subtract the following amounts from its overall domestic loss accounts at the end of its taxable year in the following order, as applicable:
(1)
Pre-recapture reduction for amounts allocated to other taxpayers.
An overall domestic loss account is reduced by the amount of any overall domestic loss which is allocated to another taxpayer in accordance with § 1.1502-9 (relating to consolidated overall domestic losses).
(2)
Reduction for amounts recaptured.
An overall domestic loss account is reduced by the amount of any U.S. source income that is recharacterized in accordance with § 1.904(g)-2(c) (relating to recapture under section 904(g)(1)).
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to taxpayers that sustain an overall domestic loss for a taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2012. Taxpayers may choose to apply this section to overall domestic losses sustained in other taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006, including periods covered by 26 CFR § 1.904(g)-1T (revised as of April 1, 2010).
[T.D. 9595, 77 FR 37580, June 22, 2012]
§ 1.904(g)-2
Recapture of overall domestic losses.
(a)
In general.
A taxpayer shall recapture an overall domestic loss as provided in this section. Recapture is accomplished by treating a portion of the taxpayer's U.S. source taxable income as foreign source income. The recharacterized income is allocated among and increases foreign source income in separate categories in proportion to the balances of the overall domestic loss accounts with respect to those separate categories. As a result, if the taxpayer chooses the benefits of section 901, the taxpayer's foreign tax credit limitation is increased. As provided in § 1.904(g)-1(e)(2), the balance in a taxpayer's overall domestic loss account with respect to a separate category is reduced at the end of each taxable year by the amount of loss recaptured during that taxable year. Recapture continues until the amount of U.S. source income recharacterized as foreign source income equals the amount in the overall domestic loss account.
(b)
Determination of U.S. source taxable income for purposes of recapture.
For purposes of determining the amount of an overall domestic loss subject to recapture, the taxpayer's taxable income from U.S. sources shall be computed in accordance with the rules set forth in § 1.904(g)-1(c)(4). U.S. source taxable income shall be determined by taking into account adjustments for capital gains and losses and qualified dividend income in a similar manner to the adjustments made to foreign source taxable income under section 904(b)(2) and § 1.904(b)-1, following the principles of § 1.904(b)-1(h)(1)(i).
(c)
Section 904(g)(1) recapture.
The amount of any U.S. source taxable income subject to recharacterization in a taxable year in which paragraph (a) of this section applies is the lesser of the aggregate balance of the taxpayer's overall domestic loss accounts or 50 percent of the taxpayer's U.S. source taxable income (as determined under paragraph (b) of this section).
(d)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to taxpayers that sustain an overall domestic loss for a taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2012. Taxpayers may choose to apply this section to overall domestic losses sustained in other taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006, including periods covered by 26 CFR 1.904(g)-2T (revised as of April 1, 2010).
[T.D. 9595, 77 FR 37581, June 22, 2012]
§ 1.904(g)-3
Ordering rules for the allocation of net operating losses, net capital losses, U.S. source losses, and separate limitation losses, and for the recapture of separate limitation losses, overall foreign losses, and overall domestic losses.
(a)
In general.
This section provides ordering rules for the allocation of net operating losses, net capital losses, U.S. source losses, and separate limitation losses, and for the recapture of separate limitation losses, overall foreign losses, and overall domestic losses. The rules must be applied in the order set forth in paragraphs (b) through (j) of this section.
(b)
Step One: Allocation of net operating loss and net capital loss carryovers
—(1)
In general.
Net operating losses from a current taxable year are carried forward or back to a taxable year in the following manner. Net operating losses that are carried forward pursuant to section 172 are combined with income or loss in the carryover year in the manner described in this paragraph (b). The combined amounts are then subject to the ordering rules provided in paragraphs (c) through (i) of this section. Net operating losses that are carried back to a prior taxable year pursuant to section 172 are allocated to income in the carryback year in the manner set forth in paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), (c), (d), and (e) of this section. The income in the carryback year to which the net operating loss is allocated is the foreign source income in each separate category and the U.S. source income after the application of sections 904(f) and 904(g) to income and loss in that previous year, including as a result of net operating loss carryovers or carrybacks from taxable years prior to the current taxable year. See §§ 1.861-8(e)(8), 1.904(b)-3(d)(2), and 1.1502-4(c)(1)(iii) for rules to determine the source and separate category components of a net operating loss.
(2)
Full net operating loss deduction.
If the full net operating loss (that remains after carryovers to other taxable years) is deducted in computing the taxable income in a particular year (carryover year), so that there is no remaining net operating loss that can be carried to other taxable years, U.S. source losses and foreign source losses in separate categories that comprise the net operating loss shall be combined with the U.S. source income or loss and the foreign source income or loss in the same separate categories in the carryover year.
(3)
Partial net operating loss deduction.
If the full net operating loss (that remains after carryovers to other taxable years) is not deducted in computing the taxable income in a carryover year, so that there is remaining loss that can be carried to other taxable years, the following rules apply:
(i) Any U.S. source loss (not to exceed the amount of the net operating loss carryover deducted in computing the taxable income in the carryover year (the net operating loss deduction)) shall be carried over to the extent of any U.S. source income in the carryover year.
(ii) If the net operating loss deduction exceeds the U.S. source loss carryover determined under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, then separate limitation losses that are part of the net operating loss shall be tentatively carried over to the extent of separate limitation income in the same separate category in the carryover year. If the sum of the potential separate limitation loss carryovers determined under the preceding sentence exceeds the amount of the net operating loss deduction reduced by any U.S. source loss carried over under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of
this section, then the potential separate limitation loss carryovers shall be reduced pro rata so that their sum equals such amount.
(iii) If the net operating loss deduction exceeds the sum of the U.S. and separate limitation loss carryovers determined under paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, then a proportionate part of the remaining loss from each separate category shall be carried over to the extent of such excess and combined with the foreign source loss, if any, in the same separate categories in the carryover year.
(iv) If the net operating loss deduction exceeds the sum of all the loss carryovers determined under paragraphs (b)(3)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, then any U.S. source loss not carried over under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section shall be carried over to the extent of such excess and combined with the U.S. source loss, if any, in the carryover year.
(4)
Net capital loss carryovers.
Rules similar to the rules of paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section apply for purposes of determining the components of a net capital loss carryover to a taxable year.
(c)
Step Two: Section 904(b) adjustments.
The taxpayer shall make any required adjustments to capital gains and losses and qualified dividend income under section 904(b)(2). The taxpayer also takes into account any adjustments required under section 904(b)(4) and § 1.904(b)-3.
(d)
Step Three: Allocation of separate limitation losses.
The taxpayer shall allocate separate limitation losses sustained during the taxable year (increased, if appropriate, by any losses carried over under paragraph (b) of this section), in the following manner—
(1) The taxpayer shall allocate its separate limitation losses for the taxable year to reduce its separate limitation income in other separate categories on a proportionate basis, and increase its separate limitation loss accounts appropriately. To the extent a separate limitation loss in one separate category is allocated to reduce separate limitation income in a second separate category, and the second category has a separate limitation loss account from a prior taxable year with respect to the first category, the two separate limitation loss accounts shall be netted against each other.
(2) If the taxpayer's separate limitation losses for the taxable year exceed the taxpayer's separate limitation income for the year, so that the taxpayer has separate limitation losses remaining after the application of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the taxpayer shall allocate those losses to its U.S. source income for the taxable year, to the extent thereof, and shall increase its overall foreign loss accounts to that extent in accordance with § 1.904(f)-1.
(e)
Step Four: Allocation of U.S. source losses.
The taxpayer shall allocate U.S. source losses sustained during the taxable year (increased, if appropriate, by any losses carried over under paragraph (b) of this section) to separate limitation income on a proportionate basis, and shall increase its overall domestic loss accounts to the extent of such allocation in accordance with § 1.904(g)-1.
(f)
Step Five: Recapture of overall foreign loss accounts.
If the taxpayer's separate limitation income for the taxable year (reduced by any losses carried over under paragraph (b) of this section) exceeds the sum of the taxpayer's U.S. source loss and separate limitation losses for the year, so that the taxpayer has separate limitation income remaining after the application of paragraphs (d)(1) and (e) of this section, then the taxpayer recaptures prior year overall foreign losses, if any, in accordance with § 1.904(f)-2, and reduces overall foreign loss accounts in accordance with § 1.904(f)-2. The recapture in this paragraph (f) includes amounts determined under § 1.904(f)-2(c) and (d)(3) but not § 1.904(f)-2(d)(4), which is covered in paragraph (i) of this section.
(g)
Step Six: Recapture of separate limitation loss accounts.
To the extent the taxpayer has remaining separate limitation income for the year after the application of paragraph (f) of this section, then the taxpayer shall recapture prior year separate limitation losses, if any, in accordance with § 1.904(f)-8 and reduce separate limitation loss accounts in accordance with § 1.904(f)-7.
(h)
Step Seven: Recapture of overall domestic loss accounts.
If the taxpayer's
U.S. source income for the year (reduced by any losses carried over under paragraph (b) of this section or allocated under paragraph (d) of this section, but not increased by any recapture of overall foreign loss accounts under paragraph (f) of this section) exceeds the taxpayer's separate limitation losses for the year, so that the taxpayer has U.S. source income remaining after the application of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, then the taxpayer shall recapture its prior year overall domestic losses, if any, and reduce overall domestic loss accounts in accordance with § 1.904(g)-2.
(i)
Step Eight: Dispositions under section 904(f)(3) in which gain would not otherwise be recognized.
The taxpayer determines the amount of gain that would otherwise not be recognized but that must be recognized in accordance with § 1.904(f)-2(d)(4) (not exceeding the taxpayer's applicable overall foreign loss account) and then applies § 1.904(f)-2(a) and (b) to recapture and reduce its overall foreign loss accounts in an amount equal to the gain recognized. To the extent this recognition of gain in a taxable year reduces the amount of a current year net operating loss or increases the amount of a net operating loss carryover to that taxable year, paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section are applied to determine the allocation of any additional net operating loss deduction and other deductions or losses and the applicable increases in the taxpayer's overall foreign loss, separate limitation loss, and overall domestic loss accounts, but only after the applicable overall foreign loss account has been recaptured as provided in this paragraph (i).
(j)
Step Nine: Dispositions that result in additional income recognition under the branch loss recapture and dual consolidated loss recapture rules
—(1)
In general.
If, after any gain is required to be recognized under section 904(f)(3) on a transaction that is otherwise a nonrecognition transaction, an additional amount of income is recognized under section 91(d), section 367(a)(3)(C) (as applicable to losses incurred before January 1, 2018), or § 1.1503(d)-6, and that additional income amount is determined by taking into account an offset for the amount of gain recognized under section 904(f)(3) and so is not initially taken into account in applying paragraph (b) of this section, then paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section are applied to determine the allocation of any additional net operating loss deduction and other deductions or losses and the applicable increases in the taxpayer's overall foreign loss, separate limitation loss, and overall domestic loss accounts, as well as any additional recapture and reduction of the taxpayer's separate limitation loss, overall foreign loss, and overall domestic loss accounts.
(2)
Rules for additional recapture of loss accounts.
For the purpose of recapturing and reducing loss accounts under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, the taxpayer also takes into account any creation of or addition to loss accounts that result from the application of paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section in the current tax year. If any of the additional income described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section is foreign source income in a separate category for which there is a remaining balance in an overall foreign loss account after applying paragraph (i) of this section, the section 904(f)(1) recapture amount under § 1.904(f)-2(c) for that additional income is determined by first computing a hypothetical recapture amount as it would have been determined prior to the application of paragraph (i) of this section but taking into account the additional foreign source income described in this paragraph (j)(2) and then subtracting the actual overall foreign loss recapture determined prior to the application of paragraph (i) of this section (that did not take into account the additional foreign source income). The remainder is the overall foreign loss recapture amount with respect to the additional foreign source income described in this paragraph (j)(2).

Analysis
—(A)
Net operating loss allocation.
Because USC's taxable income for Year 1 exceeds its total net operating loss for Year 2, the full net operating loss is carried back. Under paragraph (b) of this section (Step 1), each component of the net operating loss is carried back and combined with its same category in Year 1. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section. After allocation of the net operating loss, USC has the following taxable income and losses for Year 1:

($90x)
(B)
Loss allocation.
Under paragraph (e) of this section (Step 4), the ($90x) of U.S. loss is allocated proportionately to reduce the foreign branch category and passive category income. Accordingly, $30x ($90x × $100x/$300x) of the U.S. loss is allocated to foreign branch category income and $60x ($90x × $200x/$300x) of the U.S. loss is allocated to passive category income, with a corresponding creation or increase to USC's overall domestic loss accounts.

Example 2
—(i)
Facts
—(A) USC is a domestic corporation with foreign branch operations in Country X. As of January 1, Year 1, USC has no loss accounts subject to recapture. For Year 1, USC has a net operating loss of ($1,400x), determined as follows:

—(A)
Net operating loss allocation.
Under paragraph (b) of this section (Step 1), because USC's total taxable income for Year 2 of $1600x ($1,200x + $500x − $100x) exceeds the total Year 1 net operating loss, the full $1,400x net operating loss is carried forward. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, each component of the net operating loss is carried forward and combined with its same category in Year 2. After allocation of the net operating loss, USC has the following taxable income and losses:

(B)
Loss allocation.
Under paragraph (d) of this section (Step 3), $100x of the passive category loss offsets the $100x of foreign branch category income, resulting in a passive category separate limitation loss account with respect to foreign branch category income, and the other $200x of passive category loss offsets $200x of the U.S. source taxable income, resulting in the creation of an overall foreign loss account in the passive category.

Net operating loss allocation.
Under paragraph (b) of this section (Step 1), because the total net operating loss for Year 1 of ($1,400x) exceeds total taxable income for Year 2 of $1,300x ($1,200x + $200x − $100x), USC has a partial net operating loss carryover to Year 2 of $1,300x. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, first, the
$800x U.S. source component of the net operating loss is allocated to U.S. income for Year 2. The tentative foreign branch category carryover under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section ($200x) does not exceed the remaining net operating loss carryover amount ($500x). Therefore, $200x of the foreign branch category component of the net operating loss is next allocated to the foreign branch category income for Year 2. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, the remaining $300x of net operating loss carryover ($1300x − $800x − $200x) is carried over proportionally from the remaining net operating loss components in the foreign branch category ($200x, or $400x total foreign branch category loss − $200x foreign branch category loss already allocated) and passive category ($200x). Therefore, $150x ($300x × $200x/$400x) of the remaining net operating loss carryover is carried over from the foreign branch category for Year 1 and combined with the foreign branch category income for Year 2, and $150x ($300x × $200x/$400x) of the remaining net operating loss carryover is carried over from the passive category for Year 1 and combined with the passive category loss for Year 2. After allocation of the net operating loss carryover from Year 1 to the appropriate categories for Year 2, USC has the following taxable income and losses:

Net operating loss allocation.
Under paragraph (b) of this section (Step 1), because the total net operating loss of ($1400x) exceeds total taxable income for Year 2 of $200x ($200x + $200x − $200x), USC has a partial net operating loss carryover to Year 2 of $200x. Because USC has no U.S. source income in Year 2, under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section no portion of the U.S. source component of the net operating loss is initially carried into Year 2. Because the total tentative carryover under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section of $400x ($200x in each of the foreign branch and passive categories) exceeds the net operating loss carryover amount, the tentative carryover from each separate category is reduced proportionately by $100x ($200x × $200x/$400x). Accordingly, $100x ($200x − $100x) of the foreign branch category component of the net operating loss is carried forward and $100x ($200x − $100x) of the passive category component of the net operating loss is carried forward and combined with income in the same respective categories for Year 2. After allocation of the net operating loss carryover from Year 1, USC has the following taxable income and losses:

Net operating loss allocation.
Under paragraph (b) of this
section (Step 1), because USC's total net operating loss in Year 1 of ($1,400x) exceeds its total taxable income for Year 2 of $800x ($100x + $800x − $100x), USC has a partial net operating loss carryover to Year 2 of $800x. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, $100x of the U.S. source component of the net operating loss is allocated to U.S. income for Year 2. The tentative foreign branch category carryover under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section does not exceed the remaining net operating loss carryover amount. Therefore, $400x of the foreign branch category component of the net operating loss is allocated to reduce foreign branch category income in Year 2. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, of the remaining $300x of net operating loss carryover ($800x − $100x − $400x), $200x is carried forward from the passive category component of the net operating loss and combined with the passive category loss for Year 2. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, the remaining $100x ($300x − $200x) of net operating loss carryover is carried forward from the U.S. source component of the net operating loss and combined with the U.S. source income (and the previously allocated U.S. source component of the net operating loss) for Year 2. After allocation of the net operating loss carryover from Year 1, USC has the following taxable income and losses:

—(i)
Facts
—(A) USC is a domestic corporation with foreign branch operations in Country X. USC has no net operating losses and does not make an election to recapture more than the required amount of overall foreign losses. As of January 1, Year 1, USC has a ($200x) foreign branch category overall foreign loss (OFL) account and a ($200x) foreign branch category separate limitation loss (SLL) account with respect to the passive category. For Year 1, USC has $400x of passive category income that is fully offset by a ($400x) domestic loss in that taxable year, giving rise to the creation of an overall domestic loss (ODL) account with respect to the passive category. As of January 1, Year 2, USC has the following balances in its OFL, SLL, and ODL accounts:

Loss allocation.
Under paragraph (d) of this section (Step 3), the $100x of passive category loss offsets $100x of the foreign branch category income, creating a passive category SLL account of $100x with respect to the foreign branch category. Because there is an offsetting foreign branch category SLL account of $200x with respect to the passive category from a prior taxable year, the two accounts are netted against each other so that all that remains is a $100x foreign branch category SLL account with respect to the passive category.
(B)
OFL account recapture.
Under paragraph (f) of this section (Step 5), 50% of the remaining $300x, or $150x, of income in the foreign branch category is subject to recharacterization as U.S. source income as a recapture of part of the OFL account in the foreign branch category.
(C)
SLL account recapture.
Under paragraph (g) of this section (Step 6),
$100x of the remaining $150x of income in the foreign branch category is recharacterized as passive category income as a recapture of the foreign branch category SLL account with respect to the passive category.
(D)
ODL account recapture.
Under paragraph (h) of this section (Step 7), 50% of the $600, or $300, of U.S. source income is subject to recharacterization as foreign source passive category income as a recapture of a part of the ODL account with respect to the passive category. None of the $150x of foreign branch category income that was recharacterized as U.S. source income under paragraph (f) of this section (Step 5) is included here as income subject to recharacterization in connection with recapture of the ODL account.

§ 1.904(i)-1
Limitation on use of deconsolidation to avoid foreign tax credit limitations.
(a)
General rule.
If two or more includible corporations are affiliates, within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, at any time during their taxable years, then, solely for purposes of applying the foreign tax credit provisions of section 59(a), sections 901 through 908, and section 960, the rules of this section will apply.
(1)
Determination of taxable income
—(i) Each affiliate must compute its net taxable income or loss in each separate category (as defined in § 1.904-5(a)(4)(v), and treating U.S. source income or loss as a separate category) without regard to sections 904(f) and 907(c)(4). Only affiliates that are members of the same consolidated group use the consolidated return regulations (other than those under sections 904(f) and 907(c)(4)) in computing such net taxable income or loss. To the extent otherwise applicable, other provisions of the Code and regulations must be used in the determination of an affiliate's net taxable income or loss in a separate category.
(ii) The net taxable income amounts in each separate category determined under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section are combined for all affiliates to determine one amount for the group of affiliates in each separate category. However, a net loss of an affiliate (first affiliate) in a separate category determined under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section will be combined under this paragraph (a) with net income or loss amounts of other affiliates in the same category only if, and to the extent that, the net loss offsets taxable income, whether U.S. or foreign source, of the first affiliate. The consolidated
return regulations that apply the principles of sections 904(f) and 907(c)(4) to consolidated groups will then be applied to the combined amounts in each separate category as if all affiliates were members of a single consolidated group.
(2)
Allocation.
Any net taxable income in a separate category calculated under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section for purposes of the foreign tax credit provisions must then be allocated among the affiliates under any consistently applied reasonable method, taking into account all of the facts and circumstances. A method is consistently applied if used by all affiliates from year to year. Once chosen, an allocation method may be changed only with the consent of the Commissioner. This allocation will only affect the source and foreign tax credit separate limitation character of the income for purposes of the foreign tax credit separate limitation of each affiliate, and will not otherwise affect an affiliate's total net income or loss. This section applies whether the federal income tax consequences of its application favor, or are adverse to, the taxpayer.
(b)
Definitions and special rules
For purposes of this section only, the following terms will have the meanings specified.
(1)
Affiliate
—(i)
Generally.
Affiliates are includible corporations—
(A) That are members of the same affiliated group, as defined in section 1504(a); or
(B) That would be members of the same affiliated group, as defined in section 1504(a) if—
(
1
) Any non-includible corporation meeting the ownership test of section 1504(a)(2) with respect to any such includible corporation was itself an includible corporation; or
(
2
) The constructive ownership rules of section 1563(e) were applied for purposes of section 1504(a).
(ii)
Rules for consolidated groups.
Affiliates that are members of the same consolidated group are treated as a single affiliate for purposes of this section. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply if the only affiliates under this definition are already members of the same consolidated group without operation of this section.
(iii)
Exception for newly acquired affiliates
—(A) With respect to acquisitions after December 7, 1995, an includible corporation acquired from unrelated third parties (First Corporation) will not be considered an affiliate of another includible corporation (Second Corporation) during the taxable year of the First Corporation beginning before the date on which the First Corporation originally becomes an affiliate with respect to the Second Corporation.
(B) With respect to acquisitions on or before December 7, 1995, an includible corporation acquired from unrelated third parties will not be considered an affiliate of another includible corporation during its taxable year beginning before the date on which the first includible corporation first becomes an affiliate with respect to that other includible corporation.
(C) This exception does not apply where the acquisition of an includible corporation is used to avoid the application of this section.
(2)
Includible corporation.
The term
includible corporation
has the same meaning it has in section 1504(b).
(c)
Taxable years.
If all of the affiliates use the same U.S. taxable year, then that taxable year must be used for purposes of applying this section. If, however, the affiliates use more than one U.S. taxable year, then an appropriate taxable year must be used for applying this section. The determination whether a taxable year is appropriate must take into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances, including the U.S. taxable years used by the affiliates for general U.S. income tax purposes. The taxable year chosen by the affiliates for purposes of applying this section must be used consistently from year to year. The taxable year may be changed only with the prior consent of the Commissioner. Those affiliates that do not use the year determined under this paragraph (c) as their U.S. taxable year for general U.S. income tax purposes must, for purposes of this section, use their U.S. taxable year or years ending within the taxable year determined under this paragraph (c). If, however, the stock of
an affiliate is disposed of so that it ceases to be an affiliate, then the taxable year of that affiliate will be considered to end on the disposition date for purposes of this section.
(d)
Consistent treatment of foreign taxes paid.
All affiliates must consistently either elect under section 901(a) to claim a credit for foreign income taxes paid or accrued, or deemed paid or accrued, or deduct foreign taxes paid or accrued under section 164. See also § 1.1502-4(a); § 1.905-1(a).
(e)
Effective date.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section (relating to newly acquired affiliates), this section is effective for taxable years of affiliates beginning after December 31, 1993.

§ 1.904(j)-1
Certain individuals exempt from foreign tax credit limitation.
(a)
Election available only if all foreign taxes are creditable foreign taxes.
A taxpayer may elect to apply section 904(j) for a taxable year only if all of the taxes for which a credit is allowable to the taxpayer under section 901 for the taxable year (without regard to carryovers) are creditable foreign taxes (as defined in section 904(j)(3)(B)).
(b)
Coordination with carryover rules
—(1)
No carryovers to or from election year.
If the taxpayer elects to apply section 904(j) for any taxable year, then no taxes paid or accrued by the taxpayer during such taxable year may be deemed paid or accrued under section 904(c) in any other taxable year, and no taxes paid or accrued in any other taxable year may be deemed paid or accrued under section 904(c) in such taxable year.
(2)
Carryovers to and from other years determined without regard to election years.
The amount of the foreign taxes paid or accrued, and the amount of the foreign source taxable income, in any year for which the taxpayer elects to apply section 904(j) shall not be taken into account in determining the amount of any carryover to or from any other taxable year. However, an election to apply section 904(j) to any year does not extend the number of taxable years to which unused foreign taxes may be carried under section 904(c) and § 1.904-2(b). Therefore, in determining the number of such carryover years, the taxpayer must take into account years to which a section 904(j) election applies.
(3)
Determination of amount of creditable foreign taxes.
Otherwise allowable carryovers of foreign tax credits from other taxable years shall not be taken into account in determining whether the amount of creditable foreign taxes paid or accrued by an individual during a taxable year exceeds $300 ($600 in the case of a joint return) for purposes of section 904(j)(2)(B).
(c)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section:

# Example 1.
In 2006, X, a single individual using the cash basis method of accounting for income and foreign tax credits, pays $100 of foreign taxes with respect to general limitation income that was earned and included in income for United States tax purposes in 2005. The foreign taxes would be creditable under section 901 but are not shown on a payee statement furnished to X. X's only income for 2006 from sources outside the United States is qualified passive income, with respect to which X pays $200 of creditable foreign taxes shown on a payee statement. X may not elect to apply section 904(j) for 2006 because some of X's foreign taxes are not creditable foreign taxes within the meaning of section 904(j)(3)(B).

# Example 2.
(i) In 2009, A, a single individual using the cash basis method of accounting for income and foreign tax credits, pays creditable foreign taxes of $250 attributable to passive income. Under section 904(c), A may also carry forward to 2009 $100 of unused foreign taxes paid in 2005 with respect to passive income, $300 of unused foreign taxes paid
in 2005 with respect to general limitation income, $400 of unused foreign taxes paid in 2006 with respect to passive income, and $200 of unused foreign taxes paid in 2006 with respect to general limitation income. In 2009, A's only foreign source income is passive income described in section 904(j)(3)(A)(i), and this income is reported to A on a payee statement (within the meaning of section 6724(d)(2)). If A elects to apply section 904(j) for the 2009 taxable year, the unused foreign taxes paid in 2005 and 2006 are not deemed paid in 2009, and A therefore cannot claim a foreign tax credit for those taxes in 2009.
(ii) In 2010, A again is eligible for and elects the application of section 904(j). The carryforwards from 2005 expire in 2010. The carryforward period established under section 904(c) is not extended by A's election under section 904(j). In 2011, A does not elect the application of section 904(j). The $600 of unused foreign taxes paid in 2006 on passive and general limitation income are deemed paid in 2011, under section 904(c), without any adjustment for any portion of those taxes that might have been used as a foreign tax credit in 2009 or 2010 if A had not elected to apply section 904(j) to those years.
(d)
Effective date.
Section 1.904(j)-1 applies to taxable years beginning after July 20, 2004.
[T.D. 9141, 69 FR 43316, July 20, 2004]
§ 1.905-1
When credit for foreign income taxes may be taken.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides rules regarding when the credit for foreign income taxes (as defined in § 1.901-2(a)) may be taken, based on a taxpayer's method of accounting for such taxes. Paragraph (b) of this section provides the general rule. Paragraph (c) of this section sets forth rules for determining the taxable year in which taxpayers using the cash receipts and disbursement method of accounting for income (“cash method”) may claim a foreign tax credit. Paragraph (d) of this section sets forth rules for determining the taxable year in which taxpayers using the accrual method of accounting for income (“accrual method”) may claim a foreign tax credit. Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules for taxpayers using the cash method to claim foreign tax credits on the accrual basis pursuant to the election provided under section 905(a). Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules for when foreign income tax expenditures of a pass-through entity can be taken as a credit by the entity's partners, shareholders, or owners. Paragraph (g) of this section provides rules for when a foreign tax credit can be taken with respect to blocked income. Paragraph (h) provides the applicability dates for this section.
(b)
General rule.
The credit for foreign income taxes provided in subpart A, part III, subchapter N, chapter 1 of the Code (the “foreign tax credit”) may be taken either on the return for the year in which the foreign income taxes accrued or on the return for the year in which the foreign income taxes were paid (that is, remitted), depending on whether the taxpayer uses the accrual or the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting for purposes of computing taxable income and filing returns. However, regardless of the year in which the credit is claimed under the taxpayer's method of accounting for foreign income taxes, the foreign tax credit is allowed only to the extent the foreign income taxes are ultimately both owed and remitted to the foreign country (in the case of a taxpayer claiming the foreign tax credit on the accrual basis, within the time prescribed by section 905(c)(2)). See section 905(b) and §§ 1.901-1(a) and 1.901-2(e). Because the taxpayer's liability for foreign income tax may accrue (that is, become fixed and determinable) in a different taxable year than that in which the tax is paid (that is, remitted), the taxpayer's entitlement to the credit may be perfected, or become subject to adjustment, by reason of events that occur in a taxable year after the taxable year in which the credit is allowed. See section 905(c) and § 1.905-3(a) for rules relating to changes to the taxpayer's foreign income tax liability that require a redetermination of the allowable foreign tax credit and the taxpayer's U.S. tax liability.
(c)
Rules for cash method taxpayers
—(1)
Credit allowed in year paid.
Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, a taxpayer who uses the cash method of accounting may claim a foreign tax credit only in the taxable year in which the foreign income taxes are paid. Generally, foreign income taxes are considered paid in the taxable year in which the taxes are remitted to the
foreign country. However, foreign withholding taxes described in section 901(k)(1)(B), as well as foreign net income taxes described in § 1.901-2(a)(3) that are withheld from the taxpayer's gross income by the payor, are treated as paid in the year in which they are withheld. Foreign income taxes that have been withheld or remitted but which are not considered an amount of tax paid for purposes of section 901 under the rules of § 1.901-2(e) (for example, because the amount withheld or remitted was not a compulsory payment), however, are not eligible for a foreign tax credit. See §§ 1.901-2(e) and 1.905-3(b)(1)(ii)(B) (
Example 2
).
(2)
Payment of contested foreign tax liability.
Under § 1.901-2(e)(2)(i), a foreign income tax liability that is contested by the taxpayer is not a reasonable approximation of the taxpayer's final foreign income tax liability and, therefore, is not considered an amount of tax paid for purposes of section 901 until the contest is resolved. Thus, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a foreign tax credit for a contested foreign income tax liability (or portion thereof) that has been remitted to the foreign country cannot be claimed until such time as the contest is resolved and the tax is considered paid. Once the contest is resolved and the foreign income tax liability is finally determined, the tax liability is treated as paid in the taxable year in which the foreign tax was remitted. See paragraph (c)(1) of this section; see also section 6511(d)(3) and § 301.6511(d)-3 of this chapter for a special 10-year period of limitations for claiming a credit or refund of U.S. tax that is attributable to foreign income taxes for which a credit is allowed under section 901, which for taxpayers claiming credits on the cash basis runs from the unextended due date of the return for the taxable year in which the foreign income taxes are paid (within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section).
(3)
Election to claim a provisional credit for contested taxes remitted before contest is resolved.
A taxpayer claiming foreign tax credits on the cash basis may, under the conditions provided in this paragraph (c)(3), elect to claim a foreign tax credit for a contested foreign income tax liability (or a portion thereof) in the year the contested amount (or a portion thereof) is remitted to the foreign country, notwithstanding that the liability is not finally determined and so is not considered an amount of tax paid. Such election applies only for contested foreign income taxes that are remitted in a taxable year in which the taxpayer elects under section 901(a) to claim a credit, instead of a deduction under section 164(a)(3), for taxes paid in such year. To make the election, a taxpayer must file a Form 1116 (Foreign Tax Credit (Individual, Estate, or Trust)) or Form 1118 (Foreign Tax Credit—Corporations), and the agreement described in paragraphs (d)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this section. In addition, the taxpayer must, for each subsequent taxable year up to and including the taxable year in which the contest is resolved, file the annual notice described in paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section. Any portion of a contested foreign income tax liability for which a provisional credit is claimed under this paragraph (c)(3) that is subsequently refunded by the foreign country results in a foreign tax redetermination under § 1.905-3(a).
(4)
Adjustments to taxes claimed as a credit in the year paid.
A refund of foreign income taxes for which a foreign tax credit has been claimed on the cash basis, or a subsequent determination that the amount paid exceeds the taxpayer's liability for foreign income tax, requires a redetermination of foreign income taxes paid and the taxpayer's U.S. tax liability pursuant to section 905(c) and § 1.905-3. See § 1.905-3(a) and 1.905-3(b)(1)(ii)(G) (
Example 7
). Additional foreign income taxes paid that relate back to a prior year in which foreign income taxes were claimed as a credit on the cash basis, including by reason of the settlement of a dispute with the foreign tax authority, may be claimed as a credit only in the year the additional taxes are paid (within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section). The payment of such additional taxes does not result in a redetermination pursuant to section 905(c) or § 1.905-3 of the foreign income taxes paid in any prior year, although a redetermination of U.S. tax liability may
be required due, for example, to a carryback of unused foreign tax under section 904(c) and § 1.904-2.
(d)
Rules for accrual method taxpayers
—(1)
Credit allowed in year accrued
—(i)
In general.
A taxpayer who uses the accrual method of accounting may claim a foreign tax credit only in the taxable year in which the foreign income taxes are considered to accrue for foreign tax credit purposes under the rules of this paragraph (d). Foreign income taxes accrue in the taxable year in which all the events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability and the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy. See §§ 1.446-1(c)(1)(ii)(A) and 1.461-4(g)(6)(iii)(B). For purposes of the preceding sentence, a foreign income tax that is contingent on a future distribution of earnings does not meet the all events test until the earnings are distributed. A foreign income tax liability determined on the basis of a foreign taxable year becomes fixed and determinable at the close of the taxpayer's foreign taxable year. Therefore, foreign income taxes that are computed based on items of income, deduction, and loss that arise in a foreign taxable year accrue in the United States taxable year with or within which the taxpayer's foreign taxable year ends. Foreign withholding taxes that are paid with respect to a foreign taxable year and that represent advance payments of a foreign net income tax liability determined on the basis of that foreign taxable year accrue at the close of the foreign taxable year. Foreign withholding taxes imposed on a payment giving rise to an item of foreign gross income accrue on the date the payment from which the tax is withheld is made (or treated as made under foreign tax law).
(ii)
Relation-back rule for adjustments to taxes claimed as a credit in year accrued.
Additional tax paid as a result of a change in the foreign tax liability, including additional tax paid when a contest with a foreign tax authority is resolved, relates back and is considered to accrue at the end of the foreign taxable year with respect to which the tax is imposed (the “relation-back year”). Additional withholding tax paid as a result of a change in the amount of an item of foreign gross income (such as pursuant to a foreign transfer pricing adjustment) also relates back and is considered to accrue in the year in which the payment from which the additional tax is withheld is made (or considered to have been made under foreign tax law). Foreign income taxes that are not paid within 24 months after the close of the taxable year in which they were accrued are treated as refunded pursuant to § 1.905-3(a); when subsequently paid, the foreign income taxes are allowed as a credit in the relation-back year. See § 1.905-3(b)(1)(ii)(E) (
Example 5
). For special rules that apply to determine when foreign income tax is considered to accrue in the case of certain ownership and entity classification changes, see §§ 1.336-2(g)(3)(ii), 1.338-9(d), 1.901-2(f)(5), and 1.1502-76.
(2)
Special rule for 52-53 week U.S. taxable years.
If a taxpayer has elected pursuant to section 441(f) to use a U.S. taxable year consisting of 52-53 weeks, and such U.S. taxable year closes within six calendar days of the end of the taxpayer's foreign taxable year, the determination of when foreign income taxes accrue under paragraph (d)(1) of this section is made by deeming the taxpayer's U.S. taxable year to end on the last day of its foreign taxable year.
(3)
Accrual of contested foreign tax liability.
A contested foreign income tax liability is finally determined and accrues for purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section when the contest is resolved. However, pursuant to section 905(c)(2), no credit is allowed for any accrued tax that is not paid within 24 months of the close of the relation-back year until the tax is actually remitted and considered paid. Thus, except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, a foreign tax credit for a contested foreign income tax liability cannot be claimed until such time as both the contest is resolved and the tax is considered paid, even if the contested liability (or portion thereof) has previously been remitted to the foreign country. Once the contest is resolved and the foreign income tax liability is finally determined and paid, the tax liability accrues, and is considered to accrue in the relation-back year for purposes of the foreign tax credit. See
paragraph (d)(1) of this section; see also section 6511(d)(3) and § 301.6511(d)-3 of this chapter for a special 10-year period of limitations for claiming a credit or refund of U.S. tax that is attributable to foreign income taxes for which a credit is allowed under section 901, which for taxpayers claiming credits on the accrual basis runs from the unextended due date of the return for the taxable year in which the foreign income taxes accrued (within the meaning of this paragraph (d)).
(4)
Election to claim a provisional credit for contested taxes remitted before accrual
—(i)
Conditions of election.
A taxpayer may, under the conditions provided in this paragraph (d)(4), elect to claim a foreign tax credit for a contested foreign income tax liability (or a portion thereof) in the relation-back year when the contested amount (or a portion thereof) is remitted to the foreign country, notwithstanding that the liability is not finally determined and so has not accrued. This election is available only for contested foreign income taxes that relate to a taxable year in which the taxpayer has elected under section 901(a) to claim a credit, instead of a deduction under section 164(a)(3), for foreign income taxes that accrue in such year. If the election is made by a taxpayer with respect to contested foreign income taxes of a controlled foreign corporation, such taxes are treated as deemed paid in the relation-back year and the controlled foreign corporation may deduct the taxes in computing its taxable income in the relation-back year. To make the election, a taxpayer must file an amended return for the taxable year to which the contested tax relates, together with a Form 1116 (Foreign Tax Credit (Individual, Estate, or Trust)) or Form 1118 (Foreign Tax Credit—Corporations), and the agreement described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section. In addition, the taxpayer must, for each subsequent taxable year up to and including the taxable year in which the contest is resolved, file the annual notice described in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section. Any portion of a contested foreign income tax liability for which a provisional credit is claimed under this paragraph (d)(4) that is subsequently refunded by the foreign country results in a foreign tax redetermination under § 1.905-3(a).
(ii)
Contents of provisional foreign tax credit agreement.
The provisional foreign tax credit agreement must contain the following:
(A) A statement that the document is an election and an agreement under the provisions of paragraph (d)(4) of this section;
(B) A description of the contested foreign income tax liability, including the name (or other identifier) of the foreign tax or taxes being contested, the name of the country imposing the tax, the name and identifying number of the payor of the contested tax, the amount of the contested tax, and the U.S. taxable year(s) and the income to which the contested foreign income tax liability relates;
(C) The amount of the contested foreign income tax liability in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(B) of this section that has been remitted to the foreign country and the date of the remittance(s);
(D) An agreement by the taxpayer, for a period of three years from the later of the filing or the due date (with extensions) of the return for the taxable year in which the taxpayer notifies the Internal Revenue Service of the resolution of the contest, not to assert the statute of limitations on assessment as a defense to the assessment of additional taxes or interest related to the contested foreign income tax liability described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(B) of this section that may arise from a determination that the taxpayer failed to exhaust all effective and practical remedies to minimize its foreign income tax liability, so that the amount of the contested foreign income tax is not a compulsory payment and is not considered paid within the meaning of § 1.901-2(e)(5);
(E) A statement that the taxpayer agrees to comply with all the conditions and requirements of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, including to provide notice to the Internal Revenue Service upon the resolution of the contest; and
(F) Any additional information as may be prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in Internal Revenue Service forms or instructions.
(iii)
Signatory.
The provisional foreign tax credit agreement must be signed under penalties of perjury by a person authorized to sign the return of the taxpayer.
(iv)
Annual notice.
For each taxable year following the year in which an election pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section is made up to and including the taxable year in which the contest is resolved, the taxpayer must include with its timely-filed return the information described in paragraphs (d)(4)(iii)(A) through (C) of this section on Form 1116 or Form 1118 or in such other form or manner prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in Internal Revenue Service forms or instructions.
(A) A description of the contested foreign income tax liability, including the name (or other identifier) of the foreign tax or taxes, the name of the country imposing the tax, the name and identifying number of the payor of the contested tax, the amount of the contested tax, and a description of the status of the contest.
(B) With the return for the taxable year in which the contest is resolved, notification that the contest has been resolved. Such notification must include the date of final resolution and the amount of the finally determined foreign income tax liability.
(C) Any additional information, which may include a copy of the final judgment, order, settlement, or other documentation of the contest resolution, as may be prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in Internal Revenue Service forms or instructions.
(5)
Correction of improper accruals
—(i)
In general.
The accrual of a foreign income tax expense generally involves the determination of the proper timing for recognizing the expense for Federal income tax purposes. Thus, foreign income tax expense is a material item within the meaning of section 446. See § 1.446-1(e)(2)(ii). As a material item, a change in the timing of accruing a foreign income tax expense is generally a change in method of accounting. See section 446(e). A change from an improper method of accruing foreign income taxes to the proper method of accrual described in this paragraph (d) is treated as a change in a method of accounting, regardless of whether the taxpayer (or a partner or beneficiary taking into account a distributive share of foreign income taxes paid by a partnership or other pass-through entity) chooses to claim a deduction or a credit for such taxes in any taxable year. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(5), an improper method of accruing foreign income taxes includes a method under which foreign income tax is accrued in a taxable year other than the taxable year in which the requirements of the all events test in §§ 1.446-1(c)(1)(ii)(A) and 1.461-4(g)(6)(iii)(B) are met, or which fails to apply the relation-back rule in paragraph (d)(1) of this section that applies for purposes of the foreign tax credit, but does not include corrections to estimated accruals or errors in computing the amount of foreign income tax that is allowed as a deduction or credit in any taxable year. Taxpayers must file a Form 3115, Application for Change in Accounting Method, in accordance with Revenue Procedure 2015-13 (or any successor administrative procedure prescribed by the Commissioner) to obtain the Commissioner's permission to change from an improper method of accruing foreign income taxes to the proper method described in this paragraph (d). In order to prevent a duplication or omission of a benefit for foreign income taxes that accrue in any taxable year (whether through the double allowance or double disallowance of either a deduction or a credit, the allowance of both a deduction and a credit, or the disallowance of either a deduction or a credit, for the same amount of foreign income tax), the rules in paragraphs (d)(5)(ii) through (iv) of this section, describing a modified cut-off approach, apply if the Commissioner grants permission for the taxpayer to change to the proper method of accrual. Under the modified cut-off approach, a section 481(a) adjustment is neither required nor permitted with respect to the amounts of foreign income tax that were improperly accrued (or improperly not accrued) under the taxpayer's improper method in taxable years before the taxable year of change.
(ii)
Adjustments required to implement a change in method of accounting for accruing foreign income taxes.
A change from an improper method of accruing foreign income taxes to the proper method described in this paragraph (d) is made under the modified cut-off approach described in this paragraph (d)(5)(ii). Under the modified cut-off approach, the amount of foreign income tax in a statutory or residual grouping (such as a separate category as defined in § 1.904-5(a)(4)) that properly accrues in the taxable year of change (accounted for in the currency in which the foreign tax liability is denominated) is first adjusted upward by the amount of foreign income tax in the same grouping that properly accrued in a taxable year before the taxable year of change but which, under the taxpayer's improper method of accounting, the taxpayer failed to accrue and claim as either a credit or a deduction in any taxable year before the taxable year of change, and next, adjusted downward (but not below zero) by the amount of foreign income tax in the same grouping that the taxpayer improperly accrued in a taxable year before the year of change and for which the taxpayer claimed a credit or a deduction in such prior taxable year, but only if the improperly-accrued amount of foreign income tax did not properly accrue in a taxable year before the taxable year of change. The modified cut-off approach is applied separately with respect to amounts of foreign income tax for which the foreign tax credit is disallowed and to which section 275 does not apply. See, for example, section 901(m)(6). For purposes of the foreign tax credit, the adjusted amounts of accrued foreign income taxes, including any upward adjustment, are translated into U.S. dollars under § 1.986(a)-1 as if those amounts properly accrued in the taxable year of change. To the extent that the downward adjustment in any grouping required under this modified cut-off approach exceeds the amount of foreign income tax properly accruing in that grouping in the year of change, as increased by the upward adjustment, if any, such excess will carry forward to each subsequent taxable year and reduce properly-accrued amounts of foreign income tax in the same grouping to the extent of those properly-accrued amounts, until all improperly-accrued amounts included in the downward adjustment are accounted for. See § 1.861-20 for rules that apply to assign foreign income taxes to statutory and residual groupings. See paragraphs (d)(6)(v) through (d)(6)(ix) of this section for examples illustrating the application of the modified cut-off approach.
(iii)
Application of section 905(c)
—(A)
Two-year rule.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(5)(iii), if the taxpayer claimed a credit for improperly-accrued amounts in a taxable year before the taxable year of change, no adjustment is required under section 905(c)(2) and § 1.905-3(a) solely by reason of the improper accrual. For purposes of applying section 905(c)(2) and § 1.905-3(a) to improperly-accrued amounts of foreign income tax that were claimed as a credit in any taxable year before the taxable year of change, the 24-month period runs from the close of the U.S. taxable year(s) in which those amounts were accrued under the taxpayer's improper method and claimed as a credit. To the extent any improperly-accrued amounts remain unpaid as of the date 24 months after the close of the taxable year in which the amounts were improperly accrued and claimed as a credit, an adjustment is required under section 905(c)(2) and § 1.905-3(a) as if the improperly-accrued amounts were refunded as of the date 24 months after the close of such taxable year. See § 1.986(a)-1(c) (a refund or other downward adjustment to foreign income taxes paid or accrued on more than one date reduces the foreign income taxes paid or accrued on a last-in, first-out basis, starting with the amounts most recently paid or accrued).
(B)
Application of payments.
Amounts of foreign income tax that a taxpayer accrued and claimed as a credit or a deduction in a taxable year before the taxable year of change under the taxpayer's improper method, but that had properly accrued either in the taxable year the credit or deduction was claimed or in a different taxable year before the taxable year of change, are not included in the downward adjustment required by paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of
this section. Remittances to the foreign country of such amounts (accounted for in the currency in which the foreign tax liability is denominated) are treated first as payments of the amounts of tax that had properly accrued in the taxable year claimed as a credit or deduction to the extent thereof, and then as payments of the amounts of tax that were improperly accrued in a different taxable year, on a last-in, first-out basis, starting with the most recent improperly-accrued amounts. Remittances to the foreign country of amounts of foreign income tax that properly accrue in or after the taxable year of change (accounted for in the foreign currency in which the foreign tax liability is denominated) but that are offset by the amounts included in the downward adjustment required by paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section are treated as payments of the amounts of tax that were improperly accrued before the taxable year of change and included in the downward adjustment on a last-in, first-out basis, starting with the most recent improperly-accrued amounts. Additional amounts of foreign income tax that first accrue in or after the taxable year of change but that relate to a taxable year before the taxable year of change are taken into account in the earlier of the taxable year of change or the taxable year or years in which they would have been considered to accrue based upon the taxpayer's improper method. Additional amounts of foreign income tax that first accrue in or after the taxable year of change and that relate to the taxable year of change or a taxable year after the year of change are taken into account in the proper relation-back year, but may then be subject to the downward adjustment required by paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section.
(iv)
Foreign income tax expense improperly accrued by a foreign corporation, partnership, or other pass-through entity.
Foreign income tax expense of a foreign corporation reduces both the corporation's taxable income and its earnings and profits, and may give rise to an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid under section 960 that may be claimed as a credit by a United States shareholder that is a domestic corporation or that is a person that makes an election under section 962. If the Commissioner grants permission for a foreign corporation to change its method of accounting for foreign income tax expense, the duplication or omission of those expenses (accounted for in the functional currency of the foreign corporation) and the associated foreign income taxes (translated into dollars in accordance with § 1.986(a)-1) are accounted for by applying the rules in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section as if the foreign corporation were itself eligible to, and did, claim a credit under section 901 for such amounts. In the case of a partnership or other pass-through entity that is granted permission to change its method of accounting for accruing foreign income taxes to a proper method as described in this paragraph (d), such partnership or other pass-through entity must provide its partners or other owners with the information needed for the partners or other owners to properly account for the improperly-accrued or unaccrued amounts under the rules in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section as if their proportionate shares of foreign income tax expense were directly paid or accrued by them.
(6)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (d) of this section. Unless otherwise stated, the local currency of Country X and Country Y, and the functional currency of any foreign branch, is the Euro (€), and at all relevant times the exchange rate is $1:€1.
(i)
Example 1: Accrual of foreign income tax
—(A)
Facts.
A, a U.S. citizen, resides and works in Country X. A uses the calendar year as the U.S. taxable year and has made an election under paragraph (e) of this section to claim foreign tax credits on an accrual basis. Country X has a tax year that begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. A's wages are subject to net income tax, at graduated rates, under Country X tax law and are subject to withholding on a monthly basis by A's employer in Country X. In the period between April 1, Year 1, and March 31, Year 2, A earns $50,000x in Country X wages, from which A's employer withholds $10,000x in tax. On December 1, Year 1, A receives a dividend distribution from a
Country Y corporation, from which the corporation withheld $500x of tax. Country Y imposes withholding tax on dividends paid to nonresidents solely based on the gross amount of the dividend payment; A is not required to file a tax return in Country Y.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, A's liability for Country X net income tax accrues on March 31, Year 2, the last day of the Country X taxable year. The Country X net income tax withheld by A's employer from A's wages is a reasonable approximation of, and represents an advance payment of, A's final net income tax liability for the year, which becomes fixed and determinable only at the close of the Country X taxable year. Thus, A cannot claim a credit for any portion of the Country X net income tax on A's Federal income tax return for Year 1, and may claim a credit for the entire Country X net income tax that accrues on March 31, Year 2, on A's Federal income tax return for Year 2. A may claim a credit for the Country Y withholding tax on A's Federal income tax return for Year 1, because the withholding tax accrued on December 1, Year 1.
(ii)
Example 2: 52-53 week taxable year
—(A)
Facts.
U.S.C., an accrual method taxpayer, is a domestic corporation that operates in branch form in Country X. U.S.C. uses the calendar year for Country X tax purposes. For Federal income tax purposes, U.S.C. elects pursuant to § 1.441-2(a) to use a 52-53 week taxable year that ends on the last Friday of December. In Year 1, U.S.C.'s U.S. taxable year ends on Friday, December 25; in Year 2, U.S.C.'s U.S. taxable year ends Friday, December 31. For its foreign taxable year ending December 31, Year 1, U.S.C. earns $10,000x of foreign source income through its Country X branch and incurs Country X foreign income tax of $500x; for Year 2, U.S.C. earns $12,000x and incurs Country X foreign income tax of $600x.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the $500x of Country X foreign income tax becomes fixed and determinable at the close of U.S.C.'s foreign taxable year, on December 31, Year 1, which is after the close of its U.S. taxable year (December 25, Year 1). The $600x of Country X foreign income tax becomes fixed and determinable on December 31, Year 2. Thus, both the Year 1 and Year 2 Country X foreign income taxes accrue in U.S.C.'s U.S. taxable year ending December 31, Year 2. However, pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, for purposes of determining the amount of foreign income taxes accrued in each taxable year for foreign tax credit purposes, U.S.C.'s U.S. taxable year is deemed to end on December 31, the end of U.S.C.'s Country X taxable year. U.S.C. may therefore claim a foreign tax credit for $500x of Country X foreign income tax on its Federal income tax return for Year 1 and a credit for $600x of Country X foreign income tax on its Federal income tax return for Year 2.
(iii)
Example 3: Contested tax
—(A)
Facts.
U.S.C. is a domestic corporation that operates in branch form in Country X. U.S.C. uses an accrual method of accounting and uses the calendar year as its U.S. and Country X taxable year. In Year 1, when the average exchange rate described in § 1.986(a)-1(a)(1) is $1:€1, U.S.C. earns €20,000x = $20,000x through its Country X branch for U.S. and Country X tax purposes and accrues Country X foreign income taxes of €500x = $500x, which U.S.C. claims as a credit on its Federal income tax return for Year 1. In Year 3, when the average exchange rate is $1:€1.2, Country X asserts that U.S.C. owes additional foreign income taxes of €100x with respect to U.S.C.'s Year 1 income. U.S.C. contests the liability but remits €40x to Country X with respect to the contested liability in Year 3. U.S.C. does not make an election under paragraph (d)(4) of this section to claim a provisional credit with respect to the €40x. In Year 6, after exhausting all effective and practical remedies, it is finally determined that U.S.C. is liable for €50x of additional Country X foreign income taxes with respect to its Year 1 income. U.S.C. pays an additional €10x to Country X on September 15, Year 6, when the spot rate described in § 1.986(a)-1(a)(2)(i) is $1:€2.
(B)
Analysis.
Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the additional liability asserted by Country X with respect to U.S.C.'s Year 1 income does not accrue until the contest is resolved
in Year 6. U.S.C.'s remittance of €40x of contested tax in Year 3 is not a payment of accrued tax, and so is not a foreign tax redetermination. Both the €40x of Country X taxes paid in Year 3 and the €10x of Country X taxes paid in Year 6 accrue in Year 6, when the contest is resolved. Once accrued and paid, the €50x relates back for foreign tax credit purposes to Year 1, and can be claimed as a credit by U.S.C. on a timely-filed amended return for Year 1. Under § 1.986(a)-1(a), for foreign tax credit purposes the €40x paid in Year 3 is translated into dollars at the average exchange rate for Year 1 (€40x × $1/€1 = $40x), and the €10x paid in Year 6 is translated into dollars at the spot rate on the date paid (€10x × $1/€2 = $5x). Accordingly, after the €50x of Country X income tax is paid in Year 6 U.S.C. may claim an additional foreign tax credit of $45x for Year 1.
(iv)
Example 4: Provisional credit for contested tax
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as those in paragraph (d)(6)(iii)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 3
), except that U.S.C. pays the entire contested tax liability of €100x to Country X in Year 3 and elects under paragraph (d)(4) of this section to claim a provisional foreign tax credit on an amended return for Year 1. In Year 6, upon resolution of the contest, U.S.C. receives a refund of €50x from Country X.
(B)
Analysis.
In Year 3, U.S.C. may claim a provisional foreign tax credit for $100x (€100x translated at the average exchange rate for Year 1) of contested foreign tax paid to Country X by filing an amended return for Year 1, with Form 1118 attached, and a provisional foreign tax credit agreement described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section. In each year for Years 4 through 6, U.S.C. must attach the certification described in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section to its timely-filed Federal income tax return. In Year 6, as a result of the €50x refund, U.S.C. must redetermine its U.S. tax liability for Year 1 and for any other affected year pursuant to § 1.905-3, reducing the Year 1 foreign tax credit by $50x (from $600x to $550x), and comply with the notification requirements in § 1.905-4. See § 1.986(a)-1(c) (refunds of foreign income tax translated into U.S. dollars at the rate used to claim the credit).
(v)
Example 5: Improperly accelerated accrual
—(A)
Facts
—(

)
Foreign income tax accrued and paid.
U.S.C. is a domestic corporation that operates a foreign branch in Country X. All of U.S.C.'s gross and taxable income is foreign source foreign branch category income, and all of its foreign income taxes are properly allocated and apportioned under § 1.861-20 to the foreign branch category. U.S.C. uses the accrual method of accounting and uses the calendar year as its U.S. taxable year. For Country X tax purposes, U.S.C. uses a fiscal year that ends on March 31. U.S.C. accrued €200x of Country X net income tax (as defined in § 1.901-2(a)(3)) for its foreign taxable year ending March 31, Year 2, for which the average exchange rate was $1:€1. It timely filed its Country X tax return and paid the €200x on January 15, Year 3. U.S.C. accrued and paid with its timely filed Country X tax returns €280x and €240x of Country X net income tax for its foreign taxable years ending on March 31 of Year 3 and Year 4, respectively, on January 15 of Year 4 and Year 5, respectively.

Improper accrual.
On its Federal income tax return for Year 1, U.S.C. improperly pro-rated and accelerated the accrual of Country X net income tax and claimed a credit for $150x, equal to three-fourths of the Country X net income tax of $200x that relates to U.S.C.'s foreign taxable year ending March 31, Year 2. Continuing with this improper method of accruing foreign income taxes, U.S.C. claimed a foreign tax credit of $260x on its U.S. tax return for Year 2, comprising $50x (one-fourth of the $200x of net income tax relating to its foreign taxable year ending March 31, Year 2) plus $210x (three-fourths of the $280x of net income tax relating to its foreign taxable year ending March 31, Year 3). Similarly, U.S.C. improperly accrued and claimed a foreign tax credit on its U.S. tax return for Year 3 for $250x of Country X net income tax, comprising $70x (one-fourth of the $280x that properly accrued in Year 3) plus $180x (three-fourths of the $240x that properly accrued in Year 4). In Year 4, U.S.C. realizes its mistake and, as provided in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, files Form 3115 with the
IRS to seek permission to change from an improper method to a proper method of accruing foreign income taxes.

Downward adjustment.
Under paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section, in Year 4, the year of change, U.S.C. must reduce (but not below zero) the amount (in Euros) of Country X net income tax in the foreign branch category that properly accrues in Year 4, €240x, by the amount of foreign income tax that was accrued and claimed as either a deduction or a credit in a year before the year of change, and that had not properly accrued in either the year in which the tax was accrued under U.S.C.'s improper method or in any other taxable year before the taxable year of change. For all taxable years before the taxable year of change, under its improper method U.S.C. had accrued and claimed as a credit a total of €660x = $660x of foreign income tax, of which only €480x = $480x had properly accrued. Therefore, the downward adjustment required by paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section is €180x (€660x − €480x = €180x). In Year 4, U.S.C.'s foreign tax credit in the foreign branch category is reduced by $180x (€180x downward adjustment translated into dollars at $1:€1, the average exchange rate for Year 4), from $240x to $60x.

Year 1.
Under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section, the €200x U.S.C. paid on January 15, Year 3, that relates to its Country X taxable year ending on March 31, Year 2, is first treated as a payment of the €50x of that Country X net income tax liability that properly accrued and was claimed as a credit by U.S.C. in Year 2, and next as a payment of the €150x of that Country X net income tax liability that U.S.C. improperly accrued and claimed as a credit in Year 1. Because all €150x of the Country X net income tax that was improperly accrued and claimed as a credit in Year 1 was paid within 24 months of December 31, Year 1, no foreign tax redetermination occurs, and no redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required, for Year 1.

Under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section, the €280x U.S.C. paid on January 15, Year 4, that relates to its Country X taxable year ending on March 31, Year 3, is first treated as a payment of the €70x = $70x of that Country X net income tax liability that properly accrued and was claimed as a credit by U.S.C. in Year 3, and next as a payment of the €210x = $210x of that Country X net income tax liability that U.S.C. improperly accrued and claimed as a credit in Year 2. Together with the €50x = $50x of U.S.C.'s Country X net income tax liability that properly accrued and was claimed as a credit in Year 2, all €260x of the Country X net income tax that was accrued and claimed as a credit in Year 2 under U.S.C.'s improper method was paid within 24 months of December 31, Year 2. Accordingly, no foreign tax redetermination occurs, and no redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required, for Year 2.

Together with the €70x = $70x of U.S.C.'s Country X net income tax liability that properly accrued and was claimed as a credit by U.S.C. in Year 3, all €250x of the Country X net income tax that was accrued and claimed as a credit in Year 3 under U.S.C.'s improper method was paid within 24 months of December 31, Year 3.

for Year 1 and Year 2). With respect to Year 3, because the €180x = $180x of Year 4 foreign income tax that was improperly accrued and credited in Year 3 was not paid within 24 months of the end of Year 3, under section 905(c)(2) and § 1.905-3(a) that €180x = $180x is treated as refunded on December 31, Year 5, requiring a redetermination of U.S.C.'s Federal income tax liability for Year 3 (to reverse out the credit claimed). In Year 6, when U.S.C. pays the €240x of Country X income tax liability for Year 4, under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section that payment is first treated as a payment of the €60x = $60x that was properly accrued and claimed as a credit in Year 4, and then as a payment of the €180x that was improperly accrued and claimed as a credit in Year 3 and that was treated as refunded in Year 5. Under section 905(c)(2)(B) and § 1.905-3(a), that Year 6 payment of accrued but unpaid tax is a second foreign tax redetermination for Year 3 that also requires a redetermination of U.S.C.'s U.S. tax liability. Under § 1.986(a)-1(a)(2), the €180x of redetermined tax for Year 3 is translated into dollars at the spot rate on January 15, Year 6, when the tax is paid (€180x × $1/€1.5 = $120x). Under § 1.905-4(b)(1)(iv), U.S.C. may file one amended return accounting for both foreign tax redeterminations (which occur in two consecutive taxable years) with respect to Year 3, which taken together result in a reduction in U.S.C.'s foreign tax credit for Year 3 from $250x to $190x ($250x originally accrued − $180x unpaid after 24 months + $120x paid in Year 6).

Example 5
), except that in Year 6, Country X assessed additional net income tax of €100x with respect to U.S.C.'s Country X taxable year ending March 31, Year 3, and after exhausting all effective and practical remedies to reduce its liability for Country X income tax, U.S.C. pays the additional assessed tax on September 15, Year 7, when the spot rate described in § 1.986(a)-1(a)(2)(i) is $1:€0.5.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the additional €100x of Country X income tax U.S.C. paid in Year 7 with respect to its foreign taxable year that ended March 31, Year 3, relates back and is considered to accrue in Year 3. However, under its improper method of accounting U.S.C. had accrued and claimed foreign tax credits for Country X net income tax that related to Year 3 on its Federal income tax returns for both Year 2 and Year 3. Accordingly, under paragraph (d)(5)(iii)(B) of this section U.S.C. must redetermine its U.S. tax liability for both Year 2 and Year 3 (and any other affected years) to account for the additional €100x of Country X net income tax liability, using the improper method it used to accrue foreign income taxes before the year of change. Therefore, three-fourths of the €100x of additional tax, or €75x, is treated as if it accrued in Year 2, and one-fourth of the additional tax, or €25x, is treated as if it accrued in Year 3. Pursuant to § 1.986(a)-1(a)(2)(i), the €75x of tax treated as if it accrued in Year 2 and the €25x of tax treated as if it accrued in Year 3 are converted into dollars using the September 15, Year 7, spot rate of $1:€0.5, to $150x and $50x, respectively. Under § 1.905-4(b)(1)(iii), U.S.C. may claim a refund for any resulting overpayment of U.S. tax for Year 2 or Year 3 or any other affected year by filing
an amended return within the period provided in section 6511.

Example 8: Tax improperly accrued before year of change exceeds tax properly accrued in year of change
—(A)
Facts.
U.S.C. owns all of the stock in CFC, a controlled foreign corporation organized in Country X. Country X imposes net income tax on Country X corporations at a rate of 10% only in the year its earnings are distributed to its shareholders, rather than in the year the income is earned. Both U.S.C. and CFC use the calendar year as their taxable year for both Federal and Country X income tax purposes and CFC uses the Euro as its functional currency. In each of Years 1-3, CFC earns €1,000x for both Federal and Country X income tax purposes of general category foreign base company sales income (before reduction for foreign income taxes). CFC improperly accrues €100x of Country X net income tax with respect to €1,000x of income at the end of each of Years 1 and 2, even though no distribution is made in those years. In Year 1, for which the average exchange rate is $1:€1, U.S.C. computes and includes in income with respect to CFC $900x of subpart F income, claims a deemed paid foreign tax credit of $100x under section 960(a), and has a section 78 dividend of $100x. In Year 2, for which the average exchange rate is $1:€0.5, U.S.C. computes and includes in income with respect to CFC $1,800x of subpart F income, claims a deemed paid foreign tax credit of $200x under section 960(a), and has a section 78 dividend of $200x. In Year 2, CFC makes a distribution to U.S.C. of €400x of earnings and pays €40x of net income tax to Country X. In Year 3, for which the average exchange rate is $1:€1, CFC makes another distribution to U.S.C. of €500x of earnings and pays €50x in net income tax to Country X. In Year 3, U.S.C. realizes its mistake and seeks permission from the IRS for CFC to change to a proper method of accruing foreign income taxes. In Year 4, for which the average exchange rate is $1:€2, CFC makes a distribution of €700x of earnings and pays €70x of net income tax to Country X.

Downward adjustment.
Under paragraph (d)(5)(iv) of this section, CFC applies the rules of paragraph (d)(5) of this section as if it claimed a foreign tax credit under section 901 for Country X taxes. Under paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section, in Year 3, the year of change, CFC must reduce (but not below zero) the amount (in Euros) of Country X net income tax allocated and apportioned to its general category foreign base company sales income group that properly accrues in Year 3, €50x, by the amount of foreign income tax (in Euros) that was improperly accrued in that statutory grouping in a year before the year of change, and that had not properly accrued in either the year accrued or in another taxable year before the year of change. For all taxable years before the year of change, under its improper method CFC had accrued a total of €200x of foreign income tax with respect to its general category foreign base company sales income group, of which only €40x had properly accrued. Therefore, the downward adjustment required by paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section is €160x (€200x—€40x = €160x). In Year 3, CFC's €50x of eligible foreign income taxes in the general category foreign base company sales income group is reduced by €50x to zero. The €110x balance of the downward adjustment carries forward to Year 4, and reduces CFC's €70x of eligible foreign income taxes in the general category foreign base company sales income group by €70x to zero. The remaining €40x balance of the downward adjustment carries forward to later years and will reduce CFC's eligible foreign income taxes in the general category foreign base company sales income group until all improperly-accrued amounts are accounted for.

Year 2.
Under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section, CFC's payment in Year 2
of the €40x of Country X net income tax that properly accrued in Year 2, before the year of change, is treated as a payment of €40x of foreign income tax that CFC properly accrued in Year 2. The €60x of foreign income tax that CFC improperly accrued in Year 2 that remains unpaid at the end of Year 2 is not adjusted in Year 2. Under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section, CFC's payment in Year 3 of €50x of Country X net income tax that properly accrued but was offset by the downward adjustment in Year 3 is treated as a payment of €50x of the remaining €60x of Country X net income tax that CFC improperly accrued in Year 2, the most recent improper accrual. In addition, CFC's payment in Year 4 of €70x of Country X net income tax that properly accrued but was offset by the downward adjustment in Year 4 is treated first as a payment of the remaining €10x of Country X net income tax that CFC improperly accrued in Year 2. Because all €100x of foreign income tax accrued in Year 2 under CFC's improper method of accounting is treated as paid within 24 months of December 31, Year 2, no foreign tax redetermination occurs, and no redetermination of CFC's foreign base company sales income, earnings and profits, and eligible foreign income taxes or of U.S.C.'s $1,800x subpart F inclusion, $200x deemed paid credit, $200x section 78 dividend and U.S. tax liability is required, for Year 2.

)
Year 1.
Because all €100x of the tax CFC improperly accrued in Year 1 remained unpaid as of December 31, Year 3, the date 24 months after the end of Year 1, under section 905(c)(2) and § 1.905-3(a) that €100x is treated as refunded on December 31, Year 3. Under § 1.905-3(b)(2)(ii), U.S.C. must redetermine its Federal income tax liability for Year 1 to account for the foreign tax redetermination, increasing CFC's foreign base company sales income and earnings and profits by €100x, and decreasing its eligible foreign income taxes by $100x. However, under paragraph (d)(5)(iii)(B) of this section €60x of CFC's payment in Year 4 of €70x of Country X net income tax that properly accrued but was offset by the downward adjustment in Year 4 is treated as a payment of €60x of the €100x of Country X net income tax that was improperly accrued in Year 1 and treated as refunded in Year 3. Under § 1.905-4(b)(1)(iv), U.S.C. may account for the two foreign tax redeterminations that occurred in Years 3 and 4 on a single amended Federal income tax return for Year 1. CFC's foreign base company sales income (taking into account the reduction for foreign income taxes) and earnings and profits for Year 1 are recomputed as €1,000x of foreign base company sales income—€100x foreign income tax improperly accrued in Year 1 + €100x improperly accrued foreign income tax treated as refunded on December 31, Year 3—€60x improperly accrued foreign income tax treated as paid in Year 4 = €940x. CFC's eligible foreign income taxes for Year 1 are translated into dollars at the applicable exchange rate and recomputed as $100x foreign income tax improperly accrued in Year 1—$100x improperly accrued foreign income tax treated as refunded on December 31, Year 3 + $30x improperly accrued foreign income tax treated as paid in Year 4 = $30x. U.S.C.'s subpart F inclusion with respect to CFC for Year 1 (translated at the average exchange rate for Year 1 of $1:€1) is increased from $900x to $940x (€940x x $1/€1), and the amount of foreign taxes deemed paid under section 960(a) and the amount of the section 78 dividend are reduced from $100x to $30x.

Summary.
As of the end of Year 4, CFC and U.S.C. have been allowed a $30x foreign tax credit for Year 1, and a $200x foreign tax credit for Year 2. If in a later taxable year CFC distributes additional earnings to U.S.C. and accrues €40x of additional Country X net income tax that is offset by the balance of the €40x downward adjustment, CFC's payment of that €40x Country X net income tax liability will be treated as a payment of the remaining €40x of Country X net income tax that was improperly accrued in Year 1 and treated as refunded as of the end of Year 3.

Foreign income tax accrued and paid.
U.S.C. is a domestic corporation that operates a foreign branch in Country X. All of U.S.C.'s gross and taxable income is foreign source foreign branch category income, and all of its foreign income taxes are properly allocated and apportioned
under § 1.861-20 to the foreign branch category. U.S.C. uses the accrual method of accounting and uses the calendar year as its taxable year for both Federal and Country X income tax purposes. U.S.C. accrued €160x of Country X net income tax (as defined in § 1.901-2(a)(3)) with respect to Year 1. U.S.C. filed its Country X tax return and paid the €160x on June 30, Year 2. U.S.C. accrued €180x, €240x, and €150x of Country X tax for Years 2, 3, and 4, respectively, and paid with its timely filed Country X tax returns these tax liabilities on June 30 of Years 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The average exchange rate described in § 1.986(a)-1(a)(1) is $1:€0.5 in Year 1, $1:€1 in Year 2, $1:€1.25 in Year 3, and $1:€1.5 in Year 4.

Improper accrual.
On its Federal income tax return for Year 1, U.S.C. claimed no foreign tax credit. On its Federal income tax return for Year 2, U.S.C. improperly accrued and claimed a credit for $160x (€160x of Country X tax for Year 1 that it paid in Year 2, translated into dollars at the average exchange rate for Year 2). Continuing with this improper method of accounting, U.S.C. improperly accrued and claimed a credit in Year 3 for $144x (€180x of Country X tax for Year 2 that it paid in Year 3, translated into dollars at the average exchange rate for Year 3). In Year 4, U.S.C. realizes its mistake and seeks permission from the IRS to change to a proper method of accruing foreign income taxes.

Upward adjustment.
Under paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section, in Year 4, the year of change, U.S.C. increases the amount of Country X net income tax allocated and apportioned to its foreign branch category that properly accrues in Year 4, €150x, by the amount of foreign income tax in that same grouping that properly accrued in a taxable year before the taxable year of change, but which, under its improper method of accounting, U.S.C. failed to accrue and claim as either a credit or deduction before the taxable year of change. For all taxable years before the taxable year of change, under a proper method, U.S.C. would have accrued a total of €580x of foreign income tax, of which it accrued and claimed a credit for only €340x under its improper method. Thus, in Year 4, U.S.C. increases its €150x of properly accrued foreign income taxes in the foreign branch category by €240x (€580x − €340x), and may claim a credit in that year for the total, €390x, or $260x (translated into dollars at the average exchange rate for Year 4, as if the total amount properly accrued in Year 4).

Application of section 905(c).
Under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section, U.S.C.'s payment in Year 2 of €160x of Country X net income tax that properly accrued in Year 1 but that U.S.C. accrued and claimed as a credit in Year 2 under its improper method of accounting is first treated as a payment of the amount of the Year 1 tax liability that properly accrued in Year 2. Since none of the €160x properly accrued in Year 2, the €160x is treated as a payment of the Year 1 tax liability that U.S.C. improperly accrued and claimed as a credit in Year 2, €160x. Because all €160x of the Country X net income tax that was improperly accrued and claimed as a credit in Year 2 was paid within 24 months of the end of Year 2, no foreign tax redetermination occurs, and no redetermination of U.S.C.'s $160x foreign tax credit and U.S. tax liability is required, for Year 2. Similarly, because all €180x of the Year 2 Country X net income tax that was improperly accrued and claimed as a credit in Year 3 was paid within 24 months of the end of Year 3, no foreign tax redetermination occurs, and no redetermination of U.S.C.'s $144x foreign tax credit and U.S. tax liability is required, for Year 3.
(e)
Election by cash method taxpayer to take credit on the accrual basis
—(1)
In general
. A taxpayer who uses the cash method of accounting for income may elect to take the foreign tax credit in the taxable year in which the taxes accrue in accordance with the rules in
paragraph (d) of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, an election pursuant to this paragraph (e)(1) must be made on a timely-filed original return, by checking the appropriate box on Form 1116 (Foreign Tax Credit (Individual, Estate, or Trust)) or Form 1118 (Foreign Tax Credit—Corporations) indicating the cash method taxpayer's choice to claim the foreign tax credit in the year the foreign income taxes accrue. Once made, the election is irrevocable and must be followed for purposes of claiming a foreign tax credit for all subsequent years. See section 905(a).
(2)
Exception for cash method taxpayers claiming a foreign tax credit for the first time.
If the year with respect to which an election pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section to claim the foreign tax credit on an accrual basis is made (the “election year”) is the first year for which a taxpayer has ever claimed a foreign tax credit, the election to claim the foreign tax credit on an accrual basis can also be made on an amended return filed within the period permitted under § 1.901-1(d)(1). The election is binding in the election year and all subsequent taxable years in which the taxpayer claims a foreign tax credit.
(3)
Treatment of taxes that accrued in a prior year.
In the election year and subsequent taxable years, a cash method taxpayer that claimed foreign tax credits on the cash basis in a prior taxable year may claim a foreign tax credit not only for foreign income taxes that accrue in the election year, but also for foreign income taxes that accrued (or are considered to accrue) in a taxable year preceding the election year but that are paid in the election year or a subsequent taxable year, as applicable. Under paragraph (c) of this section, foreign income taxes paid with respect to a taxable year that precedes the election year may be claimed as a credit only in the year the taxes are paid and do not require a redetermination under section 905(c) or § 1.905-3 of U.S. tax liability in any prior year.

Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (e) of this section.
(i)
Example 1
—(A)
Facts.
A, a U.S. citizen who is a resident of Country X, is a cash method taxpayer who uses the calendar year as the taxable year for both U.S. and Country X tax purposes. In Year 1 through Year 5, A claims foreign tax credits for Country X foreign income taxes on the cash method, in the year the taxes are paid. For Year 6, A makes a timely election to claim foreign tax credits on the accrual basis. In Year 6, A accrues $100x of Country X foreign income taxes with respect to Year 6. Also in Year 6, A pays $80x in foreign income taxes that had accrued in Year 5.
(B)
Analysis.
Pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, A can claim a foreign tax credit in Year 6 for the $100x of Country X taxes that accrued in Year 6 and for the $80x of Country X taxes that accrued in Year 5 but that are paid in Year 6.

Rules for creditable foreign tax expenditures of partners, shareholders, or beneficiaries of a pass-through entity
—(1)
Effect of pass-through entity's method of accounting on when foreign tax credit or deduction can be claimed.
Each partner that elects to claim the foreign tax credit for a particular taxable year may treat its distributive share of the creditable foreign tax expenditures (as defined in § 1.704-1(b)(4)(viii)(
b
)) of the partnership that are paid or accrued by the partnership, under the partnership's method of accounting, during the partnership's taxable year ending with or within the partner's taxable year, as foreign income taxes paid or accrued (as the case may be, according to the partner's method of accounting for such taxes) by the partner in that particular taxable year. See §§ 1.702-1(a)(6) and 1.703-1(b)(2). Under §§ 1.905-
3(a) and 1.905-4(b)(2), additional creditable foreign tax expenditures of the partnership that result from a change in the partnership's foreign tax liability for a prior taxable year, including additional taxes paid when a contest with a foreign tax authority is resolved, must be identified by the partnership as a prior year creditable foreign tax expenditure in the information reported to its partners for its taxable year in which the additional tax is actually paid. Subject to the rules in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section, a partner using the cash method of accounting for foreign income taxes may claim a credit (or a deduction) for its distributive share of such additional taxes in the partner's taxable year with or within which the partnership's taxable year ends. Subject to the rules in paragraph (d) of this section, a partner using the accrual method of accounting for foreign income taxes may claim a credit for the partner's distributive share of such additional taxes in the relation-back year, or may claim a deduction in its taxable year with or within which the partnership's taxable year ends. The principles of this paragraph (f)(1) apply to determine the year in which a shareholder of a S corporation, or the grantor or beneficiary of an estate or trust, may claim a foreign tax credit (or a deduction) for its proportionate share of foreign income taxes paid or accrued by the S corporation, estate or trust. See sections 642(a), 671, 901(b)(5), and 1373(a) and §§ 1.1363-1(c)(2)(iii) and 1.1366-1(a)(2)(iv). See §§ 1.905-3 and 1.905-4 for notifications and adjustments of U.S. tax liability that are required if creditable foreign tax expenditures of a partnership or S corporation, or foreign income taxes paid or accrued by a trust or estate, are refunded or otherwise reduced.

Provisional credit for contested taxes.
Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, a contested foreign tax liability does not accrue until the contest is resolved and the amount of the liability has been finally determined. In addition, under section 905(c)(2), a foreign income tax that is not paid within 24 months of the close of the taxable year to which the tax relates may not be claimed as a credit until the tax is actually paid. Thus, a partnership or other pass-through entity cannot take the contested tax into account as a creditable foreign tax expenditure until both the contest is resolved and the tax is actually paid. However, to the extent that a partnership or other pass-through entity remits a contested foreign tax liability to a foreign country, a partner or other owner of such pass-through entity that claims foreign tax credits may, by complying with the rules in paragraph (c)(3) or (d)(4) of this section, as applicable, elect to claim a provisional credit for its distributive share of such contested tax liability in the year the pass-through entity remits the tax (for owners claiming foreign tax credits on the cash basis) or in the relation-back year (for owners claiming foreign tax credits on the accrual basis).
(3)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (f) of this section.
(i)
Facts.
ABC is a U.S. partnership that is engaged in a trade or business in Country X. ABC has two U.S. partners, A and B. For Federal income tax purposes, ABC and partner A both use the accrual method of accounting and utilize a taxable year ending on September 30. ABC uses a taxable year ending on September 30 for Country X tax purposes. B is a calendar year taxpayer that uses the cash method of accounting. For its taxable year ending September 30, Year 1, ABC accrues $500x in foreign income tax to Country X; each partner's distributive share of the foreign income tax is $250x. In its taxable year ending September 30, Year 5, ABC settles a contest with Country X with respect to its Year 1 tax liability and, as a result of such settlement, accrues an additional $100x in foreign income tax for Year 1. ABC remits the additional tax to Country X in January of Year 6. A and B both elect to claim foreign tax credits for their respective taxable Years 1 through 6.
(ii)
Analysis.
For its taxable year ending September 30, Year 1, A can claim a credit for its $250x distributive share of foreign income taxes paid by ABC with respect to ABC's taxable year ending September 30, Year 1. Pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section, B can claim its distributive share of $250x of
foreign income tax for its taxable year ending December 31, Year 1, even if ABC does not remit the Year 1 taxes to Country X until Year 2. Although the additional $100x of Country X foreign income tax owed by ABC with respect to Year 1 accrued in its taxable year ending September 30, Year 5, upon conclusion of the contest, because ABC uses the accrual method of accounting, it does not take the additional tax into account until the tax is actually paid, in its taxable year ending September 30, Year 6. See section 905(c)(2)(B) and paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Pursuant to § 1.905-4(b)(2), ABC is required to notify the IRS and its partners of the foreign tax redetermination. A's distributive share of the additional tax relates back, is considered to accrue, and may be claimed as a credit for Year 1; however, A cannot claim a credit for the additional tax until Year 6, when ABC remits the tax to Country X. See § 1.905-3(a). B's distributive share of the additional tax does not relate back to Year 1 and is creditable in B's taxable year ending December 31, Year 6.
(g)
Blocked income.
If, under the provisions of the regulations under section 461, an amount otherwise constituting gross income for the taxable year from sources without the United States is, owing to monetary, exchange, or other restrictions imposed by a foreign country, not includible in gross income of the taxpayer for such year, the credit for foreign income taxes imposed by such foreign country with respect to such amount shall be taken proportionately in any subsequent taxable year in which such amount or portion thereof is includible in gross income.
(h)
Applicability dates.
This section applies to foreign income taxes paid or accrued in taxable years beginning on or after December 28, 2021. In addition, the election described in paragraphs (c)(3) and (d)(4) of this section may be made (including by a partner or other owner of a pass-through entity described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section) with respect to amounts of contested tax that are remitted in taxable years beginning on or after December 28, 2021 and that relate to a taxable year beginning before December 28, 2021.

§ 1.905-2
Conditions of allowance of credit.
(a)
Forms and information.
(1) Whenever the taxpayer chooses, in accordance with paragraph (d) of § 1.901-1, to claim the benefits of the foreign tax credit, the claim for credit shall be accompanied by Form 1116 in the case of an individual or by Form 1118 in the case of a corporation.
(2) The form must be carefully filled in with all the information called for and with the calculations of credits indicated. Except where it is established to the satisfaction of the district director that it is impossible for the taxpayer to furnish such evidence, the taxpayer must provide upon request the receipt for each such tax payment if credit is sought for taxes already paid or the return on which each such accrued tax was based if credit is sought for taxes accrued. The receipt or return must be either the original, a duplicate original, or a duly certified or authenticated copy. The preceding two sentences are applicable for returns whose original due date falls on or after January 1, 1988. If the receipt or the return is in a foreign language, a certified translation thereof must be furnished by the taxpayer. Any additional information necessary for the determination under part I (section 861 and following), subchapter N, chapter 1 of the Code, of the amount of income derived from sources without the United States and from each foreign country shall, upon the request of the district director, be furnished by the taxpayer. If the taxpayer upon request fails without justification to furnish any such additional information which is significant, including any significant information which he is requested to furnish pursuant to § 1.861-8(f)(5) as proposed in the
Federal Register
for November 8, 1976, the District Director may disallow the claim of the taxpayer to the benefits of the foreign tax credit.
(b)
Secondary evidence.
Where it has been established to the satisfaction of
the District Director that it is impossible to furnish a receipt for such foreign tax payment, the foreign tax return, or direct evidence of the amount of tax withheld at the source, the District Director, may, in his discretion, accept secondary evidence thereof as follows:
(1)
Receipt for payment.
In the absence of a receipt for payment of foreign taxes there shall be submitted a photostatic copy of the check, draft, or other medium of payment showing the amount and date thereof, with certification identifying it with the tax claimed to have been paid, together with evidence establishing that the tax was paid for taxpayer's account as his own tax on his own income. If credit is claimed on an accrual method, it must be shown that the tax accrued in the taxable year.
(2)
Foreign tax return.
If the foreign tax return is not available, the foreign tax has not been paid, and credit is claimed on an accrual method, there shall be submitted—
(i) A certified statement of the amount shall be submitted—
(ii) Excerpts from the taxpayer's accounts showing amounts of foreign income and tax thereon accrued on its books.
(iii) A computation of the foreign tax based on income from the foreign country carried on the books and at current rates of tax to be established by data such as excerpts from the foreign law, assessment notices, or other documentary evidence thereof.
(iv) A bond, if deemed necessary by the District Director, filed in the manner provided in cases where the foreign return is available, and
(v) In case a bond is not required, a specific agreement wherein the taxpayer shall recognize its liability to report the correct amount of tax when ascertained, as required by the provisions of section 905 (c).
If at any time the foreign tax receipts or foreign tax returns become available to the taxpayer, they shall be promptly submitted to the district director.
(3)
Tax withheld at source.
In the case of taxes withheld at the source from dividends, interest, royalties, compensation, or other form of income, where evidence of withholding and of the amount withheld cannot be secured from those who have made the payments, the district director may, in his discretion, accept secondary evidence of such withholding and of the amount of the tax so withheld, having due regard to the taxpayer's books of account and to the rates of taxation prevailing in the particular foreign country during the period involved.
(c)
Credit for taxes accrued but not paid.
In the case of a credit sought for a tax accrued but not paid, the district director may, as a condition precedent to the allowance of a credit, require a bond from the taxpayer, in addition to Form 1116 or 1118. If such a bond is required, Form 1117 shall be used by an individual or by a corporation. It shall be in such sum as the Commissioner may prescribe, and shall be conditioned for the payment by the taxpayer of any amount of tax found due upon any redetermination of the tax made necessary by such credit proving incorrect, with such further conditions as the district director may require. This bond shall be executed by the taxpayer, or the agent or representative of the taxpayer, as principal, and by sureties satisfactory to and approved by the Commissioner. See also 6 U.S.C. 15.

§ 1.905-3
Adjustments to U.S. tax liability and to current earnings and profits as a result of a foreign tax redetermination.
(a)
Foreign tax redetermination.
For purposes of this section and § 1.905-4, the term
foreign tax redetermination
means a change in the liability for foreign income taxes (as defined in § 1.901-2(a)) or certain other changes described in this paragraph (a) that may affect a taxpayer's U.S. tax liability, including by reason of a change in the amount of its foreign tax credit, a change to claim a foreign tax credit for foreign income taxes that it previously deducted, a change to claim a deduction for foreign income taxes that it previously credited, a change in the
amount of its distributions or inclusions under sections 951, 951A, or 1293, a change in the application of the high-tax exception described in section 954(b)(4) (including for purposes of determining amounts excluded from gross tested income under section 951A(c)(2)(A)(i)(III) and § 1.951A-2(c)(1)(iii)), or a change in the amount of tax determined under sections 1291(c)(2) and 1291(g)(1)(C)(ii). In the case of a taxpayer that claims the credit in the year the taxes are paid, a foreign tax redetermination occurs if any portion of the tax paid is subsequently refunded, or if the taxpayer's liability is subsequently determined to be less than the amount paid and claimed as a credit. In the case of a taxpayer that claims the credit in the year the taxes accrue, a foreign tax redetermination occurs if taxes that when paid or later adjusted differ from amounts accrued by the taxpayer and claimed as a credit or added to PTEP group taxes (as defined in § 1.960-3(d)(1)). A foreign tax redetermination includes corrections and other adjustments to accrued amounts to reflect the final foreign tax liability, including additional payments of tax that accrue after the close of the taxable year to which the tax relates and, for foreign income taxes taken into account when accrued but translated into dollars on the date of payment, a payment of accrued tax if the value of the foreign currency relative to the dollar has changed between the date or taxable year of accrual and the date of payment. A foreign tax redetermination occurs if any tax claimed as a credit or added to PTEP group taxes is refunded in whole or in part, regardless of whether such tax was paid within the meaning of § 1.901-2(e) at the time the tax was claimed as a credit or added to PTEP group taxes. A foreign tax redetermination also includes accrued foreign income taxes that are not paid on or before the date that is 24 months after the close of the taxable year of the section 901 taxpayer (as defined in § 1.986(a)-1(a)(1)) to which such taxes relate, as well as a subsequent payment of any such accrued but unpaid taxes. If accrued foreign income taxes are not paid on or before the date that is 24 months after the close of the taxable year to which they relate, the resulting foreign tax redetermination is accounted for as if the unpaid portion of the foreign income taxes were refunded on such date. Foreign income taxes that first accrue after the date 24 months after the close of the taxable year to which such taxes relate may not be claimed as a credit or added to PTEP group taxes until paid. See section 905(b) and § 1.461-4(g)(6)(iii)(B), which require the taxpayer to establish the amount of tax that was properly accrued.
(b)
Redetermination of U.S. tax liability
—(1)
Foreign income taxes other than taxes deemed paid under section 960
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (b)(1) applies to foreign income taxes claimed as a credit under section 901 other than foreign income taxes deemed paid under section 960. If a foreign tax redetermination occurs with respect to foreign income tax claimed as a credit under section 901 (other than a tax deemed paid under section 960), then a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required for the taxable year in which the tax was claimed as a credit and any year to which unused foreign taxes from such year were carried under section 904(c). In the case of a taxpayer that claims the credit in the year the taxes are paid, the redetermination of U.S. tax liability is made by reducing the tax paid in such year by the amount refunded. In the case of a taxpayer that claims the credit in the year the taxes accrue, the redetermination of U.S. tax liability is made by treating the redetermined amount of foreign tax as the amount of tax that accrued in the year to which the redetermined tax relates. However, a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is not required (and a taxpayer need not notify the IRS) if the foreign income taxes are taken into account when accrued but translated into dollars on the date of payment, the difference between the dollar value of the accrued foreign income tax and the dollar value of the foreign income tax paid is solely attributable to fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency relative to the dollar between the date or taxable year of accrual and the date of payment, and the net dollar amount of the currency fluctuations attributable to the foreign tax redeterminations
with respect to each and every foreign country is less than the lesser of $10,000 or two percent of the total dollar amount of the foreign income tax initially accrued with respect to that foreign country for the taxable year. In such case, if no redetermination of U.S. tax liability is made, an appropriate adjustment is made to the taxpayer's U.S. tax liability in the taxable year during which the foreign tax redeterminations occur.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (b)(1) and § 1.986(a)-1. In all examples, assume that USC is a domestic corporation that uses the calendar year as its taxable year both for Federal income tax purposes and for foreign tax purposes and that it is doing business through a foreign branch operating in Country X, which is a qualified business unit (within the meaning of section 989 and § 1.989(a)-1) (QBU) the functional currency of which is the “u.” Except as otherwise provided, the “u” is not an inflationary currency within the meaning of § 1.986(a)-1(a)(2)(iii). USC is an accrual basis taxpayer.
(A)
Example 1: Contested tax
—(
1
)
Facts.
In Year 1, USC earned 500u of foreign source foreign branch category income through its foreign branch in Country X and accrued and paid 50u of Country X foreign income tax on its earnings. The average exchange rate for Year 1 used to translate the foreign income taxes into dollars was $1x:1u.
See
§ 1.986(a)-1(a)(1). On its Year 1 income tax return, USC claimed a foreign tax credit under section 901 of $50x (50u translated at the average exchange rate for Year 1, that is, $1x:1u). In Year 4, Country X assessed an additional 20u of tax with respect to USC's Year 1 earnings. USC did not pay or accrue the additional 20u of tax and contested the assessment. After exhausting all effective and practical remedies to reduce, over time, its liability for foreign tax, USC settled the contest with Country X in Year 6, paying 10u of additional tax on September 1, Year 6, when the spot rate was $1.10x:1u.
(
2
)
Analysis.
USC's payment in Year 6 of the 10u of additional tax accrued with respect to Year 1 is a foreign tax redetermination under paragraph (a) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the additional tax is taken into account in Year 1, the year to which the redetermined tax relates, irrespective of when the tax is paid. Under § 1.986(a)-1(a)(2)(i), because the tax was paid more than 24 months after the close of the year to which the redetermined tax relates, the 10u of tax is translated into dollars at the spot rate on the date of payment in Year 6 (10u at $1.10x:1u = $11x). If USC timely notifies the IRS, it may claim an increased foreign tax credit for Year 1. USC must also make corresponding adjustments in determining its taxable income and net unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in Year 1. See §§ 1.987-3(c)(2)(v) and 1.987-4(d)(7).
(B)
Example 2: Refund of tax improperly claimed as a credit
—(
1
)
Facts.
USC holds a note issued by FC, an unrelated foreign corporation in Country Y. In Year 1, FC owed USC 500u of interest on the loan. The statutory rate of withholding on interest paid to a nonresident of Country Y is 20%. On December 1, Year 1, when the spot rate was $1x:1u, FC withheld and remitted to Country Y 100u of tax and paid 400u to USC. Effective for Year 1, USC elected under § 1.986(a)-1(a)(2)(iv) to translate its taxes denominated in nonfunctional currency into dollars at the spot rate on the date the taxes are paid. Under the United States—Country Y Income Tax Treaty (Treaty), USC was entitled to a reduced 15% rate of withholding that would result in a withholding tax of 75u. However, USC improperly claimed a foreign tax credit under section 901 for 100u = $100x on its Year 1 Federal income tax return. (See § 1.901-2(e)(2)(i) and (e)(5), providing that an amount is not tax paid to the extent it exceeds the taxpayer's liability for tax or is reasonably certain to be refunded.) In Year 4, USC filed a refund claim with Country Y for 25u, the difference between the amount actually withheld at the 20% statutory rate of tax and the amount owed by USC at the 15% Treaty rate. On March 15, Year 6, when the spot rate was $1.10x:1u, USC received a refund from Country Y of 25u. USC converted the 25u into dollars on the same day.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Notwithstanding that the 25u of refundable tax did not constitute an amount of tax paid within
the meaning of § 1.901-2(e) at the time USC improperly claimed it as a credit, the 25u refund in Year 6 is a foreign tax redetermination under paragraph (a) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, USC must redetermine its U.S. tax liability for Year 1, the taxable year to which the redetermined tax relates. Under § 1.986(a)-1(c), the refund is translated at the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when originally claimed as a credit. Accordingly, if not previously adjusted by USC or the Internal Revenue Service, USC must file an amended return for Year 1, reducing the amount of foreign tax credit claimed for Year 1 by $25x (25u translated at the spot rate on December 1, Year 1; that is, $1x:1u). Under § 1.986(a)-1(e)(1), USC's basis in the 25u is the same dollar value of the refund as determined under § 1.986(a)-1(c), or $25x. When USC converted the 25u to $27.50x (translated at the spot rate on March 15, Year 6, that is, $1.10x:1u), it realized an exchange gain (within the meaning of § 1.988-1(e)) equal to $2.50x ($27.50x−$25x basis).

Example 3: Change in functional currency
—(
1
)
Facts.
In Year 1, USC earned 500u of foreign source foreign branch category income through its foreign branch in Country X and accrued 100u of Country X foreign income tax on its earnings. The average exchange rate for Year 1 used to translate the foreign income taxes into dollars was $1x:1u.
See
§ 1.986(a)-1(a)(1). On its Federal income tax return for Year 1, USC claimed a foreign tax credit under section 901 of $100x (100u translated at the average exchange rate for Year 1, that is, $1x:1u). As of Year 2, the foreign branch changed its functional currency from the “u” to the dollar, and pursuant to § 1.985-5(d)(2), USC's foreign branch terminated and USC recognized section 987 gain or loss on December 31, Year 1 (the date of change). The rate of exchange, as determined under § 1.985-5(c), used to calculate the U.S. dollar basis in the foreign branch's property on the date of the change was $1.10x:1u, the spot rate on December 31, Year 1. On June 15, Year 3, when the spot rate was $1.30x:1u, USC's foreign branch received a refund from Country X of 10u. The foreign branch converted the 10u into $13x on the same day.
(
2
)
Analysis.
The 10u refund in Year 3 is a foreign tax redetermination under paragraph (a) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, USC must redetermine its U.S. tax liability for Year 1, the taxable year to which the redetermined tax relates. Under § 1.986(a)-1(c), the refund is translated at the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when originally claimed as a credit. Accordingly, USC must file an amended return, reducing the amount of foreign tax credit claimed for Year 1 by $10x (10u translated at the average exchange rate for Year 1, that is $1x:1u). USC must also make corresponding adjustments in determining its taxable income and net unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in Year 1. See §§ 1.987-3(c)(2)(v) and 1.987-4(d)(8). Because the foreign branch changed its functional currency to the dollar in Year 2, the 10u it receives is a refund of nonfunctional currency tax that is denominated in a currency that was the functional currency of the foreign branch at the time USC originally claimed a credit for that foreign income tax. Under §§ 1.985-5(d)(2) and 1.987-4(d), in Year 1 USC must recognize an additional $1x of section 987 gain (or $1x less of section 987 loss) by reason of the 10u being treated as an asset of the foreign branch at the time of the foreign branch's termination. Under § 1.986(a)-1(e)(2), USC's basis in the 10u refund is $11x, which is determined by using the exchange rate used under § 1.985-5(c) when the foreign branch changed its functional currency in Year 2 ($1.10x:1u). When the foreign branch converted the 10u to $13x (translated at the spot rate on June 15, Year 3, which is $1.30x:1u), it realized an exchange gain (within the meaning of § 1.988-1(e)) equal to $2x ($13x−$11x (10u translated at $1.10x:1u)).
(D)
Example 4: Inflationary currency
—(
1
)
Facts.
In Year 1, USC earned 500u of foreign source foreign branch category income through its foreign branch in Country X and accrued 100u of Country X foreign income tax on its earnings. The average exchange rate for Year 1 used to translate the foreign income taxes into dollars was $1x:1u.
See
§ 1.986(a)-1(a)(1). On its Federal income
tax return for Year 1, USC claimed a foreign tax credit under section 901 of $100x (100u translated at the average exchange rate for Year 1, that is, $1x:1u). USC paid the 100u of tax on April 15, Year 3, when the spot rate was $1x:2u. In Year 3, but not in Year 1, the u was an inflationary currency within the meaning of § 1.986(a)-1(a)(2)(iii).
(
2
)
Analysis.
Under § 1.986(a)-1(a)(2)(iii), because the u was an inflationary currency in the year the taxes were paid, USC must translate the 100u of Year 1 tax into dollars using the spot rate on the date of payment of the foreign taxes. Under paragraph (a) of this section, because the translated value of USC's Year 1 taxes when paid, that is, $50x (100u translated at the spot rate on April 15, Year 3, that is, $1x:2u), differs from the amount claimed as credits, that is, $100x (100u translated at the average exchange rate for Year 1, that is, $1x:1u), a foreign tax redetermination has occurred. Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, because the $50x foreign tax redetermination resulting from the currency fluctuation exceeds 2% of the $100x initially accrued, USC must redetermine its U.S. tax liability for Year 1, the taxable year to which the redetermined tax relates. Accordingly, USC must notify the IRS, reducing the amount of foreign tax credit claimed for Year 1 by $50x (the excess of the translated value of the Year 1 taxes when accrued, that is, $100x, over the translated value of the Year 1 taxes when paid, that is, $50x).

Facts.
In Year 1, USC earned 500u of foreign source foreign branch category income through its foreign branch in Country X and accrued 100u of Country X foreign income tax on its earnings. The average exchange rate used to translate the foreign income taxes into dollars for Year 1 was $1x:1u. See § 1.986(a)-1(a)(1). On its Federal income tax return for Year 1, USC claimed a foreign tax credit under section 901 of $100x (100u translated at the average exchange rate for Year 1, that is, $1x:1u). USC did not pay the Year 1 foreign income taxes until March 15, Year 6, when the spot rate was $0.8x:1u.

)
Result in Year 3.
USC's failure to pay the tax by the end of Year 3 results in a foreign tax redetermination under paragraph (a) of this section. Because the taxes were not paid on or before the date 24 months after the close of the taxable year to which the tax relates, USC must account for the redetermination as if the unpaid 100u of accrued taxes were refunded on the last day of Year 3. Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, USC must redetermine its U.S. tax liability for Year 1, the taxable year to which the redetermined tax relates. Under § 1.986(a)-1(c), the deemed refund is translated at the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when originally claimed as a credit. Accordingly, USC must notify the IRS, reducing the amount of foreign tax credit claimed for Year 1 by $100x (100u translated at the average exchange rate for Year 1, that is, $1x:1u). USC must also make corresponding adjustments in determining its taxable income and net unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in Year 1. See §§ 1.987-3(c)(2)(v) and 1.987-4(d)(8).
(
ii
)
Result in Year 6.
USC's payment of the Year 1 tax liability of 100u on March 15, Year 6, results in a second foreign tax redetermination under paragraph (a) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the additional tax is taken into account in Year 1, the year to which the redetermined tax relates, irrespective of when the tax is paid. Under § 1.986(a)-1(a)(2)(i), because the tax was paid more than 24 months after the close of the year to which the tax relates, USC must translate the 100u of tax at the spot rate on the date of payment of the foreign taxes in Year 6. If USC timely notifies the IRS, it may claim an increased foreign tax credit for Year 1. USC must also make corresponding adjustments in determining its taxable income and net unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in Year 1. See §§ 1.987-3(c)(2)(v) and 1.987-4(d)(7).

Facts.
Individual A, a U.S. citizen resident in Country X, is a cash basis taxpayer who has not made an election under section 905(a) to claim the foreign tax credit in the year the taxes accrue. A uses the calendar year as the taxable year for both U.S. and Country X tax
purposes. In Year 2, A pays 100u of foreign income taxes to Country X with respect to Year 1. The exchange rate used to translate the foreign income taxes into dollars was $1x:1u, the spot rate on the date A paid the taxes in Year 2.

section 986(a)(2)(A) and § 1.986(a)-1(b). On A's Year 2 Federal income tax return, A claims a foreign tax credit under section 901 of $100x. In Year 4, Country X assesses an additional 20u of tax with respect to A's Year 1 income. A does not pay the additional 20u of tax and contests the assessment. After exhausting all effective and practical remedies to reduce, over time, A's liability for foreign tax, A settles the contest with Country X in Year 6, paying 10u of additional tax on September 1, Year 6, when the spot rate is $1.10x:1u.

Analysis.
Because A is a cash basis taxpayer that claims the foreign tax credit in the year the taxes are paid, A's payment in Year 6 of 10u of additional tax owed with respect to Year 1 is not a foreign tax redetermination requiring a redetermination of U.S. tax liability under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Rather, A is eligible to claim the additional tax as a credit in Year 6, the year in which the tax is paid. Under § 1.986(a)-1(b), the 10u of tax is translated into dollars at the spot rate on the date of payment in Year 6 (10u at $1.10x:1u = $11x).

Analysis.
Under paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) of this section, A must redetermine its U.S. tax liability for Year 2 and any year to which unused foreign taxes were carried from Year 2. Under § 1.986(a)-1(c), the amount of A's foreign tax credit for Year 2 is reduced by $10x, the 10u refund translated at the exchange rate used to translate the tax when claimed as a credit. Under § 1.986(a)-1(e)(1), A's basis in the 10u is $10x.

Foreign income taxes paid or accrued by foreign corporations
—(i)
In general.
A redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required to account for the effect of a redetermination of foreign income taxes taken into account by a foreign corporation in the year accrued, or a refund of foreign income taxes taken into account by the foreign corporation in the year paid.
(ii)
Required adjustments.
If a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required for any taxable year under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the foreign corporation's taxable income, earnings and profits, and current year taxes (as defined in § 1.960-1(b)(4)) must be adjusted in the year to which the redetermined tax relates (or, in the case of a foreign corporation that receives a refund of foreign income tax and uses the cash basis of accounting, in the year the tax was paid). The redetermination of U.S. tax liability is made by treating the redetermined amount of foreign tax as the amount of tax paid or accrued by the foreign corporation in such year. For example, in the case of a refund of foreign income taxes taken into account in the year accrued, the foreign corporation's subpart F income, tested income, and current earnings and profits are increased, as appropriate, in the year to which the foreign tax relates to reflect the functional currency amount of the foreign income tax refund. The required redetermination of U.S. tax liability must account for the effect of the foreign tax redetermination on the characterization and amount of distributions or inclusions under section 951, 951A, or 1293 taken into account by each of the foreign corporation's United States shareholders, on the application of the high-tax exception described in section 954(b)(4) (including for purposes of determining the exclusions from gross tested income under section 951A(c)(2)(A)(i)(III) and § 1.951A-2(c)(1)(iii)), and the amount of tax determined under sections 1291(c)(2) and 1291(g)(1)(C)(ii), as well as on the amount of foreign taxes deemed paid under section 960 in such year, regardless of whether any such shareholder chooses to deduct or credit its foreign income taxes in any taxable year. In addition, a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required for any subsequent
taxable year in which the characterization or amount of a United States shareholder's distribution or inclusion from the foreign corporation is affected by the foreign tax redetermination, up to and including the taxable year in which the foreign tax redetermination occurs, as well as any year to which unused foreign taxes from such year were carried under section 904(c).
(iii)
Reduction of corporate level tax on distribution of earnings and profits.
If a United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation receives a distribution out of previously taxed earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1) and (2) and a foreign country has imposed tax on the income of the controlled foreign corporation, which tax is reduced on distribution of the earnings and profits of the corporation (resulting in a foreign tax redetermination), then the United States shareholder must redetermine its U.S. tax liability for the year or years affected. See also § 1.904-4(c)(7)(i).
(iv)
Foreign tax redeterminations relating to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018.
In the case of a foreign tax redetermination of a foreign corporation that relates to a taxable year of the foreign corporation beginning before January 1, 2018, a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required under the rules of § 1.905-5.
(v)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (b)(2).
(A)
Presumed Facts.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(2)(v), the following facts are assumed for purposes of the examples in paragraphs (b)(2)(v)(B) through (E) of this section:
(
1
) All parties are accrual basis taxpayers that use the calendar year as their taxable year both for Federal income tax purposes and for foreign tax purposes and use the average exchange rate to translate accrued foreign income taxes;
(
2
) CFC, CFC1, and CFC2 are controlled foreign corporations organized in Country X that use the “u” as their functional currency;
(
3
) No income adjustment is required to reflect exchange gain or loss (within the meaning of § 1.988-1(e)) with respect to the disposition of nonfunctional currency attributable to a refund of foreign income taxes received by any CFC, because all foreign income taxes are denominated and paid in the CFC's functional currency;
(
4
) The highest rate of U.S. tax in section 11 and the rate applicable to USP in all years is 21 percent;
(
5
) No election to exclude high-taxed income under section 954(b)(4) or § 1.951A-2(c)(7) is made with respect to CFC, CFC1, or CFC2; and
(

Facts.
CFC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USP, a domestic corporation. In Year 1, CFC earns 3,660u of general category gross tested income and accrues and pays 300u of foreign income taxes with respect to that income. CFC has no allowable deductions other than the foreign income tax expense. Accordingly, CFC has tested income of 3,360u in Year 1. CFC has no qualified business asset investment (within the meaning of section 951A(d) and § 1.951A-3(b)). In Year 1, no portion of USP's deduction under section 250 (“section 250 deduction”) is reduced by reason of section 250(a)(2)(B)(ii). USP's inclusion percentage (as defined in § 1.960-2(c)(2)) is 100%. In Year 1, USP earns no other income and has no other expenses. The average exchange rate used to translate USP's inclusion under section 951A and CFC's foreign income taxes into dollars for Year 1 is $1x:1u. See section 989(b)(3) and §§ 1.951A-1(d)(1) and 1.986(a)-1(a)(1). Accordingly, for Year 1, USP's tested foreign income taxes (as defined in § 1.960-2(c)(3)) with respect to CFC are $300x. In Year 3, CFC carries back a loss for foreign tax purposes and receives a refund of foreign tax of 100u that relates to Year 1.

Result in Year 1.
In Year 1, CFC has tested income of 3,360u and tested foreign income taxes of $300x. Under section 951A(a) and § 1.951A-1(c)(1), USP has a GILTI inclusion amount of $3,360x (3,360u translated at $1x:1u). Under section 960(d) and § 1.960-2(c), USP is deemed to have paid $240x (80% × 100% × $300x) of foreign income taxes. Under section 78
and § 1.78-1(a), USP is treated as receiving a dividend of $300x (a “section 78 dividend”). USP's section 250 deduction is $1,830x (50% × ($3,360x + $300x)). Accordingly, for Year 1, USP has taxable income of $1,830x ($3,360x + $300x−$1,830x) and pre-credit U.S. tax liability of $384.30x (21% × $1,830x). Accordingly, USP pays U.S. tax of $144.30x ($384.30x−$240x).

)
Result in Year 3.
The refund of 100u to CFC in Year 3 is a foreign tax redetermination under paragraph (a) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, USP must account for the effect of the foreign tax redetermination on its GILTI inclusion amount and foreign taxes deemed paid in Year 1. In redetermining USP's U.S. tax liability for Year 1, USP must increase CFC's tested income and its earnings and profits in Year 1 by the refunded tax amount of 100u, must determine the effect of that increase on its GILTI inclusion amount, and must adjust the amount of foreign taxes deemed paid and the section 78 dividend to account for CFC's refund of foreign tax. Under § 1.986(a)-1(c), the refund is translated into dollars at the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when initially accrued. As a result of the foreign tax redetermination, for Year 1, CFC has tested income of 3,460u (3,360u + 100u) and tested foreign income taxes of $200x ($300x−$100x). Under section 951A(a) and § 1.951A-1(c)(1), USP has a redetermined GILTI inclusion amount of $3,460x (3,460u translated at $1x:1u). Under section 960(d) and § 1.960-2(c), USP is deemed to have paid $160x (80% × 100% × $200x) of foreign income taxes. Under section 78 and § 1.78-1(a), USP's section 78 dividend is $200x. USP's redetermined section 250 deduction is $1,830x (50% × ($3,460x + $200x)). Accordingly, USP's redetermined taxable income is $1,830x ($3,460x + $200x−$1,830x) and its pre-credit U.S. tax liability is $384.30x (21% × $1,830x). Therefore, USP's redetermined U.S. tax liability is $224.3x ($384.30x−$160x), an increase of $80x ($224.30x−$144.30x).

Facts.
CFC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USP, a domestic corporation. In Year 1, CFC earns 1,000u of general category gross foreign base company sales income and accrues and pays 100u of foreign income taxes with respect to that income. CFC has no allowable deductions other than the foreign income tax expense. The average exchange rate used to translate USP's subpart F inclusion and CFC's foreign income taxes into dollars for Year 1 is $1x:1u. See section 989(b)(3) and § 1.986(a)-1(a)(1). In Year 1, USP earns no other income and has no other expenses. In Year 5, pursuant to a Country X audit CFC accrues and pays additional foreign income tax of 80u with respect to its 1,000u of general category foreign base company sales income earned in Year 1. The spot rate (as defined in § 1.988-1(d)) on the date of payment of the tax in Year 5 is $1x:0.8u. The foreign income taxes accrued and paid in Year 1 and Year 5 are properly attributable to CFC's foreign base company sales income that is included in income by USP under section 951(a)(1)(A) (“subpart F inclusion”) in Year 1 with respect to CFC.

Result in Year 1.
In Year 1, CFC has subpart F income of 900u (1,000u−100u). Accordingly, USP has a $900x (900u translated at $1x:1u) subpart F inclusion. Under section 960(a) and § 1.960-2(b), USP is deemed to have paid $100x (100u translated at $1x:1u) of foreign income taxes. Under section 78 and § 1.78-1(a), USP's section 78 dividend is $100x. Accordingly, for Year 1, USP has taxable income of $1,000x ($900x + $100x) and pre-credit U.S. tax liability of $210x (21% × $1,000x). Accordingly, USP's U.S. tax liability is $110x ($210x−$100x).
(

)
Result in Year 5.
CFC's payment of 80u of additional foreign income tax in Year 5 with respect to Year 1 is a foreign tax redetermination as defined in paragraph (a) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, USP must reduce CFC's subpart F income and its earnings and profits in Year 1 by the additional tax amount of 80u. Further, USP must reduce its subpart F inclusion, adjust the amount of foreign taxes deemed paid, and adjust the amount of the section 78 dividend to account for CFC's additional payment of foreign tax. Under section 986(a)(1)(B)(i) and § 1.986(a)-1(a)(2)(i), because CFC's payment of additional tax occurs more than 24 months after the
close of the taxable year to which it relates, the additional tax is translated into dollars at the spot rate on the date of payment ($1x:0.8u). Therefore, CFC has foreign income taxes of $200x (100u translated at $1x:1u plus 80u translated at $1x:0.8u) that are properly attributable to CFC's foreign base company sales income that gives rise to USP's subpart F inclusion in Year 1. As a result of the foreign tax redetermination, for Year 1, USP has a subpart F inclusion of $820x (1,000u−180u = 820u translated at $1x:1u). Under section 960(a) and § 1.960-2(b), USP is deemed to have paid $200x of foreign income taxes. Under section 78 and § 1.78-1(a), USP's section 78 dividend is $200x. USP's redetermined U.S. taxable income is $1,020x ($820x + $200x) and its pre-credit U.S. tax liability is $214.20x (21% × $1,020x). Therefore, USP's redetermined U.S. tax liability is $14.20x ($214.20x−$200x), a decrease of $95.80x ($110x−$14.20x). If USP makes a timely refund claim within the period allowed by section 6511, USP will be entitled to a refund of any overpayment resulting from the redetermination of its U.S. tax liability.

CFC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USP, a domestic corporation. In Year 1, CFC earns 1,000u of general category gross foreign base company sales income and accrues 210u of foreign income taxes with respect to that income. In Year 1, USP earns no other income and has no other expenses. The average exchange rate used to translate USP's subpart F inclusion and CFC's foreign income taxes into dollars for Year 1 is $1x:1u. See sections 989(b)(3) and 986(a)(1)(A) and § 1.986(a)-1(a)(1). CFC does not pay its foreign income taxes for Year 1 until September 1, Year 5, when the spot rate is $0.8x:1u. The foreign income taxes accrued and paid in Year 1 and Year 5, respectively, are properly attributable to CFC's foreign base company sales income that gives rise to USP's subpart F inclusion in Year 1 with respect to CFC.

Result in Year 1.
In Year 1, CFC has subpart F income of 790u (1,000u−210u). Accordingly, USP has a $790x (790u translated at $1x:1u) subpart F inclusion. Under section 960(a) and § 1.960-2(b), USP is deemed to have paid $210x (210u translated at $1x:1u) of foreign income taxes. Under section 78 and § 1.78-1(a), USP's section 78 dividend is $210x. Accordingly, for Year 1, USP has taxable income of $1,000x ($790x + $210x) and pre-credit U.S. tax liability of $210x (21% × $1,000x). Accordingly, USP owes no U.S. tax ($210x−$210x = 0).

)
Result in Year 3.
CFC's failure to pay the tax by the end of Year 3 results in a foreign tax redetermination under paragraph (a) of this section. Because the taxes are not paid on or before the date 24 months after the close of the taxable year to which the tax relates, under paragraph (a) of this section CFC must account for the redetermination as if the unpaid 210u of taxes were refunded on the last day of Year 3. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, USP must increase CFC's subpart F income and its earnings and profits in Year 1 by the unpaid tax amount of 210u. Further, USP must increase its subpart F inclusion, and decrease the amount of foreign taxes deemed paid and the amount of the section 78 dividend to account for the unpaid taxes. As a result of the foreign tax redetermination, for Year 1, USP has a subpart F inclusion of $1,000x (1,000u translated at $1x:1u). Under section 960(a) and § 1.960-2(b), USP is deemed to have paid no foreign income taxes. Under section 78 and § 1.78-1(a), USP has no section 78 dividend. Accordingly, USP's redetermined taxable income is $1,000x and its pre-credit U.S. tax liability is unchanged at $210x (21% × $1,000x). However, USP has no foreign tax credits. Therefore, USP's redetermined U.S. tax liability for Year 1 is $210x, an increase of $210x.

)
Result in Year 5.
CFC's payment of the Year 1 tax liability of 210u on September 1, Year 5, results in a second foreign tax redetermination under paragraph (a) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, USP must decrease CFC's subpart F income and its earnings and profits in Year 1 by the tax paid amount of 210u. Further, USP must reduce its subpart F inclusion, and adjust the amount of foreign taxes deemed paid and the amount of the section 78 dividend to account for CFC's payment of foreign tax. Under section 986(a)(1)(B)(i) and
§ 1.986(a)-1(a)(2)(i), because the tax was paid more than 24 months after the close of the year to which the tax relates, CFC must translate the 210u of tax at the spot rate on the date of payment of the foreign taxes in Year 5. Therefore, CFC has foreign income taxes of $168x (210u translated at $0.8x:1u) that are properly attributable to CFC's foreign base company sales income that gives rise to USP's subpart F inclusion in Year 1. As a result of the foreign tax redetermination, for Year 1, USP has a subpart F inclusion of $790x (1,000u−210u = 790u translated at $1x:1u). Under section 960(a) and § 1.960-2(b), USP is deemed to have paid $168x of foreign income taxes. Under section 78 and § 1.78-1(a), USP's section 78 dividend is $168x. Accordingly, USP's redetermined taxable income is $958x ($790x + $168x), its pre-credit U.S. tax liability is $201.18x (21% × $958x), and its redetermined U.S. tax liability is $33.18 ($201.18x−$168x), a decrease of $176.82x ($210x−$33.18x). If USP makes a timely refund claim within the period allowed by section 6511, USP will be entitled to a refund of any overpayment resulting from the redetermination of its U.S. tax liability.

Facts.
CFC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USP, a domestic corporation. In Year 1, CFC earns 360u of general category gross tested income and accrues and pays 160u of current year taxes with respect to that income. CFC has no allowable deductions other than the foreign income tax expense. Accordingly, CFC has tested income of 200u in Year 1. CFC has no qualified business asset investment (within the meaning of section 951A(d) and § 1.951A-3(b)). In Year 1, no portion of USP's section 250 deduction is reduced by reason of section 250(a)(2)(B)(ii). USP's inclusion percentage (as defined in § 1.960-2(c)(2)) is 100%. In Year 1, USP earns no other income and has no other expenses. The average exchange rate used to translate USP's section 951A inclusion and CFC's foreign income taxes into dollars for Year 1 is $1x:1u. See section 989(b)(3) and §§ 1.951A-1(d)(1) and 1.986(a)-1(a)(1). Accordingly, for Year 1, CFC's tested foreign income taxes (as defined in § 1.960-2(c)(3)) with respect to USP are $160x. In Year 3, Country X assessed an additional 30u of tax with respect to CFC's Year 1 income. CFC did not pay the additional 30u of tax and contested the assessment. After exhausting all effective and practical remedies to reduce, over time, its liability for foreign income tax, CFC settled the contest with Country X in Year 4 for 20u, which CFC did not pay until January 15, Year 5, when the spot rate was $1.1x:1u. CFC did not earn any other income or accrue any other foreign income taxes in Years 2 through 6 and made no distributions to USP. The additional taxes paid in Year 5 are also tested foreign income taxes of CFC with respect to USP.

In Year 1, CFC has tested income of 200u and tested foreign income taxes of $160x. Under section 951A(a) and § 1.951A-1(c)(1), USP has a GILTI inclusion amount of $200x (200u translated at $1x:1u). Under section 960(d) and § 1.960-2(c), USP is deemed to have paid $128x (80% × 100% × $160x) of foreign income taxes. Under section 78 and § 1.78-1(a), USP's section 78 dividend is $160x. USP's section 250 deduction is $180x (50% × ($200x + $160x)). Accordingly, for Year 1, USP has taxable income of $180x ($200x + $160x−$180x) and a pre-credit U.S. tax liability of $37.80x (21% × $180x). Under section 904(a), because all of USP's income is section 951A category income (see § 1.904-4(g)), USP's foreign tax credit limitation is $37.80x ($37.80x × $180x/$180x), which is less than the $128x of foreign income tax that USP is deemed to have paid. Accordingly, USP owes no U.S. tax ($37.80x−$37.80x = 0).

Result in Year 5.
CFC's accrual and payment of the additional 20u of foreign income tax with respect to Year 1 is a foreign tax redetermination under paragraph (a) of this section. Under § 1.461-4(g)(6)(iii)(B), the additional taxes accrue when the tax contest is resolved, that is, in Year 4. However, because the taxes, which relate to Year 1, were not paid on or before the date 24 months after close of CFC's taxable year to which the tax relates, that is, Year 1, under section 905(c)(2) and paragraph (a) of this section CFC cannot take these taxes into account when they accrue in Year 4. Instead, the taxes are taken into account when
they are paid in Year 5. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, USP must decrease CFC's tested income and its earnings and profits in Year 1 by the additional tax amount of 20u. Further, USP must adjust its GILTI inclusion amount, the amount of foreign taxes deemed paid, and the amount of the section 78 dividend to account for CFC's additional payment of tax. Under section 986(a)(1)(B)(i) and § 1.986(a)-1(a)(2)(i), because CFC's payment of additional tax occurs more than 24 months after the close of the taxable year to which it relates, the additional tax is translated into dollars at the spot rate on the date of payment ($1.1x:1u). Therefore, CFC has tested foreign income taxes of $182x (160u translated at $1x:1u plus 20u translated at $1.1x:1u). As a result of the foreign tax redetermination, for Year 1, CFC has tested income of 180u (200u−20u). Under section 951A(a) and § 1.951A-1(c)(1), USP has a redetermined GILTI inclusion amount of $180x (180u, translated at $1x:1u). Under section 960(d) and § 1.960-2(c), USP is deemed to have paid $145.60x (80% × 100% × $182x) of foreign income taxes. Under section 78 and § 1.78-1(a), USP's section 78 dividend is $182x. USP's redetermined section 250 deduction is $181x (50% × ($180x + $182x)). Accordingly, USP's redetermined taxable income is $181x ($180x + $182x−$181x), its pre-credit U.S. tax liability is $38.01x (21% × $181x), and its redetermined U.S. tax liability is zero ($38.01x−$38.01x).

Foreign tax redeterminations of successors or transferees.
If at the time of a foreign tax redetermination the person with legal liability for the tax (or in the case of a refund, the legal right to such refund) (the “successor”) is a different person than the person that had legal liability for the tax in the year to which the redetermined tax relates (the “original taxpayer”), the required redetermination of U.S. tax liability is made as if the foreign tax redetermination occurred in the hands of the original taxpayer. Federal income tax principles apply to determine the tax consequences if the successor remits (or receives a refund of) a tax that in the year to which the redetermined tax relates was the legal liability of, and thus under § 1.901-2(f) is considered paid by, the original taxpayer.
(4)
Change in election to claim a foreign tax credit.
A redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required to account for the effect of a timely change by the taxpayer to claim a foreign tax credit or a deduction for foreign income taxes paid or accrued in any taxable year as permitted under § 1.901-1(d).
(c)
Foreign income tax imposed on foreign refund.
If a redetermination of foreign income tax for a taxable year or years results from a refund to the section 901 taxpayer of foreign income taxes paid to a foreign country or possession of the United States and the foreign country or possession imposed foreign income tax on such refund, then, in accordance with section 905(c)(5), the amount of the refund is considered to be reduced by the amount of any foreign income tax described in section 901 imposed by the foreign country or possession of the United States with respect to such refund. In such case, no other credit under section 901, and no deduction under section 164, is allowed for any taxable year with respect to such tax imposed on such refund.
(d)
Applicability dates.
Except as provided in this paragraph (d), this section applies to foreign tax redeterminations occurring in taxable years ending on or after December 16, 2019, and to foreign tax redeterminations of foreign corporations occurring in taxable years that end with or within a taxable year of a United States shareholder ending on or after December 16, 2019 and that relate to taxable years of foreign corporations beginning after December 31, 2017. The first two sentences of paragraph (a) of this section, and paragraph (b)(4) of this section, apply to foreign tax redeterminations occurring in taxable years beginning on or after December 28, 2021.

§ 1.905-4
Notification of foreign tax redetermination.
(a)
Application of this section.
The rules of this section apply if, as a result of a foreign tax redetermination
(as defined in § 1.905-3(a)), a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required under section 905(c) and § 1.905-3(b).
(b)
Time and manner of notification
—(1)
Redetermination of U.S. tax liability
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(v) and (b)(2) through (4) of this section, any taxpayer for which a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required must notify the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the foreign tax redetermination by filing an amended return, Form 1118 (Foreign Tax Credit—Corporations) or Form 1116 (Foreign Tax Credit (Individual, Estate, or Trust)), and the statement described in paragraph (c) of this section for the taxable year with respect to which a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required. Such notification must be filed within the time prescribed by this paragraph (b) and contain the information described in paragraph (c) of this section. If a foreign tax redetermination requires an individual to redetermine the individual's U.S. tax liability, and if, after taking into account such foreign tax redetermination, the amount of creditable foreign taxes (as defined in section 904(j)(3)(B)) that are paid or accrued by such individual during the taxable year does not exceed the applicable dollar limitation in section 904(j), the individual is not required to file Form 1116 with the amended return for such taxable year if the individual satisfies the requirements of section 904(j).
(ii)
Increase in amount of U.S. tax liability.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(iv) and (v) and (b)(2) through (4) of this section, for each taxable year of the taxpayer with respect to which a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required by reason of a foreign tax redetermination that increases the amount of U.S. tax liability, for example, by reason of a downward adjustment to the amount of foreign income taxes paid or accrued by the taxpayer or a foreign corporation with respect to which the taxpayer computes an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid, the taxpayer must file a separate notification by the due date (with extensions) of the original return for the taxpayer's taxable year in which the foreign tax redetermination occurs.
(iii)
Decrease in amount of U.S. tax liability.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(iv) and (v) and (b)(2) through (4) of this section, for each taxable year of the taxpayer with respect to which a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required by reason of a foreign tax redetermination that decreases the amount of U.S. tax liability and results in an overpayment, for example, by reason of an increase in the amount of foreign income taxes paid or accrued by the taxpayer or a foreign corporation with respect to which the taxpayer computes an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid, the taxpayer must file a claim for refund with the IRS within the period provided in section 6511. See section 6511(d)(3)(A) for the special refund period for refunds attributable to an increase in foreign tax credits.
(iv)
Multiple redeterminations of U.S. tax liability for same taxable year.
The rules of this paragraph (b)(1)(iv) apply except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(v) and (b)(2) through (4) of this section. If more than one foreign tax redetermination requires a redetermination of U.S. tax liability for the same affected taxable year of the taxpayer and those foreign tax redeterminations occur within the same taxable year or within two consecutive taxable years of the taxpayer, the taxpayer may file for the affected taxable year one amended return, Form 1118 or Form 1116, and the statement described in paragraph (c) of this section that reflects all such foreign tax redeterminations. If the taxpayer chooses to file one notification for such redeterminations, one or more of such redeterminations would increase the U.S. tax liability, and the net effect of all such redeterminations is to increase the U.S. tax liability for the affected taxable year, the taxpayer must file such notification by the due date (with extensions) of the original return for the taxpayer's taxable year in which the first foreign tax redetermination that would result in an increased U.S. tax liability occurred. If the taxpayer chooses to file one notification for such redeterminations, one or more of such redeterminations would decrease the
U.S. tax liability, and the net effect of all such redeterminations is to decrease the total amount of U.S. tax liability for the affected taxable year, the taxpayer must file such notification as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, within the period provided by section 6511. If a foreign tax redetermination with respect to the taxable year for which a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required occurs after the date for providing such notification, more than one amended return may be required with respect to that taxable year.
(v)
Amended return required only if there is a change in amount of U.S. tax due.
If a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required by reason of a foreign tax redetermination (or multiple foreign tax redeterminations, in the case of redeterminations described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section), but does not change the amount of U.S. tax due for any taxable year, the taxpayer may, in lieu of applying the applicable rules of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section, notify the IRS of such redetermination by attaching a statement to the original return for the taxpayer's taxable year in which the foreign tax redetermination occurs. The statement must be filed by the due date (with extensions) of the original return for the taxpayer's taxable year in which the foreign tax redetermination occurs and contain the information described in § 1.904-2(f). If a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required by reason of a foreign tax redetermination (either alone, or if the taxpayer chooses to apply paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, in combination with other foreign tax redeterminations, as provided therein) and the redetermination of U.S. tax liability results in a change to the amount of U.S. tax due for a taxable year, but does not change the amount of U.S. tax due for other taxable years, for example, because of a carryback or carryover of an unused foreign tax under section 904(c), the notification requirements for such other taxable years are deemed to be satisfied if the taxpayer complies with the applicable rules of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section with respect to each taxable year for which the foreign tax redetermination changes the amount of U.S. tax due.
(2)
Notification with respect to a change in the amount of foreign tax reported to an owner by a pass-through entity
—(i)
In general.
If a partnership, trust, or other pass-through entity that reports to its beneficial owners (or to any intermediary on behalf of its beneficial owners), including partners, shareholders, beneficiaries, or similar persons, an amount of creditable foreign tax expenditures, such pass-through entity must notify both the IRS and its owners of any foreign tax redetermination described in § 1.905-3(a) with respect to the foreign tax so reported. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), whether or not a redetermination has occurred within the meaning of § 1.905-3(a) is determined as if the pass-through entity were a domestic corporation which had elected to and claimed foreign tax credits in the amount reported for the year to which such foreign taxes relate. The notification required under this paragraph (b)(2) must include the statement described in paragraph (c) of this section along with any information necessary for the owners to redetermine their U.S. tax liability.
(ii)
Partnerships subject to subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Code.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, if a redetermination of U.S. tax liability that is required under § 1.905-3(b) by reason of a foreign tax redetermination described in § 1.905-3(a) would require a partnership adjustment as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(6) of this chapter, the partnership must file an administrative adjustment request under section 6227 and make any adjustments required under section 6227. See §§ 301.6227-2 and 301.6227-3 of this chapter for procedures for making adjustments with respect to an administrative adjustment request. An administrative adjustment request required under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) must be filed by the due date (with extensions) of the original return for the partnership's taxable year in which the foreign tax redetermination occurs, and the restrictions in section 6227(c) do not apply to such filing. However, unless the administrative adjustment request may otherwise be filed after applying the limitations contained in section
6227(c), such a request is limited to adjustments that are required to be made under section 905(c). The requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section are deemed to be satisfied with respect to any item taken into account in an administrative adjustment request filed under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii).
(3)
Alternative notification requirements.
An amended return and Form 1118 (Foreign Tax Credit—Corporations) or Form 1116 (Foreign Tax Credit (Individual, Estate, or Trust)), is not required to notify the IRS of the foreign tax redetermination and redetermination of U.S. tax liability if the taxpayer satisfies alternative notification requirements that may be prescribed by the IRS through forms, instructions, publications, or other guidance.
(4)
Taxpayers under examination within the jurisdiction of the Large Business and International Division
—(i)
In general.
The alternative notification requirements of this paragraph (b)(4) apply if all of the conditions described in paragraphs (b)(4)(i)(A) through (E) of this section are satisfied.
(A) A foreign tax redetermination occurs while the taxpayer is under examination within the jurisdiction of the Large Business and International Division.
(B) The foreign tax redetermination results in an adjustment to the amount of foreign income taxes paid or accrued by the taxpayer or a foreign corporation with respect to which the taxpayer computes an amount of foreign income taxes deemed paid.
(C) The foreign tax redetermination requires a redetermination of U.S. tax liability that increases the amount of U.S. tax liability, and accordingly, but for this paragraph (b)(4), the taxpayer would be required to notify the IRS of such foreign tax redetermination under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section (determined without regard to paragraphs (b)(1)(iv) and (v) of this section) or paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. See paragraph (b)(4)(v) of this section regarding foreign tax redeterminations that decrease the amount of U.S. tax liability.
(D) The return for the taxable year for which a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required is under examination.
(E) The due date specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2)(ii) of this section for providing notice of such foreign tax redetermination is not before the later of the opening conference or the hand-delivery or postmark date of the opening letter concerning an examination of the return for the taxable year for which a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required by reason of such foreign tax redetermination.
(ii)
Notification requirements
—(A)
Foreign tax redetermination occurring before commencement of the examination.
If a foreign tax redetermination described in paragraphs (b)(4)(i)(B) and (C) of this section occurs before the later of the opening conference or the hand-delivery or postmark date of the opening letter and if the condition provided in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(E) of this section with respect to such foreign tax redetermination is met, the taxpayer, in lieu of applying the rules of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section (requiring the filing of an amended return, Form 1116 or 1118, and the statement described in paragraph (c) of this section) or paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section (requiring the filing of an administrative adjustment request), must notify the IRS of such redetermination by providing the statement described in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section to the examiner no later than 120 days after the later of the date of the opening conference of the examination, or the hand-delivery or postmark date of the opening letter concerning the examination.
(B)
Foreign tax redetermination occurring within 180 days after commencement of the examination.
If a foreign tax redetermination described in paragraphs (b)(4)(i)(B) and (C) of this section occurs on or after the latest of the opening conference or the hand-delivery or postmark date of the opening letter and on or before the date that is 180 days after the later of the opening conference or the hand-delivery or postmark date of the opening letter, the taxpayer, in lieu of applying the rules of paragraph (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this
section or paragraph (b)(2) of this section, must notify the IRS of such redetermination by providing the statement described in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section to the examiner no later than 120 days after the date the foreign tax redetermination occurs.
(C)
Foreign tax redetermination occurring more than 180 days after commencement of the examination.
If a foreign tax redetermination described in paragraphs (b)(4)(i)(B) and (C) of this section occurs after the date that is 180 days after the later of the opening conference or the hand-delivery or postmark date of the opening letter, the taxpayer must either apply the rules of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section or paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or, in lieu of applying paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section or paragraph (b)(2) of this section, provide the statement described in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section to the examiner within 120 days after the date the foreign tax redetermination occurs.

(iii)
Statement.
The statement required by paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section must provide the original amount of foreign income taxes paid or accrued, the revised amount of foreign income taxes paid or accrued, and documentation with respect to the revisions, including exchange rates and dates of accrual or payment, and, if applicable, the information described in paragraph (c)(8) of this section. The statement must include the following declaration signed by a person authorized to sign the return of the taxpayer: “Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this written statement, and to the best of my knowledge and belief, this written statement is true, correct, and complete.”
(iv)
Penalty for failure to file notice of a foreign tax redetermination.
A taxpayer subject to the rules of this paragraph (b)(4) must satisfy the rules of paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section in order not to be subject to the penalty relating to the failure to file notice of a foreign tax redetermination under section 6689 and § 301.6689-1 of this chapter.
(v)
Notification of foreign tax redetermination that decreases U.S. tax liability in an affected year under audit.
A taxpayer may (but is not required to) notify the IRS as provided in this paragraph (b)(4)(v) if the taxpayer has a foreign tax redetermination that meets the conditions in paragraphs (b)(4)(i)(A), (B), and (D) of this section and results in a decrease in the amount of U.S. tax liability that, but for this paragraph (b)(4), would require the taxpayer to notify the IRS of such foreign tax redetermination under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) or (b)(2)(ii) of this section (determined without regard to paragraphs (b)(1)(iv) and (v) of this section). The notification should be made in the time and manner specified in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section. The IRS, in its discretion, may either accept such alternate notification or require the taxpayer to comply with the rules of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (iii) or paragraphs (b)(2) of this section, as applicable.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (b) of this section.
(i)
Example 1.
(A) X, a domestic corporation, is an accrual basis taxpayer and uses the calendar year as its U.S. taxable year. X conducts business through a branch in Country M, the currency of which is the m, and also conducts business through a branch in Country N, the currency of which is the n. X uses the average exchange rate to translate foreign income taxes. X is able to claim a credit under section 901 for all foreign income taxes paid or accrued.
(B) In Year 1, X accrued and paid 100m of Country M income taxes with respect to 400m of foreign source foreign branch category income. The average exchange rate for Year 1 was $1:1m. Also in Year 1, X accrued and paid 50n of Country N income taxes with respect to 150n of foreign source foreign branch category income. The average exchange rate for Year 1 was $1:1n. On its Year 1 Federal income tax return, X claimed a foreign tax credit under section 901 of $150 ($100 (100m translated at $1:1m) + $50 (50n translated at $1:1n))
with respect to its foreign source foreign branch category income. See § 1.986(a)-1(a)(1).
(C) In Year 2, X accrued and paid 100n of Country N income taxes with respect to 300n of foreign source foreign branch category income. The average exchange rate for Year 2 was $1.50:1n. On its Year 2 Federal income tax return, X claimed a foreign tax credit under section 901 of $150 (100n translated at $1.5:1n). See § 1.986(a)-1(a)(1).
(D) On June 15, Year 5, when the spot rate was $1.40:1n, X received a refund of 10n from Country N, and, on March 15, Year 6, when the spot rate was $1.20:1m, X was assessed by and paid Country M an additional 20m of tax. Both payments were with respect to X's foreign source foreign branch category income in Year 1. On May 15, Year 6, when the spot rate was $1.45:1n, X received a refund of 5n from Country N with respect to its foreign source foreign branch category income in Year 2.
(E) Both of the refunds and the assessment are foreign tax redeterminations under § 1.905-3(a). Under § 1.905-3(b)(1), X must redetermine its U.S. tax liability for both Year 1 and Year 2. With respect to Year 1, under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section X must notify the IRS of the June 15, Year 5, refund of 10n from Country N that increased X's U.S. tax liability by filing an amended return, Form 1118, and the statement required by paragraph (c) of this section for Year 1 by the due date of the original return (with extensions) for Year 5. The amended return and Form 1118 would reflect the reduced amount of foreign income taxes claimed as a credit under section 901 and the increase in X's U.S. tax liability of $10 (10n refund translated at the average exchange rate for Year 1, or $1:1n (see § 1.986(a)-1(c)). With respect to the March 15, Year 6, additional assessment of 20m by Country M, under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section X must notify the IRS within the time period provided by section 6511, increasing the foreign income taxes available as a credit and reducing X's U.S. tax liability by $24 (20m translated at the spot rate on the date of payment, or $1.20:1m). See sections 986(a)(1)(B)(i) and 986(a)(2)(A) and § 1.986(a)-1(a)(2)(i). X may so notify the IRS by filing a second amended return, Form 1118, and the statement described in paragraph (c) of this section for Year 1, within the time period provided by section 6511. Alternatively, under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, when X redetermines its U.S. tax liability for Year 1 to take into account the 10n refund from Country N that occurred in Year 5, X may also take into account the 20m additional assessment by Country M that occurred on March 15, Year 6. If X reflects both foreign tax redeterminations on the same amended return, Form 1118, and in the statement described in paragraph (c) of this section for Year 1, the amount of X's foreign income taxes available as a credit would be reduced by $10 (10n refund translated at $1:1n), and increased by $24 (20m additional assessment translated at the spot rate on the date of payment, March 15, Year 6, or $1.20:1m). The foreign income taxes available as a credit therefore would be increased by $14 ($24 (additional assessment)−$10 (refund)). Because the net effect of the foreign tax redeterminations is to increase the amount of foreign taxes paid or accrued and decrease X's U.S. tax liability for Year 1, under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section the Year 1 amended return, Form 1118, and the statement required in paragraph (c) of this section reflecting foreign tax redeterminations in both years must be filed within the period provided by section 6511.
(F) With respect to Year 2, under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section X must notify the IRS by filing an amended return, Form 1118, and the statement required by paragraph (c) of this section for Year 2, in addition to the amended return, Form 1118, and statement that are required by reason of the separate foreign tax redeterminations that affect Year 1. The amended return, Form 1118, and the statement required by paragraph (c) of this section for Year 2 must be filed by the due date (with extensions) of X's original return for Year 6. The amended return and Form 1118 must reflect the reduced amount of foreign income taxes claimed as a credit under section 901 and the increase in X's U.S. tax liability of $7.50 (5n refund translated at
the average exchange rate for Year 2, or $1.50:1n).
(ii)
Example 2.
X, a taxpayer within the jurisdiction of the Large Business and International Division, uses the calendar year as its U.S. taxable year. On November 15, Year 2, X receives a refund of foreign income taxes that constitutes a foreign tax redetermination and necessitates a redetermination of U.S. tax liability for X's Year 1 taxable year. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, X is required to notify the IRS of the foreign tax redetermination that increased its U.S. tax liability by filing an amended return, Form 1118, and the statement described in paragraph (c) of this section for its Year 1 taxable year by October 15, Year 3 (the due date (with extensions) of the original return for X's Year 2 taxable year). On December 15, Year 3, the IRS hand delivers an opening letter concerning the examination of the return for X's Year 1 taxable year, and the opening conference for such examination is scheduled for January 15, Year 4. Because the date for notifying the IRS of the foreign tax redetermination under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section (October 15, Year 3) is before the date of the opening conference concerning the examination of the return for X's Year 1 taxable year (January 15, Year 4), the condition of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(E) of this section is not met, and so paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section does not apply. Accordingly, X must notify the IRS of the foreign tax redetermination by filing an amended return, Form 1118, and the statement described in paragraph (c) of this section for the Year 1 taxable year by October 15, Year 3.
(6)
Transition rule for certain foreign tax redeterminations.
In the case of foreign tax redeterminations occurring in taxable years ending on or after December 16, 2019, and before November 12, 2020, and foreign tax redeterminations of foreign corporations occurring in taxable years that end with or within a taxable year of a United States shareholder ending on or after December 16, 2019, and before November 12, 2020, any amended return or other notification that under paragraph (b)(1)(ii), (iv), or (v) or (b)(2)(ii) of this section must be filed by the due date (with extensions) of, or attached to, the original return for the taxpayer's taxable year in which the foreign tax redetermination occurs must instead be filed by the due date (with extensions) of, or attached to, the original return for the taxpayer's first taxable year ending on or after November 12, 2020. For purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(E) of this section, the relevant due date is the due date specified in this paragraph (b)(6).
(c)
Notification contents.
The statement required by paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) and (b)(2) of this section must contain information sufficient for the IRS to redetermine U.S. tax liability if such a redetermination is required under section 905(c). The information must be in a form that enables the IRS to verify and compare the original computation of U.S. tax liability, the revised computation resulting from the foreign tax redetermination, and the net changes resulting therefrom. The statement must include the following:
(1) The taxpayer's name, address, identifying number, the taxable year or years of the taxpayer that are affected by the foreign tax redetermination, and, in the case of foreign taxes deemed paid, the name and identifying number, if any, of the foreign corporation;
(2) The date or dates the foreign income taxes were accrued, if applicable; the date or dates the foreign income taxes were paid; the amount of foreign income taxes paid or accrued on each date (in foreign currency) and the exchange rate used to translate each such amount, as provided in § 1.986(a)-1(a) or (b);
(3) Information sufficient to determine any change to the characterization of a distribution, the amount of any inclusion under section 951(a), 951A, or 1293, or the deferred tax amount under section 1291;
(4) Information sufficient to determine any interest due from or owing to the taxpayer, including the amount of any interest paid by the foreign government to the taxpayer and the dates received;
(5) In the case of any foreign income tax that is refunded in whole or in part, the taxpayer must provide the
date of each such refund; the amount of such refund (in foreign currency); and the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when originally claimed as a credit (as provided in § 1.986(a)-1(c)) and the spot rate (as defined in § 1.988-1(d)) for the date the refund was received (for purposes of computing foreign currency gain or loss under section 988);
(6) In the case of any foreign income taxes that are not paid on or before the date that is 24 months after the close of the taxable year to which such taxes relate, the amount of such taxes in foreign currency, and the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when originally claimed as a credit or added to PTEP group taxes (as defined in § 1.960-3(d)(1));
(7) If a redetermination of U.S. tax liability results in an amount of additional tax due, and the carryback or carryover of an unused foreign income tax under section 904(c) only partially eliminates such amount, the information required in § 1.904-2(f); and
(8) In the case of a pass-through entity, the name, address, and identifying number of each beneficial owner to which foreign taxes were reported for the taxable year or years to which the foreign tax redetermination relates, and the amount of foreign tax initially reported to each beneficial owner for each such year and the amount of foreign tax allocable to each beneficial owner for each such year after the foreign tax redetermination is taken into account.
(d)
Payment or refund of U.S. tax.
The amount of tax, if any, due upon a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is paid by the taxpayer after notice and demand has been made by the IRS. Subchapter B of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code (relating to deficiency procedures) does not apply with respect to the assessment of the amount due upon such redetermination. In accordance with sections 905(c) and 6501(c)(5), the amount of additional tax due is assessed and collected without regard to the provisions of section 6501(a) (relating to limitations on assessment and collection). The amount of tax, if any, shown by a redetermination of U.S. tax liability to have been overpaid is credited or refunded to the taxpayer in accordance with subchapter B of chapter 66 (sections 6511 through 6515).
(e)
Interest and penalties
—(1)
In general.
If a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required by reason of a foreign tax redetermination, interest is computed on the underpayment or overpayment in accordance with sections 6601 and 6611. No interest is assessed or collected on any underpayment resulting from a refund of foreign income taxes for any period before the receipt of the refund, except to the extent interest was paid by the foreign country or possession of the United States on the refund for the period before the receipt of the refund. See section 905(c)(5). In no case, however, will interest assessed and collected pursuant to the preceding sentence for any period before receipt of the refund exceed the amount that otherwise would have been assessed and collected under section 6601 for that period. Interest is assessed from the time the taxpayer (or the foreign corporation, partnership, trust, or other pass-through entity of which the taxpayer is a shareholder, partner, or beneficiary) receives a refund until the taxpayer pays the additional tax due the United States.
(2)
Imposition of penalty.
Failure to comply with the provisions of this section subjects the taxpayer to the penalty provisions of section 6689 and § 301.6689-1 of this chapter.
(f)
Applicability date.
This section applies to foreign tax redeterminations (as defined in § 1.905-3(a)) occurring in taxable years ending on or after December 16, 2019, and to foreign tax redeterminations of foreign corporations occurring in taxable years that end with or within a taxable year of a United States shareholder ending on or after December 16, 2019.

Effect of foreign tax redetermination of a foreign corporation.
Except as provided in paragraph (e) of
this section, a foreign tax redetermination (as defined in § 1.905-3(a)) of a foreign corporation that relates to a taxable year of the foreign corporation beginning before January 1, 2018, and that may affect a taxpayer's foreign tax credit in any taxable year, must be accounted for by adjusting the foreign corporation's taxable income and earnings and profits, post-1986 undistributed earnings as defined in § 1.902-1(a)(9), and post-1986 foreign income taxes as defined in § 1.902-1(a)(8) (or its pre-1987 accumulated profits as defined in § 1.902-1(a)(10)(i) and pre-1987 foreign income taxes as defined in § 1.902-1(a)(10)(iii), as applicable) in the taxable year of the foreign corporation to which the foreign taxes relate.
(2)
Required redetermination of U.S. tax liability.
Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required to account for the effect of the foreign tax redetermination on the earnings and profits and taxable income of the foreign corporation, the taxable income of a United States shareholder, and the amount of foreign taxes deemed paid by the United States shareholder under section 902 or 960 (as in effect before December 22, 2017), in the year to which the redetermined foreign taxes relate. For example, in the case of a refund of foreign income taxes, the subpart F income, earnings and profits, and post-1986 undistributed earnings (or pre-1987 accumulated profits, as applicable) of the foreign corporation are increased in the year to which the foreign tax relates to reflect the functional currency amount of the foreign income tax refund. The required redetermination of U.S. tax liability must account for the effect of the foreign tax redetermination on the characterization and amount of distributions or inclusions under section 951 or 1293 taken into account by each of the foreign corporation's United States shareholders and on the application of the high-tax exception described in section 954(b)(4), as well as on the amount of foreign income taxes deemed paid in such year. In addition, a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required for any subsequent taxable year in which the United States shareholder received or accrued a distribution or inclusion from the foreign corporation, up to and including the taxable year in which the foreign tax redetermination occurs, as well as any year to which unused foreign taxes from such year were carried under section 904(c).
(b)
Notification requirements
—(1)
In general.
The notification requirements of § 1.905-4, as modified by paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, apply if a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required under paragraph (a) or (e) of this section.
(2)
Notification relating to post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes.
In the case of foreign tax redeterminations with respect to taxes included in post-1986 foreign income taxes, in addition to the information required by § 1.905-4(c), the taxpayer must provide the balances of the pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes before and after adjusting the pools, the dates and amounts of any dividend distributions or other inclusions made out of earnings and profits for the affected year or years, and the amount of earnings and profits from which such dividends were paid or such inclusions were made for the affected year or years.
(3)
Notification relating to pre-1987 accumulated profits and pre-1987 foreign income taxes.
In the case of foreign tax redeterminations with respect to pre-1987 accumulated profits, in addition to the information required by § 1.905-4(c), the taxpayer must provide the following: The dates and amounts of any dividend distributions made out of earnings and profits for the affected year or years; the rate of exchange on the date of any such distribution; and the amount of earnings and profits from which such dividends were paid for the affected year or years.
(c)
Currency translation rules for adjustments to pre-1987 foreign income taxes.
Foreign income taxes paid with respect to pre-1987 accumulated profits that are deemed paid under section 960 (or under section 902 in the case of an amount treated as a dividend under section 1248) are translated into dollars at the spot rate for the date of the payment of the foreign income taxes, and refunds of such taxes are translated into dollars at the spot rate for the
date of the refund. Foreign income taxes deemed paid by a taxpayer under section 902 with respect to an actual distribution of pre-1987 accumulated profits and refunds of such taxes are translated into dollars at the spot rate for the date of the distribution of the earnings to which the foreign income taxes relate. See section 902(c)(6) (as in effect before December 22, 2017) and § 1.902-1(a)(10)(iii). For purposes of this section, the term
spot rate
has the meaning provided in § 1.988-1(d).
(d)
Timing and effect of pooling adjustments.
The redetermination of U.S. tax liability required by paragraphs (a) and (e) of this section is made in accordance with section 905(c) as in effect for those taxable years, without regard (except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section) to rules that required adjustments to a foreign corporation's pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in the year of the foreign tax redetermination rather than in the year to which the redetermined foreign tax relates. No underpayment or overpayment of U.S. tax liability results from a foreign tax redetermination unless the required adjustments change the U.S. tax liability. Consequently, no interest is paid by or to a taxpayer as a result of adjustments, required by reason of a foreign tax redetermination, to a foreign corporation's pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in the year to which the redetermined foreign tax relates (or a subsequent year) that did not result in a change to U.S. tax liability, for example, because no foreign taxes were deemed paid in that year.
(e)
Election to account for certain foreign tax redeterminations with respect to pre-2018 taxable years in the foreign corporation's last pooling year
—(1)
In general.
A taxpayer may elect under the rules in paragraph (e)(2) of this section to account for foreign tax redeterminations of a foreign corporation that occur in the foreign corporation's taxable years ending with or within a taxable year of a United States shareholder of the foreign corporation ending on or after November 2, 2020, and that relate to taxable years of the foreign corporation beginning before January 1, 2018, by treating such foreign tax redeterminations as if they occurred in the foreign corporation's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018 (the “last pooling year”), and applying the rules in §§ 1.905-3T(d) and 1.905-5T for purposes of determining whether the foreign tax redetermination is accounted for in the foreign corporation's last pooling year or must be accounted for in the year to which the redetermined foreign tax relates. Except with respect to determining under the preceding sentence whether the foreign tax redetermination is accounted for in the foreign corporation's last pooling year or in the year to which the redetermined foreign tax relates, the rules of this section apply to foreign tax redeterminations covered by an election under this paragraph (e). Therefore, unless an exception in § 1.905-3T(d)(3) applies, a foreign tax redetermination to which an election under this paragraph (e) applies is accounted for under paragraph (a)(2) of this section by adjusting the foreign corporation's pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in the last pooling year, rather than in the year to which the redetermined foreign tax relates. For purposes of this paragraph (e), references to §§ 1.905-3T and 1.905-5T are to such provisions as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised as of April 1, 2019.
(2)
Rules regarding the election
—(i)
Time and manner of election.
For a foreign corporation's first taxable year that ends with or within a taxable year of a United States shareholder of the foreign corporation ending on or after November 2, 2020 in which the foreign corporation has a foreign tax redetermination (the “first redetermination year”), the controlling domestic shareholders (as defined in § 1.964-1(c)(5)) of the foreign corporation make the election described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section by—
(A) Filing the statement required under § 1.964-1(c)(3)(ii) with a timely filed original income tax return for the taxable year of each controlling domestic shareholder of the foreign corporation in which or with which the foreign corporation's first redetermination year ends;
(B) Providing any notices required under § 1.964-1(c)(3)(iii);
(C) Filing amended returns as required under § 1.905-4 and this section for each controlling domestic shareholder's taxable year with or within which ends the foreign corporation's last pooling year and each other affected year before the controlling domestic shareholder's taxable year with or within which ends the foreign corporation's first redetermination year reflecting a redetermination of the controlling domestic shareholder's U.S. tax liability for each such taxable year, in cases where a redetermination of the shareholder's U.S. tax liability for taxable years ending before the foreign corporation's last pooling year ends is not required under the rules in §§ 1.905-3T(d) and 1.905-5T;
(D) Filing amended returns as required under § 1.905-4 and this section with respect to each affected year before the controlling domestic shareholder's taxable year with or within which ends the foreign corporation's first redetermination year reflecting a redetermination of the controlling domestic shareholder's U.S. tax liability for each such taxable year, in cases where a redetermination of the shareholder's U.S. tax liability for taxable years ending before the foreign corporation's last pooling year ends is required under the rules in §§ 1.905-3T(d) and 1.905-5T and this section; and
(E) Providing any additional information required by applicable administrative pronouncements.
(ii)
Scope, duration, and effect of election.
An election under paragraph (e)(1) of this section with respect to the first redetermination year of a foreign corporation is binding on all persons who are, or were in a prior year to which the election applies, United States shareholders of the foreign corporation. In addition, such election applies to all foreign tax redeterminations in the first redetermination year and all subsequent taxable years of such foreign corporation and cannot be revoked. For foreign tax redeterminations that occur in taxable years after the first redetermination year, all United States shareholders of such foreign corporation must account for the foreign tax redeterminations under the rules in paragraph (e)(1) of this section by filing amended returns and providing other information as required by § 1.905-4 and paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(C) through (E) of this section.
(iii)
Requirements for valid election.
An election under paragraph (e)(1) of this section is valid only if all of the requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, including the requirement to provide notice under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section, are satisfied by each of the controlling domestic shareholders with respect to the first redetermination year.
(iv)
CFC group conformity requirement
—(A)
In general.
An election made under paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies to all controlled foreign corporations that are members of the same CFC group, and the rules in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section apply by reference to the CFC group. Therefore, an election by the controlling domestic shareholders of any controlled foreign corporation with respect to that controlled foreign corporation's first redetermination year also applies to foreign tax redeterminations of all members of the CFC group that includes that controlled foreign corporation, determined as of the close of that controlled foreign corporation's first redetermination year. The election is binding on all persons who are, or were in a prior year to which the election applies, United States shareholders of any member of the CFC group, applies with respect to foreign tax redeterminations of each member that occur in and after that member's first taxable year with or within which ends such controlled foreign corporation's first redetermination year, and cannot be revoked.
(B)
Determination of the CFC group
—(
1
)
Definition.
Subject to the rules in paragraphs (b)(2)(iv)(B)(
2
) and (
3
) of this section, the term
CFC group
means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) without regard to section 1504(b)(1) through (6), except that section 1504(a) is applied by substituting “more than 50 percent” for “at least 80 percent” each place it appears, and section 1504(a)(2)(A) is applied by substituting “or” for “and.” For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(B)(
1
), stock ownership is determined by applying the constructive ownership rules of
section 318(a), other than section 318(a)(3)(A) and (B), by applying section 318(a)(4) only to options (as defined in § 1.1504-4(d)) that are reasonably certain to be exercised as described in § 1.1504-4(g), and by substituting in section 318(a)(2)(C) “5 percent” for “50 percent.”
(
2
)
Member of a CFC group.
The determination of whether a controlled foreign corporation is included in a CFC group is made as of the close of the first redetermination year of any controlled foreign corporation for which an election is made under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. One or more controlled foreign corporations are members of a CFC group if the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(B)(
2
) of this section are satisfied as of the end of the first redetermination year of at least one of the controlled foreign corporations, even if the requirements are not satisfied as of the end of the first redetermination year of all controlled foreign corporations. If the controlling domestic shareholders do not have the same taxable year, the determination of whether a controlled foreign corporation is a member of a CFC group is made with respect to the first redetermination year that ends with or within the taxable year of the majority of the controlling domestic shareholders (determined based on voting power) or, if no such majority taxable year exists, the calendar year.
(
3
)
Controlled foreign corporations included in only one CFC group.
A controlled foreign corporation cannot be a member of more than one CFC group. If a controlled foreign corporation would be a member of more than one CFC group under paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(B)(
2
) of this section, then ownership of stock of the controlled foreign corporation is determined by applying paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(B)(
2
) of this section without regard to section 1504(a)(2)(B) or, if applicable, by reference to the ownership existing as of the end of the first redetermination year of a controlled foreign corporation that would cause a CFC group to exist.
(3)
Rules for successor entities.
All of the United States persons that own equity interests in a successor entity to a foreign corporation (“U.S. owners”) may elect under the principles of paragraph (e)(2) of this section to apply the rules in paragraph (e)(1) to foreign tax redeterminations of such foreign corporation that occur in taxable years of the successor entity that end with or within taxable years of its U.S. owners ending on or after November 2, 2020.
(f)
Applicability date.
This section applies to foreign tax redeterminations (as defined in § 1.905-3(a)) of foreign corporation and successor entities that occur in taxable years that end with or within taxable years of a United States shareholder or other United States persons ending on or after November 2, 2020, and that relate to taxable years of such foreign corporations beginning before January 1, 2018.

§ 1.907(a)-0
Introduction (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982).
(a)
Effective dates.
The provisions of §§ 1.907(a)-0 through 1.907(f)-1 apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982. For provisions that apply to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983, see §§ 1.907(a)-0A through 1.907(f)-1A.
(b)
Key terms.
For purposes of the regulations under section 907—
(1)
FOGEI
means foreign oil and gas extraction income.
(2)
FORI
means foreign oil related income.
(3)
FOGEI taxes
mean foreign oil and gas extraction taxes as defined in section 907(c)(5).
(4)
FORI taxes
means foreign taxes on foreign oil related income. See § 1.907(c)-3.
(c)
FOGEI tax limitation.
Section 907(a) limits the foreign tax credit for taxes paid or accrued on FOGEI. See § 1.907(a)-1.
(d)
Reduction of creditable FORI taxes.
Section 907(b) recharacterizes FORI taxes as non-creditable deductible expenses to the extent that the foreign law imposing the FORI taxes is structured, or in fact operates, so that the amount of tax imposed with respect to FORI will be materially greater, over a reasonable period of time, than the amount generally imposed on income that is neither FOGEI nor FORI. See § 1.907(b)-1.
(e)
FOGEI and FORI.
FOGEI includes the taxable income from the extraction of minerals from oil or gas wells by a taxpayer (or another person) and from the sale or exchange of assets used in the extraction business. FORI includes taxable income from the activities of processing oil and gas into their primary products, transporting or distributing oil and gas and their primary products, and from the disposition of assets used in these activities. For this purpose, a disposition includes only a sale or exchange. FOGEI and FORI may also include taxable income from the performance of related services or from the lease of related property and certain dividends, interest, or amounts described in section 951(a). See §§ 1.907(c)-1 through 1.907(c)-3.
(f)
Posted prices.
Certain sales prices are disregarded when computing FOGEI for purposes of chapter 1 of the Code. See § 1.907(d)-1.
(g)
Transitional rules.
Section 907(e) provides rules for the carryover of unused FOGEI taxes from taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983, and carryback of FOGEI taxes arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982. See § 1.907(e)-1.
(h)
Section 907(f) carrybacks and carryovers.
FOGEI taxes disallowed under section 907(a) may be carried back or forward to other taxable years. These FOGEI taxes may be absorbed in another taxable year to the extent of the lesser of the separate excess extraction limitation or the excess limitation in the general limitation category (section 904(d)(1)(I)) for the carryback or carryover year. See § 1.907(f)-1.
(i)
Statutes covered.
The regulations under section 907 are issued as a result of the enactment of section 601 of the Tax Reduction Act of 1975, of section 1035 of the Tax Reform Act of 1976, of section 301(b)(14) of the Revenue Act of 1978, of section 211 of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 and of section 1012(g)(6) (A)-(B) of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988.
[T.D. 8338, 56 FR 11065, Mar. 15, 1991]
§ 1.907(a)-1
Reduction in taxes paid on FOGEI (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982).
(a)
Amount of reduction.
FOGEI taxes are reduced by the amount by which they exceed a limitation level (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section).
(b)
Foreign taxes paid or accrued.
For purposes of the regulations under section 907—
(1)
Foreign taxes.
The term “foreign taxes” means income, war profits, or excess profits taxes of foreign countries or possessions of the United States otherwise creditable under section 901 (including those creditable by reason of section 903).
(2)
Foreign taxes paid or accrued.
The terms “foreign taxes paid or accrued,” “FOGEI taxes paid or accrued,” and
“FORI taxes paid or accrued” include foreign taxes deemed paid under sections 902 and 960. Unless otherwise expressly provided, these terms do not include foreign taxes deemed paid by reason of sections 904(c) and 907(f).
(c)
Limitation level
—(1)
In general.
The limitation level is FOGEI for the taxable year multiplied by the limitation percentage for that year.
(2)
Limitation percentage for corporations.
A corporation's limitation percentage is the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b) for the particular year.
(3)
Limitation percentage for individuals.
Section 907(a)(2)(B) provides that the limitation percentage for individual taxpayers is the effective rate of tax for those taxpayers. The effective rate of tax is computed by dividing the entire tax, before the credit under section 901(a) is taken, by the taxpayer's entire taxable income.
(4)
Losses.
(i) For purposes of determining whether income is FOGEI, a taxpayer's FOGEI will be recharacterized as foreign source non-FOGEI to the extent that FOGEI losses for preceding taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982, exceed the amount of FOGEI already recharacterized. See § 1.907(c)-1(c). However, taxes that were paid or accrued on the recharacterized FOGEI will remain FOGEI taxes.
(ii) Taxes paid or accrued by a person to a foreign country may be FOGEI taxes even though that person has under U.S. law a net operating loss from sources within that country.
(iii) For purposes of determining whether income is FOGEI, a taxpayer's income will be treated as income from sources outside the United States even though all or a portion of that income may be resourced as income from sources within the United States under section 904(f) (1) and (4).
(5)
Priority.
(i) Section 907(a) applies before section 908, relating to reduction of credit for participation in or cooperation with an international boycott.
(ii) Section 901(f) (relating to certain payments with respect to oil and gas not considered as taxes) applies before section 907.
(d)
Illustrations.
Paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
M, a U.S. corporation, uses the accrual method of accounting and the calendar year as its taxable year. For 1984, M has $20,000 of FOGEI, derived from operations in foreign countries X and Y, and has accrued $11,500 of foreign taxes with respect to FOGEI. The highest tax rate specified in section 11(b) for M's 1984 taxable year is 46 percent. Pursuant to section 907(a), M's FOGEI taxes limitation level for 1984 is $9,200 (46% × $20,000). The foreign taxes in excess of this limitation level ($2,300) may be carried back or forward. See section 907(f) and § 1.907(f)-1 and section 907(e) and § 1.907(e)-1.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that M is a partnership owned equally by U.S. citizens A and B who each file as unmarried individuals and do not itemize deductions. Pursuant to section 905(a), A and B have elected to credit foreign taxes in the year accrued. The total amount of foreign taxes accrued by A and B with respect to their distributive shares of M's FOGEI is $11,500 ($5,750 accrued by A and $5,750 accrued by B). A and B have no other FOGEI. A's only taxable income for 1984 is his 50% distributive share ($10,000) of M's FOGEI and A has a preliminary U.S. tax liability of $1,079. B has $112,130 of taxable income for 1984 (including his 50% distributive share ($10,000) of M's FOGEI) and has a preliminary U.S. tax liability of $44,000. Pursuant to section 907(a), A's FOGEI taxes limitation level for 1984 is $1,079 (($1,079/$10,000) × $10,000) and B's FOGEI taxes limitation level for 1984 is $3,924 (($44,000/$112,130) × $10,000).
(e)
Effect on other provisions
—(1)
Deduction denied.
If a credit is claimed under section 901, no deduction under section 164(a)(3) is allowed for the amount of the FOGEI taxes that exceed a taxpayer's limitation level for the taxable year. See section 275(a)(4)(A). Thus, FOGEI taxes disallowed under section 907(a) are not added to the cost or inventory amount of oil or gas.
(2)
Reduction inapplicable.
The reduction under section 907(a) does not apply to a taxpayer that deducts foreign taxes and does not claim the benefits of section 901 for a taxable year.
(3)
Section 78 dividend.
The reduction under section 907(a) has no effect on the amount of foreign taxes that are treated as dividends under section 78.
(f)
Section 904 limitation.
FOGEI taxes as reduced under section 907(a) are creditable only to the extent permitted
by the general limitation of section 904(d)(1)(I).

§ 1.907(b)-1
Reduction of creditable FORI taxes (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982).
If the foreign law imposing a FORI tax (as defined in § 1.907(c)-3) is either structured in a manner, or operates in a manner, so that the amount of tax imposed on FORI is generally materially greater than the tax imposed by the foreign law on income that is neither FORI nor FOGEI (“described manner”), section 907(b) provides a special rule which limits the amount of FORI taxes paid or accrued by a person to a foreign country which will be considered income, war profits, or excess profits taxes. Section 907(b) will apply to a person regardless of whether that person is a dual capacity taxpayer as defined in § 1.901-2(a)(2)(ii)(A). (In general, a dual capacity taxpayer is a person who pays an amount to a foreign country part of which is attributable to an income tax and the remainder of which is a payment for a specific economic benefit derived from that country.) Foreign law imposing a tax on FORI will be considered either to be structured in or to operate in the described manner only if, under the facts and circumstances, there has been a shifting of tax by the foreign country from a tax on FOGEI to a tax on FORI.
[T.D. 8338, 56 FR 11066, Mar. 15, 1991]
§ 1.907(c)-1
Definitions relating to FOGEI and FORI (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982).
(a)
Scope.
This section explains the meaning to be given certain terms and items in section 907(c) (1), (2), and (4). See also §§ 1.907(a)-0(b) and ­1.907(c)-2 for further definitions.
(b)
FOGEI
—(1)
General rule.
Under section 907(c)(1), FOGEI means taxable income (or loss) derived from sources outside the United States and its possessions from the extraction (by the taxpayer or any other person) of minerals from oil or gas wells located outside the United States and its possessions or from the sale or exchange of assets used by the taxpayer in the trade or business of extracting those minerals. Extraction of minerals from oil or gas wells will result in gross income from extraction in every case in which that person has an economic interest in the minerals in place. For other circumstances in which gross income from extraction may arise, see paragraph (b)(3) of this section. For determination of the amount of gross income from extraction, see paragraph (b)(2) of this section. For definition of the phrase “assets used by the taxpayer in the trade or business” and for rules relating to that type of FOGEI, see paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The term “minerals” is defined in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. For determination of taxable income, see paragraph (f)(2) of this section. FOGEI includes, in addition, items listed in section 907(c)(3) (relating to dividends, interest, partnership distributions, etc.) and explained in § 1.907(c)-2. For the reduction of what would otherwise be FOGEI by losses incurred in a prior year, see section 907(c)(4) and paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Amount.
The gross income from extraction is determined by reference to the fair market value of the minerals in the immediate vicinity of the well. Fair market value is determined under paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
(3)
Other circumstances.
Gross income from extraction or the sale or exchange of assets described in section 907(c)(1)(B) includes income from any arrangement, or a combination of arrangements or transactions, to the extent the income is in substance attributable to the extraction of minerals or such a sale or exchange. For instance, a person may have gross income from such a sale or exchange if the person purchased minerals from a foreign government at a discount and the discount reflects an arm's-length amount in consideration for the government's nationalization of assets that person owned and used in the extraction of minerals.
(4)
Income directly related to extraction.
Gross income from extraction includes directly related income under paragraph (g) of this section.
(5)
Income not included.
FOGEI as otherwise determined under this paragraph (b), nevertheless, does not include income to the extent attributable to marketing, distributing, processing
or transporting minerals or primary products. Income from the purchase and sale of minerals is not ordinarily FOGEI. If the foreign taxes paid or accrued in connection with income from a purchase and sale are not creditable by reason of section 901(f), that income is not FOGEI. A taxpayer to whom section 901(f) applies is not a producer.
(6)
Fair market value.
For purposes of this paragraph (b), the fair market value of oil or gas in the immediate vicinity of the well depends on all of the facts and circumstances as they exist relative to a party in any particular case. The facts and circumstances that may be taken into account include, but are not limited to, the following—
(i) The facts and circumstances pertaining to an independent market value (if any) in the immediate vicinity of the well,
(ii) The facts and circumstances pertaining to the relationships between the taxpayer and the foreign government. If an independent fair market value in the immediate vicinity of the well cannot be determined but fair market value at the port, or a similar point, in the foreign country can be determined (port price), an analysis of the arrangement between the taxpayer and the foreign government that retains a share of production could be evidence of the appropriate, arm's-length difference between the port price and the field price, and
(iii) The other facts and circumstances pertaining to any difference in the producing country between the field and port prices.
(7)
Economic interest.
For purposes of this paragraph (b), the term “economic interest” means an economic interest as defined in § 1.611-1(b)(1), whether or not a deduction for depletion is allowable under section 611.
(c)
Carryover of foreign oil extraction losses
—(1)
In general.
Pursuant to section 907(c)(4), the determination of FOGEI for a particular taxable year takes into account a foreign oil extraction loss incurred in prior taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982. There is no time limitation on this carryover of foreign oil extraction losses. Section 907(c)(4) does not provide for any carryback of these losses. Section 907(c)(4) operates solely for purposes of determining FOGEI and thus operates independently of section 904(f).
(2)
Reduction.
That portion of the income of the taxpayer for the taxable year which but for this paragraph (c) would be treated as FOGEI is reduced (but not below zero) by the excess of—
(i) The aggregate amount of foreign oil extraction losses for preceding taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982, over
(ii) The aggregate amount of reductions under this paragraph (c) for preceding taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982.
(3)
Foreign oil extraction loss defined
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term “foreign oil extraction loss” means the amount by which the gross income for the taxable year that is taken into account in determining FOGEI for that year is exceeded by the sum of the deductions properly allocated and apportioned to that gross income as determined under paragraph (f)(2) of this section). A person can have a foreign oil extraction loss for a taxable year even if the person has not chosen the benefits of section 901 for that year.
(ii)
Items not taken into account.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the following items are not taken into account—
(A) The net operating loss deduction allowable for the taxable year under section 172(a),
(B) Any foreign expropriation loss (as defined in section 172(h)) for the taxable year, and
(C) Any loss for the taxable year which arises from fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty, or from theft.
A loss mentioned in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) (B) or (C) of this section is taken into account, however, to the extent compensation (for instance by insurance) for the loss is included in gross income.
(4)
Affiliated groups.
The foreign oil extraction loss of an affiliated group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1504(a)) that files a consolidated return is determined on a group basis. If the group does not have a foreign oil extraction loss, the foreign oil extraction loss of a member of that group will not reduce on a separate basis that member's FOGEI for a later
taxable year. For special rules affecting the foreign oil extraction loss in the case of certain related domestic corporations that are not members of the same affiliated group, see section 904(i).
(5)
FOGEI taxes.
If FOGEI is reduced pursuant to this paragraph (c) (and thereby recharacterized as non-FOGEI income), any foreign taxes imposed on the FOGEI that is recharacterized as other income retain their character as FOGEI taxes. See section 907(c)(5).
(6)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (c) may be illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
X, a U.S. corporation using the accrual method of accounting and the calendar year as its taxable year, is engaged in extraction activities in three foreign countries. X has only the following combined foreign tax items for the three countries (prior to the application of this paragraph (c)) for 1983, 1984, and 1985:
1983
1984
1985
FOGEI
$(700)
$100
$450
FOGEI taxes

(500)
0
0
General limitation taxes other than FOGEI taxes
30
90
230
(ii)
1983.
Because X's FOGEI for 1983 is a loss of $(700), X's section 907(a) limitation for 1983 is $0 (.46 × $0). Thus, none of the FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1983 ($10) can be credited in 1983. They can, however, be carried back to 1981 or 1982 pursuant to the provisions of section 907(e)(2) and § 1.907(e)-1 and carried forward pursuant to the provisions of section 907(f) and § 1.907(f)-1.
(iii)
1984.
X's FOGEI for 1984, prior to the application of this paragraph (c), is $100. X has a foreign oil extraction loss for 1983 of $(500). This loss must be applied against X's preliminary FOGEI of $100 for 1984. Thus, X's FOGEI for 1984 is $0 and X has $(400) ($500−$100) of foreign oil extraction loss from 1983 to be carried to 1985. Since X's FOGEI for 1984 is $0, its section 907(a) limitation is $0 (.46 × $0). Therefore, none of the FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1984 ($60) can be credited in 1984. They can, however, be carried back pursuant to the provisions of section 907(e)(2) and § 1.907(e)-1 and carried forward pursuant to the provisions of section 907(f) and § 1.907(f)-1.
(iv)
1985.
X's FOGEI for 1985, prior to the application of this paragraph (c), is $450. X's remaining foreign oil extraction loss carryover from 1983 is $(400) and this must be applied against X's preliminary FOGEI of $450 for 1985. Thus, X's FOGEI for 1984 is $50 ($450−$400). X's section 907 (a) limitation is $23 (.46 × $50). Therefore, $23 of the FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1985, together with the other $230 of general limitation taxes, can be credited in 1985, subject to the general limitation of section 904(d)(1)(E) (as in effect prior to 1987). The excess of FOGEI taxes, $177 ($200−$23), can be carried back pursuant to the provisions of section 907(e)(2) and § 1.907(e)-1 and carried forward pursuant to the provisions of section 907(f) and § 1.907(f)-1.

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that X's paragraph (c)(3)(ii) items for 1983 allocable to FOGEI are $(800) instead of $(200). FOGEI remains a loss of $(700). Thus, X does not have a foreign oil extraction loss for 1983 because it has $100 of FOGEI when its paragraph (c)(3)(ii) items are not taken into account ($(700) + $800).
(ii)
1983.
The results are the same as in Example 1.
(iii)
1984.
Although X had FOGEI loss of $(700) in 1983, there is not a loss that can be carried forward after adjustment for paragraph (c)(3)(ii) items. Thus, X's FOGEI for 1984 is not reduced by the 1983 loss. X's section 907(a) limitation for 1984 is $46 (.46 × $100). Therefore, $46 of the FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1984, together with the other $90 of general limitation taxes, can be credited in 1984, subject to the general limitation of section 904(d)(1)(E) (as in effect prior to 1987). The excess of $14 ($60−$46) can be carried back to 1982 pursuant to the provisions of section 907(e)(2) and § 1.907(e)-1 and carried forward pursuant to the provisions of section 907(f) and § 1.907(f)-1.
(iv)
1985.
Since there is no foreign oil extraction loss for either 1983 or 1984 to be applied in 1985, X's FOGEI for 1985 is $450. Thus, its section 907(a) limitation for 1985 is $207 (.46 × $450) and all of its FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1985 ($200), together with the other $230 of general limitation taxes, can be credited in 1985, subject to the general limitation of section 904(d)(1)(E) (as in effect prior to 1987). FOGEI taxes in the amount of $10 from 1983 and $14 from 1984 may be carried forward to 1985 if they have not been used in carryback years. However, because the excess section 907(a) limitation for 1985 is only $7, that is the maximum potential FOGEI taxes from 1983 or 1984 that may be used in 1985.

# Example 3.
(i)
Facts.
Y, a U.S. corporation using the accrual method of accounting and the calendar year as its taxable year, is engaged in extraction activities in three foreign countries. Y's only foreign taxable income is income subject to the general limitation of section 904(d)(1)(E) (as in effect prior to 1987). Y has no paragraph (c)(3)(ii) items. Y has the following foreign tax items for 1983 and 1984:

(ii)
1983
—(A)
Section 907(a) limitation.
Because Y's FOGEI for 1983 is a loss of $(400), Y's section 907(a) limitation for 1983 is $0. Thus, none of the FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1983 ($10) can be credited in 1983. They can, however, be carried back to 1981 or 1982 pursuant to the provisions of section 907(e)(2) and § 1.907(e)-1 and carried forward pursuant to the provisions of section 907(f) and § 1.907(f)-1.
(B)
Section 904(d) fraction.
Y has a foreign loss of $(150) ($(400 + $250) for 1983. Thus, its fraction for purposes of determining its general limitation of section 904(d)(1)(E) is $0/$850.
(iii)
1984
—(A)
Section 907(a) limitation.
Y's foreign oil extraction loss for 1983 is $(400). Applying this loss to its preliminary FOGEI for 1984 ($300) eliminates all of Y's FOGEI for 1984. Because Y's FOGEI for 1984 is $0, its section 907(a) limitation is also $0. Thus, none of the FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1984 ($180) can be credited in 1984. They can, however, be carried back to 1982 pursuant to the provisions of section 907(e)(2) and § 1.907(e)-1 and carried forward pursuant to the provisions of section 907(f) and § 1.907(f)-1. Y has a remaining foreign oil extraction loss of $(100) from 1983 to be carried to 1985.
(B)
Section 904(d) fraction.
Y's preliminary foreign taxable income for purposes of determining its general limitation of section 904(d)(1)(E) is $500 ($300 + $200). However, Y has an overall foreign loss from 1983 of $(150) ($(400) + $250) and thus, pursuant to section 904(f), Y must recharacterize $150 (lesser of $150 or 50% of $500) of its 1984 foreign taxable income as U.S. taxable income. Thus, Y's fraction for purposes of determining its general limitation of section 904(d)(1)(E) for 1984 is $350/$1,600.

For 1983, Y has a section 904(d)(1)(E) overall foreign loss account of $50; see section 904(f) and § 1.904(f)-1(b).
(iii)
1984.
Because Y's FOGEI for 1984 is a loss of $(100), Y's section 907(a) limitation for 1984 is $0. Thus, none of the FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1984 ($10) can be credited in 1984. They can, however, be carried back under the provisions of section 907(e)(2) and § 1.907(e)-1 and carried forward under the provisions of section 907(f) and § 1.907(f)-1.
(iv)
1985.
Y's FOGEI loss of $(100) for 1984 is carried forward to 1985 and offsets FOGEI income in that amount in 1985. The entire section 904(d)(1)(E) overall foreign loss account of $50 is recaptured in 1985; therefore, Y has $75 of foreign source income and $50 of U.S. source income. However, Y has $125 of FOGEI since, for purposes of section 907(a), the $50 resourced by section 904(f) will be treated as income from sources outside the United States; see § 1.907(a)-1(c)(4)(iii). Accordingly, Y's section 907(a) limitation is $57.50 (.46 × $125). Y's section 904(d)(1)(E) limitation is, however, only $34.50 (.46 × $75). Thus, Y may claim a foreign tax credit of $34.50 in 1985. Y may carry back or carry forward $23 ($57.50-$34.50) and that amount is not subject to the section 907(a) limitation in the carry to year. In addition, $67.50 ($125−$57.50) may be carried back pursuant to the provisions of section 907(e)(2) and § 1.907(e)-1 and carried forward pursuant to the provisions of section 907(f) and § 1.907(f)-1. This amount is subject to the section 907(a) limitation in the carry to year.
(d)
FORI
—(1)
In general.
Section 907(c)(2) defines FORI to include taxable income from the processing of oil and gas into their primary products, from the transportation or distribution and sale of oil and gas and their primary products, from the disposition of assets used in these activities and from the performance of any other related service. FORI may also include, under section 907(c)(3), certain dividends, interest, or amounts described in section 951(a). This paragraph (d) defines certain terms and items applicable to FORI.
(2)
Transportation.
Gross income from transportation of minerals or primary products (“gross transportation income”) is gross income arising from carrying minerals or primary products between two places (including time or voyage charter hires) by any means of transportation, such as a vessel, pipeline, truck, railroad, or aircraft. Except for directly related income under paragraphs (d)(7) and (g) of this section, gross transportation income does
not include gross income received by a lessor from a bareboat charter hire of a means of transportation, certain other rental income, or income from the performance of certain services.
(3)
Distribution or sale.
The term “distribution or sale” means the sale or exchange of minerals or primary products to processors, users who purchase, store, or use in bulk quantities, other persons for further distribution, retailers, or consumers. Gross income from distribution or sale includes interest income attributable to the distribution of minerals or primary products on credit.
(4)
Processing.
The term “processing” means the destructive distillation, or a process similar in effect to destructive distillation, of crude oil and the processing of natural gas into their primary products including processes used to remove pollutants from crude oil or natural gas.
(5)
Primary product from oil.
The term “primary product” (in the case of oil) means all products derived from the processing of crude oil, including volatile products, light oils (such as motor fuel and kerosene), distillates (such as naphtha), lubricating oils, greases and waxes, and residues (such as fuel oil).
(6)
Primary product from gas.
The term “primary product” (in the case of gas) means all gas and associated hydrocarbon components from gas wells or oil wells, whether recovered at the lease or upon further processing, including natural gas, condensates, liquefiable petroleum gases (such as ethane, propane, and butane), and liquid products (such as natural gasoline).
(7)
Directly related income.
FORI also includes directly related income under paragraph (g) of this section.
(e)
Assets used in a trade or business
—(1)
In general.
The term “assets used by the taxpayer in the trade or business” in section 907(c) (1)(B) and (2)(D) means property primarily used in one or more of the trades or businesses that are section 907(c) activities. For purposes of this paragraph (e), assets used in a trade or business are assets described in section 1231(b) (applied without regard to any holding period or the character of the asset as being subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167).
(2)
Section 907(c) activities.
Section 907(c) activities are those described in section 907(c)(1)(A) (for FOGEI) or (c)(2) (A) through (C) (for FORI). If an asset is used primarily in one or more section 907(c) activities, then the entire gain (or loss) will be considered attributable to those activities. For example, if a person uses a service station primarily to distribute primary products from oil, then all of the gain (or loss) on the sale of the station is FORI even though the person uses the station to distribute products that are not primary products (such as tires or batteries). If an asset is not primarily used in one or more section 907(c) activities, then the entire gain or loss will not be FOGEI or FORI.
(3)
Stock.
Stock of any corporation (whether foreign or domestic) will not be treated as an asset used by a person in section 907(c) activities.
(4)
Losses on sale of stock.
If, under § 1.861-8(e)(7), a loss on the sale, exchange, or disposition of stock is considered a deduction which is definitely related and allocable to FOGEI or FORI, then notwithstanding § 1.861-8 (e)(7) and paragraph (f)(2) of this section, this loss shall be allocated and apportioned to the same class of income that would have been produced if there were capital gain from the sale, exchange or disposition.
(5)
Character of gain or loss.
Except in the case of stock, gain or loss from the sale, exchange or disposition of assets used in the trade or business may be FORI or FOGEI to the extent taken into account in computing taxable income for the taxable year, whether or not the gain or loss is ordinary income or ordinary loss.
(6)
Allocation of amount realized.
The amount realized from the sale, exchange or disposition of several assets in one transaction is allocated among them in proportion to their respective fair market values. This allocation is made under the principles set forth in § 1.1245-1(a)(5) (relating to allocation between section 1245 property and non-section 1245 property).
(7)
Interest.
Gross income from the sale, exchange or disposition of an asset used in a section 907(c) activity includes interest income from such a sale, exchange or disposition.
(f)
Terms and items common to FORI and FOGEI
—(1)
Minerals.
The term “minerals” means hydrocarbon minerals extracted from oil and gas wells, including crude oil or natural gas (as defined in section 613A(e)). The term includes incidental impurities from these wells, such as sulphur, nitrogen, or helium. The term does not include hydrocarbon minerals derived from shale oil or tar sands.
(2)
Taxable income.
Deductions to be taken into account in computing taxable income or net operating loss attributable to FOGEI or FORI are determined under the principles of § 1.861-8. For an exception with regard to losses, see paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
(3)
Interest on working capital.
FORI and FOGEI may include interest on bank deposits or on any other temporary investment which is not in excess of funds reasonably necessary to meet the working capital requirements and the specifically anticipated business needs of the person that is engaged in the conduct of the activities described in section 907(c) (1) or (2).
(4)
Exchange gain or loss.
Exchange gain (and loss) may be FORI and FOGEI. For taxable years beginning after 1986, exchange gain or loss from a section 988 transaction may be FORI or FOGEI only if directly related to the business needs (under the principles of section 954(c)(1)(D)) attributable to the conduct of the section 907(c) activity.
(5)
Allocation.
Interest income and exchange gain (or loss) described, respectively, in paragraph (f) (3) and (4) of this section are allocated among FORI, FOGEI, and any other class of income relevant for purposes of the foreign tax credit limitations under any reasonable method which is consistently applied from year-to-year.
(6)
Facts and circumstances.
Income not described elsewhere in this section may be FOGEI or FORI if, under the facts and circumstances in the particular case, the income is in substance directly attributable to the activities described in section 907(c) (1) or (2). For example, assume that a producer in the North Sea suffers a casualty caused by an explosion, fire, and resulting destruction of a drilling platform. Insurance proceeds received for the platform's destruction in excess of the producer's basis is extraction income if the excess constitutes income from sources outside the United States. In addition, income from an insurance policy for business interruption may be extraction income to the extent the payments under the policy are geared directly to the loss of income from production and are treated as income from sources outside the United States. Also, if an oil company's oil concession or assets used in extraction activities described in section 907(c)(1)(A) and located outside the United States are nationalized or expropriated by a foreign government, or instrumentality thereof, income derived from that nationalization or expropriation (including interest on the income paid pursuant to the nationalization or expropriation) is FOGEI. Likewise, if a company's assets used in the activities described in section 907(c)(2) (A) through (C) and located outside the United States are nationalized or expropriated by a foreign government, or instrumentality thereof, income (including interest on the income paid pursuant to the nationalization or expropriation) derived from the nationalization or expropriation will be FORI. Nationalization or expropriation is deemed to be a sale or exchange for purposes of section 907(c)(1)(B) and a disposition for purposes of section 907(c)(2)(D). In further example, assume that an oil company has an exclusive right to buy all the oil in country X from Y, an instrumentality of the foreign sovereign which owns all of the oil in X. The oil company does not have an economic interest in any oil in country X. Y has a temporary cash-flow problem and demands that the oil company make advance deposits for the purchase of oil not yet delivered. In return, Y grants the oil company a discount on the price of the oil when delivered. Income represented by the discount on the later disposition of the oil is FORI described in section 907(c)(2)(C). The result would be the same if Y credited the oil company with interest on the advance deposits, which had to be used to purchase oil (the interest income would be FORI).
(g)
Directly related income
—(1)
In general.
Section 907(c)(2)(E) and this paragraph (g) include in FORI, and this
paragraph (g) includes in FOGEI, income from the performance of directly related services (as defined in paragraph (g)(2) of this section). This paragraph (g) also includes in FORI and FOGEI income from the lease or license of related property (as defined in paragraph (g)(3) of this section). Section 907(c)(2)(E) with regard to FORI and this paragraph (g) with regard to both FORI and FOGEI do not apply to a person if—
(i) Neither that person nor a related person (as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) has FOGEI described in paragraph (b) of this section (other than paragraph (b)(4) of this section relating to directly related income) or FORI described in paragraph (d) of this section (other than paragraph (d)(7) of this section relating to directly related income), or
(ii) Less than 50 percent of that person's gross income from sources outside the United States which is related exclusively to the performance of services and from the lease or license of property described in paragraph (g) (2) and (3) of this section, respectively, is attributable to services performed for (or on behalf of), leases to, or licenses with, related persons, but
(iii) Paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section will not apply to a person if 50 percent or more of that person's total gross income from sources outside the United States is FOGEI and FORI (as both are described in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section).
A person described in paragraph (g)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section will, however, have directly related services income which is FOGEI if the income is so classified by reason of the income based on output test set forth in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
(2)
Directly related services
—(i)
FOGEI.
(A) Income from directly related services will be FOGEI, as that term is defined in paragraph (b)(1) and (3) of this section, if those services are directly related to the active conduct of extraction (including exploration) of minerals from oil and gas wells. Paragraph (b)(1) of this section provides that, in order to have extraction income, a person must have an economic interest in the minerals in place. However, paragraph (b)(3) of this section recognizes that income arising from “other circumstances” is extraction income if that income is in substance attributable to the extraction of minerals.
(B) An example of “other circumstances” under paragraph (b)(3) of this section is the “income based on output test.” This income based on output test provides that, if the amount of compensation paid or credited to a person for services is dependent on the amount of minerals discovered or extracted, the income of the person from the performance of the services will be directly related services income which is FOGEI. This test will apply whether or not the person performing the services has, or had, an economic interest in the minerals discovered or extracted.
(ii)
FORI.
With regard to the determination of directly related services income which is FORI, directly related services are those services directly related to the active conduct of the operations described in section 907(c)(2) (A) through (C). Those services include, for example, services performed in relation to the distribution of minerals or primary products or in connection with the operation of a refinery, or the types of services described in § 1.954-6(d) (other than § 1.954-6(d)(4) which relate to foreign base company shipping income.
(iii)
Recipient of the services.
Directly related services described in paragraph (g)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section may be performed for any person without regard to whether that person is a related person.
(iv)
Excluded services
—(A)
FOGEI.
Directly related services which produce FOGEI do not include insurance, accounting or managerial services.
(B)
FORI.
Directly related services which produce FORI do not, generally, include insurance, accounting or managerial services. These services will, however, produce FORI if they are performed by the person performing the operations described in section 907(c)(2) (A) through (C). For these purposes, insurance income which is FORI means taxable income as defined in section 832(a).
(3)
Leases and licenses.
A lease or license of related property is the lease or license of assets used (or held for use)
by the lessor, licensor, or another person (including the lessee or a sublessee) in the active conduct of the activities described in section 907 (c)(1)(A) or (c)(2) (A) through (C). The leases or licenses described in this paragraph (g)(3) include, for example, a lease of a means of transportation under a bareboat charter hire, of drilling equipment used in extraction operations, or the license of a patent, know-how, or similar intangible property used in extracting, transporting, distributing or processing minerals or primary products. This paragraph (g)(3) applies without regard to whether the parties are related persons.
(4)
Related person.
A person will be treated as a related person for purposes of this paragraph (g) if that person would be so treated within the meaning of section 954(d)(3) (as applied by substituting the word “corporation” for the word “controlled foreign corporation”) or that person is a partnership or partner described in section 707(b)(1).
(5)
Gross income.
A foreign corporation shall be treated as a domestic corporation for the purpose of applying the gross-income rules in paragraph (g)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section.
(h)
Coordination with other provisions
—(1)
Certain adjustments.
The character of income as FOGEI or FORI is determined before making any adjustment under section 482 or section 907(d). For example, assume that X and Y are related parties, Y's only income is from the sale of oil that Y purchased from X, and FOGEI from X is diverted to Y through an arrangement described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Accordingly, Y has FOGEI. If under section 482 the Commissioner reallocates the FOGEI from Y to X, then Y's remaining income represents only a profit from distributing the oil, and thus is FORI. If the foreign taxes paid by Y on this income are otherwise creditable under section 901, the foreign taxes that are not refunded to Y retain their characterization as FOGEI taxes.
(2)
Section 901(f).
Section 901(f) (relating to certain payments with respect to oil and gas not considered as taxes) applies before section 907. Taxes disallowed by section 901(f) are added to the cost or inventory amount of oil or gas.
[T.D. 8338, 56 FR 11067, Mar. 15, 1991]
§ 1.907(c)-2
Section 907(c)(3) items (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982).
(a)
Scope.
This section provides rules relating to certain items listed in section 907(c)(3). The rules of this section are expressed in terms of FORI but apply for determining FOGEI by substituting “FOGEI” for “FORI” whenever appropriate. FOGEI does not include interest described in section 907(c)(3)(A). Dividends paid prior to January 1, 1987, and described in section 907(c)(3)(B), as in effect prior to amendment by the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, are included in FORI and not FOGEI.
(b)
Dividend
—(1)
Section 1248 dividend.
A section 1248 dividend is a dividend described in section 907(c)(3)(A). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(1), gain (or loss) from the disposition of stock in any corporation is not FOGEI or FORI. See § 1.907(c)-1(e) (3) and (4).
(2)
Section 78 dividend.
A section 78 dividend is FORI to the extent it arises from a dividend described in section 907(c)(3)(A), or an amount described in section 907(c)(3)(C).
(c)
Taxes deemed paid
—(1)
Voting stock test.
Items described in section 907(c)(3) (A) or (C) are FORI only if a deemed-paid-tax test is met under the criteria of section 902 or 960. The purpose of this test is to require minimum direct or indirect ownership by a domestic corporation in the voting stock of a foreign corporation as a prerequisite for the item to qualify as FORI in the hands of the domestic corporation. The test is whether a domestic corporation would be deemed to pay any taxes of a foreign corporation when a dividend or an amount described in section 907(c)(3) (A) or (C), respectively, is included in the domestic corporation's gross income. In the case of interest described in section 907(c)(3)(A), the test is whether any taxes would be deemed paid if there were a hypothetical dividend.
(2)
Dividends and interest.
For purposes of section 907(c)(3)(A), a domestic corporation is deemed under section 902
to pay taxes in respect of dividends and interest received from a foreign corporation whether or not the foreign corporation:
(i) Actually pays or is deemed to pay taxes, or
(ii) In the case of interest, actually pays dividends.
This paragraph (c)(2) also applies to dividends received by a foreign corporation from a second-tier or third-tier foreign corporation (as defined in § 1.902-1(a)(3)(i) and (4), respectively). In the case of interest received by a foreign corporation from another foreign corporation, this paragraph (c)(2) applies if the taxes of both foreign corporations would be deemed paid under section 902 (a) or (b) for purposes of applying section 902(a) to the same taxpayer which is a domestic corporation. In the case of interest received by any corporation (whether foreign or domestic), all members of an affiliated group filing a consolidated return will be treated as the same taxpayer under section 907(c)(3)(A) if the foreign taxes of the payor and (if the recipient is a foreign corporation) the foreign taxes of the recipient would be deemed paid under section 902 by at least one member. The term “member” is defined in § 1.1502-1(b). Thus, for example, assume that P owns all of the stock of D1 and D2 and P. D1, and D2 are members of an affiliated group filing a consolidated return. Assume further that D1 owns all of the stock of F1 and D2 owns all of the stock of F2, where F1 and F2 are foreign corporations. Interest paid by F1 to P, D2, or F2 may be FORI.
(3)
Amounts included under section 951(a).
For purposes of section 907(c)(3)(C), a domestic corporation is deemed under section 960 to pay taxes in respect of a foreign corporation, whether or not the foreign corporation actually pays taxes on the amounts included in gross income under section 951(a).
(d)
Amount attributable to certain items
—(1)
Certain dividends
—(i)
General rule.
The portion of a dividend described in section 907(c)(3)(A) that is FORI equals—
Amount of dividend × a/b
a = FORI accumulated profits in excess of FORI taxes paid or accrued, and
b = Total accumulated profits in excess of total foreign taxes paid or accrued.
This paragraph (d)(1)(i) applies even though the FORI accumulated profits arose in a taxable year of a foreign corporation beginning before January 1, 1983. Determination of the FORI amount of dividends under this paragraph (d)(1)(i) must be made separately for FORI accumulated profits and total accumulated profits that arose in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987, and for FORI accumulated profits and total accumulated profits that arose in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986. Dividends are deemed to be paid first out of FORI and total accumulated profits that arose in table years beginning after December 31, 1986. With regard to FORI accumulated profits and total accumulated profits that arose in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, the portion of a dividend that is FORI equals—
Amount of dividend × a/b
a = Post-1986 undistributed FORI earnings determined under the principles of section 902(c)(1), and
b = Post-1986 undistributed earnings determined under the principles of section 902(c)(1).
(ii)
Cross-references.
See § 1.902-1(g) for the determination of a foreign corporation's earnings and profits and of those out of which a dividend is paid. See § 1.1248-2 or 1.1248-3 for the determination of the earnings and profits attributable to the sale or exchange of stock in certain foreign corporations.
(2)
Interest received from certain foreign corporations.
Interest described in section 907(c)(3)(A) is FORI to the extent the corresponding interest expense of the paying corporation is properly allocable and apportionable to the gross income of the paying corporation that would be FORI were that corporation a domestic corporation. This allocation and apportionment is made in a manner consistent with the rules of section 954(b)(5) and § 1.861-8(e)(2).
(3)
Dividends from domestic corporation.
The amount of a dividend from a corporation described in section 907(c)(3)(B), as in effect prior to amendment by the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, paid in a
taxable year of that corporation beginning before December 31, 1986, that is FORI is determined under the principles of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section with respect to its current earnings and profits under section 316(a)(2) or its accumulated earnings and profits under section 316(a)(1), as the case may be.
(4)
Amounts with respect to which taxes are deemed paid under section 906(a)
—(i)
Portion attributable to FORI.
The portion of an amount described in section 907(c)(3)(C) that is FORI equals:
EC07OC91.045
A = Amount described in section 907(c)(3)(C)
B = FORI earnings and profits
C = Total earnings and profits
For taxable years ending after January 23, 1989, the facts and circumstances will be used to determined what part of the amount of the section 907(c)(3)(C) amount is directly attributable to FOGEI, FORI and other income.
(ii)
Earnings and profits.
Total earnings and profits are those of the foreign corporation for a taxable year under section 964 and the regulations under that section.
(5)
Section 78 dividend.
The portion of a section 78 dividend that will be considered FORI will equal the amount of taxes deemed paid under either section 902(a) or section 960(a)(1) with respect to the dividend to the extent the taxes deemed paid are FORI taxes under § 1.907(c)-3 (b) or (c). See § 1.907(c)-3(a)(1).
(6)
Special rule.
(i) No item in the formula described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section includes amounts excluded from the gross income of a United States shareholder under section 959(a)(1).
(ii) With respect to a foreign corporation, earnings and profits in the formula described in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section do not include amounts excluded under section 959(b) from its gross income.
(7)
Deficits
—(i)
Allocation of deficits within a separate category.
In a taxable year in which a foreign corporation described in section 907(c)(3)(A) pays a dividend or has income that is subject to inclusion under section 951, if the foreign corporation has positive post—1986 undistributed earnings in a separate category but within that separate category there is a deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings attributable to earnings other than FOGEI and FORI, that deficit shall be allocated ratably between the FOGEI and FORI post-1986 undistributed earnings within that separate category. Any deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings attributable to either FOGEI or FORI shall be allocated first to FOGEI or FORI post-1986 undistributed earnings (as the case may be) to the extent thereof. Post-1986 undistributed FORI earnings are the post-1986 undistributed earnings (as defined in section 902 and the regulations under that section) attributable to FORI as defined in section 907(c) (2) and (3). Post-1986 undistributed FOGEI earnings are the post-1986 undistributed earnings (as defined in section 902 and the regulations under that section) attributable to FOGEI as defined in section 907(c) (1) and (3).

# Example.
Foreign corporation X for years 1987 and 1988 had the following undistributed earnings (none of which is income that is subject to inclusion under section 951) and foreign taxes:
Earnings
Taxes
FOGEI
$800
$400
FORI
(750)
Other
700
250
Total
$750
$650
On December 31, 1988, X paid a dividend of all of its post-1986 undistributed earnings to its sole shareholder Y. Under paragraph (d)(5) and (7)(i) of this section and § 1.907 (c)-2 (d)(5), $450 of Y's dividend is attributable to FOGEI ($50 from undistributed earnings plus a $400 section 78 dividend) and $950 is attributable to other earnings ($700 from undistributed earnings plus a $250 section 78 dividend).
(ii)
Deficits allocated among separate categories.
If a deficit in a separate category (“first separate category”) is allocated to another separate category (“second separate category”) under sections 902 and 960 pursuant to notice 88-71, 1988-2 CB 374 and the regulations under those sections, the following rules shall apply. Any deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings attributable to either FOGEI (or FORI) from
the first separate category shall be allocated to post-1986 undistributed earnings in the second separate category to the extent thereof in the following order:
(A) FOGEI (or FORI),
(B) FORI (or FOGEI), and
(C) Other income.
Any deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings attributable to other income from the first separate category shall be allocated first to other post-1986 undistributed earnings and then ratably to FOGEI and FORI post—1986 undistributed earnings in the second separate category.
(iii)
Pre-1987 deficits.
The amount of a dividend paid by a foreign corporation described in section 907(c)(3)(A) out of positive pre-1987 earnings that is attributable to FOGEI and FORI shall be determined in a manner similar to that used in paragraph (d)(7) (i) and (ii) of this section except that the determinations shall be made on an annual basis.
(8)
Illustrations.
The application of this paragraph (d) is illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
X, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of Y, a foreign corporation organized in country S. Y owns all of the stock of Z, a foreign corporation also organized in country S. Each corporation uses the calendar year as its taxable year. In 1983, Z has $150 of FOGEI earnings and profits and $250 of earnings and profits other than FOGEI or FORI. Assume that Z paid no taxes to S and X must include $100 in its gross income under section 951(a) with respect to Z. Under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, $37.50 of the amount described in section 951(a) is FOGEI ($100 × $150/$400). the remaining $62.50 of the section 951(a) amount represents other income.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that the taxable year in question is 1988. In addition, under the facts and circumstances, it is determined that of the $100 section 951(a) amount included in X's gross income, $30 is directly attributable to Z's FOGEI activity, $60 is directly attributable to Z's FORI activity and $10 is directly attributable to Z's other activity. Accordingly, under paragraph (d)(4)(i), $30 will be FOGEI and $60 will be FORI to X.

# Example 3.
(i) Assume the same facts as in
Example 1.
Assume further that, in 1983, Z distributes its entire earnings and profits ($400) to Y which consists of a dividend of $300 and a section 959(a)(1) distribution of $100. Y has no other earnings and profits during 1983. Assume that the dividend and distribution are not foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c). Y pays no taxes to S. In 1983, Y distributes its entire earnings and profits to X.
(ii) Under paragraphs (c)(2) and (d)(1)(i) of this section, Y has FOGEI of $112.50,
i.e.,
the amount of the dividend received by Y ($300) multiplied by the fraction described in paragraph (d)(1)(i). The numerator of the fraction is Z's FOGEI accumulated profits in excess of the FOGEI taxes paid ($112.50) and the denominator is Z's total accumulated profits in excess of total foreign taxes paid ($400) minus the amount excluded from Y's gross income under section 959(a)(1) ($100). The rule of paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section does not apply since X does not include any amount in its gross income under section 951(a) with respect to Y. If Y paid taxes to S, this paragraph (d) would apply to characterize those taxes as FOGEI taxes or other taxes. See § 1.907(c)-3(a)(8) and Example 2 (iii) under § 1.907(c)-3(e).
(iii) The distribution from Y to X is a dividend to the extent of $300,
i.e.,
the amount of the distribution ($400) minus the amount excluded from X's gross income under section 959(a)(1) ($100). Under paragraphs (d) (1)(i) and (6)(i) of this section, $112.50 of the dividend is FOGEI,
i.e.,
the amount of the dividend ($300) multiplied by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is $112.50,
i.e.,
the FOGEI accumulated profits of Y in excess of FOGEI taxes paid ($150) minus the FOGEI accumulated profits of Y in excess of FOGEI taxes paid excluded from X's gross income under section 959(a)(1) ($37.50). The denominator of the fraction is $300,
i.e.,
the total accumulated profits of Y in excess of taxes paid ($400) minus the amount excluded from X's gross income under section 959(a)(1) ($100).

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in Example 1 with the following modifications: In 1983, Z's only earnings and profits are FORI earnings and profits which are included in X's gross income under section 951(a). Z distributes its entire earnings and profits to Y. In 1983, Y has total earnings and profits of $100 without regard to the dividend from Z, $60 of which are FORI earnings and profits. Y also has $40 which is included in X's gross income under section 951(a). Under paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section, the dividend from Z is disregarded for purposes of applying paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section to the $40 included in X's gross income under section 951(a) with respect to Y. Accordingly, $24 of the amount described in section 951(a) is FORI ($40 × $60/$100). Had these circumstances existed in 1988, and if the $40 included in X's gross income under section 951(a) was directly attributable to FORI activity, all of that income would be FORI to X.
(e)
Dividends, interest, and other amounts from sources within a possession.
FORI includes the items listed in (A) and (C) to the extent attributable to FORI of a corporation that is created or organized in or under the laws of a possession of the United States.
(f)
Income from partnerships, trusts, etc.
FORI and FOGEI include a person's distributive share (determined under the principles of section 704) of the income of any partnership and amounts included in income under subchapter J of chapter 1 of the Code (relating to the taxation of trusts, estates, and beneficiaries) to the extent the income and amounts are attributable to FORI and FOGEI. For taxable years beginning after 1986, the principles of § 1.904-5 (h) and (i) shall be applied to determine whether (and to what extent) a person's distributive share is FORI and FOGEI. Thus, for example, a less-than-10 percent corporate partner's share of income of the partnership would generally be treated as passive income to the partner, and not as FORI or FOGEI, unless an exception under § 1.904-5 (h) and (i) applies.
[T.D. 8338, 56 FR 11071, Mar. 15, 1991]
§ 1.907(c)-3
FOGEI and FORI taxes (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982).
(a)
Tax characterization, allocation and apportionment
—(1)
Scope.
Paragraphs (a)(2) through (6) of this section provides rules for the characterization, allocation, and apportionment of the income taxes (other than withholding taxes) paid or accrued to a foreign country among FOGEI, FORI, and other income relevant for purposes of sections 907 and 904. Some of the rules in this section are expressed in terms of FOGEI taxes but they apply to FORI taxes by substituting “FORI taxes” for “FOGEI taxes” whenever appropriate. For the treatment of withholding taxes, see paragraph (a)(8) of this section. FOGEI taxes are determined without any reduction under section 907(a). In addition, determination of FOGEI taxes will not be affected by recharacterization of FOGEI by section 907(c)(4). See § 1.907(c)-1(c)(5). Foreign taxes will not be characterized as creditable FORI taxes if section 907(b) and § 1.907(b)-1 apply.
(2)
Three classes of income.
There are three classes of income: FOGEI, FORI, and other income.
(3)
More than one class in a foreign tax base.
If more than one class of income is taxed under one tax base under the law of a foreign country, the amount of pre-credit foreign tax for each base must be determined. This amount is the foreign taxes paid or accrued to that country for the base as increased by the tax credits (if any) which reduced those taxes and were allowed in the country for that tax. More than one class of income is taxed under the same base, if, under a foreign country's law, deductions from one class of income may reduce the income of any other class and the classes are subject to foreign tax at the same rates.
(4)
Allocation of tax within a base.
If more than one class of income is taxed under the same base under a foreign country's law, the pre-credit foreign tax for the base is apportioned to each class of income in proportion to the income of each class. Tax credits are than allocated (under paragraph (a)(6) of this section) to the apportioned pre-credit tax. Income of a class over the deductions allowed under foreign law for, and which are attributable to, that class.
(5)
Modified gross income.
Modified gross income is not necessarily the same as gross income as defined for purposes of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. Modified gross income is determined with reference to the foreign tax base for gross income (or its equivalent). However, the characterization of the base as a particular class of income is governed by general principles of U.S. tax law. Thus, for example—
(i) Gross income from extraction is the fair market value of oil or gas in the immediate vicinity of the well (as determined under § 1.907(c)-1(b)(6) (without any deductions)).
(ii) Whether cost of goods sold (or any other deduction) is a deduction from modified gross income and the amount of such a deduction is determined under foreign law.
(iii) Modified gross income includes items that are part of the foreign tax
base even though they are not gross income under U.S. law so long as the foreign taxes paid on the base constitute creditable taxes under section 901 (including taxes described in section 903). For example, if a foreign country imposes a tax (creditable under section 901) on a tax base that includes in small part a percentage of the value of a company's oil reserves in place, modified gross income from extraction includes such a percentage of value solely for purposes of making the tax allocation in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(iv) Modified gross income from extraction is increased for purposes of this paragraph (a)(5) by the entire excess of the posted price over fair market value if the foreign country uses a posted price system or other pricing arrangement described in section 907(d) in imposing its income tax.
(v) Modified gross income from FORI is that income attributable to the activities in sections 907(c)(2) (A) through (C) and (E).
(vi) Modified gross income for any class may not include gross income that is not subject to taxation by the foreign country.
(6)
Allocation of tax credits.
The foreign taxes paid or accrued on a particular class of income equals the precredit tax on the class reduced (but not below zero) by the credits allowed under foreign law against the foreign tax on the particular class. Any tax credit attributable to a class that is not allocated to that class is allocated to the other class in the base or, if there are three classes in the base, is apportioned ratably among the taxes paid or accrued on the other two classes (as reduced in accordance with the preceding sentence).
(7)
Withholding taxes.
Paragraph (a)(2) through (6) of this section does not apply to withholding taxes imposed by a foreign country. FOGEI taxes may include withholding taxes imposed with respect to a distribution from a corporation. The portion of the total withholding taxes on a distribution that constitutes FOGEI taxes is determined by the portion of the distribution that is FOGEI. In addition, FOGEI taxes may include taxes imposed on a distribution described in section 959(a)(1) or on amounts described in section 959(b). The portion of the total withholding taxes imposed on a distribution described in section 959(a)(1) or on amounts described in section 959(b) is determined by reference to the portion of the amount included in gross income under section 951(a) that was FOGEI.
(b)
Dividends—In general.
(i) FOGEI taxes deemed paid with respect to a dividend equal the total taxes deemed paid with respect to the dividend multiplied by the fraction:
FOGEI taxes paid or accrued by the payor/Total foreign taxes paid or accrued by the payor.
(ii) With regard to dividends received in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, FOGEI taxes deemed paid with respect to a dividend equal the total taxes deemed paid with respect to the portion of the dividend within a separate category multiplied by the fraction:
EC07OC91.046
(iii) This paragraph (b) applies to a dividend described in section 907(c)(3)(A) (including a section 1248 dividend) with reference to the particular taxable year or years of those accumulated profits out of which a dividend is paid. Determination of FOGEI taxes under this paragraph (b) must be made separately.
(A) For FOGEI taxes paid on FOGEI accumulated profits and total taxes paid on accumulated profits that arose
in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987, to which paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section applies, and
(B) For FOGEI taxes paid on FOGEI accumulated profits and total taxes paid on accumulated profits that arose in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, to which paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section applies.
For purposes of these determinations, dividends are deemed to be paid first out of FOGEI and total accumulated profits that arose in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986. See § 1.907(c)-2(d)(1)(i). See section 960(a)(3) and § 1.960-2 relating to distributions that are treated as dividends for purposes of section 902.
(2)
Section 78 dividend.
There are no FOGEI taxes with respect to section 78 dividends.
(c)
Includable amounts under section 951(a).
(1) FOGEI taxes deemed paid with respect to an amount includable in gross income under section 951(a) equal the total taxes deemed paid with respect to that amount multiplied by the fraction:
EC07OC91.047
(2) With regard to an amount includable in gross income under section 951(a) in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, FOGEI taxes deemed paid with respect to that amount equal the total taxes deemed paid with respect to that amount within a separate category multiplied by the fraction:
EC07OC91.048
Taxes in the fraction in this paragraph (c)(2) include only those foreign taxes that may be deemed paid under section 960(a) by reason of such inclusion. See §§ 1.960-1(c)(3) and 1.960-2(c).
(d)
Partnerships.
A partner's distributive share of the partnership's FOGEI taxes is determined under the principles of section 704.
(e)
Illustrations.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
X, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of Y, a foreign corporation organized in country S. Y owns all of the stock of Z, a foreign corporation organized in country T. Each corporation used the calendar year as its taxable year. In 1983, X includes in its gross income an amount described in section 951(a) with respect to Z. Assume that the taxes deemed paid under section 902(a) by X by reason of such an inclusion is $70. Assume further that Z paid total taxes of $120, $80 of which is FOGEI tax. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the FOGEI tax deemed paid is $46.67 (
i.e.,
$70 × $80/$120). This $46.67 is also FOGEI under § 1.907(c)-2(d)(5) because it must be included in X's gross income under section 78.

# Example 2.
(i) Assume the same facts as in Example 1. Assume further that in 1983, Z distributes its entire earnings and profits to Y. Y has no earnings and profits during 1983 other than this dividend. Y paid a tax of $50 to S. Assume that Y is deemed under section 902(b)(1) to pay $50 of the tax paid by Z which was not deemed paid by X under section 960(a)(1) in 1983. In 1983, Y distributes its entire earnings and profits to X. Assume that X is deemed under section 902(a) to pay $100 of the taxes actually paid, and deemed paid, by Y.
(ii) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies to characterize the $50 tax of Z that Y is deemed to pay under section 902(b)(1). Y is deemed to pay $33.33 of FOGEI tax,
i.e.,
the amount of the tax deemed paid by Y ($50) multiplied by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the amount of Z's FOGEI tax
($80) and the denominator is the total taxes paid by Z ($120).
(iii) Under paragraph (a)(8) of this section, a portion of the $50 tax actually paid by Y on the earnings and profits received from Z is FOGEI tax. The amount of tax actually paid by Y that is FOGEI tax depends on the amount of the distribution from Z that is FOGEI (see § 1.907(c)-2(d)(1) (i) and Example 2 (ii) under § 1.907(c)-2(d)(8)). This result does not depend upon whether a portion of the distribution from Z is described in section 959(b) and it follows even though a portion of Y's earnings and profits will be excluded from X's gross income under section 959(a)(1) when distributed by Y. Assume that $12.50 of the $50 tax actually paid by Y is FOGEI tax.
(iv) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, X is deemed to pay $45.83 of FOGEI tax by reason of the distribution from Y. This amount is determined by multiplying the total taxes deemed paid by X by reason of such distribution ($100) by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the FOGEI tax paid, and deemed paid, by Y ($45.83,
i.e.,
$33.33 under paragraph (ii) of this example plus $12.50 under paragraph (iii) of this example). The denominator of the fraction is the total taxes paid, and deemed paid, by Y ($100). This $45.83 is FOGEI under § 1.907(c)-2(d)(5) because it is included in X's gross income as a section 78 dividend.

# Example 3.
(i) X, a domestic corporation, has a concession with foreign country Y that gives it the exclusive right to extract and export the crude oil and natural gas owned by Y. The concession agreement and location of the oil and gas wells mandate that X construct a system of pipelines to transport the minerals that are extracted to a port where they are loaded onto tankers for export. X owns the transportation facilities. Y has an income tax system under which income from mineral operations is subject to a 50 percent tax rate. The taxation by Y of the mineral operations is a separate tax base under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Under this system, Y imposes the tax at the port prior to export and it establishes a posted price of $12 per barrel. Y also collects royalties of $1.44 per barrel (
i.e.,
12 percent of this posted price) which is deductible in computing the petroleum tax. Y also allows X deductible lifting costs of $.20 per barrel and deductible transporting costs of $.80 per barrel. Y does not allow any credits against the mineral tax. Assume that X does not have any income in Y other than the mineral income. (In 1983, X extracts, transports, and exports 10,000,000 barrels of crude oil, but for convenience, all computations are in terms of one barrel). X pays foreign taxes of $4.78 per barrel, computed as follows:
Sales
$12.00
Royalties
$1.44
Lifting
.20
Transporting
.80
2.44
(2.44)
Income base
9.56
Tax rate (percent)
.50
Tax
4.78
Assume that these taxes are creditable taxes under section 901, that the fair market value of the oil at the port is $10 per barrel, and that under § 1.907(c)-1(b)(6) fair market value in the immediate vicinity of the oil wells is $9 per barrel. Thus, at the port, the excess of posted price ($12) over fair market value ($10) is $2.
(ii) The $4.78 foreign tax paid to Y is allocated to FOGEI and FORI in accordance with the rules in paragraph (a)(2) through (5) of this section.
(iii) Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, FOGEI and FORI are subject to foreign taxation under one tax base. This foreign tax is allocated between FOGEI tax and FORI tax in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) and (5) of this section.
(iv) The modified gross income for FOGEI is $11,
i.e.,
fair market value in the immediate vicinity of the well ($9) plus the excess at the port of posted price over fair market value ($2). The modified gross income for FORI is $1,
i.e.,
value added to the oil beyond the well-head which is part of Y's tax base ($10-$9).
(v) The royalty deductions are all directly attributable to FOGEI.
(vi) Under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the income of each class is determined as follows:
FOGEI
FORI
Modified gross income
$11.00
$1.00
Deductions:
Royalties
1.44
0
Lifting
.20
0
Transporting
0
.80
Total
1.64
.80
Net Income
9.36
.20
(vii) Under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the total tax paid to Y is allocated to FOGEI and FORI in proportion to the income in each class. The calculation is as follows:
FOGEI tax = $4.78 × $9.36/$9.56 = $4.68
FORI tax = $4.78 × $0.20/$9.56 = $0.10
Thus, for the 10,000,000 barrels, the FOGEI tax is $46,800,000 and the FORI tax is $1,000,000.
(viii) The allocation under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, rather than the direct application of stated foreign tax rates to foreign-law taxable income in each class of income (which would produce the same results in the facts of this example), is necessary when a foreign country taxes more than one class of income under a progressive rate structure. See Example 4 in this paragraph (e).

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in Example 3 except that Y's tax is imposed at 40 percent for the first $20,000,000 of income and at 60 percent for all other income. The foreign taxes are allocated under paragraph (a)(4) of this section between FOGEI and FORI in the same manner as in paragraphs (vi) and (vii) of Example 3, as follows:
(1) Taxable income
$95,600,000
(2) Tax:
(a) 40% of $20,000,000
8,000,000
(b) 60% of $75,600,000
45,360,000
(c) Total tax
53,360,000
(3) FOGEI tax (line 2(c) × $9.36/$9.56)
52,243,680
(4) FORI tax (line 2(c) × $0.20/$9.56)
1,116,320

# Example 5.
Assume the same facts as in Example 3. Assume further that X refines the crude oil into primary products prior to export and Y imposes its tax on the basis of crude oil equivalences of $12 per barrel, rather than the value of the primary products, to establish port prices. Assume that this arrangement is a pricing arrangement described in section 907(d). Thus, Y does not tax the refinery income. The results are the same as in Example 3 even if $12 per barrel is equal to, more than, or less than, the value of the primary products at the port. See paragraph (a)(5)(vi) of this section.
[T.D. 8338, 56 FR 11073, Mar. 15, 1991]
§ 1.907(d)-1
Disregard of posted prices for purposes of chapter 1 of the Code (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982).
(a)
In general
—(1)
Scope.
Section 907(d) applies if a person has FOGEI from the—
(i) Acquisition (other than from a foreign government) or
(ii) Disposition of minerals at a posted price that differs from the fair market value at the time of the transaction. Also, if a seller (other than a foreign government) derives FOGEI upon a disposition described in the preceding sentence, section 907(d) applies to the acquisition by the purchaser whether or not the purchaser has FOGEI. Thus, section 907(d) may apply in determining a person's FORI.
(2)
Initial computation requirement.
If section 907(d) applies to any person, income on the transaction as initially reflected on the person's return shall be computed as if the transaction were effected at fair market value. This requirement applies the first time a person has taxable income derived from either the transaction or an item (such as a dividend described in section 907(c)(3)(A)) determined with reference to that income.
(3)
Burden of proof.
The taxpayer must be able to demonstrate the transaction as it actually occurred and the basis for reporting the transaction under the principles of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(4)
Related parties.
Section 907(d) (as a rule of characterization) applies whether or not the parties to the transaction are related. Thus, the excess of the posted price over the fair market value may never be taken into account in determining a person's FOGEI under section 907(a) but may be taken into account in determining a person's FORI.
(b)
Adjustments.
If a taxpayer does not comply with the initial requirement of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, adjustments under section 907(d) may be made only by the Commissioner in the same manner that section 482 is administered. Correlative and similar adjustments consistent with the substantive and procedural principles of section 482 and § 1.482-1(d) apply. However, section 907(d) is not a limitation on section 482. If a taxpayer disposing of minerals at a posted price does comply with the initial computation requirement of this section, adjustments and correlative and similar adjustments consistent with the substantive and procedural aspects of section 482 and § 1.482-1(d) shall apply, whether made on the return by the taxpayer or on a later audit. This paragraph (b) does not apply to an actual sale or exchange of minerals made between persons with respect to whom adjustments under section 482 would never apply (but see paragraph (a)(4) of this section).
(c)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section—
(1)
Foreign government.
The term
foreign government
means only the integral parts or controlled entities of a foreign sovereign and political subdivisions of a foreign country.
(2)
Minerals.
The term
minerals
has the same meaning as in § 1.907(c)-1(f)(1).
(3)
Posted price.
The term
posted price
means the price set by, or at the direction of, a foreign government to calculate income for purposes of its tax or at which minerals must be sold.
(4)
Other pricing arrangement.
The term
other pricing arrangement
in section 907(d) means a pricing arrangement having the effect of a posted price.
(5)
Fair market value.
The term
fair market value,
whether or not at the port prior to export, is determined in the same way that the wellhead price is determined under § 1.907(c)-1(b)(6).
[T.D. 8338, 56 FR 11075, Mar. 15, 1991]
§ 1.907(e)-1
[Reserved]
§ 1.907(f)-1
Carryback and carryover of credits disallowed by section 907(a) (for amounts carried between taxable years that each begin after December 31, 1982).
(a)
In general.
If a taxpayer chooses the benefits of section 901, any unused FOGEI tax paid or accrued in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1982, may be carried to the taxable years specified in section 907(f) under the carryback and carryover principles of this section § 1.904-2(b). See section 907(e) and § 1.907(e)-1 for transitional rules that apply to unused FOGEI taxes carried back or forward between a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1983, and a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1982.
(b)
Unused FOGEI tax
—(1)
In general.
The “unused FOGEI tax” for purposes of this section is the excess of the FOGEI taxes for a taxable year (year of origin) over that year's limitation level (as defined in § 1.907(a)-1(b)).
(2)
Year of origin.
The term “year of origin” in the regulations under section 904 corresponds to the term “unused credit year” under section 907(f).
(c)
Tax deemed paid or accrued.
The unused FOGEI tax from a year of origin that may be deemed paid or accrued under section 907(f) in any preceding or succeeding taxable year (“excess limitation year”) may not exceed the lesser of—
(1) The excess extraction limitation for the excess limitation year, or
(2) The excess general section 904 limitation for the excess limitation year.
(d)
Excess extraction limitation.
Under section 907(f)(2)(A), the “excess extraction limitation” for an excess limitation year is the amount by which that year's section 907(a) extraction limitation exceeds the sum of—
(1) The FOGEI taxes paid or accrued, and
(2) The FOGEI taxes deemed paid or accrued in that year by reason of a section 907(f) carryback or carryover from preceding years of origin.
(e)
Excess general section 904 limitation.
Under section 907(f)(2)(B), the “excess general section 904 limitation” for an excess limitation year is the amount by which that year's section 904 general limitation exceeds the sum of—
(1) The general limitation taxes paid or accrued (or deemed to have been paid under section 902 or 960) to all foreign countries and possessions of the United States during the taxable year,
(2) The general limitation taxes deemed paid or accrued in such taxable year under section 904(c) and which are attributable to taxable years preceding the unused credit year, plus
(3) The FOGEI taxes deemed paid or accrued in that year by reason of a section 907(f) carryover (or carryback) from preceding years of origin.
(f)
Section 907(f) priority.
If a taxable year is a year of origin under both section 907(f) and section 904(c), section 907(f) applies first. See section 907(f)(3)(A).
(g)
Cross-reference.
In computing the carryback and carryover of disallowed credits under section 907(f), the principles of § 1.904-2 (d), (e), and (f) apply.
(h)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of section 907(f).

# Example.
X, a U.S. corporation organized on January 1, 1983, uses the accrual method of accounting and the calendar year as its taxable year. X's only income is income which is not subject to a separate tax limitation under section 904(d). X's preliminary U.S. tax liability indicates an effective rate of 46% for taxable years 1983-1985. X has the following foreign tax items for 1983-1985:
1983

0
400
X has unused 1983 FOGEI taxes of $600. Since the excess section 907(a) limitation for 1984 is zero, the unused FOGEI taxes are carried to 1985. Of the $600 carryover, $400 is deemed accrued in 1985 and the balance of $200 is carried to following years (but not to a year after 1988). After the carryover from 1983 to 1985, the excess section 904 general limitation for 1985 (line 8(b)) is reduced by $400 to $1,600 to reflect the amount of 1983 FOGEI taxes deemed accrued in 1985 under section 907(f).
