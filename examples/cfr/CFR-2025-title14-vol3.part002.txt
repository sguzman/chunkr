G135.2.7
Fuel Requirements.
No person may dispatch or release for flight an ETOPS flight unless, considering wind and other weather conditions expected, it has the fuel otherwise required by this part and enough fuel to satisfy each of the following requirements:
(a)
Fuel to fly to an ETOPS Alternate Airport.
(1) Fuel to account for rapid decompression and engine failure. The airplane must carry the greater of the following amounts of fuel:
(i) Fuel sufficient to fly to an ETOPS Alternate Airport assuming a rapid decompression at the most critical point followed by descent to a safe altitude in compliance with the oxygen supply requirements of § 135.157;
(ii) Fuel sufficient to fly to an ETOPS Alternate Airport (at the one-engine-inoperative cruise speed under standard conditions in still air) assuming a rapid decompression and a simultaneous engine failure at the most critical point followed by descent to a safe altitude in compliance with the oxygen requirements of § 135.157; or
(iii) Fuel sufficient to fly to an ETOPS Alternate Airport (at the one-engine-inoperative cruise speed under standard conditions in still air) assuming an engine failure at the most critical point followed by descent to the one engine inoperative cruise altitude.
(2) Fuel to account for errors in wind forecasting. In calculating the amount of fuel required by paragraph G135.2.7(a)(1) of this appendix, the certificate holder must increase the actual forecast wind speed by 5% (resulting in an increase in headwind or a decrease in tailwind) to account for any potential errors in wind forecasting. If a certificate holder is not using the actual forecast wind based on a wind model accepted by the FAA, the airplane must carry additional fuel equal to 5% of the fuel required by paragraph G135.2.7(a) of this appendix, as reserve fuel to allow for errors in wind data.
(3) Fuel to account for icing. In calculating the amount of fuel required by paragraph G135.2.7(a)(1) of this appendix, (after completing the wind calculation in G135.2.7(a)(2) of this appendix), the certificate holder must ensure that the airplane carries the greater of the following amounts of fuel in anticipation of possible icing during the diversion:
(i) Fuel that would be burned as a result of airframe icing during 10 percent of the time icing is forecast (including the fuel used by engine and wing anti-ice during this period).
(ii) Fuel that would be used for engine anti-ice, and if appropriate wing anti-ice, for the entire time during which icing is forecast.
(4) Fuel to account for engine deterioration. In calculating the amount of fuel required by paragraph G135.2.7(a)(1) of this appendix (after completing the wind calculation in paragraph G135.2.7(a)(2) of this appendix), the certificate holder must ensure the airplane also carries fuel equal to 5% of the fuel specified above, to account for deterioration in cruise fuel burn performance unless the certificate holder has a program to monitor airplane in-service deterioration to cruise fuel burn performance.
(b)
Fuel to account for holding, approach, and landing.
In addition to the fuel required by paragraph G135.2.7 (a) of this appendix, the airplane must carry fuel sufficient to hold at 1500 feet above field elevation for 15 minutes upon reaching the ETOPS Alternate Airport and then conduct an instrument approach and land.
(c)
Fuel to account for APU use.
If an APU is a required power source, the certificate holder must account for its fuel consumption during the appropriate phases of flight.
G135.2.8
Maintenance Program Requirements.
In order to conduct an ETOPS flight under § 135.364, each certificate holder must develop and comply with the ETOPS maintenance program as authorized in the certificate holder's operations specifications for each two-engine airplane-engine combination used in ETOPS.

(c) This subpart does not apply to operations conducted in balloons, gliders (powered and un-powered), parachutes (powered and un-powered), gyroplanes, or airships.
(d) For the purposes of this subpart the following definitions apply:
Commercial air tour
means a flight conducted for compensation or hire in an airplane, powered-lift, or rotorcraft where a purpose of the flight is sightseeing. The FAA may consider the following factors in determining whether a flight is a commercial air tour for purposes of this subpart:
(i) Whether there was a holding out to the public of willingness to conduct a sightseeing flight for compensation or hire;
(ii) Whether the person offering the flight provided a narrative that referred to areas or points of interest on the surface below the route of the flight;
(iii) The area of operation;
(iv) How often the person offering the flight conducts such flights;
(v) The route of the flight;
(vi) The inclusion of sightseeing flights as part of any travel arrangement package;
(vii) Whether the flight in question would have been canceled based on poor visibility of the surface below the route of the flight; and
(viii) Any other factors that the FAA considers appropriate.
Commercial Air Tour operator
means any person who conducts a commercial air tour.
Life preserver
means a flotation device used by an aircraft occupant if the aircraft ditches in water. If an inflatable device, it must be un-inflated and ready for its intended use once inflated. In evaluating whether a non-inflatable life preserver is acceptable to the FAA, the operator must demonstrate to the FAA that such a preserver can be used during an evacuation and will allow all passengers to exit the aircraft without blocking the exit. Each occupant must have the physical capacity to wear and inflate the type of device used once briefed by the commercial air tour operator. Seat cushions do not meet this definition.
Raw terrain
means any area on the surface, including water, devoid of any person, structure, vehicle, or vessel.
Shoreline
means that area of the land adjacent to the water of an ocean, sea,
lake, pond, river or tidal basin that is above the high water mark and excludes land areas unsuitable for landing such as vertical cliffs or land intermittently under water during the particular flight.
Suitable landing area for rotorcraft
means an area that provides the operator reasonable capability to land in an emergency without causing serious injury to persons. These suitable landing areas must be site specific, designated by the operator, and accepted by the FAA.
(e) In an in-flight emergency requiring immediate action, the pilot in command may deviate from any rule of this subpart to the extent required to meet that emergency.

(b) No person may operate an aircraft over a congested area except in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph.
(1) Prior written approval must be obtained from the appropriate official or governing body of the political subdivision over which the operations are conducted.
(2) Notice of the intended operation must be given to the public by some effective means, such as daily newspapers, radio, television, or door-to-door notice.
(3) A plan for each complete operation must be submitted to, and approved by appropriate personnel of the responsible Flight Standards office for the area where the operation is to be conducted. The plan must include consideration of obstructions to flight; the emergency landing capabilities of the aircraft to be used; and any necessary coordination with air traffic control.
(4) Single engine aircraft must be operated as follows:
(i) Except for helicopters, no person may take off a loaded aircraft, or make a turnaround over a congested area.
(ii) No person may operate an aircraft over a congested area below the altitudes prescribed in part 91 of this chapter except during the actual dispensing operation, including the approaches and departures necessary for that operation.
(iii) No person may operate an aircraft over a congested area during the actual dispensing operation, including the approaches and departures for that operation, unless it is operated in a pattern and at such an altitude that the aircraft can land, in an emergency, without endangering persons or property on the surface.
(5) Multiengine aircraft must be operated as follows:
(i) No person may take off a multiengine airplane over a congested area except under conditions that will allow the airplane to be brought to a safe stop within the effective length of the runway from any point on takeoff up to the time of attaining, with all engines operating at normal takeoff power, 105 percent of the minimum control speed with the critical engine inoperative in the takeoff configuration or 115 percent of the power-off stall speed in the takeoff configuration, whichever is greater, as shown by the accelerate stop distance data. In applying this requirement, takeoff data is based upon still-air conditions, and no correction is made for any uphill gradient of 1 percent or less when the percentage is measured as the difference between elevation at the end points of the runway divided by the total length. For uphill gradients greater than 1 percent, the effective
takeoff length of the runway is reduced 20 percent for each 1-percent grade.
(ii) No person may operate a multiengine airplane at a weight greater than the weight that, with the critical engine inoperative, would permit a rate of climb of at least 50 feet per minute at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet above the elevation of the highest ground or obstruction within the area to be worked or at an altitude of 5,000 feet, whichever is higher. For the purposes of this subdivision, it is assumed that the propeller of the inoperative engine is in the minimum drag position; that the wing flaps and landing gear are in the most favorable positions; and that the remaining engine or engines are operating at the maximum continuous power available.
(iii) No person may operate any multiengine aircraft over a congested area below the altitudes prescribed in part 91 of this chapter except during the actual dispensing operation, including the approaches, departures, and turnarounds necessary for that operation.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 150.1
Scope and purpose.
This part prescribes the procedures, standards, and methodology governing the development, submission, and review of airport noise exposure maps and airport noise compatibility programs, including the process for evaluating and approving or disapproving those programs. It prescribes single systems for—(a) measuring noise at airports and surrounding areas that generally provides a highly reliable relationship between projected noise exposure and surveyed reaction of people to noise; and (b) determining exposure of individuals to noise that results from the operations of an airport. This part also identifies those land uses which are normally compatible with various levels of exposure to noise by individuals. It provides technical assistance to airport operators, in conjunction with other local, State, and Federal authorities, to prepare and execute appropriate noise compatibility planning and implementation programs.
§ 150.3
Applicability.
This part applies to the airport noise compatibility planning activities of the operators of “public use airports,” including heliports, as that term is used in section 47501(2) as amended (49 U.S.C. 47501
et seq.
) and as defined in section 47102(17) of 49 U.S.C.
[Docket FAA-2004-19158, 69 FR 57625, Sept. 24, 2004]
§ 150.5
Limitations of this part.
(a) Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 47501
et seq.,
this part provides for airport noise compatibility planning and land use programs necessary to the purposes of those provisions. No submittal of a map, or approval or disapproval, in whole or part, of any map or program submitted under this part is a determination concerning the acceptability or unacceptability of that land use under Federal, State, or local law.
(b) Approval of a noise compatibility program under this part is neither a commitment by the FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program, nor a determination that all measures covered by the program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA.
(c) Approval of a noise compatibility program under this part does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for Federal action or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action, pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332
et seq.
) and guidelines.
(d) Acceptance of a noise exposure map does not constitute an FAA determination that any specific parcel of land lies within a particular noise contour. Responsibility for interpretation of the effects of noise contours upon subjacent land uses, including the relationship between noise contours and specific properties, rests with the sponsor or with other state or local government.

# Subpart B—Development of Noise Exposure Maps and Noise Compatibility Programs
§ 150.21
Noise exposure maps and related descriptions.
(a) Each airport operator may after completion of the consultations and public procedure specified under paragraph (b) of this section submit to the Regional Airports Division Manager five copies of the noise exposure map (or revised map) which identifies each noncompatible land use in each area depicted on the map, as of the date of submission, and five copies of a map each with accompanying documentation setting forth—
(1) The noise exposure based on forecast aircraft operations at the airport for a forecast period that is at least 5 years in the future, beginning after the date of submission (based on reasonable assumptions concerning future type and frequency of aircraft operations, number of nighttime operations, flight patterns, airport layout including any planned airport development, planned land use changes, and demographic changes in the surrounding areas); and
(2) The nature and extent, if any, to which those forecast operations will affect the compatibility and land uses depicted on the map.
(b) Each map, and related documentation submitted under this section must be developed and prepared in accordance with appendix A of this part, or an FAA approved equivalent, and in consultation with states, and public agencies and planning agencies whose area, or any portion of whose area, of jurisdiction is within the L
dn
65 dB contour depicted on the map, FAA regional officials, and other Federal officials having local responsibility for land uses depicted on the map. This consultation must include regular aeronautical users of the airport. The airport operator shall certify that it has afforded interested persons adequate opportunity to submit their views, data, and comments concerning the correctness and adequacy of the draft noise exposure map and descriptions of forecast aircraft operations. Each map and revised map must be accompanied by documentation describing the consultation accomplished under this paragraph and the opportunities afforded the public to review and comment during the development of the map. One copy of all written comments received during consultation shall also be filed with the Regional Airports Division Manager.
(c) The Regional Airports Division Manager acknowledges receipt of noise exposure maps and descriptions and indicates whether they are in compliance with the applicable requirements. The Regional Airports Division Manager publishes in the
Federal Register
a notice of compliance for each such noise exposure map and description, identifying the airport involved. Such notice includes information as to when
and where the map and related documentation are available for public inspection.
(d) The airport operator shall, in accordance with this section, promptly prepare and submit a revised noise exposure map.
(1) If, after submission of a noise exposure map under paragraph (a) of this section, any change in the operation of the airport would create any “substantial, new noncompatible use” in any area depicted on the map beyond that which is forecast for a period of at least five years after the date of submission, the airport operator shall, in accordance with this section, promptly prepare and submit a revised noise exposure map. A change in the operation of an airport creates a substantial new noncompatible use if that change results in an increase in the yearly day-night average sound level of 1.5 dB or greater in either a land area which was formerly compatible but is thereby made noncompatible under Appendix A (Table 1), or in a land area which was previously determined to be noncompatible under that Table and whose noncompatibility is now significantly increased.
(2) If, after submission of a noise exposure map under paragraph (a) of this section, any change in the operation of the airport would significantly reduce noise over existing noncompatible uses that is not reflected in either the existing conditions or forecast noise exposure map on file with the FAA, the airport operator shall, in accordance with this section, promptly prepare and submit a revised noise exposure map. A change in the operation of the airport creates a significant reduction in noise over existing noncompatible uses if that change results in a decrease in the yearly day-night average sound level of 1.5 dB or greater in a land area which was formerly noncompatible but is thereby made compatible under Appendix A (Table 1).
(3) Such updating of the map shall include a reassessment of those areas excluded under section A150.101(e)(5) of Appendix A because of high ambient noise levels.
(4) If the forecast map is based on assumptions involving recommendations in a noise compatibility program which are subsequently disapproved by the FAA, a revised map must be submitted if revised assumptions would create a substantial, new noncompatible use not indicated on the forecast map. Revised noise exposure maps are subject to the same requirements and procedures as initial submissions of noise exposure maps under this part.
(e) Each map, or revised map, and description of consultation and opportunity for public comment, submitted to the FAA, must be certified as true and complete under penalty of 18 U.S.C. 1001.
(f)(1) Title 49, section 47506 provides that no person who acquires property or an interest therein after the date of enactment of the Act in an area surrounding an airport with respect to which a noise exposure map has been submitted under section 47503 of the Act shall be entitled to recover damages with respect to the noise attributable to such airport if such person had actual or constructive knowledge of the existence of such noise exposure map unless, in addition to any other elements for recovery of damages, such person can show that—
No person who acquires property or an interest therein after the date of enactment of the Act in an area surrounding an airport with respect to which a noise exposure map has been submitted under section 103 of the Act shall be entitled to recover damages with respect to the noise attributable to such airport if such person had actual or constructive knowledge of the existence of such noise exposure map unless, in addition to any other elements for recovery of damages, such person can show that—
(i) A significant change in the type or frequency of aircraft operations at the airport; or
(ii) A significant change in the airport layout; or
(iii) A significant change in the flight patterns; or
(iv) A significant increase in nighttime operations; occurred after the date of the acquisition of such property or interest therein and that the damages for which recovery is sought have resulted from any such change or increase.”
(f)(2) Title 49 section 47506(b) further provides:
That for this purpose, “constructive knowledge” shall be imputed, at a minimum, to
any person who acquires property or an interest therein in an area surrounding an airport after the date of enactment of the Act if—
(i) Prior to the date of such acquisition, notice of the existence of a noise exposure map for such area was published at least three times in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which such property is located; or
(ii) A copy of such noise exposure map is furnished to such person at the time of such acquisition.
(g) For this purpose, the term
significant
in paragraph (f) of this section means that change or increase in one or more of the four factors which results in a “substantial new noncompatible use” as defined in § 150.21(d), affecting the property in issue. Responsibility for applying or interpreting this provision with respect to specific properties rests with local government.
[Docket 18691, 49 FR 49269, Dec. 1, 1984; 50 FR 5063, Feb. 6, 1985; Amdt. 150-2, 54 FR 39295, Sept. 25, 1989; Amdt. 150-4, 69 FR 57626, Sept. 24, 2004]
§ 150.23
Noise compatibility programs.
(a) Any airport operator who has submitted an acceptable noise exposure map under § 150.21 may, after FAA notice of acceptability and other consultation and public procedure specified under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, as applicable, submit to the Regional Airports Division Manager five copies of a noise compatibility program.
(b) An airport operator may submit the noise compatibility program at the same time as the noise exposure map. In this case, the Regional Airports Division Manager will not begin the statutory 180-day review period (for the program) until after FAA reviews the noise exposure map and finds that it and its supporting documentation are in compliance with the applicable requirements.
(c) Each noise compatibility program must be developed and prepared in accordance with appendix B of this part, or an FAA approved equivalent, and in consultation with FAA regional officials, the officials of the state and of any public agencies and planning agencies whose area, or any portion or whose area, of jurisdiction within the L
dn
65 dB noise contours is depicted on the noise exposure map, and other Federal officials having local responsibility of land uses depicted on the map. Consultation with FAA regional officials shall include, to the extent practicable, informal agreement from FAA on proposed new or modified flight procedures. For air carrier airports, consultation must include any air carriers and, to the extent practicable, other aircraft operators using the airport. For other airports, consultation must include, to the extent practicable, aircraft operators using the airport.
(d) Prior to and during the development of a program, and prior to submission of the resulting draft program to the FAA, the airport operator shall afford adequate opportunity for the active and direct participation of the States, public agencies and planning agencies in the areas surrounding the airport, aeronautical users of the airport, the airport operator, and the general public to submit their views, data, and comments on the formulation and adequacy of that program. Prior to submitting the program to the FAA, the airport operator shall also provide notice and the opportunity for a public hearing.
(e) Each noise compatibility program submitted to the FAA must consist of at least the following:
(1) A copy of the noise exposure map and its supporting documentation as found in compliance with the applicable requirements by the FAA, per § 150.21(c).
(2) A description and analysis of the alternative measures considered by the airport operator in developing the program, together with a discussion of why each rejected measure was not included in the program.
(3) Program measures proposed to reduce or eliminate present and future noncompatible land uses and a description of the relative contribution of each of the proposed measures to the overall effectiveness of the program.
(4) A description of public participation and the consultation with officials of public agencies and planning agencies in areas surrounding the airport, FAA regional officials and other Federal officials having local responsibility for land uses depicted on the
map, any air carriers and other users of the airport.
(5) The actual or anticipated effect of the program on reducing noise exposure to individuals and noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible uses within the area covered by the noise exposure map. The effects must be based on expressed assumptions concerning the type and frequency of aircraft operations, number of nighttime operations, flight patterns, airport layout including planned airport development, planned land use changes, and demographic changes within the L
dn
65 dB noise contours.
(6) A description of how the proposed future actions may change any noise control or compatibility plans or actions previously adopted by the airport proprietor.
(7) A summary of the comments at any public hearing on the program and a copy of all written material submitted to the operator under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, together with the operator's response and disposition of those comments and materials to demonstrate the program is feasible and reasonably consistent with obtaining the objectives of airport noise compatibility planning under this part.
(8) The period covered by the program, the schedule for implementation of the program, the persons responsible for implementation of each measure in the program, and, for each measure, documentation supporting the feasibility of implementation, including any essential governmental actions, costs, and anticipated sources of funding, that will demonstrate that the program is reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of airport noise compatibility planning under this part.
(9) Provision for revising the program if made necessary by revision of the noise exposure map.

# Subpart C—Evaluations and Determinations of Effects of Noise Compatibility Programs
§ 150.31
Preliminary review: Acknowledgments.
(a) Upon receipt of a noise compatibility program submitted under § 150.23, the Regional Airports Division Manager acknowledges to the airport operator receipt of the program and conducts a preliminary review of the submission.
(b) If, based on the preliminary review, the Regional Airports Division Manager finds that the submission does not conform to the requirements of this part, he disapproves and returns the unacceptable program to the airport operator for reconsideration and development of a program in accordance with this part.
(c) If, based on the preliminary review, the Regional Airports Division Manager finds that the program conforms to the requirements of this part, the Regional Airports Division Manager publishes in the
Federal Register
a notice of receipt of the program for comment which indicates the following:
(1) The airport covered by the program, and the date of receipt.
(2) The availability of the program for examination in the offices of the Regional Airports Division Manager and the airport operator.
(3) That comments on the program are invited and, will be considered by the FAA.
(d) The date of signature of the published notice of receipt starts the 180-day approval period for the program.
[Docket 18691, 49 FR 49269, Dec. 18, 1984, as amended by Amdt. 150-2, 54 FR 39295, Sept. 25, 1989]
§ 150.33
Evaluation of programs.
(a) The FAA conducts an evaluation of each noise compatibility program and, based on that evaluation, either approves or disapproves the program. The evaluation includes consideration of proposed measures to determine whether they—
(1) May create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce (including unjust discrimination);
(2) Are reasonably consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing existing noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses; and
(3) Include the use of new or modified flight procedures to control the operation of aircraft for purposes of noise control, or affect flight procedures in any way.
(b) The evaluation may also include an evaluation of those proposed measures to determine whether they may adversely affect the exercise of the authority and responsibilities of the Administrator under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended.
(c) To the extent considered necessary, the FAA may—
(1) Confer with the airport operator and other persons known to have information and views material to the evaluation;
(2) Explore the objectives of the program and the measures, and any alternative measures, for achieving the objectives.
(3) Examine the program for developing a range of alternatives that would eliminate the reasons, if any, for disapproving the program.
(4) Convene an informal meeting with the airport operator and other persons involved in developing or implementing the program for the purposes of gathering all facts relevant to the determination of approval or disapproval of the program and of discussing any needs to accommodate or modify the program as submitted.
(d) If requested by the FAA, the airport operator shall furnish all information needed to complete FAA's review under (c).
(e) An airport operator may, at any time before approval or disapproval of a program, withdraw or revise the program. If the airport operator withdraws or revises the program or indicates to the Regional Airports Division Manager, in writing, the intention to revise the program, the Regional Airports Division Manager terminates the evaluation and notifies the airport operator of that action. That termination cancels the 180-day review period. The FAA does not evaluate a second program for any airport until any previously submitted program has been withdrawn or a determination on it is issued. A new evaluation is commenced upon receipt of a revised program, and a new 180-day approval period is begun, unless the Regional Airports Division Manager finds that the modification made, in light of the overall revised program, can be integrated into the unmodified portions of the revised program without exceeding the original 180-day approval period or causing undue expense to the government.
[Docket 18691, 49 FR 49269, Dec. 18, 1984, as amended by Amdt. 150-2, 54 FR 39295, Sept. 25, 1989]
§ 150.35
Determinations; publications; effectivity.
(a) The FAA issues a determination approving or disapproving each airport noise compatibility program (and revised program). Portions of a program may be individually approved or disapproved. No conditional approvals will be issued. A determination on a program acceptable under this part is issued within 180 days after the program is received under § 150.23 of this part or it may be considered approved, except that this time period may be exceeded for any portion of a program relating to the use of flight procedures for noise control purposes. A determination on portions of a program covered by the exceptions to the 180-day review period for approval will be issued within a reasonable time after receipt of the program. Determinations relating to the use of any flight procedure for noise control purposes may be issued either in connection with the determination on other portions of the program or separately. Except as provided by this paragraph, no approval of any noise compatibility program, or any portion of a program, may be implied in the absence of the FAA's express approval.
(b) The Administrator approves programs under this part, if—
(1) It is found that the program measures to be implemented would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce (including any unjust discrimination) and are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land
uses around the airport and of preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses;
(2) The program provides for revision if made necessary by the revision of the noise map; and
(3) Those aspects of programs relating to the use of flight procedures for noise control can be implemented within the period covered by the program and without—
(i) Reducing the level of aviation safety provided;
(ii) Derogating the requisite level of protection for aircraft, their occupants and persons and property on the ground;
(iii) Adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the Navigable Airspace and Air Traffic Control Systems; or
(iv) Adversely affecting any other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed by law or any other program, standard, or requirement established in accordance with law.
(c) When a determination is issued, the Regional Airports Division Manager notifies the airport operator and publishes a notice of approval or disapproval in the
Federal Register
identifying the nature and extent of the determination.
(d) Approvals issued under this part for a program or portion thereof become effective as specified therein and may be withdrawn when one of the following occurs:
(1) The program or portion thereof is required to be revised under this part or under its own terms, and is not so revised;
(2) If a revision has been submitted for approval, a determination is issued on the revised program or portion thereof, that is inconsistent with the prior approval.
(3) A term or condition of the program, or portion thereof, or its approval is violated by the responsible government body.
(4) A flight procedure or other FAA action upon which the approved program or portion thereof is dependent is subsequently disapproved, significantly altered, or rescinded by the FAA.
(5) The airport operator requests rescission of the approval.
(6) Impacts on flight procedures, air traffic management, or air commerce occur which could not be foreseen at the time of approval.
A determination may be sooner rescinded or modified for cause with at least 30 days written notice to the airport operator of the FAA's intention to rescind or modify the determination for the reasons stated in the notice. The airport operator may, during the 30-day period, submit to the Regional Airports Division Manager for consideration any reasons and circumstances why the determination should not be rescinded or modified on the basis stated in the notice of intent. Thereafter, the FAA either rescinds or modifies the determination consistent with the notice or withdraws the notice of intent and terminates the action.
(e) Determinations may contain conditions which must be satisfied prior to implementation of any portion of the program relating to flight procedures affecting airport or aircraft operations.
(f) Noise exposure maps for current and forecast year map conditions that are submitted and approved with noise compatibility programs are considered to be the new FAA accepted noise exposure maps for purposes of part 150.

# Part A—General

# Sec. A150.1 Purpose.
(a) This appendix establishes a uniform methodology for the development and preparation of airport noise exposure maps. That methodology includes a single system of measuring noise at airports for which there is a highly reliable relationship between projected noise exposure and surveyed reactions of people to noise along with a separate single system for determining the exposure of individuals to noise. It also identifies land uses which, for the purpose of this part are considered to be compatible with various exposures of individuals to noise around airports.
(b) This appendix provides for the use of the FAA's Integrated Noise Model (INM) or an FAA approved equivalent, for developing standardized noise exposure maps and predicting noise impacts. Noise monitoring may be utilized by airport operators for data acquisition and data refinement, but is not required by this part for the development of noise exposure maps or airport noise compatibility programs. Whenever noise monitoring is used, under this part, it should be accomplished in accordance with Sec. A150.5 of this appendix.

# Sec. A150.3 Noise descriptors.
(a)
Airport Noise Measurement.
The A-Weighted Sound Level, measured, filtered and recorded in accordance with Sec. A150.5 of this appendix, must be employed as the unit for the measurement of single event noise at airports and in the areas surrounding the airports.
(b)
Airport Noise Exposure.
The yearly day-night average sound level (YDNL) must be employed for the analysis and characterization of multiple aircraft noise events and for determining the cumulative exposure of individuals to noise around airports.

# Sec. A150.5 Noise measurement procedures and equipment.
(a) Sound levels must be measured or analyzed with equipment having the “A” frequency weighting, filter characteristics, and the “slow response” characteristics as defined in International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Publication No. 179, entitled “Precision Sound Level Meters” as incorporated by reference in part 150 under § 150.11. For purposes of this part, the tolerances allowed for general purpose, type 2 sound level meters in IEU 179, are acceptable.
(b) Noise measurements and documentation must be in accordance with accepted acoustical measurement methodology, such as those described in American National Standards Institute publication ANSI 51.13, dated 1971 as revised 1979, entitled “ANS—Methods for the Measurement of Sound Pressure Levels”; ARP No. 796, dated 1969, entitled “Measurement of Aircraft Exterior Noise in the Field”; “Handbook of Noise Measurement,” Ninth Ed. 1980, by Arnold P.G. Peterson; or “Acoustic Noise Measurement,” dated Jan., 1979, by J.R. Hassell and K. Zaveri. For purposes of this part, measurements intended for comparison to a State or local standard or with another transportation noise source (including other aircraft) must be reported in maximum A-weighted sound levels (L
AM
); for computation or validation of the yearly day-night average level (L
dn
), measurements must be reported in sound exposure level (L
AE
), as defined in Sec. A150.205 of this appendix.

# Part B—Noise Exposure Map Development

# Sec. A150.101 Noise contours and land usages.
(a) To determine the extent of the noise impact around an airport, airport proprietors developing noise exposure maps in accordance with this part must develop L
dn
contours. Continuous contours must be developed for YDNL levels of 65, 70, and 75 (additional contours may be developed and depicted when appropriate). In those areas where YDNL values are 65 YDNL or greater, the airport operator shall identify land uses and determine land use compatibility in accordance with the standards and procedures of this appendix.
(b) Table 1 of this appendix describes compatible land use information for several land uses as a function of YDNL values. The ranges of YDNL values in Table 1 reflect the statistical variability for the responses of large groups of people to noise. Any particular level might not, therefore, accurately assess an individual's perception of an actual noise environment. Compatible or noncompatible land use is determined by comparing the predicted or measured YDNL values at a site with the values given. Adjustments or modifications of the descriptions of the land-use categories may be desirable after consideration of specific local conditions.
(c) Compatibility designations in Table 1 generally refer to the major use of the site. If other uses with greater sensitivity to noise are permitted by local government at a site, a determination of compatibility must be based on that use which is most adversely affected by noise. When appropriate, noise level reduction through incorporation of sound attenuation into the design and construction of a structure may be necessary to achieve compatibility.
(d) For the purpose of compliance with this part, all land uses are considered to be compatible with noise levels less than L
dn
65 dB. Local needs or values may dictate further delineation based on local requirements or determinations.
(e) Except as provided in (f) below, the noise exposure maps must also contain and indentify:
(1) Runway locations.
(2) Flight tracks.
(3) Noise contours of L
dn
65, 70, and 75 dB resulting from aircraft operations.
(4) Outline of the airport boundaries.
(5) Noncompatible land uses within the noise contours, including those within the L
dn
65 dB contours. (No land use has to be identified as noncompatible if the self-generated noise from that use and/or the ambient noise from other nonaircraft and nonairport uses is equal to or greater than the noise from aircraft and airport sources.)
(6) Location of noise sensitive public buildings (such as schools, hospitals, and health care facilities), and properties on or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.
(7) Locations of any aircraft noise monitoring sites utilized for data acquisition and refinement procedures.
(8) Estimates of the number of people residing within the L
dn
65, 70, and 75 dB contours.
(9) Depiction of the required noise contours over a land use map of a sufficient scale and quality to discern streets and other identifiable geographic features.
(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, noise exposure maps prepared in connection with studies which were either Federally funded or Federally approved and which commenced before October 1, 1981, are not required to be modified to contain the following items:
(1) Flight tracks depicted on the map.
(2) Use of ambient noise to determine land use compatibility.
(3) The L
dn
70 dB noise contour and data related to L
dn
70 dB contour. When determinations on land use compatibility using Table 1 differ between L
dn
65-70 dB and the L
dn
70-75 dB, determinations should either use the more conservative L
dn
70-75 dB column or reflect determinations based on local needs and values.
(4) Estimates of the number of people residing within the L
dn
65, 70, and 75 dB contours.

*The designations contained in this table do not constitute a Federal determination that any use of land covered by the program is acceptable or unacceptable under Federal, State, or local law. The responsibility for determining the acceptable and permissible land uses and the relationship between specific properties and specific noise contours rests with the local authorities. FAA determinations under part 150 are not intended to substitute federally determined land uses for those determined to be appropriate by local authorities in response to locally determined needs and values in achieving noise compatible land uses.
Key to Table 1
SLUCM = Standard Land Use Coding Manual.
Y (Yes) = Land Use and related structures compatible without restrictions.
N (No) = Land Use and related structures are not compatible and should be prohibited.
NLR = Noise Level Reduction (outdoor to indoor) to be achieved through incorporation of noise attenuation into the design and construction of the structure.
25, 30, or 35 = Land use and related structures generally compatible; measures to achieve NLR of 25, 30, or 35 dB must be incorporated into design and construction of structure.
Notes for Table 1
(1) Where the community determines that residential or school uses must be allowed, measures to achieve outdoor to indoor Noise Level Reduction (NLR) of at least 25 dB and 30 dB should be incorporated into building codes and be considered in individual approvals. Normal residential construction can be expected to provide a NLR of 20 dB, thus, the reduction requirements are often stated as 5, 10 or 15 dB over standard construction and normally assume mechanical ventilation and closed windows year round. However, the use of NLR criteria will not eliminate outdoor noise problems.
(2) Measures to achieve NLR 25 dB must be incorporated into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas or where the normal noise level is low.
(3) Measures to achieve NLR of 30 dB must be incorporated into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas or where the normal noise level is low.
(4) Measures to achieve NLR 35 dB must be incorporated into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas or where the normal level is low.
(5) Land use compatible provided special sound reinforcement systems are installed.
(6) Residential buildings require an NLR of 25.
(7) Residential buildings require an NLR of 30.
(8) Residential buildings not permitted.

# Sec. A150.103 Use of computer prediction model.
(a) The airport operator shall acquire the aviation operations data necessary to develop noise exposure contours using an FAA approved methodology or computer program, such as the Integrated Noise Model (INM) for airports or the Heliport Noise Model (HNM) for heliports. In considering approval of a methodology or computer program, key factors include the demonstrated capability to produce the required output and the public availability of the program or methodology to provide interested parties the opportunity to substantiate the results.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the following information must be obtained for input to the calculation of noise exposure contours:
(1) A map of the airport and its environs at an adequately detailed scale (not less than 1 inch to 2,000 feet) indicating runway length, alignments, landing thresholds, takeoff start-of-roll points, airport boundary, and flight tracks out to at least 30,000 feet from the end of each runway.
(2) Airport activity levels and operational data which will indicate, on an annual average-daily-basis, the number of aircraft, by type of aircraft, which utilize each flight track, in both the standard daytime (0700-2200 hours local) and nighttime (2200-0700 hours local) periods for both landings and takeoffs.
(3) For landings—glide slopes, glide slope intercept altitudes, and other pertinent information needed to establish approach profiles along with the engine power levels needed to fly that approach profile.
(4) For takeoffs—the flight profile which is the relationship of altitude to distance from start-of-roll along with the engine power levels needed to fly that takeoff profile; these data must reflect the use of noise abatement departure procedures and, if applicable, the takeoff weight of the aircraft or some proxy for weight such as stage length.
(5) Existing topographical or airspace restrictions which preclude the utilization of alternative flight tracks.
(6) The government furnished data depicting aircraft noise characteristics (if not already a part of the computer program's stored data bank).
(7) Airport elevation and average temperature.
(c) For heliports, the map scale required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not be less than 1 inch to 2,000 feet and shall indicate heliport boundaries, takeoff and landing pads, and typical flight tracks out to at least 4,000 feet horizontally from the landing pad. Where these flight tracks cannot be determined, obstructions or other limitations on flight tracks in and out of the heliport shall be identified within the map areas out to at least 4,000 feet horizontally from the landing pad. For static operation (hover), the helicopter type, the number of daily operations based on an annual average, and the duration in minutes of the hover operation shall be identified. The other information required in paragraph (b) shall be furnished in a form suitable for input to the HNM or other FAA approved methodology or computer program.

# Sec. A150.105 Identification of public agencies and planning agencies.
(a) The airport proprietor shall identify each public agency and planning agency whose jurisdiction or responsibility is either
wholly or partially within the L
dn
65 dB boundary.
(b) For those agencies identified in (a) that have land use planning and control authority, the supporting documentation shall identify their geographic areas of jurisdiction.

# Part C—Mathematical Descriptions

# Sec. A150.205 Mathematical computations.
(a) Average sound level must be computed in accordance with the following formula:
EC15SE91.000
where T is the length of the time period, in seconds, during which the average is taken; L
A
(t) is the instantaneous time varying A-weighted sound level during the time period T.

# Note:
When a noise environment is caused by a number of identifiable noise events, such as aircraft flyovers, average sound level may be conveniently calculated from the sound exposure levels of the individual events occurring within a time period T:
EC15SE91.001
where L
AEi
is the sound exposure level of the i-th event, in a series of n events in time period T, in seconds.

# Note:
When T is one hour, L
T
is referred to as one-hour average sound level.
(b) Day-night average sound level (individual day) must be computed in accordance with the following formula:
ER10FE03.003
Time is in seconds, so the limits shown in hours and minutes are actually interpreted in seconds. It is often convenient to compute day-night average sound level from the one-hour average sound levels obtained during successive hours.
(c) Yearly day-night average sound level must be computed in accordance with the following formula:
EC15SE91.003
where L
dni
is the day-night average sound level for the i-th day out of one year.
(d) Sound exposure level must be computed in accordance with the following formula:
EC15SE91.004
where t
o
is one second and L
A
(t) is the time-varying A-weighted sound level in the time interval t
1
to t
2
.
The time interval should be sufficiently large that it encompasses all the significant sound of a designated event.
The requisite integral may be approximated with sufficient accuracy by integrating L
A
(t) over the time interval during which L
A
(t) lies within 10 decibels of its maximum value, before and after the maximum occurs.

Sec. B150.1 Scope and purpose.
Sec. B150.3 Requirement for noise map.
Sec. B150.5 Program standards.
Sec. B150.7 Analysis of program alternatives.
Sec. B150.9 Equivalent programs.

# Sec. B150.1 Scope and purpose.
(a) This appendix prescribes the content and the methods for developing noise compatibility programs authorized under this part. Each program must set forth the measures which the airport operator (or other person or agency responsible) has taken, or proposes to take, for the reduction of existing noncompatible land uses and the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses within the area covered by the noise exposure map submitted by the operator.
(b) The purpose of a noise compatibility program is:
(1) To promote a planning process through which the airport operator can examine and analyze the noise impact created by the operation of an airport, as well as the costs and benefits associated with various alternative noise reduction techniques, and the responsible impacted land use control jurisdictions can examine existing and forecast areas of noncompatibility and consider actions to reduce noncompatible uses.
(2) To bring together through public participation, agency coordination, and overall cooperation, all interested parties with their respective authorities and obligations, thereby facilitating the creation of an agreed upon noise abatement plan especially suited to the individual airport location while at the same time not unduly affecting the national air transportation system.
(3) To develop comprehensive and implementable noise reduction techniques and land use controls which, to the maximum extent feasible, will confine severe aircraft YDNL values of L
dn
75 dB or greater to areas included within the airport boundary and will establish and maintain compatible land uses in the areas affected by noise between the L
dn
65 and 75 dB contours.

# Sec. B150.3 Requirement for noise map.
(a) It is required that a current and complete noise exposure map and its supporting documentation as found in compliance with the applicable requirements by the FAA, per § 150.21(c) be included in each noise compatibility program:
(1) To identify existing and future noncompatible land uses, based on airport operation and off-airport land uses, which have generated the need to develop a program.
(2) To identify changes in noncompatible uses to be derived from proposed program measures.
(b) If the proposed noise compatibility program would yield maps differing from those previously submitted to FAA, the program shall be accompanied by appropriately revised maps. Such revisions must be prepared in accordance with the requirements of Sec. A150.101(e) of appendix A and will be accepted by FAA in accordance with § 150.35(f).

# Sec. B150.5 Program standards.
Based upon the airport noise exposure and noncompatible land uses identified in the map, the airport operator shall evaluate the several alternative noise control actions and develop a noise compatibility program which—
(a) Reduces existing noncompatible uses and prevents or reduces the probability of the establishment of additional noncompatible uses;
(b) Does not impose undue burden on interstate and foreign commerce;
(c) Provides for revision in accordance with § 150.23 of this part.
(d) Is not unjustly discriminatory.
(e) Does not derogate safety or adversely affect the safe and efficient use of airspace.
(f) To the extent practicable, meets both local needs and needs of the national air transportation system, considering tradeoffs between economic benefits derived from the airport and the noise impact.
(g) Can be implemented in a manner consistent with all of the powers and duties of the Administrator of FAA.

# Sec. B150.7 Analysis of program alternatives.
(a) Noise control alternatives must be considered and presented according to the following categories:
(1) Noise abatement alternatives for which the airport operator has adequate implementation authority.
(2) Noise abatement alternatives for which the requisite implementation authority is vested in a local agency or political subdivision governing body, or a state agency or political subdivision governing body.
(3) Noise abatement options for which requisite authority is vested in the FAA or other Federal agency.
(b) At a minimum, the operator shall analyze and report on the following alternatives, subject to the constraints that the strategies are appropriate to the specific airport (for example, an evaluation of night curfews is not appropriate if there are no night flights and none are forecast):
(1) Acquisition of land and interests therein, including, but not limited to air rights, easements, and development rights, to ensure the use of property for purposes which are compatible with airport operations.
(2) The construction of barriers and acoustical shielding, including the soundproofing of public buildings.
(3) The implementation of a preferential runway system.
(4) The use of flight procedures (including the modifications of flight tracks) to control
the operation of aircraft to reduce exposure of individuals (or specific noise sensitive areas) to noise in the area around the airport.
(5) The implementation of any restriction on the use of airport by any type or class of aircraft based on the noise characteristics of those aircraft. Such restrictions may include, but are not limited to—
(i) Denial of use of the airport to aircraft types or classes which do not meet Federal noise standards;
(ii) Capacity limitations based on the relative noisiness of different types of aircraft;
(iii) Requirement that aircraft using the airport must use noise abatement takeoff or approach procedures previously approved as safe by the FAA;
(iv) Landing fees based on FAA certificated or estimated noise emission levels or on time of arrival; and
(v) Partial or complete curfews.
(6) Other actions or combinations of actions which would have a beneficial noise control or abatement impact on the public.
(7) Other actions recommended for analysis by the FAA for the specific airport.
(c) For those alternatives selected for implementation, the program must identify the agency or agencies responsible for such implementation, whether those agencies have agreed to the implementation, and the approximate schedule agreed upon.

# Sec. B150.9 Equivalent programs.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, noise compatibility programs prepared in connection with studies which were either Federally funded or Federally approved and commenced before October 1, 1981, are not required to be modified to contain the following items:
(1) Flight tracks.
(2) A noise contour of L
dn
70 dB resulting from aircraft operations and data related to the L
dn
70 dB contour. When determinations on land use compatibility using Table 1 of appendix A differ between L
dn
65-70 dB and L
dn
70-75 dB, the determinations should either use the more conservative L
dn
70-75 dB column or reflect determinations based on local needs and values.
(3) The categorization of alternatives pursuant to Sec. B150.7(a), although the persons responsible for implementation of each measure in the program must still be identified in accordance with § 150.23(e)(8).
(4) Use of ambient noise to determine land use compatibility.
(b) Previously prepared noise compatibility program documentation may be supplemented to include these and other program requirements which have not been excepted.

).
[Docket 1329, 27 FR 12349, Dec. 13, 1962]
§ 151.3
National Airport Plan.
(a) Under the Federal Airport Act, the FAA prepares each year a “National Airport Plan” for developing public airports in the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam. In terms of general location and type of development, the National Airport Plan specifies the maximum limits of airport development that is necessary to provide a system of public airports adequate to anticipate and meet the needs of civil aeronautics.
(b) If, within the forecast period, an airport will have a substantial aeronautical necessity, it may be included in the National Airport Plan. Only work on an airport included in the current Plan is eligible for inclusion in the Federal-aid Airport Program to be undertaken within currently available appropriations and authorizations. However, the inclusion of an airport in the National Airport Plan does not commit the United States to include it in the Federal-aid Airport Program. In addition, the local community concerned is not required to proceed with planning or development of an airport included in the National Airport Plan.

(2) The location and nature of existing and proposed airport facilities (such as runways, taxiways, aprons, terminal buildings, hangars, and roads) and of their proposed modifications and extensions; and
(3) The location of existing and proposed non-aviation areas, and of their existing improvements.
All airport development under the Federal-aid Airport Program must be done in accordance with an approved airport
layout plan. Each airport layout plan, and any change in it, is subject to FAA approval. The Administrator's signature on the face of an original airport layout plan, or of any change in it, indicates FAA approval. The FAA approves an airport layout plan only if the airport development is sound and meets applicable requirements.
(b)
Safe, useful, and usable unit.
Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, each advance planning and engineering proposal or airport development project must provide for the planning or development of—
(1) An airport or unit of an airport that is safe, useful, and usable; or
(2) An additional facility that increases the safety, usefulness, or usability of an airport.
(c)
National defense needs.
The needs of national defense are fully considered in administering the Federal-aid Airport Program. However, approval of an advance planning and engineering proposal or a project application is limited to planning or airport development necessary for civil aviation.
(d)
Stage development.
In any case in which airport development can be accomplished more economically under stage construction, federal funds may be programmed in advance for the development over two or more years under two or more grant agreements. In such a case, the FAA makes a tentative allocation of funds for both the current and future fiscal years, rather than allocating the entire federal share in one fiscal year. A grant agreement is made only during the fiscal year in which funds are authorized to be obligated. Advance planning and engineering grants are not made under this paragraph.
[Amdt. 151-8, 30 FR 8039, June 23, 1965]
§ 151.7
Grants of funds: General policies.
(a)
Compliance with sponsorship requirements.
The FAA authorizes the expenditure of funds under the Federal-aid Airport Program for airport planning and engineering or for airport development only if the Administrator is satisfied that the sponsor has met or will meet the requirements established by existing and proposed agreements with the United States with respect to any airport that the sponsor owns or controls.
(1) Agreements with the United States to which this requirement of compliance applies include—
(i) Any grant agreement made under the Federal-aid Airport Program;
(ii) Any covenant in a conveyance under section 16 of the Federal Airport Act;
(iii) Any covenant in a conveyance of surplus airport property either under section 13(g) of the Surplus Property Act (50 U.S.C. App. 1622(g)) or under Regulation 16 of the War Assets Administration; and
(iv) Any AP-4 agreement made under the terminated Development Landing Areas National Defense Program and the Development Civil Landing Areas Program.
This requirement does not apply to assurances required under section 602 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-1) and § 15.7 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 15.7).
(2) If it appears that a sponsor has failed to comply with a requirement of an agreement with the United States with respect to an airport, the FAA notifies him of this fact and affords him an opportunity to submit materials to refute the allegation of noncompliance or to achieve compliance.
(3) If a project is otherwise eligible under the Federal-aid Airport Program, a grant may be made to a sponsor who has not complied with an agreement if the sponsor shows—
(i) That the noncompliance is caused by factors beyond his control; or
(ii) That the following circumstances exist:
(
a
) The noncompliance consisted of a failure, through mistake or ignorance, to perform minor conditions in old agreements with the Federal Government; and
(
b
) The sponsor is taking reasonable action promptly to correct the deficiency or the deficiency relates to an obligation that is no longer required for the safe and efficient use of the airport under existing law and policy.
(b)
Small proposals and projects.
Unless there is otherwise a special need for U.S. participation, the FAA includes an advance planning and engineering proposal or an airport development
project in the Federal-aid Airport Program only if—
(1) The advance planning and engineering proposal involves more than $1,000 in United States funds; and
(2) The project application involves more than $5,000 in U.S. funds.
Whenever possible, the sponsor must consolidate small projects on a single airport in one grant agreement even though the airport development is to be accomplished over a period of years.
(c)
Previously obligated work.
Unless the Administrator specifically authorizes it, no advance planning and engineering proposal or project application may include any planning, engineering, or construction work included in a prior agreement with the United States obligating the sponsor or any other non-U.S. public agency to do the work, and entitling the sponsor or any other non-United States public agency to payment of U.S. funds for all or part of the work.

§ 151.9
Runway clear zones: General.
(a) Whenever funds are allocated for developing new runways or landing strips, or to improve or repair existing runways, the sponsor must own, acquire, or agree to acquire, runway clear zones. Exceptions are considered (on the basis of a full statement of facts by the sponsor) upon a showing of uneconomical acquisition costs, or lack of necessity for the acquisition.
(b) For the purpose of this part, a runway clear zone is an area at ground level which begins at the end of each primary surface defined in § 77.27(a) and extends with the width of each approach surface defined in § 77.27 (b) and (c), to terminate directly below each approach surface slope at the point, or points, where the slope reaches a height of 50 feet above the elevation of the runway or 50 feet above the terrain at the outer extremity of the clear zone, whichever distance is shorter.
(c) For the purposes of this section, an airport operator or owner is considered to have an adequate property interest if it has an easement (or a covenant running with the land) giving it enough control to rid the clear zone of all obstructions (objects so far as they project above the approach surfaces established by § 77.27 (b) and (c) of part 77 of this chapter), and to prevent the creation of future obstructions; together with the right of entrance and exit for those purposes, to ensure the safe and unrestricted passage of aircraft in and over the area.
[Docket 1329, 27 FR 12349, Dec. 13, 1962, as amended by Amdt. 151-7, 30 FR 7484, June 8, 1965; Amdt. 151-21, 33 FR 258, Jan. 9, 1968]
§ 151.11
Runway clear zones; requirements.
(a) In projects involving grants-in-aid under the Federal-aid Airport Program, a sponsor must own, acquire, or agree to acquire an adequate property interest in runway clear zone areas as prescribed in paragraph (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section, as applicable. Property interests that a sponsor acquires to meet the requirements of this section are eligible for inclusion in the Program.
(b) On new airports, the sponsor must own, acquire, or agree to acquire adequate property interests in runway clear zone areas (in connection with initial land acquisition) for all eligible runways or landing strips, without substantial deviation from standard configuration and length.
(c) On existing airports where new runways or landing strips are developed, the sponsor must own, acquire, or agree to acquire adequate property interests in runway clear zone areas for each runway and landing strip to be developed or extended, to the extent that the Administrator determines practical and feasible considering all facts presented by the airport owner or operator, preferably without substantial deviation from standard configuration and length.
(d) On existing airports where improvements are made to runways or landing strips, the sponsor must own, acquire, or agree to acquire adequate property interests in runway clear zone areas for each runway or landing strip that is to be improved to the extent that the Administrator determines is practical and feasible with regard to
standard configuration, length, and property interests, considering all facts presented by the airport owner or operator. Any development that improves a specific runway or landing strip is considered to be a runway improvement, including runway lighting and the developing or lighting of taxiways serving a runway.
(e) On existing airports where substantial improvements are made that do not benefit a specific runway or landing strip, such as overall grading or drainage, terminal area or building developments, the sponsor must own, acquire, or agree to acquire adequate property interests in runway clear zone areas for the dominant runway or landing strip to the extent that the Administrator determines is practical and feasible, with regard to standard configuration, length, and property interests, considering all facts presented by the airport owner or operator.
(f) If a sponsor or other public agency shows that it is legally able to prevent the future erection or creation of obstructions in the runway clear zone area, and adopts protective measures to prohibit their future erection or creation, that showing is acceptable for the purposes of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section in place of an adequate property interest (except for rights required for removing existing obstructions). In such a case, there must be an agreement between the FAA and the sponsor for removing or marking or lighting (to be determined in each case) any existing obstruction to air navigation In each case, the sponsor must furnish information as to the specific height limitations established and as to the current and foreseeable future use of the property to which they apply. The information must include an acceptable legal opinion of the validity of the measures adopted, including a conclusion that the height limitations are not unreasonable in view of current and foreseeable future use of the property, and are a reasonable exercise of the police power, together with the reasons or basis supporting the opinion.
(g) The authority exercised by the Administrator under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section to allow a deviation from, or the extent of conformity to, standard configuration or length of runway clear zones, or to determine the adequacy of property interests therein, is also exercised by Regional Directors.
[Docket 1329, 27 FR 12350, Dec. 13, 1962, as amended by Amdt. 151-22, 33 FR 8267, June 4, 1968; Amdt. 151-25, 33 FR 14535, Sept. 27, 1968]
§ 151.13
Federal-aid Airport Program: Policy affecting landing aid requirements.
(a)
Landing aid requirements.
No project for developing or improving an airport may be approved for the Program unless it provides for acquiring or installing such of the following landing aids as the Administrator determines are needed for the safe and efficient use of the airport by aircraft, considering the category of the airport and the type and volume of traffic using it:
(1) Land needed for installing approach lighting systems (ALS).
(2) In-runway lighting.
(3) High intensity runway lighting.
(4) Runway distance markers.
For the purposes of this section “approach lighting system (ALS)” is a standard configuration of aeronautical ground lights in the approach area to a runway or channel to assist a pilot in making an approach to the runway or channel.
(b)
Specific landing aid requirements.
The landing aids set forth in paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) of this section are required for the safe and efficient use of airports by aircraft in the following cases:
(1) Lands for installing approach lighting systems are required as part of a project if the installing of the components of the system on the airport is in an approved FAA budget, unless the sponsor has already acquired the land necessary for the system or is otherwise undertaking to acquire that land. If the sponsor is otherwise undertaking to acquire the land, the grant agreement for the project must obligate the sponsor to complete the acquisition within a time limit prescribed by the Administrator. The Administrator immediately notifies a sponsor when a budget is approved providing for installing an approach lighting system at the airport concerned.
(2) In-runway lighting is required as part of a project:
(i) If the project includes:
(
a
) Construction of a new runway designated by the FAA as an instrument landing runway for which the installation of an IFR precision approach system including ALS and ILS, has been programmed by the FAA with funds then available therefor;
(
b
) An extension of 3,000 feet or more (usable for landing purposes) of the approach end of a designated instrument landing runway equipped, or programed by the FAA, with funds then available therefor, to be equipped, with an IFR precision approach system including ALS and ILS;
(
c
) Reconstruction of a designated instrument landing runway equipped, or programed by the FAA, with funds then available therefor, to be equipped with an IFR precision approach system including ALS and ILS, if the reconstruction requires the closing of the runway; or
(
d
) Any other airport development on an airport whose designated instrument landing runway is equipped, or programed by the FAA, with funds then available therefor, to be equipped with an IFR precision approach system including ALS and ILS; and
(ii) Only if a study of the airport shows that in-runway lighting is required for the safe and efficient use of the airport by aircraft, after the Administrator considers the following:
(
a
) The type and volume of flight activity;
(
b
) Other existing or planned navigational aids;
(
c
) Airport environmental factors such as local weather conditions and adjacent geographic profiles;
(
d
) Approach and departure paths;
(
e
) Effect on landing and takeoff minima; and
(
f
) In the case of projects under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(
d
) of this section, whether installing in-runway lighting requires closing the runway for so long a time that the adverse effect on safety of its closing would outweigh the contribution to safety that would be gained by the in-runway lights or whether it would unduly interfere with the efficiency of aircraft operations.
(3) High intensity runway edge lighting on the designated instrument landing runway is required as a part of a project whenever that runway is equipped or programmed for the installation of an ILS and high intensity runway edge lights are not then installed on the runway or included in another project. A project for extending a runway that has high intensity runway edge lights on the existing runway requires, as a part of the project, the extension of the high intensity runway edge lights.
(4) Runway distance markers whose design standards have been approved and published by the FAA are required as a part of a project on a case-by-case basis if, after reviewing the pertinent facts and circumstances of the case, the Administrator determines that they are needed for the safe and efficient use of the airport by aircraft.

§ 151.15
Federal-aid Airport Program: Policy affecting runway or taxiway remarking.
No project for developing or improving an airport may be approved for the Program unless it provides for runway or taxiway remarking if the present marking is obliterated by construction, alteration or repair work included in a FAAP project or by the required routing of construction equipment used therein.

Docket 1329, 27 FR 12351, Dec. 13, 1962, unless otherwise noted.
§ 151.21
Procedures: Application; general information.
(a) An eligible sponsor that desires to obtain Federal aid for eligible airport development must submit to the Area Manager of the area in which the sponsor is located (hereinafter in this part referred to as the “Area Manager”), a
request on FAA Form 5100-3, accompanied by—
(1) The sponsor's written statement as to whether the proposed project involves the displacement and relocation of persons residing on land physically acquired or to be acquired for the project development; and
(2) The sponsor's written assurance, if the project involves displacement and relocation of such persons, that adequate replacement housing will be available or provided for (built, if necessary), without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, before the execution of a grant agreement for the project.
(b) A proposed project is selected for inclusion in a program only if the sponsor has submitted a written assurance when required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or if the Administrator has determined that the project does not involve the displacement and relocation of persons residing on land to be physically acquired or to be acquired for the project development. If the Administrator selects a proposed project for inclusion in a program, a tentative allocation of funds is made for it and the sponsor is notified of the allocation. The tentative allocation may be withdrawn if the sponsor fails to submit an acceptable project application as provided in paragraph (c) of this section or fails to proceed diligently with the project, or if adequate replacement housing is not available or provided for in accordance with a written assurance when required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(c) As soon as practicable after receiving notice of the tentative allocation, the sponsor must submit a project application on FAA Form 1624 to the Area Manager, without changing the language of the form, unless the change is approved in advance by the Administrator. In the case of a joint project, each sponsor executes only those provisions of the project application that apply to it. A sponsor who has executed a grant agreement for a project for the development of an airport under the Program, may, in the Administrator's discretion, submit additional project applications on FAA Form 1624 for further development of that airport.
(49 U.S.C. 1120, 1655(c); sec. 6(c), Dept. of Transportation Act; sec. 1.4(b)(1) of the regulations of the Office of the Secretary of Transportation; Federal Airport Act, as amended)

§ 151.23
Procedures: Application; funding information.
Each sponsor must state in its application that it has on hand, or show that it can obtain as needed, funds to pay all estimated costs of the proposed project that are not borne by the United States or by another sponsor. If any of the funds are to be furnished to a sponsor, or used to pay project costs on behalf of a sponsor, by a State agency or any other public agency that is not a sponsor of the project, that agency may, instead of the sponsor, submit evidence that the funds will be provided if the project is approved.
[Docket 1329, 27 FR 12351, Dec. 13, 1962, as amended by Amdt. 151-34, 34 FR 12883, Aug. 8, 1969]
§ 151.24
Procedures: Application; information on estimated project costs.
(a) If any part of the estimated project costs consists of the value of donated land, labor, materials, or equipment, or of the value of a property interest in land acquired at a cost that (as represented by the sponsor) is not the actual cost or the amount of an award in eminent domain proceedings, the sponsor must so state in the application, indicating the nature of the donation or other transaction and the value it places on it.
(b) If, after the grant agreement is executed and before the final payment of the allowable project costs is made under § 151.63, it appears that the sponsor inadvertently or unknowingly failed to comply with paragraph (a) of this section as to any item, the Administrator—
(1) Makes or obtains an appraisal of the item, and if the appraised value is less than the value placed on the item in the project application, notifies the sponsor that it may, within a stated
time, ask in writing for reconsideration of the appraisal and submit statements of pertinent facts and opinion; and
(2) Adjusts the U.S. share of the project costs to reflect any decrease in value of the item below that stated in the project application.
[Amdt. 151-34, 34 FR 12883, Aug. 8, 1969]
§ 151.25
Procedures: Application; information as to property interests.
(a) Each sponsor must state in its application all of the property interests that he holds in the lands to be developed or used as part of, or in connection with, the airport as it will be when the project is completed. Each project application contains a covenant on the part of the sponsor to acquire, before starting construction work, or within a reasonable time if not needed for the construction, property interests satisfactory to the Administrator in all the lands in which it does not hold those property interests at the time it submits the application. In the case of a joint project, any one or more of the sponsors may hold or acquire the necessary property interests. In such a case, each sponsor may show on its application only those property interests that it holds or is to acquire.
(b) Each sponsor of a project must send with its application a property map (designated as Exhibit A) or incorporate such a map by reference to one in a previous application that was approved. The sponsor must clearly identify on the map all property interests required in paragraph (a) of this section, showing prior and proposed acquisitions for which United States aid is requested under the project.
(c) For the purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the property interest that the sponsor must have or agree to obtain, is—
(1) Title free and clear of any reversionary interest, lien, easement, lease, or other encumbrance that, in the opinion of the Administrator, would create an undue risk that it might deprive the sponsor of possession or control, interfere with its use for public airport purposes, or make it impossible for the sponsor to carry out the agreements and covenants in the application;
(2) A lease of not less than 20 years granted to the sponsor by another public agency that has title as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, on terms that the Administrator considers satisfactory; or
(3) In the case of an offsite area an agreement, easement, leasehold, or other right or property interest that, in the Administrator's opinion, provides reasonable assurance that the sponsor will not be deprived of its right to use the land for the intended purpose during the period necessary to meet the requirements of the grant agreement.
(d) For the purposes of this section, the word “land” includes landing areas, building areas, runway clear zones, clearways and approach zones, and areas required for offsite construction, entrance roads, drainage, protection of approaches, installation of air navigation facilities, or other airport purposes.
§ 151.26
Procedures: Applications; compatible land use information; consideration of local community interest; relocation of displaced persons.
(a) Each sponsor must state in its application the action that it has taken to restrict the use of land adjacent to or in the immediate vicinity of the airport to activities and purposes compatible with normal airport operations including landing and take-off of aircraft. The sponsor's statement must include information on—
(1) Any property interests (such as airspace easements or title to airspace) acquired by the sponsor to assure compatible land use, or to protect or control aerial approaches;
(2) Any zoning laws enacted or in force restricting the use of land adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, or assuring protection or control of aerial approaches, whether or not enacted by the sponsor; and
(3) Any action taken by the sponsor to induce the appropriate government authority to enact zoning laws restricting the use of land adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, or assuring protection or control of aerial approaches, when the sponsor lacks the power to zone the land.
(b) Each sponsor must submit with his application—
(1) A written statement—
(i) Specifying what consideration has been given to the interest of all communities in or near which the project is located; and
(ii) Containing the substance of any objection to, or approval of, the proposed project made known to the sponsor by any local individual, group or community; and
(2) A written statement showing that adequate replacement housing that is open to all persons, regardless of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, is available and has been offered on the same nondiscriminatory basis to persons who have resided on land physically acquired or to be acquired for the project development and who will be displaced thereby.
[Amdt. 151-8, 30 FR 8039, June 23, 1965, as amended by Amdt. 151-17, 31 FR 16524, Dec. 28, 1966; Amdt. 151-39, 35 FR 5537, Apr. 3, 1970]
§ 151.27
Procedures: Application, plans, specifications, and appraisals.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each sponsor shall incorporate by reference in its project application the final plans and specifications, describing the items of airport development for which it requests United States aid. It must submit the plans and specifications with the application unless they were previously submitted or are submitted with that of another sponsor of the project.
(b) In special cases, the Administrator authorizes the postponement of the submission of final plans and specifications until a later date to be specified in the grant agreement, if the sponsor has submitted—
(1) An airport layout plan approved by the Administrator; and
(2) Preliminary plans and specifications in enough detail to identify all items of development included in the project, and prepared so as to provide for accomplishing the project in accordance with the master plan layout, the rules in subparts B and C and applicable local laws and regulations.
(c) If the project involves acquiring a property interest in land by donation, or at a cost that (as represented by the sponsor) is not the actual cost or the amount of an award in eminent domain proceedings, the Administrator, before passing on the eligibility of the project makes or obtains an appraisal of the interest. If the appraised value is less than the value placed on the interest by the sponsor (§ 151.23), the Administrator notifies the sponsor that he may within a stated time, ask in writing for reconsideration of the appraisal and submit statements of pertinent facts and opinion.
[Docket 1329, 27 FR 12351, Dec. 13, 1962, as amended by Amdt. 151-8, 30 FR 8039, June 23, 1965; Amdt. 151-17, 31 FR 16524, Dec. 28, 1966]
§ 151.29
Procedures: Offer, amendment, and acceptance.
(a) Upon approving a project, the Administrator makes an offer to the sponsor to pay the United States share of the allowable project costs. The offer states a definite amount as the maximum obligation of the United States, and is subject to change or withdrawal by the Administrator, in his discretion, at any time before it is accepted.
(b) If, before the sponsor accepts the offer, it is determined that the maximum obligation of the United States stated in the offer is not enough to pay the United States share of the allowable project costs, the sponsor may request an increase in the amount in the offer, through the Area Manager.
(c) An official of the sponsor must accept the offer for the sponsor within the time prescribed in the offer, and in the required number of counterparts, by signing it in the space provided. The signing official must have been authorized to sign the acceptance by a resolution or ordinance adopted by the sponsor's governing body. The resolution or ordinance must, as appropriate under the local law—
(1) Set forth the terms of the offer at length; or
(2) Have a copy of the offer attached to the resolution or ordinance and incorporated into it by reference.
The sponsor must attach a certified copy of the resolution to each executed copy of an accepted offer or grant agreement that it is required to send to the Area Manager.
§ 151.31
Procedures: Grant agreement.
(a) An offer by the Administrator, and acceptance by the sponsor, as set forth in § 151.29, constitute a grant agreement between the sponsor and the United States. Except as provided in § 151.41(c)(3), the United States does not pay, and is not obligated to pay, any part of the project costs that have been or may be incurred, before the grant agreement is executed.
(b) The Administrator and the sponsor may agree to a change in a grant agreement if—
(1) The change does not increase the maximum obligation of the United States under the grant agreement by more than 10 percent;
(2) The change provides only for airport development that meets the requirements of subparts B and C; and
(3) The change does not prejudice the interests of the United States.
(c) When a change is agreed to, the Administrator issues a supplemental agreement incorporating the change. The sponsor must accept the supplemental agreement in the manner provided in § 151.29(c).
[Docket 1329, 27 FR 12351, Dec. 13, 1962, as amended by Amdt. 151-8, 30 FR 8040, June 23, 1965]
§ 151.33
Cosponsorship and agency.
(a) Any two or more public agencies that desire to participate either in accomplishing development under a project or in maintaining or operating the airport, may cosponsor it if they meet the requirements of subparts B and C, including—
(1) The eligibility requirements of § 151.37; and
(2) The submission of a single project application, executed by each sponsor, clearly stating the certifications, representations, warranties, and obligations made or assumed by each, or a separate application by each that does not meet all the requirements of subparts B and C if in the Administrator's opinion, the applications collectively meet the requirements of subparts B and C as applied to a project with a single sponsor.
(b) A public agency that desires to participate in a project only by contributing funds to a sponsor need not become a sponsor or an agent of the sponsor, as provided in this section. However, any funds that it contributes are considered as funds of the sponsor for the purposes of the Federal Airport Act and this part.
(c) If the sponsors of a joint project are not each willing to assume, jointly and severally, the obligations that subparts B and C requires a sponsor to assume, they must send a true copy of an agreement between them, satisfactory to the Administrator, to be incorporated into the grant agreement. Each agreement must state—
(1) The responsibilities of each sponsor to the others with respect to accomplishing the proposed development and operating and maintaining the airport;
(2) The obligations that each will assume to the United States; and
(3) The name of the sponsor or sponsors who will accept, receipt for, and disburse grant payments.
If an offer is made to the sponsors of a joint project, as provided in § 151.29, it contains a specific condition that it is made in accordance with the agreement between the sponsors (and the agreement is incorporated therein by reference) and that, by accepting the offer, each sponsor assumes only its respective obligations as set forth in the agreement.
(d) A public agency may, if it is authorized by local law, act as agent of the public agency that is to own and operate the airport, with or without participating financially and without becoming a sponsor. The terms and conditions of the agency and the agent's authority to act for the sponsor must be set forth in an agency agreement that is satisfactory to the Administrator. The sponsor must submit a true copy of the agreement with the project application. Such an agent may accept, on behalf of the sponsor, an offer made under § 151.29, only if that acceptance has been specifically and legally authorized by the sponsor's governing body and the authority is specifically set forth in the agency agreement.
(e) When the cosponsors of an airport are not located in the same area, they must submit a joint request to the
Area Manager of the area in which the airport development will be located.
[Docket 1329, 27 FR 12351, Dec. 13, 1962, as amended by Amdt. 151-8, 30 FR 8040, June 23, 1965; Amdt. 151-11, 31 FR 6686, May 5, 1966]
§ 151.35
Airport development and facilities to which subparts B and C apply.

§ 151.45
Performance of construction work: General requirements.
(a) All construction work under a project must be performed under contract, except in a case where the Administrator determines that the project, or a part of it, can be more effectively and economically accomplished on a force account basis by the sponsor or by another public agency acting for or as agent of the sponsor.
(b) Each contract under a project must meet the requirements of local law.
(c) No sponsor may issue any change order under any of its construction contracts or enter into a supplemental agreement unless three copies of that order or agreement have been sent to and approved by the Area Manager. §§ 151.47 and 151.49 apply to supplemental agreements as well as to original contracts.
(d) This section and §§ 151.47 through 151.49 do not apply to contracts with the owners of airport hazards, (as described in § 151.39(b)), buildings, pipe lines, power lines, or other structures or facilities, for installing, extending, changing, removing, or relocating that structure or facility. However, the sponsor must obtain the approval of the Area Manager before entering into such a contract.
(e) No sponsor may allow a contractor or subcontractor to begin work under a project until—
(1) The sponsor has furnished three conformed copies of the contract to the Area Manager; and
(2) The Area Manager agrees to the issuance of a notice to proceed with the work to the contractor. However, the Area Manager does not agree to the
issuance of such a notice unless he is satisfied that adequate replacement housing is available and has been offered to affected persons, as required for project eligibility by § 151.39(a)(5).
(f) Except when the Area Manager determines that the sponsor has previously demonstrated satisfactory engineering and construction supervision and inspection, no sponsor may allow a contractor or subcontractor to begin work, nor may the sponsor begin force account work, until the sponsor has notified the Area Manager in writing that engineering and construction supervision and inspection have been arranged to insure that construction will conform to FAA approved plans and specifications, and that the sponsor has caused a review to be made of the qualifications of personnel who will be performing such supervision and inspection and is satisfied that they are qualified to do so.

§ 151.47
Performance of construction work: Letting of contracts.
(a)
Advertising required; exceptions.
Unless the Administrator approves another method for use on a particular airport development project, each contract for construction work on a project in the amount of more than $2,000 must be awarded on the basis of public advertising and open competitive bidding under the local law applicable to the letting of public contracts. Any oral or written agreement or understanding between a sponsor and another public agency that is not a sponsor of the project, under which that public agency undertakes construction work for or as agent of the sponsor, is not considered to be a construction contract for the purposes of this section, or §§ 151.45, 151.49, and 151.51.
(b)
Advertisement; conditions and contents.
There may be no advertisement for bids on, or negotiation of, a construction contract until the Administrator has approved the plans and specifications. The advertisement shall inform the bidders of the contract and reporting provisions required by § 151.54. Unless the estimated contract price or construction cost is $2,000 or less, there may be no advertisement for bids or negotiation until the Administrator has given the sponsor a copy of a decision of the Secretary of Labor establishing the minimum wage rates for skilled and unskilled labor under the proposed contract. In each case, a copy of the wage determination decision must be set forth in the initial invitation for bids or proposed contract or incorporated therein by reference to a copy set forth in the advertised or negotiated specifications.
(c)
Procedure for the Secretary of Labor's wage determinations.
At least 60 days before the intended date of advertising or negotiating under paragraph (b) of this section, the sponsor shall send to the Area Manager, completed Department of Labor Form DB-11, with only the classifications needed in the performance of the work checked. General entries (such as “entire schedule” or “all applicable classifications”) may not be used. Additional necessary classifications not on the form may be typed in the blank spaces or on an attached separate list. A classification that can be fitted into classifications on the form, or a classification that is not generally recognized in the area or in the industry, may not be used. Except in areas where the wage patterns are clearly established, the Form must be accompanied by any available pertinent wage payment or locally prevailing fringe benefit information.
(d)
Use and effectiveness of the Secretary of Labor's wage determinations.
(1) Wage determinations are effective only for 120 days from the date of the determinations. If it appears that a determination may expire between bid opening and award, the sponsor shall so advise the FAA as soon as possible. If he wishes a new request for wage determination to be made and if any pertinent circumstances have changed, he shall submit a new Form DB-11 and accompanying information. If he claims that the determination expires before award and after bid opening due to unavoidable circumstances, he shall submit proof of the facts which he claims support a finding to that effect.
(2) The Secretary of Labor may modify any wage determination before the award of the contract or contracts for which it was sought. If the proposed
contract is awarded on the basis of public advertisement and open competitive bidding, any modification that the FAA receives less than 10 days before the opening of bids is not effective, unless the Administrator finds that there is reasonable time to notify bidders. A modification may not continue in effect beyond the effective period of the wage determination to which it relates. The Administrator sends any modification to the sponsor as soon as possible. If the modification is effective, it must be incorporated in the invitation for bids, by issuing an addendum to the specifications or otherwise.
(e)
Requirements for awarding construction contracts.
A sponsor may not award a construction contract without the written concurrence of the Administrator (through the Area Manager) that the contract prices are reasonable and that the contract conforms to the sponsor's grant agreement with the United States. A sponsor that awards contracts on the basis of public advertising and open competitive bidding, shall, after the bids are opened, send a tabulation of the bids and its recommendations for award to the Area Manager. The allowable project costs of the work, on which the Federal participation is computed, may not be more than the bid of the lowest responsible bidder. The sponsor may not accept a bid by a contractor whose name appears on the current list of ineligible contractors published by the Comptroller General of the United States under § 5.6(b) of Title 29 of the regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR part 5), or a bid by any firm, corporation, partnership, or association in which that contractor has a substantial interest.
(f)
Secretary of Labor's interpretations apply.
Where applicable by their terms, the regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR 5.20-5.32) interpreting the fringe benefit provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act apply to this section.

§ 151.55
Accounting and audit.
(a) Each sponsor shall establish and maintain, for each individual project, an adequate accounting record to allow appropriate personnel of the FAA to determine all funds received (including funds of the sponsor and funds received from the United States or other sources), and to determine the allowability of all incurred costs of the project. The sponsor shall segregate and group project costs so that it can
furnish, on due notice, cost information in the following cost classifications:
(1) Purchase price or value of land.
(2) Incidental costs of land acquisition.
(3) Costs of contract construction.
(4) Costs of force account construction.
(5) Engineering costs of plans and designs.
(6) Engineering costs of supervision and inspection.
(7) Other administrative costs.
(b) The sponsor shall obtain and retain in its files for a period of three years after the date of the final grant payment, documentary evidence such as invoices, cost estimates, and payrolls supporting each item of project costs.
(c) The sponsor shall retain, for a period of three years after the date of the final grant payment, evidence of all payments for items of project costs including vouchers, cancelled checks or warrants, and receipts for cash payments.
(d) The sponsor shall allow the Administrator and the Comptroller General of the United States, or an authorized representative of either of them, access to any of its books, documents, papers, and records that are pertinent to grants received under the Federal-aid Airport Program for the purposes of accounting and audit. Appropriate FAA personnel may make progress audits at any time during the project, upon notice to the sponsor. If work is suspended on the project for an appreciable period of time, an audit will be made before any semi-final payment is made. In each case an audit is made before the final payment.
[Docket 1329, 27 FR 12351, Dec. 13, 1962, as amended by Amdt. 151-8, 30 FR 8040, June 23, 1965]
§ 151.57
Grant payments: General.
(a) An application for a grant payment is made on FAA Form 5100-6, accompanied by—
(1) A summary of project costs on Form FAA-1630;
(2) A periodic cost estimate on Form FAA-1629 for each contract representing costs for which payment is requested; and
(3) Any supporting information, including appraisals of property interests, that the FAA needs to determine the allowability of any costs for which payment is requested.
(b) Contractor's certifications. Each application that involves work performed by a contractor must contain, in the contractor's certification in the periodic cost estimate, a statement that “there has been full compliance with all labor provisions included in the contract identified above and in all subcontracts made under that contract”, and, in the case of a substantial dispute as to the nature of the contractor's or a subcontractor's obligation under the labor provisions of the contract or a subcontract, and additional phrase “except insofar as a substantial dispute exists with respect to these provisions”.
(c) If a contractor or subcontractor fails or refuses to comply with the labor provisions of the contract with the sponsor, further grant payments to the sponsor are suspended until the violations stop, until the Administrator determines the allowability of the project costs to which the violations related, or, to the extent that the violations consist of underpayments to labor, until the sponsor furnishes satisfactory assurances to the FAA that restitution has been or will be made to the affected employees.
(d) If, upon final determination of the allowability of all project costs of a project, it is found that the total of grant payments to the sponsor was more than the total United States share of the allowable costs of the project, the sponsor shall promptly return the excess to the FAA.
[Docket 1329, 27 FR 12351, Dec. 13, 1962, as amended by Amdt. 151-4, 29 FR 11336, Aug. 6, 1964; Amdt. 151-8, 30 FR 8040, June 23, 1965; Amdt. 151-17, 31 FR 16525, Dec. 28, 1966; Amdt. 151-32, 34 FR 9617, June 19, 1969]
§ 151.59
Grant payments: Land acquisition.
If an approved project includes land acquisition as an item of airport development, the sponsor may, at any time after executing the grant agreement and after title evidence has been approved by the Administrator for the property interest for which payment is
requested, apply to the FAA, through the Area Manager, for payment of the United States share of the allowable project costs of the acquisition, including any acquisition that is completed before executing the grant agreement and is part of the airport development included in the project.
§ 151.61
Grant payments: Partial.
(a) Subject to the final determination of allowable project costs as provided in § 151.63 partial grant payments for project costs may be made to a sponsor upon application. Unless previously agreed otherwise, a sponsor may apply for partial payments on a monthly basis. The payments may be paid, upon application, on the basis of the costs of airport development that is accomplished or on the basis of the estimated cost of airport development expected to be accomplished.
(b) Except as otherwise provided, partial grant payments are made in amounts large enough to bring the aggregate amount of all partial payments to the estimated United States share of the project costs of the airport development accomplished under the project as of the date of the sponsor's latest application for payment. In addition, if the sponsor applies, a partial grant payment is made as an advance payment in an amount large enough to bring the aggregate amount of all partial payments to the estimated United States share of the estimated project costs of the airport development expected to be accomplished within 30 days after the date of the sponsor's application for advance payment. However, no partial payment may be made in an amount that would bring the aggregate amount of all partial payments for the project to more than 90 percent of the estimated United States share of the total estimated cost of all airport development included in the project, but not including contingency items, or 90 percent of the maximum obligation of the United States as stated in the grant agreement, whichever amount is the lower. In determining the amount of a partial grant payment, those project costs that the Administrator considers to be of questionable allowability are deducted both from the amount of proj- ect costs incurred and from the amount of the estimated total project cost.
§ 151.63
Grant payments: Semifinal and final.
(a) Whenever airport development on a project is delayed or suspended for an appreciable period of time for reasons beyond the sponsor's control and the allowability of the project costs of all airport development completed has been determined on the basis of an audit and review of all costs, a semifinal grant payment may be made in an amount large enough to bring the aggregate amount of all partial grant payments for the project to the United States share of all allowable project costs incurred, even if the amount is more than the 90 percent limitation prescribed in § 151.61(b). However, it may not be more than the maximum obligation of the United States as stated in the grant agreement.
(b) Whenever the project is completed in accordance with the grant agreement, the sponsor may apply for final payment. The final payment is made to the sponsor if—
(1) A final inspection of all work at the airport site has been made jointly by the Area Manager and representatives of the sponsor and the contractor, unless the Area Manager agrees to a different procedure for final inspection.
(2) A final audit of the project account has been completed by appropriate personnel of the FAA; and
(3) The sponsor has furnished final “as constructed” plans, unless otherwise agreed to by the Administrator.
(c) Based upon the final inspection, the final audit, the plans, and the documents and supporting information required by § 151.57(a), the Administrator determines the total amount of the allowable project costs and pays the sponsor the United States' share, less the total amount of all prior payments.
§ 151.65
Memoranda and hearings.
(a) At any time before the FAA issues a grant offer for a project, any public agency or person having a substantial interest in the disposition of the project application may file a memorandum supporting or opposing it with the Area Manager of the area in
which the project is located. In addition, that public agency or person may request a public hearing on the location of the airport to be developed. If, in the Administrator's opinion, that public agency or person has a substantial interest in the matter, a public hearing is held.
(b) The Administrator sets the time and place of each hearing under this section, to avoid undue delay in disposing of the application, to afford reasonable time for all parties concerned to prepare for it, and to hold it at a place convenient to the sponsor. Notice of the time and place is mailed to the public agency or person filing the memorandum, the sponsor, and any other necessary persons.
(c) The purpose of the hearing is to help the Administrator discover facts relating to the location of the airport that is proposed to be developed under an application pending before him. There are no adverse parties or interests and no defendant or respondent. They are not hearings for the purposes of 5 U.S.C. 554, 556, and 557, and do not terminate in an adjudication as defined in that Act.
(d) Each hearing under this section is conducted by a hearing officer designated by the Administrator. The hearing officer decides the length of the hearing, the kind of testimony to be heard, and all other matters respecting the conduct of the hearing. The hearing is recorded in a manner determined by the hearing officer and the record becomes a part of the record of the project application. The Administrator's decision is not made solely on the basis of the hearing, but on all relevant facts.

§ 151.75
Preparation of site.
(a) Grading, drainage, and associated items of site preparation are eligible for inclusion in a project, but only with respect to one landing strip at any airport, unless the airport qualifies for more than one runway, based on traffic volume or wind conditions (as outlined in § 151.77) and the overall site preparation required for development in accordance with the airport layout plan. The complete clearance of runway clear zone areas is desirable, but, as a minimum, all obstructions as determined by § 77.23 as applied to § 77.27 (b) and (c) of this chapter must be removed. Grading in runway clear zones is eligible only to remove terrain that is an obstruction. The clear zone is not a graded overrun area. Specific site preparation for an airport terminal building is eligible on the same basis as the building itself. The site preparation cost is prorated based on eligible and ineligible building space. Appendix B of this part sets forth typical eligible and ineligible items of site preparation as covered by this section.
(b) For the purposes of this section, eligible drainage work off the airport site includes drainage outfalls, drainage disposal, and interception ditches. If there is damage to adjacent property, its correction is an eligible item for inclusion in the project.

§ 151.77
Runway paving: General rules.
(a) On any airport, paving of the designated instrument landing runway (or dominant runway if there is no designated instrument runway) is eligible for inclusion in a project, within the limits of the current National Airport Plan. Program participation in constructing, reconstructing or resurfacing is limited to a single runway at each airport, unless more than one runway is eligible under a standard in § 151.79 or § 151.80.
(b) The kinds of runway paving that are eligible for inclusion in a project include pavement construction and reconstruction, and include runway grooving to improve skid resistance, and resurfacing to increase the load bearing capacity of the runway or to provide a leveling course to correct major irregularities in the pavement. Runway resealing or refilling joints as an ordinary maintenance matter are not eligible items, except for bituminous resurfacing consisting of at least 100 pounds of plant-mixed material for each square yard, and except for the application of a bituminous surface treatment (two applications of material and cover aggregate as prescribed in FAA Specification P-609) on a pavement the current surface of which consists of that kind of a bituminous surface treatment.
(c) On new pavement construction, the applying of a bituminous seal coat on plant hot-mix bituminous surfaces only, is an eligible item only if initial engineering analysis and design indicate the need for a seal coat. However, any delay in applying it that is caused other than by construction difficulties, makes the application a maintenance item that is not eligible.
(d) In any case in which the need for a seal coat is necessary for a new runway extension or partial reconstruction of a runway, the entire runway may be sealed.
(e) Appendix C to this part sets forth typical eligible and ineligible items of runway paving.

§ 151.79
Runway paving: Second runway; wind conditions.
(a)
All airports.
Paving a second runway on the basis of wind conditions is eligible for inclusion in a project only if the sponsor shows that—
(1) The airport meets the applicable standards of paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section;
(2) The operational experience, and the economic factors of air traffic at the location, justify an additional runway for the airport; and
(3) The second runway is oriented with the existing paved runway to achieve the maximum wind coverage, with due consideration to the airport noise factor, topography, soil conditions, and other pertinent factors affecting the economy and efficiency of the runway development.
(b)
Airports serving large and small aircraft.
The airport serves both large and small aircraft and the existing paved runway is subject to a crosswind component of more than 15 miles per hour (13 knots) more than 5 percent of the time.
(c)
Airports serving small aircraft only.
The airport serves small aircraft exclusively, and—
(1) The airport has 10,000, or more, aircraft operations each year; and
(2) The existing paved runway is subject to a crosswind component of more than 12 miles per hour (10.5 knots) more than 5 percent of the time.
(d)
Airports serving aircraft of less than 8,000 pounds only.
The airport serves small aircraft of less than 8,000 pounds maximum certificated takeoff weight exclusively and—
(1) The airport has 5,000, or more, aircraft operations each year; and
(2) The existing paved runway is subject to a crosswind component of more than 12 miles per hour (10.5 knots) more than 5 percent of the time.

§ 151.80
Runway paving: Additional runway; other conditions.
Paving an additional runway on an airport that does not qualify for a second runway under § 151.79 is eligible if the Administrator, upon consideration on a case-to-case basis, is satisfied that—
(a) The volume of traffic justifies an additional paved runway and the layout and orientation of the additional runway will expedite traffic; or
(b) A combination of traffic volume and aircraft noise problems justifies an additional paved runway for that airport.
[Amdt. 151-17, 31 FR 16525, Dec. 28, 1966]
§ 151.81
Taxiway paving.
(a) The construction, alteration, and repair of taxiways needed to expedite the flow of ground traffic between runways and aircraft parking areas available for general public use are eligible items under the program. Taxiways to serve an area or facility that is primarily for the exclusive or near exclusive use of a tenant or operator that does not furnish aircraft servicing to the public are not eligible. In addition, the policies on resealing or refilling joints, as set forth in § 151.77, apply also to taxiway paving.
(b) Appendix D of this part sets forth typical eligible and ineligible items of taxiway paving.
§ 151.83
Aprons.
(a) The construction, alteration, and repair of aprons are eligible program items upon being shown that they are needed as public use facilities. An apron to serve an area that is primarily for the exclusive or near exclusive use of a tenant or operator who does not furnish aircraft servicing to the public is not eligible. In addition, the policies on resealing or refilling joints, as set forth in § 151.77 apply also to apron paving.
(b) In determining public use for the purposes of this section, the current
use being made of a hangar governs, unless there is definite information regarding its future use. In the case of an apron area being built for future hangars, it should be shown that early hangar development is assured and that the hangars will be public facilities.
(c) Appendix E of this part sets forth typical eligible and ineligible items of apron paving.
§ 151.85
Special treatment areas.
The following special treatment for areas adjacent to pavement is eligible for inclusion in a project in cases where, due to the operation of turbojet powered aircraft, it may be necessary to treat those areas adjacent to runway ends, holding aprons, and taxiways to prevent erosion from the blast effects of the turbojet:
(a) Runway ends—a stabilized area the width of the runway and extending 100 to 150 feet from the end of the runway.
(b) Holding aprons—a stabilized area up to 50 feet from the edge of the pavement.
(c) Taxiway intersections—a stabilized area 25 feet on each side of the taxiway and extending 300 feet from the intersection.
(d) Taxiway (continuous movement of aircraft)—dense turf 25 feet on each side of the taxiway, or in a geographic area where dense turf cannot be established, stabilization.
§ 151.86
Lighting and electrical work: General.
(a) The installing of lighting facilities and related electrical work, as provided in § 151.87, is eligible for inclusion in a project only if the Administrator determines, for the particular airport involved, that they are needed to ensure—
(1) Its safe and efficient use by aircraft under § 151.13; or
(2) Its continued operation and adequate maintenance, and it has a large enough volume (actual or potential) of night operations.
(b) Before the Administrator makes a grant offer to the sponsor of a project that includes installing lighting facilities and related electrical work under paragraph (a) of this section, the sponsor must—
(1) Provide in the project for removing, relocating, or adequately marking and lighting, each obstruction in the approach and turning zones, as provided in § 151.91(a);
(2) Acknowledge its awareness of the cost of operating and maintaining airport lighting; and
(3) Agree to operate the airport lighting installed—
(i) Throughout each night of the year; or
(ii) According to a satisfactory plan of operation, submitted under paragraph (c) of this section.
(c) The sponsor of a project that includes installing airport lighting and related electrical work, under paragraph (a) of this section, may—
(1) Submit to the Administrator a proposed plan of operation of the airport lighting installed for periods less than throughout each night of the year;
(2) Specify, in the proposed plan, the times when the airport lighting installed will be operated; and
(3) Satisfy the Administrator that the proposed plan provides for safety in air commerce, and justifies the investment of Program funds.
(d) Paragraph (b)(3) of this section also applies to each sponsor of a project that includes installing airport lighting and related electrical work if that sponsor has not entered into a grant agreement for the project before September 5, 1968.

§ 151.87
Lighting and electrical work: Standards.
(a)-(b) [Reserved]
(c) The number of runways that are eligible for lighting is the same as the number eligible for paving under § 151.77, § 151.79, or § 151.80.
(d) The installing of high intensity runway edge lighting is eligible on a designated instrument landing runway and any other runway with approved straight-in approach procedures. A runway that is eligible for lighting, but does not meet the requirements for 75 percent U.S. participation under § 151.43(d), is eligible for 50 percent U.S. participation in the costs of high intensity runway edge lighting (or the allowable percentage in § 151.43(c) for public land States), if the airport is served by a navigational aid that will allow using instrument approach procedures. If a runway is not eligible for 75 or 50 percent Federal participation in high intensity runway edge lighting but is otherwise eligible for runway lighting, the U.S. share of the cost of runway edge lighting is 50 percent of the cost of the lighting installed but not more than 50 percent of the cost of medium intensity lighting.
(e) In-runway lighting (touchdown zone lighting system, and centerline lighting system) is eligible on the designated instrument landing runway.
(f) Taxiways to eligible runways on airports served by transport aircraft are eligible for lighting. On airports serving only general aviation, the lighting of connecting taxiways is eligible if the runway served is lighted or is programed to be lighted. The lighting of a parallel taxiway is eligible if the taxiway is eligible for paving. Lighting of other taxiways is eligible or not, depending on the complexity of the taxiway system.
(g) Floodlighting of aprons is eligible if there is a proven need for it, including a showing of night operations where the runway is lighted.
(h) Any airport that is eligible to participate in the costs of runway lighting is eligible for the installing of an airport beacon, lighted wind indicator, obstruction lights, lighting control equipment, and other components of basic airport lighting, including separate transformer vaults and connection to the nearest available power source.
(i) The interconnection of two or more power sources on an airport property, the providing of second sources of power, and the installing of standby engine generators of reasonable capacity, are eligible under the program.
(j) Economy approach lighting aids are eligible for inclusion in a project at an airport that will not qualify within the next three years for approach lighting aids installed by FAA under the Facilities and Equipment Program if the economy approach lighting aids—
(1) Will correct a visual deficiency on one of the lighted runways of the airport; or
(2) Will permit operations at an airport at lower minimums.
“Economy approach lighting aids” includes a medium intensity approach lighting system (MALS) that may include a sequence flasher (SF); a runway end identifier lights system (REILS): and an abbreviated visual approach slope indicator (AVASI).
(k) Appendix F of this part sets forth typical eligible and ineligible items of airport lighting covered by § 151.86 and this section.

§ 151.89
Roads.
(a) Federal-aid Airport Program funds may not be used to resolve highway problems. Only those airport entrance roads that are definitely needed and are intended only as a way in and out of the airport are eligible.
(b) The construction, alteration, and repair of airport roads and streets that are entirely within the airport boundaries are eligible under the program, if needed for operating and maintaining the airport. In the case of an entrance road, a strip right-of-way joining the main body of the airport to the nearest public road may be considered a part of the normal boundary of the airport if—
(1) Adequate title is obtained;
(2) It was acquired to provide an airport entrance road and was not, before the existence of the airport, a public thoroughfare;
(3) The entrance road is intended only as a way in and out of the airport; and
(4) The entrance road extends only to the nearest public highway, road, or street.
(c) An entrance road may be joined to an existing highway or street with a normal fillet connection. However, acceleration-deceleration strips or grade separations are not eligible.
(d) Offsite road or street relocation needed to allow airport development or to remove an obstruction, and is not for entrance road purposes, is eligible.
(e) Appendix G sets forth typical eligible and ineligible items of road construction covered by this section.
§ 151.91
Removal of obstructions.
(a) The removal or relocation, or both, of obstructions, as defined in Technical Standard Order N18 is eligible under the Program in cases where definite arrangements are made to prevent the obstruction from being recreated. In a case where removal is not feasible, the cost of marking or lighting it is eligible. The removal and relocation of structures necessary for essential airport development is eligible. The removal of structures that are not obstructions under § 77.23 of this chapter as applied to § 77.27 of this chapter are eligible when they are located within a runway clear zone.
(b) The removal and relocation of an airport hangar that is an airport hazard (as described in § 151.39(b)) is eligible, if the reerected hangar will be substantially identical to the disassembled one.
(c) Whenever a hangar must be relocated (either for clearance of the site for other airport development or to remove a hazard) and the existing structure is to be relocated with or without disassembly, the cost of the relocation is an eligible item of project costs, including costs incidental to the relocation such as necessary footings and floors. However, if the existing structure is to be demolished and a new hangar is to be built, only the cost of demolishing the existing hangar is an eligible item.

§ 151.93
Buildings; utilities; sidewalks; parking areas; and landscaping.
(a) Only buildings or parts of buildings intended to house facilities or activities directly related to the safety of persons at the airport, including fire and rescue equipment buildings, are eligible items under the Federal-aid Airport Program. To the extent they are necessary to house snow removal and abrasive spreading equipment, and to provide minimum protection for abrasive materials, field maintenance equipment buildings are eligible items in any airport development project for an airport in a location having a mean daily minimum temperature of zero degrees Fahrenheit, or less, for at least 20 days each year for the 5 years preceding the year when Federal aid is requested under § 151.21(a), based on the statistics of the U.S. Department of Commerce Weather Bureau if available, or other evidence satisfactory to the Administrator.
(b) Airport utility construction, installation, and connection are eligible under the Federal-aid Airport Program as follows:
(1) An airport utility serving only eligible areas and facilities is eligible; and
(2) An airport utility serving both eligible and ineligible airport areas and facilities is eligible only to the extent of the additional cost of providing the capacity needed for eligible areas and facilities over and above the capacity necessary for the ineligible areas and facilities.
However, a water system is eligible only to the extent necessary to provide fire protection for aircraft operations, and to provide water for a fire and rescue equipment building.
(c) No part of the constructing, altering, or repairing (including grading, drainage, and other site preparation work) of a facility or area that is to be used as a public parking facility for passenger automobiles is eligible for inclusion in a project.
(d) Landscaping is not eligible for inclusion in a project. However, the establishment of turf on graded areas and special treatment to prevent slope erosion is eligible to the extent of the eligibility of the facilities or areas served, preserved, or protected by the turf or treatment. In the case of turfing or treatment for an area or facility that is partly eligible and partly ineligible, the eligibility of the turfing or treatment is established on a pro rata basis.
(e) The construction of sidewalks is not eligible for inclusion in a project.

§ 151.95
Fences; distance markers; navigational and landing aids; and offsite work.
(a) Boundary or perimeter fences for security purposes are eligible for inclusion in a project.
(b) A blast fence is eligible for inclusion in a project whenever—
(1) It is necessary for safety at a runway end or a holding area near the end of a runway and its installation would be more economical than the acquiring of additional property interests; or
(2) Its installation for safety at a turbojet-passenger gate will result in less separation being needed for gate positions, thereby reducing the need for apron expansion, and it is more economical to build the fence than to expand the apron.
(c) The eligibility of runway distance markers for inclusion in a project is decided on a case-by-case basis.
(d) The relocation of navigational aids is eligible for inclusion in a proj- ect whenever necessitated by development on the airport under a Program project and the sponsor is responsible under FAA Order OA 6030.1 (Agency Order 53).
(e) The installation of any of the following landing aids is eligible for inclusion in a project:
(1) Segmented circle.
(2) Wind and landing direction indicators.
(3) Boundary markers.
(f) The initial marking of runway and taxiway systems is eligible for inclusion in a project. The remarking of existing runways or taxiways is eligible if—
(1) Present marking is obsolete under current FAA standards; or
(2) Present marking is obliterated by construction, alteration or repair work included in a FAAP project or by the required routing of construction equipment used therein.
However, apron marking that is not allied with runway and taxiway marking systems, is not eligible.
(g) The following offsite work performed outside of the boundaries of an airport or airport site is eligible for inclusion in a project:
(1) Removal of obstruction as provided in § 151.91.

§ 151.97
Maintenance and repair.
(a) Maintenance work is not airport development as defined in the Federal Airport Act and is not eligible for inclusion in the Program. Therefore, it is necessary in many cases that a determination be made whether particular proposed development is maintenance or repair. For the purpose of these determinations, maintenance includes any regular or recurring work necessary to preserve existing airport facilities in good condition, any work involved in cleaning or caring for existing airport facilities, and any incidental or minor repair work on existing airport facilities, such as—
(1) Mowing and fertilizing of turfed areas;
(2) Trimming and replacing of land- scaping material;
(3) Cleaning of drainage systems including ditches, pipes, catch basins, and replacing and restoring eroded
areas, except when caused by act of God or improper design;
(4) Painting of buildings (inside and outside) and replacement of damaged items normally anticipated;
(5) Repairing and replacing burned out or broken fixtures and cables, unless major reconstruction is needed;
(6) Paving repairs in localized areas, except where the size of the work is such that it constitutes a major repair item or is part of a reconstruction project; and
(7) Refilling joints and resealing surface of pavements.
(b) Repair includes any work not included in paragraph (a) of this section that is necessary to restore existing airport facilities to good condition or preserve them in good condition.
§ 151.99
Modifications of programming standards.
The Director, Airports, Service, or the Regional Director concerned may, on individual projects, when necessary for adaptation to meet local conditions, modify any standard set forth in or incorporated into this subpart, if he determines that the modification will provide an acceptable level of safety, economy, durability, or workmanship.

§ 151.123
Procedures: Offer; amendment; acceptance; advance planning agreement.
(a) The procedures and requirements of § 151.29 also apply to approved advance planning proposals. FAA's offer and the sponsor's acceptance constitute an advance planning grant agreement between the sponsor and the United States. The United States does not pay any of the advance planning costs incurred before the advance planning grant agreement is executed.
(b) No grant is made unless the sponsor intends to begin airport development within three years after the date of sponsor's written acceptance of a grant offer. The sponsor's intention must be evidenced by an appropriate written statement in the proposal.
§ 151.125
Allowable advance planning costs.
(a) The United States' share of the allowable costs of an advance planning proposal is stated in the advance planning grant agreement, but is not more than 50 percent of the total cost of the
necessary and reasonable planning and engineering services.
(b) The allowable advance planning costs consist of planning and engineering expenses necessarily incurred in effecting the advance planning proposal. Allowable cost items include—
(1) Location surveys, such as preliminary topographic and soil exploration;
(2) Site evaluation;
(3) Preliminary engineering, such as stage construction outlines, cost estimates, and cost/benefit evaluation reports;
(4) Contract drawings and specifications;
(5) Testing; and
(6) Incidental costs incurred to accomplish the proposal, that would not have been incurred otherwise.
(c) To qualify as allowable, the advance planning costs paid or incurred by the sponsor must be—
(1) Reasonably necessary and directly related to the planning or engineering included in the proposal as approved by FAA;
(2) Reasonable in amount; and
(3) Verified by sufficient evidence.
§ 151.127
Accounting and audit.
The requirements of § 151.55 relating to accounting and audit of project costs are also applicable to advance planning proposal costs. However, the requirement of segregating and grouping costs applies only to § 151.55(a) (5) and (7) classifications.
§ 151.129
Payments.
(a) The United States' share of advance planning costs is paid in two installments unless the advance planning grant agreement provides otherwise. Upon request by sponsor, the first payment may be made in an amount not more than 50 percent of the maximum obligation of the United States stipulated in the advance planning grant agreement upon certification by sponsor that 50 percent or more of the proposed work has been completed. The final payment is made upon the sponsor's request after—
(1) The conditions of the advance planning grant agreement have been met;
(2) Evidence of cost of each item has been submitted; and
(3) Audit of submitted evidence or audit of sponsor's records, if considered desirable by FAA, has been made.
(b) When the advance planning proposal relates to the selection of an airport site, the advance planning grant agreement provides that Federal funds are paid to the sponsor only after the site is selected and the Administrator is satisfied that the site selected for the airport is reasonably consistent with existing plans of public agencies for development of the area in which the site is located, and will contribute to the accomplishment of the purposes of the Federal-aid Airport Program.

# Appendix H to Part 151
There is set forth below the contract provision required by the regulations of the Secretary of Labor in part 5 of title 29 of the
Code of Federal Regulations. Section 151.49(a) requires sponsors to insert this provision in full in each construction contract.

# provision required by the regulations of the secretary of labor
A. Minimum wages.
(1) All mechanics and laborers employed or working upon the site of the work will be paid unconditionally and not less often than once a week, and without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account (except such payroll deductions as are permitted by regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor under the Copeland Act [29 CFR part 3]), the full amounts due at time of payment computed at wage rates not less than those contained in the wage determination decision(s) of the Secretary of Labor which is (are) attached hereto and made a part hereof, regardless of any contractual relationship which may be alleged to exist between the contractor and such laborers and mechanics; and the wage determination decision(s) shall be posted by the contractor at the site of the work in a prominent place where it (they) can be easily seen by the workers. For the purpose of this paragraph, contributions made or costs reasonably anticipated under section 1(b)(2) of the Davis-Bacon Act on behalf of laborers or mechanics are considered wages paid to such laborers or mechanics, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (4) below. Also for the purpose of this paragraph, regular contributions made or costs incurred for more than a weekly period under plans, funds, or programs, but covering the particular weekly period, are deemed to be constructively made or incurred during such weekly period (29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(i)).
(2) Any class of laborers or mechanics which is not listed in the wage determination(s) and which is to be employed under the contract, shall be classified or reclassified comformably to the wage determination(s), and a report of the action taken shall be sent by the [insert sponsor's name] to the FAA for approval and transmittal to the Secretary of Labor. In the event that the interested parties cannot agree on the proper classification or reclassification of a particular class of laborers and mechanics to be used, the question accompanied by the recommendation of the FAA shall be referred to the Secretary of Labor for final determination (29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(ii)).
(3) Whenever the minimum wage rate prescribed in the contract for a class of laborers or mechanics includes a fringe benefit which is not expressed as an hourly wage rate and the contractor is obligated to pay a cash equivalent of such a fringe benefit, an hourly cash equivalent thereof shall be established. In the event the interested parties cannot agree upon a cash equivalent of the fringe benefit, the question, accompanied by the recommendation of the FAA shall be referred to the Secretary of Labor for determination (29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(iii)).
(4) If the contractor does not make payments to a trustee or other third person, he may consider as part of the wages of any laborer or mechanic the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing benefits under a plan or program of a type expressly listed in the wage determination decision of the Secretary of Labor which is a part of this contract:
Provided, however,
The Secretary of Labor has found, upon the written request of the contractor, that the applicable standards of the Davis-Bacon Act have been met. The Secretary of Labor may require the contractor to set aside in a separate account assets for the meeting of obligations under the plan or program.
B. Withholding: FAA from sponsor.
Pursuant to the terms of the grant agreement between the United States and [insert sponsor's name], relating to Federal-aid Airport Project No. __, and part 151 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 151), the FAA may withhold or cause to be withheld from the [insert sponsor's name] so much of the accrued payments or advances as may be considered necessary to pay laborers and mechanics employed by the contractor or any subcontractor on the work the full amount of wages required by this contract. In the event of failure to pay any laborer or mechanic employed or working on the site of the work all or part of the wages required by this contract, the FAA may, after written notice to the [insert sponsor's name], take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased (29 CFR 5.5(a)(2)).
C. Payrolls and basic records.
(1) Payrolls and basic records relating thereto will be maintained during the course of the work and preserved for a period of three years thereafter for all laborers and mechanics working at the site of the work. Such records will contain the name and address of each such employee, his correct classification, rates of pay (including rates of contributions or costs anticipated of the types described in section 1(b)(2) of the Davis-Bacon Act), daily and weekly number of hours worked, deductions made and actual wages paid. Whenever the Secretary of Labor has found, under 29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(iv) (see subparagraph (4) of subparagraph (A) above), that the wages of any laborer or mechanic include the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing benefits under a plan or program described in section 1(b)(2)(B) of the Davis-Bacon Act, the contractor shall maintain records which show that the commitment to provide such benefits is enforceable, that the plan or program is financially responsible, and that the plan
or program has been communicated in writing to the laborers or mechanics affected, and records which show the costs anticipated or the actual cost incurred in providing such benefits (29 CFR 5.5(a)(3)(i)).
(2) The contractor will submit weekly a copy of all payrolls to the [insert sponsor's name] for transmission to the FAA, as required by § 151.53(a). The copy shall be accompanied by a statement signed by the employer or his agent indicating that the payrolls are correct and complete, that the wage rates contained therein are not less than those determined by the Secretary of Labor and that the classifications set forth for each laborer or mechanic conform with the work he performed. A submission of a “Weekly Statement of Compliance” which is required under this contract and the Copeland regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR part 3) and the filing with the initial payroll or any subsequent payroll of a copy of any findings by the Secretary of Labor, under 29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(iv) (see subparagraph (4) of paragraph (A) above), shall satisfy this requirement. The prime contractor shall be responsible for the submission of copies of payrolls of all subcontractors. The contractor will make the records required under the labor standards clauses of the contract available for inspection by authorized representatives of the FAA and the Department of Labor, and will permit such representatives to interview employees during working hours on the job (29 CFR 5.5(a)(3)(ii)).
D. Apprentices.
Apprentices will be permitted to work as such only when they are registered, individually, under a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State apprenticeship agency which is recognized by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, United States Department of Labor; or, if no such recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, United States Department of Labor. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program. Any employee listed on a payroll at an apprentice wage rate, who is not registered as above, shall be paid the wage rate determined by the Secretary of Labor for the classification of work he actually performed. The contractor or subcontractor will be required to furnish to the [insert sponsor's name] written evidence of the registration of his program and apprentices as well as of the appropriate ratios and wage rates, for the area of construction prior to using any apprentices on the contract work (29 CFR 5.5(a)(4)).
E. Compliance with Copeland Regulations.
The contractor shall comply with the Copeland Regulations (29 CFR part 3) of the Secretary of Labor which are herein incorporated by reference (29 CFR 5.5(a)(5)).
F. Overtime requirements.
No contractor or subcontractor contracting for any part of the contract work which may require or involve the employment of laborers or mechanics shall require or permit any laborer or mechanic in any workweek in which he is employed on such work to work in excess of eight hours in any calendar day or in excess of forty hours in such workweek unless such laborer or mechanic received compensation at a rate not less than one and one-half times his basic rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight hours in any calendar day or in excess of forty hours in such workweek, as the case may be (29 CFR 5.5(c)(1)).
G. Violations; liability for unpaid wages; liquidated damages.
In the event of any violation of paragraph F of this provision, the contractor and any subcontractor responsible therefore shall be liable to any affected employee for his unpaid wages. In addition, such contractor and subcontractor shall be liable to the United States for liquidated damages. Such liquidated damages shall be computed, with respect to each individual laborer or mechanic employed in violation of said paragraph F of this provision, in the sum of $10 for each calendar day on which such employee was required or permitted to work in excess of eight hours or in excess of the standard workweek of forty hours without payment of the overtime wages required by said paragraph F of this provision (29 CFR 5.5 (c)(2)).
H. Withholding for unpaid wages and liquidated damages, and priority of payment
(1) The FAA may withhold or cause to be withheld, from any moneys payable on account of work performed by the contractor or subcontractor, such sums as may administratively be determined to be necessary to satisfy any liabilities of such contractor or subcontractor for unpaid wages and liquidated damages as provided in paragraph G of this provision (29 CFR 5.5(c)(3)).
(2) In the event of failure or refusal of the contractor or any subcontractor to comply with overtime pay requirements of the Contract Work Hours Standards Act, if the funds withheld by the FAA for the violations are not sufficient to pay fully both the unpaid wages due laborers and mechanics and the liquidated damages due the United States, the available funds shall be used first to compensate the laborers and mechanics for the wages to which they are entitled (or an equitable portion thereof when the funds are not adequate for this purpose); and the balance, if any, shall be used for the payment of liquidated damages (29 CFR 5.14 (d)(2)).
I. Subcontracts.
The contractor will insert in each of his subcontracts the clauses contained in paragraphs A through H and J of this provision, and also a clause requiring
the subcontractors to include these provisions in any lower tier subcontracts which they may enter into, together with a clause requiring this insertion in any further subcontracts that may in turn be made (29 CFR 5.5(a)(6), 5.5(c)(4)).
J. Contract termination; debarment.
A breach of paragraphs A through I of this provision may be grounds for termination of the contract. A breach of paragraphs A through E and I may also be grounds for debarment as provided in 29 CFR 5.6 of the regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR 5.5(a)(8)).

# I. Contract Provisions Required by the Regulations of the Secretary of Labor
Each sponsor entering into a construction contract for an airport development project shall insert in the contract and any supplemental agreement:
(1) The provisions required by the Secretary of Labor, as set forth in paragraphs A through K;
(2) The provisions set forth in paragraph L, and
(3) Any other provisions necessary to ensure completion of the work in accordance with the grant agreement.
The provisions in paragraphs A through K and provision (5) in paragraph L need not be included in prime contracts of $2,000 or less.
A. Minimum wages.

For the purpose of this paragraph, contributions made or costs reasonably anticipated under section 1(b)(2) of the Davis-Bacon Act on behalf of laborers or mechanics are considered wages paid to such laborers or mechanics, subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) below. Also for the purpose of this paragraph, regular contributions made or costs incurred for more than a weekly period under plans, funds, or programs, but covering the particular weekly period, are deemed to be constructively made or incurred during such weekly period (29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(i)).
(2) Any class of laborers or mechanics, including apprentices and trainees, which is not listed in the wage determination(s) and which is to be employed under the contract, shall be classified or reclassified conformably to the wage determination(s), and a report of the action taken shall be sent by the [insert sponsor's name] to the FAA for approval and transmittal to the Secretary of Labor. In the event that the interested parties cannot agree on the proper classification or reclassification of a particular class of laborers and mechanics, including apprentices and trainees, to be used, the question accompanied by the recommendation of the FAA shall be referred to the Secretary of Labor for final determination (29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(ii)).
(3) Whenever the minimum wage rate prescribed in the contract for a class of laborers or mechanics includes a fringe benefit which is not expressed as an hourly wage rate and the contractor is obligated to pay a cash equivalent of such a fringe benefit, an hourly cash equivalent thereof shall be established. In the event the interested parties cannot agree upon a cash equivalent of the fringe benefit, the question accompanied by the recommendation of the FAA shall be referred to the Secretary of Labor for determination (29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(iii)).
(4) If the contractor does not make payments to a trustee or other third person, he may consider as part of the wages of any laborer or mechanic the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing benefits under a plan or program of a type expressly listed in the wage determination decision of the Secretary of Labor which is a part of this contract:
Provided, however,
the Secretary of Labor has found, upon written request of the contractor, that the applicable standards of the Davis-Bacon Act have been met. The Secretary of Labor may require the contractor to set aside in a separate account assets for the meeting of obligations under the plan or program (29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(iv)).

# Appendix C to Part 152—Procurement Procedures and Requirements
There is set forth below procurement procedures and requirements applicable to grants for airport development under the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970.
1.
General.
Each contract under a project must meet the requirements of local law and the requirements and standards contained in this appendix. The sponsor shall establish procedures for procurement of supplies, equipment, construction, and services funded under the project which meet the requirements of Attachment O of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-102 (44 FR 47874) and of this appendix. Subject to funding and time limitations, the FAA reviews the sponsor's procurement system to determine whether it may be certified in accordance with Attachment O of OMB Circular A-102.
2.
Out-of-state labor.
No procedure or requirement shall be imposed by any grantee which will operate to discriminate against the employment of labor from any other State, possession, or territory of the United States in the construction of a project.
3.
Bid guarantee.
All bids for construction or facility improvement in excess of $100,000 shall be accompanied by a bid guarantee consisting of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check or other negotiable instrument equivalent to five percent of the bid price as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the time specified.
4.
Construction work.
All construction work under a project must be performed under contract, except in a case where the Administrator determines that the project, or a part of it, can be more effectively and economically accomplished on a force account basis by the sponsor or by another public agency acting for or as agent of the sponsor.
5.
Change order.
Unless otherwise authorized by the Administrator, no sponsor may issue any change order under any of its construction contracts or enter into a supplemental agreement unless three copies of that order or agreement have been sent to, and approved by, the FAA.
6.
Beginning work.
No sponsor may allow a contractor or subcontractor to begin work under a project until—
a. The sponsor has furnished three conformed copies of the contract to the appropriate FAA office;
b. The sponsor has, if applicable, submitted a statement that comparable replacement housing, as defined in § 25.15 of the Regulations of the Office of the Secretary of Transportation, will be available within a reasonable period of time before displacement.
c. The appropriate FAA office has agreed to the issuance of a notice to proceed with the work to the contractor.
7.
Supervision and inspection.
No work will be commenced until the sponsor has provided for adequate supervision and inspection of construction and advised the appropriate FAA office.
8.
Engineering and planning services.
Unless otherwise authorized by the Administrator, each proposal for engineering and planning services shall be reviewed by FAA before the commencement of the development of design plans and specifications.
9.
Advertising general.
Unless the Administrator approves another method for use on a particular airport development project, each contract and supplemental agreement for construction work on a project in the amount of more than $10,000 must be awarded on the basis of public advertising and
open competitive bidding under the local law applicable to the letting of public contracts.
10.
Advertising: conditions and contents.
There may be no advertisement for bids on, or negotiation of, a construction contract or supplemental agreement until the Administrator has either approved the plans and specifications or accepted a certification in accordance with § 152.7 that they meet all applicable standards prescribed by this part. The advertisement shall inform the bidders of the equal employment opportunity requirements of part 152. Unless the estimated contract price or construction cost in $2,000 or less, there may be no advertisement for bids or negotiations until the Administrator has given the sponsor a copy of a decision of the Secretary of Labor establishing the minimum wage rates for skilled and unskilled labor under the proposed contract. In each case, a copy of the wage determination decision, including fringe benefits, must be set forth in the initial invitation for bids or proposed contract, or incorporated therein by reference to a copy set forth in the advertised or negotiated specifications.
11.
Procedures for obtaining wage determinations.
(a)
Specific request for wage determination.
At least 60 days before the intended date of advertising or negotiating of this section, the sponsor shall send to the appropriate FAA office, completed Department of Labor Form DB-11 or DB-11(a), as appropriate, with only the classifications needed in the performance of the work checked. General entries (such as “entire schedule” or “all applicable classifications”) may not be used. Additional necessary classifications not on the form may be typed in the blank spaces or on an attached separate list. A classification that can be fitted into classifications on the form, or a classification that is not generally recognized in the area or in the industry, may not be used. Except in areas where the wage patterns are clearly established, the Form must be accompanied by any available pertinent wage payment or locally prevailing fringe benefit information.
(b)
General wage determination.
Whenever the wage patterns in a particular area for a particular type of construction are well settled and whenever it may be reasonably anticipated that there will be a large volume of procurement in that area for that type of construction, the Secretary of Labor, upon the request of a Federal agency or in his discretion, may issue a general wage determination when, after consideration of the facts and circumstances involved, he finds that the applicable statutory standards and those of part 1, 29 CFR, subtitle A, will be met. This general wage determination is used for all projects located in the area and for the type of construction covered by the general wage determination.
12.
Advertising: wage determinations.
(a) Wage determinations are effective only for 120 days from the date of the determinations. If it appears that a determination may expire between bid opening and award, the sponsor shall so advise the FAA as soon as possible. If it wishes a new request for wage determination to be made and if any pertinent circumstances have changed, it shall submit the appropriate form of the Department of Labor and accompanying information. If it claims that the determination expires before award and after bid opening due to unavoidable circumstances, it shall submit proof of the facts which it claims support a finding to that effect.
(b) The Secretary of Labor may modify any wage determination before the award of the contract or contracts for which it was sought. If the proposed contract is awarded on the basis of public advertisement and open competitive bidding, any modification that the FAA receives less than 10 days before the opening of bids is not effective, unless the Administrator finds that there is reasonable time to notify bidders. A modification may not continue in effect beyond the effective period of the wage determination to which it relates. The Administrator sends any modification to the sponsor as soon as possible. If the modification is effective, it must be incorporated in the invitation for bids, by issuing an addendum to the specifications or otherwise.
13.
Awarding contracts.
(a) A sponsor may not award a construction contract without the written concurrence of the Administrator (through the appropriate FAA office) that the contract prices are reasonable. A sponsor that awards contracts on the basis of public advertising and open competitive bidding, shall, after the bids are opened, send a tabulation of the bids and its recommendations for award to the appropriate FAA office. The sponsor may not accept a bid by a contractor whose name appears on the current list of ineligible contractors published by the Comptroller General of the United States under § 5.6(b) of the regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR part 5), or a bid by any firm, corporation, partnership, or association in which an ineligible contractor has a substantial interest.
(b) A sponsor's proposed contract must have pre-award review and approval by the FAA in any of the following circumstances:
(1) The sponsor's procurement system is not in compliance with one or more significant aspects of Attachment O of OMB Circular A-102 or with the standards of this appendix.
(2) The procurement is expected to exceed $10,000 and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to solicitation.
(3) The procurement is expected to exceed $10,000 and specifies a “brand name” product.
(c) The FAA may require pre-award review and approval of a sponsor's proposed contract under any of the following circumstances:
(1) The sponsor's procurement system has not yet been reviewed by the FAA for compliance with OMB Circular A-102 and this appendix.
(2) The sponsor has requested pre-award assistance.
(3) The proposal is for automatic data processing in accordance with paragraph C1 of Attachment B to Federal Management Circular 74-4 (39 FR 27133; 43 FR 50977).
(4) The proposal is one of a series with the same firm.
(5) The proposal is to be performed outside the recipient's established procurement system or office.
(6) The proposal is for construction and is to be awarded through the negotiation procurement method or without competition.
14.
Force account work.
Before undertaking any force account construction work, the sponsor (or any public agency acting as agent for the sponsor) must obtain the written consent of the Administrator through the appropriate FAA office. In requesting that consent, the sponsor must submit—
(a) Adequate plans and specifications showing the nature and extent of the construction work to be performed under that force account;
(b) A schedule of the proposed construction and of the construction equipment that will be available for the project;
(c) Assurance that adequate labor, material, equipment, engineering personnel, as well as supervisory and inspection personnel as required by this appendix, will be provided; and
(d) A detailed estimate of the cost of the work, broken down for each class of costs involved, such as labor, materials, rental of equipment, and other pertinent items of cost.
15.
Each sponsor shall
—
(a) Include the equal opportunity clause required by 41 CFR 60-1.4(b) in each nonexempt construction contract and subcontract;
(b) Prior to the award of each nonexempt contract, require each prime contractor and subcontractor to submit the certification required by 41 CFR 60-1.8(b);
(c) Include the Notice of Requirement for Affirmative Action to Ensure Equal Employment Opportunity (Executive Order 11246) required by 41 CFR 60-4.2 in all solicitations for offers and bids on each nonexempt construction contract and subcontract;
(d) Include the Standard Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Construction Contract Specifications (Executive Order 11246) required by 41 CFR 60-4.3(a) in each nonexempt construction contract and subcontract.
16.
Exceptions.
(a) Paragraphs 1 through 5 and paragraphs 9 through 13 of this section do not apply to contracts with the owners of airport hazards, buildings, pipelines, powerlines, or other structures or facilities, for installing, extending, changing, removing, or relocating any of those structures or facilities. However, the sponsor must obtain the approval of the appropriate FAA office before entering into such a contract.
(b) Any oral or written agreement or understanding between a sponsor and another public agency that is not a sponsor of the project, under which that public agency undertakes construction work for or as agent of the sponsor, is not considered to be a construction contract for the purposes of this appendix.

18.
Conditions and limitations on airport use.
The Sponsor will operate the Airport as such for the use and benefit of the public. In furtherance of this covenant (but without limiting its general applicability and effect), the Sponsor specifically agrees that it will keep the Airport open to all types, kinds, and classes of aeronautical use on fair and reasonable terms without discrimination between such types, kinds, and classes.
Provided,
that the sponsor may establish such fair, equal, and not unjustly discriminatory conditions to be met by all users of the airport as may be necessary for the safe and efficient operation of the Airport; and
Provided further,
That the Sponsor may prohibit or limit any given type, kind, or class of aeronautical use of the Airport if such action is necessary for the safe operation of the Airport or necessary to serve the civil aviation needs of the public.
19.
Exclusive right.
The Sponsor—
a. Will not grant or permit any exclusive right forbidden by Section 308(a) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C. 1349(a)) at the Airport, or at any other airport now owned or controlled by it;
b. Agrees that, in furtherance of the policy of the FAA under this covenant, unless authorized by the Administrator, it will not, either directly or indirectly, grant or permit any person, firm or corporation the exclusive right at the Airport, or at any other airport now owned or controlled by it, to conduct any aeronautical activities, including, but not limited to charter flights, pilot training, aircraft rental and sightseeing, aerial photography, crop dusting, aerial advertising and surveying, air carrier operations, aircraft sales and services, sale of aviation petroleum products whether or not conducted in conjunction with other aeronautical activity, repair and maintenance of aircraft, sale of aircraft parts, and any other activities which because of their direct relationship to the operation of aircraft can be regarded as an aeronautical activity.
c. Agrees that it will terminate any existing exclusive right to engage in the sale of gasoline or oil, or both, granted before July 17, 1962, at such an airport, at the earliest renewal, cancellation, or expiration date applicable to the agreement that established the exclusive right; and
d. Agrees that it will terminate any other exclusive right to conduct an aeronautical activity now existing at such an airport before the grant of any assistance under the Airport and Airway Development Act.
20.
Public use and benefit.
The Sponsor agrees that it will operate the Airport for the use and benefit of the public, on fair and reasonable terms, and without unjust discrimination. In furtherance of the covenant (but without limiting its general applicability and effect), the Sponsor specifically covenants and agrees:
a. That in its operation and the operation of all facilities on the Airport, neither it nor any person or organization occupying space or facilities thereon will discriminate against any person or class of persons by reason of race, color, creed, or national origin in the use of any of the facilities provided for the public on the Airport.
b. That in any agreement, contract, lease or other arrangement under which a right or privilege at the Airport is granted to any person, firm, or corporation to conduct or engage in any aeronautical activity for furnishing services to the public at the Airport, the Sponsor will insert and enforce provisions requiring the contractor—
(1) To furnish said service on a fair, equal, and not unjustly discriminatory basis to all users thereof, and
(2) To charge fair, reasonable, and not unjustly discriminatory prices for each unit or service; Provided, That the contractor may be allowed to make reasonable and nondiscriminatory discounts, rebates, or other similar types of price reductions to volume purchasers.
c. That it will not exercise or grant any right or privilege which would operate to prevent any person, firm or corporation operating aircraft on the Airport from performing any services on its own aircraft with its own employees (including, but not limited to maintenance and repair) that it may choose to perform.
d. In the event the Sponsor itself exercises any of the rights and privileges referred to in subsection b, the services involved will be provided on the same conditions as would apply to the furnishing of such services by contractors or concessionaires of the Sponsor under the provisions of such subsection b.
21.
Nonaviation activities.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit the granting or exercise of an exclusive right for the furnishing of nonaviation products and supplies or any service of a nonaeronautical nature or to obligate the Sponsor to furnish any particular nonaeronautical service at the Airport.
22.
Operation and maintenance of the airport.
The Sponsor will operate and maintain in a safe and serviceable condition the Airport and all facilities thereon and connected therewith which are necessary to serve the aeronautical users of the Airport other than facilities owned or controlled by the United
States, and will not permit any activity thereon which would interfere with its use for airport purposes;
Provided,
That nothing contained herein shall be construed to require that the Airport be operated for aeronautical uses during temporary periods when snow, flood, or other climatic conditions interfere with such operation and maintenance; and
Provided further,
That nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the maintenance, repair, restoration or replacement of any structure or facility which is substantially damaged or destroyed due to an act of God or other condition or circumstance beyond the control of the Sponsor. In furtherance of this covenant the sponsor will have in effect at all times arrangements for—
a. Operating the airport's aeronautical facilities whenever required;
b. Promptly marking and lighting hazards resulting from airport conditions, including temporary conditions; and
c. Promptly notifying airmen of any condition affecting aeronautical use of the Airport.
23.
Airport Hazards.
Insofar as it is within its power and reasonable, the Sponsor will, either by the acquisition and retention of easements or other interests in or rights for the use of land or airspace or by the adoption and enforcement of zoning regulations, prevent the construction, erection, alteration, or growth of any structure, tree, or other object in the approach areas of the runways of the Airport, which would constitute an airport hazard.
In addition, the Sponsor will not erect or permit the erection of any permanent structure or facility which would interfere materially with the use, operation, or future development of the Airport, in any portion of a runway approach area in which the Sponsor has acquired, or hereafter acquires, property interests permitting it to so control the use made of the surface of the land.
24.
Use of adjacent land.
Insofar as it is within its power and reasonable, the Sponsor will, either by the acquisition and retention of easements or other interests in or rights for the use of land or airspace or by the adoption and enforcement of zoning regulations, take action to restrict the use of land adjacent to or in the immediate vicinity of the Airport to activities and purposes compatible with normal airport operations including landing and takeoff of aircraft.
25.
Airport layout plan.
The Sponsor will keep up to date at all times an airport layout plan of the Airport showing (1) boundaries of the Airport and all proposed additions thereto, together with the boundaries of all offsite areas owned or controlled by the Sponsor for airport purposes, and proposed additions thereto; (2) the location and nature of all existing and proposed airport facilities and structures (such as runways, taxiways, aprons, terminal buildings, hangars and roads), including all proposed extensions and reductions of existing airport facilities; and (3) the location of all existing and proposed nonaviation areas and of all existing improvements thereon. Such airport layout plan and each amendment, revision, or modification thereof, shall be subject to the approval of the FAA, which approval shall be evidenced by the signature of a duly authorized representative of the FAA on the face of the airport layout plan. The Sponsor will not make or permit any changes or alterations in the airport or in any of its facilities other than in conformity with the airport layout plan as so approved by the FAA, if such changes or alterations might adversely affect the safety, utility, or efficiency of the Airport.
26.
Federal use of facilities.
All facilities of the Airport developed with Federal aid and all those usable for the landing and taking off of aircraft, will be available to the United States at all times, without charge, for use by government aircraft in common with other aircraft, except that if the use by government aircraft is substantial, a reasonable share, proportional to such use, of the cost of operating and maintaining facilities so used, may be charged. Unless otherwise determined by the FAA, or otherwise agreed to by the Sponsor and the using agency, substantial use of an airport by government aircraft will be considered to exist when operations of such aircraft are in excess of those which, in the opinion of the FAA, would unduly interfere with use of the landing area by other authorized aircraft, or during any calendar month that—
a. Five (5) or more government aircraft are regularly based at the airport or on land adjacent thereto; or
b. The total number of movements (counting each landing as a movement and each takeoff as a movement) of government aircraft is 300 or more, or the gross accumulative weight of government aircraft using the Airport (the total movements of government aircraft multiplied by gross certified weights of such aircraft) is in excess of five million pounds.
27.
Areas for FAA Use.
Whenever so requested by the FAA, the Sponsor will furnish without cost to the Federal Government, for construction, operation, and maintenance of facilities for air traffic control activities, or weather reporting activities and communication activities related to air traffic control, such areas of land or water, or estate therein, or rights in buildings of the Sponsor as the FAA may consider necessary or desirable for construction at Federal expense of space or facilities for such purposes. The approximate amounts of areas and the nature of the property interests and/or rights so required
will be set forth in the Grant Agreement relating to the project. Such areas or any portion thereof will be made available as provided herein within 4 months after receipt of written requests from the FAA.
28.
Fee and rental structure.
The airport operator or owner will maintain a fee and rental structure for the facilities and services being provided the airport users which will make the Airport as self-sustaining as possible under the circumstances existing at the Airport, taking into account such factors as the volume of traffic and economy of collection.
29.
Reports to FAA.
The Sponsor will furnish the FAA with such annual or special airport financial and operational reports as may be reasonably requested. Such reports may be submitted on forms furnished by the FAA, or may be submitted in such manner as the Sponsor elects so long as the essential data are furnished. The Airport and all airport records and documents affecting the Airport, including deeds, leases, operation and use agreements, regulations, and other instruments, will be made available of inspection and audit by the Secretary and the Comptroller General of the United States, or their duly authorized representatives, upon reasonable request. The Sponsor will furnish to the FAA or to the General Accounting Office, upon request, a true copy of any such document.
30.
System of accounting.
All project accounts and records will be kept in accordance with a standard system of accounting if so prescribed by the Secretary.
31.
Interfering right.
If at any time it is determined by the FAA that there is any outstanding right or claim of right in or to the Airport property, other than those set forth in Part II of the Application for Federal Assistance, the existence of which creates an undue risk of interference with the operation of the Airport or the performance of the covenants of this part, the sponsor will acquire, extinguish, or modify such right or claim of right in a manner acceptable to the FAA.
32.
Performance obligation.
The Sponsor will not enter into any transaction which would operate to deprive it of any of the rights and powers necessary to perform any or all of the covenants made herein, unless by such transaction the obligation to perform all such covenants is assumed by another public agency found by the FAA to be eligible under the Act and Regulations to assume such obligations and having the power, authority, and financial resources to carry out all such obligations. If an arrangement is made for management or operation of the Airport by any agency or person other than the Sponsor or an employee of the Sponsor, the Sponsor will reserve sufficient rights and authority to insure that the Airport will be operated and maintained in accordance with the Act, the Regulations, and these covenants.
33.
Meaning of terms.
Unless the context otherwise requires, all terms used in these covenants which are defined in the Act and the Regulations shall have the meanings assigned to them therein.
B.
Airport Layout Plan Approval.

Docket 1329, 27 FR 12361, Dec. 13, 1962, unless otherwise noted.
§ 155.1
Applicability.
This part applies to releases from terms, conditions, reservations, or restrictions in any deed, surrender of leasehold, or other instrument of transfer or conveyance (in this part called “instrument of disposal”) by which some right, title, or interest of the United States in real or personal property was conveyed to a non-Federal public agency under section 13 of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (58 Stat. 765; 61 Stat. 678) to be used by that agency in developing, improving, operating, or maintaining a public airport or to provide a source of revenue from non-aviation business at a public airport.
§ 155.3
Applicable law.
(a) Section 4 of the Act of October 1, 1949 (63 Stat. 700) authorizes the Administrator to grant the releases described in § 155.1, if he determines that—
(1) The property to which the release relates no longer serves the purpose for which it was made subject to the terms, conditions, reservations, or restrictions concerned; or
(2) The release will not prevent accomplishing the purpose for which the property was made subject to the terms, conditions, reservations, or restrictions, and is necessary to protect or advance the interests of the United States in civil aviation.
In addition, section 4 of that Act authorizes the Administrator to grant the releases subject to terms and conditions that he considers necessary to protect or advance the interests of the United States in civil aviation.
(b) Section 2 of the Act of October 1, 1949 (63 Stat. 700) provides that the restrictions against using structures for industrial purposes in any instrument of disposal issued under section 13(g)(2)(A) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as amended (61 Stat. 678) are considered to be extinguished. In addition, section 2 authorizes the Administrator to issue any instruments of release or conveyance necessary to remove, of record, such a restriction, without monetary consideration to the United States.
(c) Section 68 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2098) releases, remises, and quitclaims, to persons entitled thereto, all reserved rights of the United States in radioactive minerals in instruments of disposal of public or acquired lands. In addition, section 3 of the Act of October 1, 1949 (50 U.S.C. App. 1622b) authorizes the Administrator to issue instruments that he considers necessary to correct any instrument of disposal by which surplus property was transferred to a non-Federal public agency for airport purposes or to conform the transfer to the requirements of applicable law. Based on the laws cited in this paragraph, the Administrator issues appropriate instruments of correction upon the written request of persons entitled to ownership, occupancy, or use of the lands concerned.
§ 155.5
Property and releases covered by this part.
This part applies to—
(a) Any real or personal property that is subject to the terms, conditions, reservations, or restrictions in an instrument of disposal described in § 155.1; and
(b) Any release from a term, condition, reservation, or restriction in such an instrument, including a release of—
(1) Personal property, equipment, or structures from any term, condition, reservation, or restriction so far as necessary to allow it to be disposed of for salvage purposes;
(2) Land, personal property, equipment or structures from any term, condition, reservation, or restriction requiring that it be used for airport purposes to allow its use, lease, or sale for nonairport use in place;
(3) Land, personal property, equipment, or structures from any term, condition, reservation, or restriction requiring its maintenance for airport use;
(4) Land, personal property, equipment, or structures from all terms, conditions, restrictions, or reservations to allow its use, lease, sale, or other disposal for nonairport purposes; and
(5) Land, personal property, equipment, or structures from the reservation of right of use by the United States in time of war or national emergency, to facilitate financing the operation and maintenance or further development of a public airport.
§ 155.7
General policies.
(a) Upon a request under § 155.11, the Administrator issues any instrument that is necessary to remove, of record, any restriction against the use of property for industrial purposes that is in an instrument of disposal covered by this part.
(b) The Administrator does not issue a release under this part if it would allow the sale of the property concerned to a third party, unless the public agency concerned has obligated itself to use the proceeds from the sale exclusively for developing, improving,
operating, or maintaining a public airport.
(c) Except for a release from a restriction against using property for industrial purposes, the Administrator does not issue a release under this part unless it is justified under § 155.3(a) (1) or (2).
(d) The Administrator may issue a release from the terms, conditions, reservations, or restrictions of an instrument of disposal subject to any other terms or conditions that he considers necessary to protect or advance the interests of the United States in civil aviation. Such a term or condition, including one regarding the use of proceeds from the sale of property, is imposed as a personal covenant or obligation of the public agency concerned rather than as a term or condition to the release or as a covenant running with the land, unless the Administrator determines that the purpose of the term or condition would be better achieved as a condition or covenant running with the land.
(e) A letter or other document issued by the Administrator that merely grants consent to or approval of a lease, or to the use of the property for other than the airport use contemplated by the instrument of disposal, does not otherwise release the property from the terms, conditions, reservations, or restrictions of the instrument of disposal.
§ 155.9
Release from war or national emergency restrictions.
(a) The primary purpose of each transfer of surplus airport property under section 13 of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 was to make the property available for public or civil airport needs. However, it was also intended to ensure the availability of the property transferred, and of the entire airport, for use by the United States during a war or national emergency, if needed. As evidence of this purpose, most instruments of disposal of surplus airport property reserved or granted to the United States a right of exclusive possession and control of the airport during a war or emergency, substantially the same as one of the following:
(1) That during the existence of any emergency declared by the President or the Congress, the Government shall have the right without charge except as indicated below to the full, unrestricted possession, control, and use of the landing area, building areas, and airport facilities or any part thereof, including any additions or improvements thereto made subsequent to the declaration of the airport property as surplus:
Provided, however,
That the Government shall be responsible during the period of such use for the entire cost of maintaining all such areas, facilities, and improvements, or the portions used, and shall pay a fair rental for the use of any installations or structures which have been added thereto without Federal aid.
(2) During any national emergency declared by the President or by Congress, the United States shall have the right to make exclusive or nonexclusive use and have exclusive or nonexclusive control and possession, without charge, of the airport at which the surplus property is located or used or of such portion thereof as it may desire:
Provided, however,
That the United States shall be responsible for the entire cost of maintaining such part of the airport as it may use exclusively, or over which it may have exclusive possession and control, during the period of such use, possession, or control and shall be obligated to contribute a reasonable share, commensurate with the use made by it, of the cost of maintenance of such property as it may use nonexclusively or over which it may have nonexclusive control and possession:
Provided further,
That the United States shall pay a fair rental for its use, control, or possession, exclusively or nonexclusively, of any improvements to the airport made without U.S. aid.
(b) A release from the terms, conditions, reservations, or restrictions of an instrument of disposal that might prejudice the needs or interests of the armed forces, is granted only after consultation with the Department of Defense.
§ 155.11
Form and content of requests for release.
(a) A request for the release of surplus airport property from a term, condition, reservation, or restriction in an
instrument of disposal need not be in any special form, but must be in writing and signed by an authorized official of the public agency that owns the airport.
(b) A request for a release under this part must be submitted in triplicate to the District Airport Engineer in whose district the airport is located.
(c) Each request for a release must include the following information, if applicable and available:
(1) Identification of the instruments of disposal to which the property concerned is subject.
(2) A description of the property concerned.
(3) The condition of the property concerned.
(4) The purpose for which the property was transferred, such as for use as a part of, or in connection with, operating the airport or for producing revenues from nonaviation business.
(5) The kind of release requested.
(6) The purpose of the release.
(7) A statement of the circumstances justifying the release on the basis set forth in § 155.3(a) (1) or (2) with supporting documents.
(8) Maps, photographs, plans, or similar material of the airport and the property concerned that are appropriate to determining whether the release is justified under § 155.9.
(9) The proposed use or disposition of the property, including the terms and conditions of any proposed sale or lease and the status of negotiations therefor.
(10) If the release would allow sale of any part of the property, a certified copy of a resolution or ordinance of the governing body of the public agency that owns the airport obligating itself to use the proceeds of the sale exclusively for developing, improving, operating, or maintaining a public airport.
(11) A suggested letter or other instrument of release that would meet the requirements of State and local law for the release requested.
(12) The sponsor's environmental assessment prepared in conformance with Appendix 6 of FAA Order 1050.1C, “Policies and Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts” (45 FR 2244; Jan. 10, 1980), and FAA Order 5050.4, “Airport Environmental Handbook” (45 FR 56624; Aug. 25, 1980), if an assessment is required by Order 5050.4. Copies of these orders may be examined in the Rules Docket, Office of the Chief Counsel, FAA, Washington, D.C., and may be obtained on request at any FAA regional office headquarters or any airports district office.
[Docket 1329, 27 FR 12361, Dec. 13, 1962, as amended by Amdt. 155-1, 45 FR 56622, Aug. 25, 1980]
§ 155.13
Determinations by FAA.
(a) An FAA office that receives a request for a release under this part, and supporting documents therefore, examines it to determine whether the request meets the requirements of the Act of October 1, 1949 (63 Stat. 700) so far as it concerns the interests of the United States in civil aviation and whether it might prejudice the needs and interests of the armed forces. Upon a determination that the release might prejudice those needs and interests, the Department of Defense is consulted as provided in § 155.9(b).
(b) Upon completing the review, and receiving the advice of the Department of Defense if the case was referred to it, the FAA advises the airport owner as to whether the release or a modification of it, may be granted. If the release, or a modification of it acceptable to the owner, is granted, the FAA prepares the necessary instruments and delivers them to the airport owner.

(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section—
(1) In an emergency involving essential public service, public health, or public safety or when the delay arising from the 90-day advance notice requirement would result in an unreasonable hardship, a proponent may provide notice to the appropriate FAA Airport District/Field Office or Regional Office by telephone or other expeditious means as soon as practicable in lieu of submitting FAA Form 7480-1. However, the proponent shall provide full notice, through the submission of FAA Form 7480-1, when otherwise requested or required by the FAA.
(2) notice concerning the deactivation, discontinued use, or abandonment of an airport, an airport landing or takeoff area, or associated taxiway may be submitted by letter. Prior notice is not required; except that a 30-day prior notice is required when an established instrument approach procedure is involved or when the affected property is subject to any agreement with the United States requiring that it be maintained and operated as a public-use airport.
§ 157.7
FAA determinations.
(a) The FAA will conduct an aeronautical study of an airport proposal and, after consultations with interested persons, as appropriate, issue a determination to the proponent and advise those concerned of the FAA determination. The FAA will consider matters such as the effects the proposed action would have on existing or contemplated traffic patterns of neighboring airports; the effects the proposed action would have on the existing airspace structure and projected programs of the FAA; and the effects that existing or proposed manmade objects (on file with the FAA) and natural objects within the affected area would have on the airport proposal. While determinations consider the effects of the proposed action on the safe and efficient use of airspace by aircraft and the safety of persons and property on the ground, the determinations are only advisory. Except for an objectionable determination, each determination will contain a determination-void date to facilitate efficient planning of the use of the navigable airspace. A determination does not relieve the proponent of responsibility for compliance with any local law, ordinance or regulation, or state or other Federal regulation. Aeronautical studies and determinations will not consider environmental or land use compatibility impacts.
(b) An airport determination issued under this part will be one of the following:
(1)
No objection.
(2)
Conditional.
A conditional determination will identify the objectionable aspects of a project or action and specify the conditions which must be met and sustained to preclude an objectionable determination.
(3)
Objectionable.
An objectionable determination will specify the FAA's reasons for issuing such a determination.
(c)
Determination void date.
All work or action for which notice is required by this sub-part must be completed by the determination void date. Unless otherwise extended, revised, or terminated, an FAA determination becomes
invalid on the day specified as the determination void date. Interested persons may, at least 15 days in advance of the determination void date, petition the FAA official who issued the determination to:
(1) Revise the determination based on new facts that change the basis on which it was made; or
(2) Extend the determination void date. Determinations will be furnished to the proponent, aviation officials of the state concerned, and, when appropriate, local political bodies and other interested persons.
§ 157.9
Notice of completion.
Within 15 days after completion of any airport project covered by this part, the proponent of such project shall notify the FAA Airport District Office or Regional Office by submission of FAA Form 5010-5 or by letter. A copy of FAA Form 5010-5 will be provided with the FAA determination.

[Docket FAA-2000-7402, 65 FR 34541, May 30, 2000]
§ 158.13
Use of PFC revenue.
PFC revenue, including any interest earned after such revenue has been remitted to a public agency, may be used only to finance the allowable costs of approved projects at any airport the public agency controls.
(a)
Total cost.
PFC revenue may be used to pay all or part of the allowable cost of an approved project.
(b)
PFC administrative support costs.
Public agencies may use PFC revenue to pay for allowable administrative support costs. Public agencies must submit these costs as a separate project in each PFC application.
(c)
Maximum cost for certain low-emission technology projects.
If a project involves a vehicle or ground support equipment using low emission technology eligible under § 158.15(b), the FAA will determine the maximum cost that may be financed by PFC revenue. The maximum cost for a new vehicle is the incremental amount between the purchase price of a new low emission vehicle and the purchase price of a standard emission vehicle, or the cost of converting a standard emission vehicle to a low emission vehicle.
(d)
Bond-associated debt service and financing costs.
(1) Public agencies may use PFC revenue to pay debt service and financing costs incurred for a bond issued to carry out approved projects.
(2) If the public agency's bond documents require that PFC revenue be commingled in the general revenue stream of the airport and pledged for the benefit of holders of obligations, the FAA considers PFC revenue to have paid the costs covered in § 158.13(d)(1) if—
(i) An amount equal to the part of the proceeds of the bond issued to carry out approved projects is used to pay allowable costs of such projects; and
(ii) To the extent the PFC revenue collected in any year exceeds the debt service and financing costs on such bonds during that year, an amount equal to the excess is applied as required by § 158.39.
(e)
Exception providing for the use of PFC revenue to pay for debt service for non-eligible projects.
The FAA may authorize a public agency under § 158.18 to impose a PFC for payments for debt
service on indebtedness incurred to carry out an airport project that is not eligible if the FAA determines that such use is necessary because of the financial need of the airport.
(f)
Combination of PFC revenue and Federal grant funds.
A public agency may combine PFC revenue and airport grant funds to carry out an approved project. These projects are subject to the record keeping and auditing requirements of this part, as well as the reporting, record keeping and auditing requirements imposed by the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (AAIA).
(g)
Non-Federal share.
Public agencies may use PFC revenue to meet the non-Federal share of the cost of projects funded under the Federal airport grant program or the FAA “Program to Permit Cost-Sharing of Air Traffic Modernization Projects” under 49 U.S.C. 44517.
(h)
Approval of project following approval to impose a PFC.
The public agency may not use PFC revenue or interest earned thereon except on an approved project.
[Docket 26385, 56 FR 24278, May 29, 1991, as amended by Amdt. 158-4, 72 FR 28847, May 23, 2007]
§ 158.15
Project eligibility at PFC levels of $1, $2, or $3.
(a) To be eligible, a project must—
(1) Preserve or enhance safety, security, or capacity of the national air transportation system;
(2) Reduce noise or mitigate noise impacts resulting from an airport; or
(3) Furnish opportunities for enhanced competition between or among air carriers.
(b) Eligible projects are any of the following projects—
(1) Airport development eligible under subchapter I of chapter 471 of 49 U.S.C.;

(6) Construction of gates and related areas at which passengers are enplaned or deplaned and other areas directly related to the movement of passengers and baggage in air commerce within the boundaries of the airport. These areas do not include restaurants, car rental and automobile parking facilities, or other concessions. Projects required to enable added air service by an air carrier with less than 50 percent of the annual passenger boardings at an airport have added eligibility. Such projects may include structural foundations and floor systems, exterior building walls and load-bearing interior columns or walls, windows, door and roof systems, building utilities (including heating, air conditioning, ventilation, plumbing, and electrical service), and aircraft fueling facilities next to the gate;
(7) A project approved under the FAA's “Program to Permit Cost-Sharing of Air Traffic Modernization Projects” under 49 U.S.C. 44517; or
(8) If the airport is in an air quality nonattainment area (as defined by section 171(2) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7501(2)) or a maintenance area referred to in section 175A of such Act (42 U.S.C. 7505a), and the project will result in the airport receiving appropriate emission credits as described in 49 U.S.C. 47139, a project for:
(i) Converting vehicles eligible under § 158.15(b)(1) and ground support equipment powered by a diesel or gasoline engine used at a commercial service airport to low-emission technology certified or verified by the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce emissions or to use cleaner burning conventional fuels; or
(ii) Acquiring for use at a commercial service airport vehicles eligible under § 158.15(b)(1) and, subject to § 158.13(c), ground support equipment that include low-emission technology or use cleaner burning fuels.

(b) In addition, a project for a medium or large airport is only eligible for PFC funding at levels of $4 or $4.50 if the project will make a significant contribution to improving air safety and security, increasing competition among air carriers, reducing current or anticipated congestion, or reducing the impact of aviation noise on people living near the airport.
[Docket FAA-2000-7402, 65 FR 34541, May 30, 2000]
§ 158.18
Use of PFC revenue to pay for debt service for non-eligible projects.
(a) The FAA may authorize a public agency to impose a PFC to make payments for debt service on indebtedness incurred to carry out at the airport a project that is not eligible if the FAA determines it is necessary because of the financial need of the airport. The FAA defines financial need in § 158.3.
(b) A public agency may request authority to impose a PFC and use PFC revenue under this section using the PFC application procedures in § 158.25. The public agency must document its financial position and explain its financial recovery plan that uses all available resources.
(c) The FAA reviews the application using the procedures in § 158.27. The FAA will issue its decision on the public agency's request under § 158.29.
[Docket FAA-2006-23730, 72 FR 28848, May 23, 2007]
§ 158.19
Requirement for competition plans.
(a) Beginning in fiscal year 2001, no public agency may impose a PFC with respect to a covered airport unless the public agency has submitted a written competition plan. This requirement does not apply to PFC authority approved prior to April 5, 2000.
(b) The Administrator will review any plan submitted under paragraph (a) of this section to ensure that it meets the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 47106(f) and periodically will review its implementation to ensure that each covered airport successfully implements its plan.

# Subpart C—Collection, Handling, and Remittance of PFC's
§ 158.41
General.
This subpart contains the requirements for notification, collection, handling and remittance of PFC's.
§ 158.43
Public agency notification to collect PFC's.
(a) Following approval of an application to impose a PFC under subpart B of this part, the public agency shall notify the air carriers and foreign air carriers required to collect PFC's at its airport of the Administrator's approval. Each notified carrier shall notify its agents, including other issuing carriers, of the collection requirement.
(b) The notification shall be in writing and contain at a minimum the following information:
(1) The level of PFC to be imposed.
(2) The total revenue to be collected.
(3) The charge effective date will always be the first day of the month; however, it must be at least 30 days after the date the public agency notified the air carriers of the FAA's approval to impose the PFC.
(4) The proposed charge expiration date.
(5) A copy of the Administrator's notice of approval.
(6) The address where remittances and reports are to be filed by carriers.
(c) The public agency must notify air carriers required to collect PFCs at its airport and the FAA of changes in the charge expiration date at least 30 days before the existing charge expiration date or new charge expiration date, whichever comes first. Each notified air carrier must notify its agents, including other issuing carriers, of such changes.
(d) The public agency shall provide a copy of the notification to the appropriate FAA Airports office.
[Docket 26385, 56 FR 24278, May 29, 1991, as amended by Amdt. 158-4, 72 FR 28849, May 23, 2007]
§ 158.45
Collection of PFC's on tickets issued in the U.S.
(a) On and after the charge effective date, tickets issued in the U.S. shall include the required PFC except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
(1) Issuing carriers shall be responsible for all funds from time of collection to remittance.
(2) The appropriate charge is the PFC in effect at the time the ticket is issued.
(3) Issuing carriers and their agents shall collect PFCs based on the itinerary at the time of issuance.
(i) Any change in itinerary initiated by a passenger that requires an adjustment to the amount paid by the passenger is subject to collection or refund of the PFC as appropriate.
(ii) Failure to travel on a nonrefundable or expired ticket is not a change in itinerary. If the ticket purchaser is not permitted any fare refund on the unused ticket, the ticket purchaser is not permitted a refund of any PFC associated with that ticket.
(b) Issuing carriers and their agents shall note as a separate item on each air travel ticket upon which a PFC is shown, the total amount of PFC's paid by the passenger and the airports for which the PFC's are collected.
(c) For each one-way trip shown on the complete itinerary of an air travel ticket, issuing air carriers and their agents shall collect a PFC from a passenger only for the first two airports where PFC's are imposed. For each round trip, a PFC shall be collected only for enplanements at the first two enplaning airports and the last two enplaning airports where PFC's are imposed.
(d) In addition to the restriction in paragraph (c) of this section, issuing carriers and their agents shall not collect PFC's from a passenger covered by any of the other limitations described in § 158.9(a).
(e) Collected PFC's shall be distributed as noted on the air travel ticket.
(f) Issuing carriers and their agents shall stop collecting the PFC's on the charge expiration date stated in a notice from the public agency, or as required by the Administrator.
[Docket 26385, 56 FR 24278, May 29, 1991, as amended by Amdt. 158-2, 65 FR 34542, May 30, 2000; Amdt. 158-4, 72 FR 28849, May 23, 2007]
§ 158.47
Collection of PFC's on tickets issued outside the U.S.
(a) For tickets issued outside the U.S., an air carrier or foreign air carrier may follow the requirements of either § 158.45 or this section, unless the itinerary is for travel wholly within the U.S. Air carriers and foreign air carriers must comply with § 158.45 where the itinerary is for travel wholly within the U.S. regardless of where the ticket is issued.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this part, no foreign airline is required to collect a PFC on air travel tickets issued on its own ticket stock unless it serves a point or points in the U.S.
(c) If an air carrier or foreign air carrier elects not to comply with § 158.45 for tickets issued outside the U.S.—
(1) The carrier is required to collect PFC's on such tickets only for the public agency controlling the last airport at which the passenger is enplaned prior to departure from the U.S.
(2) The carrier may collect the PFC either at the time the ticket is issued or at the time the passenger is last enplaned prior to departure from the U.S. The carrier may vary the method of collection among its flights.
(3) The carrier shall provide a written record to the passenger that a PFC has been collected. Such a record shall appear on or with the air travel ticket and shall include the same information as required by § 158.45(b), but need not be preprinted on the ticket stock.
(4) Issuing carriers and their agents shall collect PFCs based on the itinerary at the time of issuance.
(i) Any change in itinerary initiated by a passenger that requires an adjustment to the amount paid by the passenger is subject to collection or refund of the PFC as appropriate.
(ii) Failure to travel on a nonrefundable or expired ticket is not a change in itinerary. If the ticket purchaser is not permitted any fare refund on the unused ticket, the ticket purchaser is not permitted a refund of any PFC associated with that ticket.
(d) With respect to a flight on which the air carrier or foreign air carrier chooses to collect the PFC at the time the air travel ticket is issued—
(1) The carrier and its agents shall collect the required PFC on tickets issued on or after the charge effective date.
(2) The carrier is not required to collect PFC's at the time of enplanement for tickets sold by other air carriers or foreign air carriers or their agents.
(e) With respect to a flight on which the air carrier or foreign air carrier chooses to collect the PFC at the time of enplanement, the carrier shall examine the air travel ticket of each passenger enplaning at the airport on and after the charge effective date and shall collect the PFC from any passenger whose air travel ticket does not include a written record indicating that the PFC was collected at the time of issuance.
(f) Collected PFC's shall be distributed as noted on the written record provided to the passenger.
(g) Collecting carriers shall be responsible for all funds from time of collection to remittance.
(h) Collecting carriers and their agents shall stop collecting the PFC on the charge expiration date stated in a notice from the public agency, or as required by the Administrator.
[Docket 26385, 56 FR 24278, May 29, 1991; 56 FR 37127, Aug. 2, 1991; Amdt. 158-4, 72 FR 28849, May 23, 2007]
§ 158.49
Handling of PFC's.
(a) Collecting carriers shall establish and maintain a financial management system to account for PFC's in accordance with the Department of Transportation's Uniform System of Accounts and Reports (14 CFR part 241). For carriers not subject to 14 CFR part 241, such carriers shall establish and maintain an accounts payable system to handle PFC revenue with subaccounts for each public agency to which such carrier remits PFC revenue.
(b) Collecting carriers must account for PFC revenue separately. PFC revenue may be commingled with the air carrier's other sources of revenue except for covered air carriers discussed in paragraph (c) of this section. PFC revenues held by an air carrier or an agent of the air carrier after collection are held in trust for the beneficial interest of the public agency imposing the PFC. Such air carrier or agent
holds neither legal nor equitable interest in the PFC revenues except for any handling fee or interest collected on unremitted proceeds as authorized in § 158.53.
(c)(1) A covered air carrier must segregate PFC revenue in a designated separate PFC account. Regardless of the amount of PFC revenue in the covered air carrier's account at the time the bankruptcy petition is filed, the covered air carrier must deposit into the separate PFC account an amount equal to the average monthly liability for PFCs collected under this section by such air carrier or any of its agents.
(i) The covered air carrier is required to create one PFC account to cover all PFC revenue it collects. The designated PFC account is solely for PFC transactions and the covered air carrier must make all PFC transactions from that PFC account. The covered air carrier is not required to create separate PFC accounts for each airport where a PFC is imposed.
(ii) The covered air carrier must transfer PFCs from its general accounts into the separate PFC account in an amount equal to the average monthly liability for PFCs as the “PFC reserve.” The PFC reserve must equal a one-month average of the sum of the total PFCs collected by the covered air carrier, net of any credits or handling fees allowed by law, during the past 12-month period of PFC collections immediately before entering bankruptcy.
(iii) The minimum PFC reserve balance must never fall below the fixed amount defined in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
(iv) A covered air carrier may continue to deposit the PFCs it collects into its general operating accounts combined with ticket sales revenue. However, at least once every business day, the covered air carrier must remove all PFC revenue (Daily PFC amount) from those accounts and transfer it to the new PFC account. An estimate based on
1/30
of the PFC reserve balance is permitted in substitution of the Daily PFC amount.
(A) In the event a covered air carrier ceases operations while still owing PFC remittances, the PFC reserve fund may be used to make those remittances. If there is any balance in the PFC reserve fund after all PFC remittances are made, that balance will be returned to the covered air carrier's general account.
(B) In the event a covered air carrier emerges from bankruptcy protection and ceases to be a covered air carrier, any balance remaining in the PFC reserve fund after any outstanding PFC obligations are met will be returned to the air carrier's general account.
(v) If the covered air carrier uses an estimate rather than the daily PFC amount, the covered air carrier shall reconcile the estimated amount with the actual amount of PFCs collected for the prior month (Actual Monthly PFCs). This reconciliation must take place no later than the 20th day of the month (or the next business day if the date is not a business day). In the event the Actual Monthly PFCs are greater than the aggregate estimated PFC amount, the covered air carrier will, within one business day of the reconciliation, deposit the difference into the PFC account. If the Actual Monthly PFCs are less than the aggregate estimated PFC amount, the covered air carrier will be entitled to a credit in the amount of the difference to be applied to the daily PFC amount due.
(vi) The covered air carrier is permitted to recalculate and reset the PFC reserve and daily PFC amount on each successive anniversary date of its bankruptcy petition using the methodology described above.
(2) If a covered air carrier or its agent fails to segregate PFC revenue in violation of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the trust fund status of such revenue shall not be defeated by an inability of any party to identify and trace the precise funds in the accounts of the air carrier.
(3) A covered air carrier and its agents may not grant to any third party any security or other interest in PFC revenue.
(4) A covered air carrier that fails to comply with any requirement of paragraph (c) of this section, or causes an eligible public agency to spend funds to recover or retain payment of PFC revenue, must compensate that public agency for those cost incurred to recover the PFCs owed.
(5) The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section that allow the commingling of PFCs with other air carrier revenue do not apply to a covered air carrier.
(d) All collecting air carriers must disclose the existence and amount of PFC funds regarded as trust funds in their financial statements.
[Docket 26385, 56 FR 24278, May 29, 1991, as amended by Amdt. 158-2, 65 FR 34542, May 30, 2000; Amdt. 158-4, 72 FR 28850, May 23, 2007]
§ 158.51
Remittance of PFC's.
Passenger facility charges collected by carriers shall be remitted to the public agency on a monthly basis. PFC revenue recorded in the accounting system of the carrier, as set forth in § 158.49 of this part, shall be remitted to the public agency no later than the last day of the following calendar month (or if that date falls on a weekend or holiday, the first business day thereafter).
§ 158.53
Collection compensation.
(a) As compensation for collecting, handling, and remitting the PFC revenue, the collecting air carrier is entitled to:
(1) $0.11 of each PFC collected.
(2) Any interest or other investment return earned on PFC revenue between the time of collection and remittance to the public agency.
(b) A covered air carrier that fails to designate a separate PFC account is prohibited from collecting interest on the PFC revenue. Where a covered air carrier maintains a separate PFC account in compliance with § 158.49(c), it will receive the interest on PFC accounts as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(c)(1) Collecting air carriers may provide collection cost data periodically to the FAA after the agency issues a notice in the
Federal Register
that specifies the information and deadline for filing the information. Submission of the information is voluntary. The requested information must include data on interest earned by the air carriers on PFC revenue and air carrier collection, handling, and remittance costs in the following categories:
(i) Credit card fees;
(ii) Audit fees;
(iii) PFC disclosure fees;
(iv) Reservations costs;
(v) Passenger service costs;
(vi) Revenue accounting, data entry, accounts payable, tax, and legal fees;
(vii) Corporate property department costs;
(viii) Training for reservations agents, ticket agents, and other departments;
(ix) Ongoing carrier information systems costs;
(x) Ongoing computer reservations systems costs; and
(xi) Airline Reporting Corporation fees.
(2) The FAA may determine a new compensation level based on an analysis of the data provided under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if the data is submitted by carriers representing at least 75 percent of PFCs collected nationwide.
(3) Any new compensation level determined by the FAA under paragraph (c)(2) of this section will replace the level identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(iv) The closing balance in the account.
[Docket FAA-2006-23730, 72 FR 28851, May 23, 2007]
§ 158.67
Recordkeeping and auditing: Public agency.
(a) Each public agency shall keep any unliquidated PFC revenue remitted to it by collecting carriers on deposit in an interest bearing account or in other interest bearing instruments used by the public agency's airport capital fund. Interest earned on such PFC revenue shall be used, in addition to the principal, to pay the allowable costs of PFC-funded projects. PFC revenue may only be commingled with other public agency airport capital funds in deposits or interest bearing instruments.
(b) Each public agency shall establish and maintain for each approved application a separate accounting record. The accounting record shall identify the PFC revenue received from the collecting carriers, interest earned on such revenue, the amounts used on each project, and the amount reserved for currently approved projects.
(c) At least annually during the period the PFC is collected, held or used, each public agency shall provide for an audit of its PFC account. The audit shall be performed by an accredited independent public accountant and may be of limited scope. The accountant shall express an opinion of the fairness and reasonableness of the public agency's procedures for receiving, holding, and using PFC revenue. The accountant shall also express an opinion on whether the quarterly report required under § 158.63 fairly represents the net transactions within the PFC account. The audit may be—
(1) Performed specifically for the PFC account; or
(2) Conducted as part of an audit under Office of Management and Budget Circular A-133 (the Single Audit Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98-502, and the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, Pub. L. 104-156) provided the auditor specifically addresses the PFC.
(3) Upon request, a copy of the audit shall be provided to each collecting carrier that remitted PFC revenue to
the public agency in the period covered by the audit and to the Administrator.
[Docket 26385, 56 FR 24278, May 29, 1991, as amended by Amdt. 158-4, 72 FR 28851, May 23, 2007]
§ 158.69
Recordkeeping and auditing: Collecting carriers.
(a) Collecting carriers shall establish and maintain for each public agency for which they collect a PFC an accounting record of PFC revenue collected, remitted, refunded and compensation retained under § 158.53(a) of this part.

(b) The Administrator may periodically audit and/or review the collection and remittance by the collecting carriers of PFC revenue. The purpose of the audit or review is to ensure collecting carriers are in compliance with the requirements of this part and 49 U.S.C. 40117.
(c) Public agencies and carriers shall allow any authorized representative of the Administrator, the Secretary of Transportation, or the Comptroller General of the U.S., access to any of its books, documents, papers, and records pertinent to PFC's
[Docket 26385, 56 FR 24278, May 29, 1991, as amended by Amdt. 158-2, 65 FR 34543, May 30, 2000]

# Subpart E—Termination
§ 158.81
General.
This subpart contains the procedures for termination of PFCs or loss of Federal airport grant funds for violations of this part or 49 U.S.C. 40117. This subpart does not address the circumstances under which the authority to collect PFCs may be terminated for violations of 49 U.S.C. 47523 through 47528.
[Docket FAA-2006-23730, 72 FR 28851, May 23, 2007]
§ 158.83
Informal resolution.
The Administrator shall undertake informal resolution with the public agency or any other affected party if, after review under § 158.71, the Administrator cannot determine that PFC revenue is being used for the approved projects in accordance with the terms of the Administrator's approval to impose a PFC for those projects or with 49 U.S.C. 40117.
[Docket 26385, 56 FR 24278, May 29, 1991, as amended by Amdt. 158-2, 65 FR 34543, May 30, 2000]
§ 158.85
Termination of authority to impose PFC's.
(a) The FAA begins proceedings to terminate the public agency's authority to impose a PFC only if the Administrator determines that informal resolution is not successful.
(b) The Administrator publishes a notice of proposed termination in the
Federal Register
and supplies a copy to the public agency. This notice will state the scope of the proposed termination, the basis for the proposed action and the date for filing written comments or objections by all interested parties. This notice will also identify any corrective actions the public agency can take to avoid further
proceedings. The due date for comments and corrective action shall be no less than 60 days after publication of the notice.
(c) If corrective action has not been taken as prescribed by the Administrator, the FAA holds a public hearing, and notice is given to the public agency and published in the
Federal Register
at least 30 days prior to the hearing. The hearing will be in a form determined by the Administrator to be appropriate to the circumstances and to the matters in dispute.
(d) The Administrator publishes the final decision in the
Federal Register.
Where appropriate, the Administrator may prescribe corrective action, including any corrective action the public agency may yet take. A copy of the notice is also provided to the public agency.
(e) Within 10 days of the date of publication of the notice of the Administrator's decision, the public agency shall—
(1) Advise the FAA in writing that it will complete any corrective action prescribed in the decision within 30 days; or
(2) Provide the FAA with a listing of the air carriers and foreign air carriers operating at the airport and all other issuing carriers that have remitted PFC revenue to the public agency in the preceding 12 months.
(f) When the Administrator's decision does not provide for corrective action or the public agency fails to complete such action, the FAA provides a copy of the
Federal Register
notice to each air carrier and foreign air carrier identified in paragraph (e) of this section. Such carriers are responsible for terminating or modifying PFC collection no later than 30 days after the date of notification by the FAA.
§ 158.87
Loss of Federal airport grant funds.
(a) If the Administrator determines that revenue derived from a PFC is excessive or is not being used as approved, the Administrator may reduce the amount of funds otherwise payable to the public agency under 49 U.S.C. 47114. Such a reduction may be made as a corrective action under § 158.83 or § 158.85 of this part.
(b) The amount of the reduction under paragraph (a) of this section shall equal the excess collected, or the amount not used in accordance with this part.
(c) A reduction under paragraph (a) of this section shall not constitute a withholding of approval of a grant application or the payment of funds under an approved grant within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 47111(d).
[Docket 26385, 56 FR 24278, May 29, 1991, as amended by Amdt. 158-2, 65 FR 34543, May 30, 2000]

# Subpart F—Reduction in Airport Improvement Program Apportionment
§ 158.91
General.
This subpart describes the required reduction in funds apportioned to a large or medium hub airport that imposes a PFC.
§ 158.93
Public agencies subject to reduction.
The funds apportioned under 49 U.S.C. 47114 to a public agency for a specific primary commercial service airport that it controls are reduced if—
(a) Such airport enplanes 0.25 percent or more of the total annual enplanements in the U.S., and
(b) The public agency imposes a PFC at such airport.
[Docket 26385, 56 FR 24278, May 29, 1991, as amended by Amdt. 158-2, 65 FR 34543, May 30, 2000]
§ 158.95
Implementation of reduction.
(a) A reduction in apportioned funds will not take effect until the first fiscal year following the year in which the collection of the PFC is begun and will be applied in each succeeding fiscal year in which the public agency imposes the PFC.
(b) The reduction in apportioned funds is calculated at the beginning of each fiscal year and shall be an amount equal to—
(1) In the case of a fee of $3 or less, 50 percent of the projected revenues from the fee in the fiscal year but not by more than 50 percent of the amount that otherwise would be apportioned under this section; and
(2) In the case of a fee of more than $3, 75 percent of the projected revenues from the fee in the fiscal year but not by more than 75 percent of the amount that otherwise would be apportioned under this section.
(c) If the projection of PFC revenue in a fiscal year is inaccurate, the reduction in apportioned funds may be increased or decreased in the following fiscal year, except that any further reduction shall not cause the total reduction to exceed 50 percent of such apportioned amount as would otherwise be apportioned in any fiscal year.
[Docket 26385, 56 FR 24278, May 29, 1991, as amended by Amdt. 158-2, 65 FR 34543, May 30, 2000]
Pt. 158, App. A

# Appendix A to Part 158—Assurances
A.
General.
1. These assurances shall be complied with in the conduct of a project funded with passenger facility charge (PFC) revenue.
2. These assurances are required to be submitted as part of the application for approval of authority to impose a PFC under the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 40117.
3. Upon approval by the Administrator of an application, the public agency is responsible for compliance with these assurances.
B.
Public agency certification.
The public agency hereby assures and certifies, with respect to this project that:
1. Responsibility and authority of the public agency. It has legal authority to impose a PFC and to finance and carry out the proposed project; that a resolution, motion or similar action has been duly adopted or passed as an official act of the public agency's governing body authorizing the filing of the application, including all understandings and assurances contained therein, and directing and authorizing the person identified as the official representative of the public agency to act in connection with the application.
2. Compliance with regulation. It will comply with all provisions of 14 CFR part 158.
3. Compliance with state and local laws and regulations. It has complied, or will comply, with all applicable State and local laws and regulations.
4. Environmental, airspace and airport layout plan requirements. It will not use PFC revenue on a project until the FAA has notified the public agency that—
(a) Any actions required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 have been completed;
(b) The appropriate airspace finding has been made; and
(c) The FAA Airport Layout Plan with respect to the project has been approved.
5. Nonexclusivity of contractual agreements. It will not enter into an exclusive long-term lease or use agreement with an air carrier or foreign air carrier for projects funded by PFC revenue. Such leases or use agreements will not preclude the public agency from funding, developing, or assigning new capacity at the airport with PFC revenue.
6. Carryover provisions. It will not enter into any lease or use agreement with any air carrier or foreign air carrier for any facility financed in whole or in part with revenue derived from a passenger facility charge if such agreement for such facility contains a carryover provision regarding a renewal option which, upon expiration of the original lease, would operate to automatically extend the term of such agreement with such carrier in preference to any potentially competing air carrier or foreign air carrier seeking to negotiate a lease or use agreement for such facilities.
7. Competitive access. It agrees that any lease or use agreements between the public agency and any air carrier or foreign air carrier for any facility financed in whole or in part with revenue derived from a passenger facility charge will contain a provision that permits the public agency to terminate the lease or use agreement if—
(a) The air carrier or foreign air carrier has an exclusive lease or use agreement for existing facilities at such airport; and
(b) Any portion of its existing exclusive use facilities is not fully utilized and is not made available for use by potentially competing air carriers or foreign air carriers.
8. Rates, fees and charges.

Purpose.
This part implements the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 (49
U.S.C. App. 2153, 2154, 2155, and 2156). It prescribes:
(a) Notice requirements and procedures for airport operators implementing Stage 3 aircraft noise and access restrictions pursuant to agreements between airport operators and aircraft operators;
(b) Analysis and notice requirements for airport operators proposing Stage 2 aircraft noise and access restrictions;
(c) Notice, review, and approval requirements for airport operators proposing Stage 3 aircraft noise and access restrictions; and
(d) Procedures for Federal Aviation Administration reevaluation of agreements containing restrictions on Stage 3 aircraft operations and of aircraft noise and access restrictions affecting Stage 3 aircraft operations imposed by airport operators.
§ 161.3
Applicability.
(a) This part applies to airports imposing restrictions on Stage 2 aircraft operations proposed after October 1, 1990, and to airports imposing restrictions on Stage 3 aircraft operations that became effective after October 1, 1990.
(b) This part also applies to airports enacting amendments to airport noise and access restrictions in effect on October 1, 1990, but amended after that date, where the amendment reduces or limits aircraft operations or affects aircraft safety.
(c) The notice, review, and approval requirements set forth in this part apply to all airports imposing noise or access restrictions as defined in § 161.5 of this part.
§ 161.5
Definitions.
For the purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:
Agreement
means a document in writing signed by the airport operator; those aircraft operators currently operating at the airport that would be affected by the noise or access restriction; and all affected new entrants planning to provide new air service within 180 days of the effective date of the restriction that have submitted to the airport operator a plan of operations and notice of agreement to the restriction.
Aircraft operator,
for purposes of this part, means any owner of an aircraft that operates the aircraft, i.e., uses, causes to use, or authorizes the use of the aircraft; or in the case of a leased aircraft, any lessee that operates the aircraft pursuant to a lease. As used in this part, aircraft operator also means any representative of the aircraft owner, or in the case of a leased aircraft, any representative of the lessee empowered to enter into agreements with the airport operator regarding use of the airport by an aircraft.
Airport
means any area of land or water, including any heliport, that is used or intended to be used for the landing and takeoff of aircraft, and any appurtenant areas that are used or intended to be used for airport buildings or other airport facilities or rights-of-way, together with all airport buildings and facilities located thereon.
Airport noise study area
means that area surrounding the airport within the noise contour selected by the applicant for study and must include the noise contours required to be developed for noise exposure maps specified in 14 CFR part 150.
Airport operator
means the airport proprietor.
Aviation user class

Day-night average sound level (DNL)
means the 24-hour average sound level, in decibels, for the period from midnight to midnight, obtained after the addition of ten decibels to sound levels for the periods between midnight and 7 a.m., and between 10 p.m. and midnight, local time, as defined in 14 CFR part 150. (The scientific notation for DNL is L
dn
).
Noise or access restrictions
means restrictions (including but not limited to provisions of ordinances and leases) affecting access or noise that affect the operations of Stage 2 or Stage 3 aircraft, such as limits on the noise generated on either a single-event or cumulative basis; a limit, direct or indirect, on the total number of Stage 2 or Stage 3 aircraft operations; a noise
budget or noise allocation program that includes Stage 2 or Stage 3 aircraft; a restriction imposing limits on hours of operations; a program of airport-use charges that has the direct or indirect effect of controlling airport noise; and any other limit on Stage 2 or Stage 3 aircraft that has the effect of controlling airport noise. This definition does not include peak-period pricing programs where the objective is to align the number of aircraft operations with airport capacity.
Stage 2 aircraft
means an aircraft that has been shown to comply with the Stage 2 requirements under 14 CFR part 36.

Other noise abatement procedures, such as taxiing and engine runups, are not subject to this part unless the procedures imposed limit the total number of Stage 2 or Stage 3 aircraft operations, or limit the hours of Stage 2 or Stage 3 aircraft operations, at the airport.
(b) The notice, review, and approval requirements set forth in this part do not apply to airports with restrictions as specified in 49 U.S.C. App. 2153(a)(2)(C):
(1) A local action to enforce a negotiated or executed airport aircraft noise or access agreement between the airport operator and the aircraft operator in effect on November 5, 1990.
(2) A local action to enforce a negotiated or executed airport aircraft noise or access restriction the airport operator and the aircraft operators agreed to before November 5, 1990.
(3) An intergovernmental agreement including airport aircraft noise or access restriction in effect on November 5, 1990.
(4) A subsequent amendment to an airport aircraft noise or access agreement or restriction in effect on November 5, 1990, where the amendment does not reduce or limit aircraft operations or affect aircraft safety.
(5) A restriction that was adopted by an airport operator on or before October 1, 1990, and that was stayed as of October 1, 1990, by a court order or as a result of litigation, if such restriction, or a part thereof, is subsequently allowed by a court to take effect.
(6) In any case in which a restriction described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section is either partially or totally disallowed by a court, any new restriction imposed by an airport operator to replace such disallowed restriction, if such new restriction would not prohibit aircraft operations in effect on November 5, 1990.
(7) A local action that represents the adoption of the final portion of a program of a staged airport aircraft noise or access restriction, where the initial portion of such program was adopted during calendar year 1988 and was in effect on November 5, 1990.
