(G) The identification and explanation of the uncontrollable nature of errors caused by the event (types of errors, geographic location of the errors, time period during which the errors occurred, etc.).
(H) The percentage of the payment error rate that resulted from the occurrence and how this figure was derived; and
(I) The degree to which the payment error rate exceeded the national performance measure in the subject fiscal year.
(ii) (A) The following criteria and methodology will be used to assess and evaluate good cause in conjunction with the appeals process, and to determine that portion of the error rate/liability amount attributable to the uncontrollable effects of a disaster or civil disorder:
(
1
) Geographical impact of the disaster;
(
2
) State efforts to control impact on program operations;
(
3
) The proportion of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program caseload affected; and/or
(
4
) The duration of the disaster and its impact on program operations.
(B) Adjustments for these factors may result in a waiver of all, part, or none of the liability amount for the applicable period. As appropriate, the waiver amount will be adjusted to reflect States' otherwise effective administration of the program based upon the degree to which the error rate exceeds the national performance measure. For example, a reduction in the waiver amount may be made when a State agency's recent error rate history indicates that even absent the events described the State agency would have exceeded the national performance measure in the review period.
(iii) If a State agency has provided insufficient information to determine a waiver amount for the uncontrollable effects of a natural disaster or civil disorder using factual analysis, the waiver amount shall be evaluated using the following formula and methodology which measures both the duration and intensity of the event. Duration will be measured by the number of months the event had an adverse impact on program operations. Intensity will be a proportional measurement of the issuances for the counties affected to the State's total issuance. This ratio will be determined using issuance figures for the first full month immediately preceding the disaster. This figure will not include issuances made to households participating under disaster certification authorized by FNS and already excluded from the error rate calculations under § 275.12(g)(2)(vi). The counties considered affected will include counties where the disaster/civil disorder occurred, and any other county that the State agency can demonstrate had program operations adversely impacted due to the event (such as a county that diverted significant numbers of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program certification or administrative staff). The amount of the waiver of liability will be determined using the linear equation W = Ia/Ib × [M/12 or Mp/18] × L, where Ia is the issuance for the first full month immediately preceding the unusual event for the county affected; Ib is the State's total issuance for the first full month immediately preceding the unusual event; M/12 is the number of months in the subject fiscal year that the unusual event had an adverse impact on program operations; Mp/18 is the number of months in the last half (April through September) of the prior fiscal year that the unusual event had an adverse impact on program operations; L is the total amount of the liability for the fiscal year. Mathematically this formula could result in a waiver of more than 100 percent of the liability amount; however, no more than 100 percent of a State's liability amount will be waived for any one fiscal year. Under this approach, unless the State agency can demonstrate a direct uncontrollable impact on the error rate, the effects of disasters or civil disorders that ended prior to the second half of the prior fiscal year will not be considered.
(2)
Strikes.
Strikes by State agency staff necessary to determine Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program eligibility and process case changes.
(i) When submitting a request for good cause relief based on this example, the State agency shall provide the following information:
(A) Which workers (
i.e.,
eligibility workers, clerks, data input staff, etc.) and how many (number and percentage of total staff) were on strike or refused to cross picket lines;
(B) The date(s) and nature of the strike (
i.e.,
the issues surrounding the strike);
(C) The date(s) after the occurrence when program operations were affected;
(D) The geographic extent of the strike (
i.e.,
the county or counties where the strike occurred);
(E) The proportion of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program caseload whose management was affected;
(F) The reason(s) why the State agency was unable to control the effects of the strike on program administration and errors;
(G) Identification and explanation of the uncontrollable nature of errors
caused by the event (types of errors, geographic location of the errors, time period during which the errors occurred, etc.);
(H) The percentage of the payment error rate that resulted from the strike and how this figure was derived; and
(I) The degree to which the payment error rate exceeded the national performance measure in the subject fiscal year.
(ii) (A) The following criteria shall be used to assess, evaluate and respond to claims by the State agency for a good cause waiver of a liability amount in conjunction with the appeals process, and to determine that portion of the error rate/liability amount attributable to the uncontrollable effects of the strike:
(
1
) Geographical impact of the strike;
(
2
) State efforts to control impact on program operations;
(
3
) The proportion of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program caseload affected; and/or
(
4
) The duration of the strike and its impact on program operations.
(B) Adjustments for these factors may result in a waiver of all, part, or none of the liability amount for the applicable period. For example, the amount of the waiver might be reduced for a strike that was limited to a small area of the State. As appropriate, the waiver amount will be adjusted to reflect States' otherwise effective administration of the program based upon the degree to which the error rate exceeded the national performance measure.
(iii) If a State agency has provided insufficient information to determine a waiver amount for the uncontrollable effects of a strike using factual analysis, a waiver amount shall be evaluated by using the formula described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Under this approach, unless the State agency can demonstrate a direct uncontrollable impact on the error rate, the effects of strikes that ended prior to the second half of the prior fiscal year will not be considered.
(3)
Caseload growth.
A significant growth in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program caseload in a State prior to or during a fiscal year, such as a 15 percent growth in caseload. Caseload growth which historically increases during certain periods of the year will not be considered unusual or beyond the State agency's control.
(i) When submitting a request for good cause relief based on this example, the State agency shall provide the following information:
(A) The amount of growth (both actual and percentage);
(B) The time the growth occurred (what month(s)/year);
(C) The date(s) after the occurrence when program operations were affected;
(D) The geographic extent of the caseload growth (
i.e.
Statewide or in which particular counties);
(E) The impact of caseload growth;
(F) The reason(s) why the State agency was unable to control the effects of caseload growth on program administration and errors;
(G) The percentage of the payment error rate that resulted from the caseload growth and how this figure was derived; and
(H) The degree to which the error rate exceeded the national performance measure in the subject fiscal year.
(ii) (A) The following criteria and methodology shall be used to assess and evaluate good cause in conjunction with the appeals process, and to determine that portion of the error rate/liability amount attributable to the uncontrollable effects of unusual caseload growth:
(
1
) Geographical impact of the caseload growth;
(
2
) State efforts to control impact on program operations;
(
3
) The proportion of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program caseload affected; and/or
(
4
) The duration of the caseload growth and its impact on program operations.
(B) Adjustments for these factors may result in a waiver of all, part, or none of the liability amount for the applicable period. As appropriate, the waiver amount will be adjusted to reflect States' otherwise effective administration of the program based upon the degree to which the error rate exceeded the national performance measure. For example, a reduction in the waiver amount may be made when a
State agency's recent error rate history indicates that even absent the events described the State agency would have exceeded the national performance measure in the review period. Under this approach, unless the State agency can demonstrate a direct uncontrollable impact on the error rate, the effects of caseload growth that ended prior to the second half of the prior fiscal year will not be considered.
(iii) If the State agency has provided insufficient information to determine a waiver amount for the uncontrollable effects of caseload growth using factual analysis, the waiver amount shall be evaluated using the following five-step calculation:
(A) Step 1—determine the average number of households certified to participate Statewide in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for the base period consisting of twelve consecutive months ending with March of the prior fiscal year;
(B) Step 2—determine the percentage of increase in caseload growth from the base period (Step 1) using the average number of households certified to participate Statewide in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for any twelve consecutive months in the period beginning with April of the prior fiscal year and ending with June of the current year;
(C) Step 3—determine the percentage the error rate for the subject fiscal year, as calculated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, exceeds the national performance measure determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section;
(D) Step 4—divide the percentage of caseload growth increase arrived at in step 2 by the percentage the error rate for the subject fiscal year exceeds the national performance measure as determined in step 3; and
(E) Step 5—multiply the quotient arrived at in step 4 by the liability amount for the current fiscal year to determine the amount of waiver of liability.
(iv) Under this methodology, caseload growth of less than 15% and/or occurring in the last three months of the subject fiscal year will not be considered. Mathematically this formula could result in a waiver of more than 100 percent of the liability amount; however, no more than 100 percent of a State's liability amount will be waived for any one fiscal year.
(4)
Program changes.
A change in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or other Federal or State program that has a substantial adverse impact on the management of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program of a State. Requests for relief from errors caused by the uncontrollable effects of unusual program changes other than those variances already excluded by § 275.12(d)(2)(vii) will be considered to the extent the program change is not common to all States.
(i) When submitting a request for good cause relief based on unusual changes in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or other Federal or State programs, the State agency shall provide the following information:
(A) The type of changes(s) that occurred;
(B) When the change(s) occurred;
(C) The nature of the adverse effect of the changes on program operations and the State agency's efforts to mitigate these effects;
(D) Reason(s) the State agency was unable to adequately handle the change(s);
(E) Identification and explanation of the uncontrollable errors caused by the changes (types of errors, geographic location of the errors, time period during which the errors occurred, etc.);
(F) The percentage of the payment error rate that resulted from the adverse impact of the change(s) and how this figure was derived; and
(G) The degree to which the payment error rate exceeded the national performance measure in the subject fiscal year.
(ii) (A) The following criteria will be used to assess and evaluate good cause in conjunction with the appeals process and to determine that portion of the error rate/liability amount attributable to the uncontrollable effects of unusual changes in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or other Federal and State programs:
(
1
) State efforts to control impact on program operations;
(
2
) The proportion of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program caseload affected; and/or
(
3
) The duration of the unusual changes in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or other Federal and State programs and the impact on program operations.
(B) Adjustments for these factors may result in a waiver of all, part, or none of the liability amount for the applicable period. As appropriate, the waiver amount will be adjusted to reflect States' otherwise effective administration of the program based upon the degree to which the error rate exceeded the national performance measure.
(5)
Significant circumstances beyond the control of a State agency.
Requests for relief from errors caused by the uncontrollable effect of a significant circumstance other than those specifically set forth in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(4) of this section will be considered to the extent that the circumstance is not common to all States, such as a fire in a certification office.
(i) The State agency shall provide the following information when submitting a request for good cause relief based on significant circumstances, the State agency shall provide the following information:
(A) The significant circumstances that the State agency believes uncontrollably and adversely affected the payment error rate for the fiscal year in question;
(B) Why the State agency had no control over the significant circumstances;
(C) How the significant circumstances had an uncontrollable and adverse impact on the State agency's error rate;
(D) Where the significant circumstances existed (
i.e.
Statewide or in particular counties);
(E) When the significant circumstances existed (provide specific dates whenever possible);
(F) The proportion of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program caseload whose management was affected;
(G) Identification and explanation of the uncontrollable errors caused by the event (types of errors, geographic location of the errors, time period during which the errors occurred, etc.);
(H) The percentage of the payment error rate that was caused by the significant circumstances and how this figure was derived; and
(I) The degree to which the payment error rate exceeded the national performance measure in the subject fiscal year.
(ii) (A) The following criteria shall be used to assess and evaluate good cause in conjunction with the appeals process, and to determine that portion of the error rate/liability amount attributable to the uncontrollable effects of a significant circumstance beyond the control of the State agency, other than those set forth in paragraph (f)(5) of this section:
(
1
) Geographical impact of the significant circumstances;
(
2
) State efforts to control impact on program operations;
(
3
) The proportion of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program caseload affected; and/or
(
4
) The duration of the significant circumstances and the impact on program operations.
(B) Adjustments for these factors may result in a waiver of all, part, or none of the liability amount for the applicable period. As appropriate, the waiver amount will be adjusted to reflect States' otherwise effective administration of the program based upon the degree to which the error rate exceeded the national performance measure.
(6)
Adjustments.
When good cause is found under the criteria in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(5) of this section, the waiver amount may be adjusted to reflect States' otherwise effective administration of the program based upon the degree to which the error rate exceeds the national performance measure.
(7)
Evidence.
When submitting a request to the ALJ for good cause relief, the State agency shall include such data and documentation as is necessary to support and verify the information submitted in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section so as to fully explain how
a particular significant circumstance(s) uncontrollably affected its payment error rate.
(8)
Finality.
The initial decision of the ALJ concerning good cause shall constitute the final determination for purposes of judicial review as established under the provisions of § 283.17 and § 283.20 of this chapter.
(g)
Results of appeals on liability amount determinations.
(1) If a State agency wholly prevails on appeal and, consequently, its liability amount is reduced to $0 through the appeal, and if the State agency began new investment activities prior to the appeal determination, FNS shall pay to the State agency an amount equal to 50 percent of the new investment amount that was expended by the State agency.
(2) If FNS wholly prevails on a State agency's appeal, FNS will require the State agency to invest all or a portion of the amount designated for new investment to be invested or to be paid to the Federal government.
(3) If neither the State agency nor FNS wholly prevails on a State agency's appeal, FNS shall apply the original waiver, new investment, and at-risk percentage determinations to the liability amount established through the appeal. If the State agency began new investment prior to the appeal decision and has already expended more than the amount produced for new investment as a result of the appeal decision, the Department will match the amount of funds expended in excess of the amount now required by the Department for new investment.
(h)
New investment requirements.
Once FNS has determined the percentage of a liability amount to be invested or following an appeal and recalculation by FNS of an amount to be invested, a State agency shall submit a plan of offsetting investments in program administration activities intended to reduce error rates.
(1) The State agency's investment plan activity or activities must meet the following conditions to be accepted by the Department:
(i) The activity or activities must be directly related to error reduction in the ongoing program, with specific objectives regarding the amount of error reduction, and type of errors that will be reduced. The costs of demonstration, research, or evaluation projects under sections 17(a) through (c) of the Act will not be accepted. The State agency may direct the investment plan to a specific project area or implement the plan on a Statewide basis. In addition, the Department will allow an investment plan to be tested in a limited area, as a pilot project, if the Department determines it to be appropriate. A request by the State agency for a waiver of existing rules will not be acceptable as a component of the investment plan. The State agency must submit any waiver request through the normal channels for approval and receive approval of the request prior to including the waiver in the investment plan. Waivers that have been approved for the State agency's use in the ongoing operation of the program may continue to be used.
(ii) The program administration activity must represent a new or increased expenditure. The proposed activity must also represent an addition to the minimum program administration required by law for State agency administration including corrective action. Therefore, basic training of eligibility workers or a continuing correction action from a Corrective Action Plan shall not be acceptable. The State agency may include a previous initiative in its plan; however, the State agency would have to demonstrate that the initiative is entirely funded by State money, represents an increase in spending and there are no remaining Federal funds earmarked for the activity.
(iii) Investment activities must be funded in full by the State agency, without any matching Federal funds until the entire amount agreed to is spent. Amounts spent in excess of the settlement amount included in the plan may be subject to Federal matching funds.
(2) The request shall include:
(i) A statement of the amount of money that is a quality control liability claim that is to be offset by investment in program improvements;
(ii) A detailed description of the planned program administration activity;
(iii) Planned expenditures, including time schedule and anticipated cost breakdown;
(iv) Anticipated impact of the activity, identifying the types of error expected to be affected;
(v) Documentation that the funds would not replace expenditures already earmarked for an ongoing effort; and
(vi) A statement that the expenditures are not simply a reallocation of resources.
(3) A State agency may choose to begin expending State funds for any amount of the liability designated as “new investment” in the liability amount determination prior to any appeal. FNS reserves the right to approve whether the expenditure meets the requirements for new investment. Expenditures made prior to approval by the Department will be subject to approval before they are accepted. Once a new investment plan is approved, the State agency shall submit plan modifications to the Department for approval, prior to implementation.
(4) Each State agency which has part of a liability designated for new investment shall submit periodic documented reports according to a schedule in its approved investment plan. At a minimum, these reports shall contain:
(i) A detailed description of the expenditure of funds, including the source of funds and the actual goods and services purchased or rented with the funds;
(ii) A detailed description of the actual activity; and
(iii) An explanation of the activity's effect on errors, including an explanation of any discrepancy between the planned effect and the actual effect.
(5) Any funds that the State agency's reports do not document as spent as specified in the new investment plan may be recovered by the Department. Before the funds are withdrawn, the State agency will be provided an opportunity to provide the missing documentation.
(6) If the funds are recovered, the Department shall charge interest on the funds not spent according to the plan in accordance with paragraph (j) of this section.
(i)
At-risk money.
If appropriate, FNS shall initiate collection action on each claim for such liabilities before the end of the fiscal year following the reporting period in which the claim arose unless an administrative appeal relating to the claim is pending. Such appeals include administrative and judicial appeals pursuant to Section 14 of the Food and Nutrition Act. If a State agency, in the subsequent year, is again subject to a liability amount based on the national performance measure and the error rate issued to the State agency, the State agency will be required to remit to FNS any money designated as at-risk for the prior fiscal year in accordance with either the original liability amount or a revised liability amount arising from an appeal, as appropriate, within 30 days of the date of the final billing. The requirement that the State agency pay the at-risk amount for the prior year will be held in abeyance pending the outcome of any pending appeal for the subsequent liability. If the subsequent year's liability is reduced to $0, the at-risk money from for the prior fiscal year will not be required to be paid. If the subsequent year's liability is not reduced to $0, the State agency will be required to pay the at-risk money within 30 days of the date of the appeal decision. The amount of a State's at-risk money may be recovered through offsets to the State agency's letter of credit as identified in § 277.16(c) of this chapter. FNS shall also have the option of billing a State directly or using other claims collection mechanisms authorized under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-134) and the Federal Claims Collection Standards (31 CFR Parts 900-904), depending upon the amount of the State's liability.
(j)
Interest charges.
(1) To the extent that a State agency does not pay an at-risk amount within 30 days from the date on which the bill for collection is received by the State agency, the State agency shall be liable for interest on any unpaid portion of such claim accruing from the date on which the bill for collection was received by the State agency. If the State agency is notified that it failed to invest funds in accordance with an approved new investment plan, the State agency has 30
days from the date of receipt of notification of non-expenditure of new investment funds to pay the Department the amount of funds not so invested. If the State agency does not pay the Department the amount of funds not invested within 30 days from the date of receipt of the notification of non-expenditure, the State agency shall be liable for interest on the non-expended funds from the date on which the notification was received by the State agency. If the State agency agrees to pay the claim through reduction in Federal financial participation for administrative costs, this agreement shall be considered to be paying the claim. If the State agency appeals such claim (in whole or in part), the interest on any unpaid portion of the claim shall accrue from the date of the decision on the administrative appeal, or from a date that is one year after the date the bill is received, whichever is earlier, until the date the unpaid portion of the payment is received.
(2) A State agency may choose to pay the amount designated as at-risk prior to resolution of any appeals. If the State agency pays such claim (in whole or in part) and the claim is subsequently overturned or adjusted through administrative or judicial appeal, any amounts paid by the State agency above what is actually due shall be promptly returned with interest, accruing from the date the payment was received until the date the payment is returned.
(3) Any interest assessed under paragraph (j)(1) of this section shall be computed at a rate determined by the Secretary based on the average of the bond equivalent of the weekly 90-day Treasury bill auction rates during the period such interest accrues. The bond equivalent is the discount rate (
i.e.,
the price the bond is actually sold for as opposed to its face value) determined by the weekly auction (
i.e.,
the difference between the discount rate and face value) converted to an annualized figure. The Secretary shall use the investment rate (
i.e.,
the rate for 365 days) compounded in simple interest for the period for which the claim is not paid. Interest billings shall be made quarterly with the initial billing accruing from the date the interest is first due. Because the discount rate for Treasury bills is issued weekly, the interest rate for State agency claims shall be averaged for the appropriate weeks.

§ 275.24
High performance bonuses.
(a)
General rule.
(1) FNS will award bonuses totaling $48 million for each fiscal year to State agencies that show high or improved performance in accordance with the performance measures under paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) FNS will award the bonuses no later than September 30th of the fiscal year following the performance measurement year.
(3) A State agency is not eligible for a bonus payment in any fiscal year for which it has a liability amount established as a result of an excessive payment error rate in the same year. If a State is disqualified from receiving a bonus payment under this paragraph (a)(3), and the State is not tied for a bonus, the State with the next best performance will be awarded a bonus payment.
(4) The determination whether, and in what amount, to award a performance bonus payment is not subject to administrative or judicial review.
(5) In determining the amount of the award, FNS will first award a base amount of $100,000 to each State agency that is an identified winner in each category. Subsequently, FNS will divide the remaining money among the States in each category (see paragraph (b) of this section) in proportion to the size of their caseloads (the average number of households per month for the fiscal year for which performance is measured).
(6) A State cannot be awarded two bonuses in the same category; the relevant categories are payment accuracy (which is outlined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section), negative error rate (which is outlined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section), or program access index (which is outlined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section). If a State is determined to be among the best and the most improved in a category, it will be awarded
a bonus only for being the best. The next State in the best category will be awarded a bonus as being among the best States.
(7) Where there is a tie to the fourth decimal point for the categories outlined in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section, FNS will add the additional State(s) into the category and the money will be divided among all the States in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
(8) Bonus award money shall be used only on SNAP-related expenses including, but not limited to, investments in technology; improvements in administration and distribution; and actions to prevent fraud, waste and abuse.
(i) Bonus payments shall not be used for household benefits, including incentive payments.
(ii) State agency awardees shall submit their intended spending plans of bonus payments to FNS to verify appropriate use.
(b)
Performance measures.
FNS will measure performance by and base awards on the following categories of performance measures:
(1)
Payment accuracy.
FNS will divide $24 million among the 10 States with the lowest and the most improved combined payment error rates as specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
(i)
Excellence in payment accuracy.
FNS will provide bonuses to the 7 States with the lowest combined payment error rates based on the validated quality control payment error rates for the performance measurement year as determined in accordance with this part.
(ii)
Most improved in payment accuracy.
FNS will provide bonuses to the 3 States with the largest percentage point decrease in their combined payment error rates based on the comparison of the validated quality control payment error rates for the performance measurement year and the previous fiscal year, as determined in accordance with this part.
(2)
Negative error rate.
FNS will divide $6 million among the 6 States with the lowest and the most improved negative error rates as specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
(i)
Lowest negative error rate.
FNS will provide bonuses to the 4 States with the lowest negative error rates based on the validated quality control negative error rates for the performance year as determined in accordance with this part.
(ii)
Most improved negative error rate.
FNS will provide bonuses to the 2 States with the largest percentage point decrease in their negative error rates, based on the comparison of the performance measurement year's validated quality control negative error rates with those of the previous fiscal year, as determined in accordance with this part. A State agency is not eligible for a bonus under this criterion if the State's negative error rate for the fiscal year is more than 50 percent above the national average.
(3)
Program access index (PAI).
FNS will divide $12 million among the 8 States with the highest and the most improved level of participation as specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (b)(3)(iii) of this section. The PAI is the ratio of participants to persons with incomes below 125 percent of poverty, as calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section (the PAI was formerly known as the participant access rate (PAR)).
(i)
High program access index.
FNS will provide bonuses to the 4 States with the highest PAI as determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Most improved program access index.
FNS will provide bonuses to the 4 States with the most improved PAI as determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section.
(iii)
Data.
For the number of participants (numerator), FNS will use the administrative annual counts of participants minus new participants certified under special disaster program rules by State averaged over the calendar year. For the number of people below 125 percent of poverty (denominator), FNS will use the Census Bureau's March Supplement to the Current Population Survey's (CPS) count of people below 125 percent of poverty for the same calendar year. FNS will reduce the count in each State where a Food Distribution Program on Indian
Reservations (FDPIR) program is operated by the administrative counts of the number of individuals who participate in this program averaged over the calendar year. FNS will reduce the count in California by the Census Bureau's percentage of people below 125% of poverty in California who received Supplemental Security Income in the previous year. FNS reserves the right to use data from the American Community Survey (ACS) in lieu of the CPS, and to use the count of people below 130 percent of poverty, should these data become available in a timely fashion and prove more accurate. Such a substitution would apply to all States.
(4)
Application processing timeliness.
FNS will divide $6 million among the 6 States with the highest percentage of timely processed applications.
(i)
Data.
FNS will use quality control data to determine each State's rate of application processing timeliness.
(ii)
Timely processed applications.
A timely processed application is one that provides an eligible applicant the “opportunity to participate” as defined in § 274.2 of this chapter, within thirty days for normal processing or 7 days for expedited processing. New applications that are processed outside of this standard are untimely for this measure, except for applications that are properly pended in accordance with § 273.2(h)(2) of this chapter because verification is incomplete and the State agency has taken all the actions described in § 273.2(h)(1)(i)(C) of this chapter. Such applications will not be included in this measure. Applications that are denied will not be included in this measure.
(iii)
Evaluation of applications.
Only applications that were filed on or after the beginning of the performance measurement (fiscal) year will be evaluated under this measure.

§ 276.1
Responsibilities and rights.
(a)
Responsibilities.
(1) State agencies shall be responsible for establishing and maintaining secure control over coupons and cash for which the regulations designate them accountable. Except as otherwise provided in these regulations, any shortages or losses of coupons and cash shall strictly be a State agency liability and the State agency shall pay to FNS, upon demand, the amount of the lost or stolen coupons or cash, regardless of the circumstances.
(2) State agencies shall be responsible for preventing losses or shortages of Federal funds in the issuance of benefits to households participating in the Program. FNS shall strictly hold State agencies liable for all losses, thefts and unaccounted shortages that occur during issuance, unless otherwise specified. Issuance functions begin with the State agency's creation of a record-for-issuance to generate each month's issuances from the master issuance file. Shortages or losses which result from any functions that occur prior to the creation of the record-for-issuance are subject to either paragraph (a)(3) of this section or subpart C—Quality Control (QC) Reviews, of part 275—Performance Reporting System.
(3) State agencies shall be responsible for preventing losses of Federal funds in the certification of households for participation in the Program. If FNS makes a determination that there has been negligence or fraud on the part of a State agency in the certification of households for participation in the Program, FNS is authorized to bill the State agency for an amount equal to the amount of coupons issued as a result of the negligence or fraud.
(4) State agencies shall be responsible for efficiently and effectively administering the Program by complying with the provisions of the Act, the regulations issued pursuant to the Act,
and the FNS-approved State Plan of Operation. A determination by FNS that a State agency has failed to comply with any of these provisions may result in FNS seeking injunctive relief to compel compliance and/or a suspension or disallowance of the Federal share of the State agency's administrative funds. FNS has the discretion to determine in each instance of noncompliance, whether to seek injunctive relief or to suspend or disallow administrative funds. FNS may seek injunctive relief
and
suspend or disallow funds simultaneously or in sequence.
(b)
Rights.
State agencies may appeal all claims brought against them by FNS and shall be afforded an administrative review by a designee of the Secretary as provided in § 276.7. State agencies may seek judicial review of any final administrative determination made by the Secretary's designee, as provided in § 276.7(j).
[54 FR 7016, Feb. 15, 1989]
§ 276.2
State agency liabilities.
(a)
General provisions.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, State agencies shall be responsible to FNS for any financial losses involved in the acceptance, storage and issuance of coupons. All coupon issuance shall be documented, and the State agency shall make available to the Department all primary documentation (or secondary, if the primary has been inadvertently destroyed) when required to do so. State agencies shall pay to FNS, upon demand, the amount of any such losses.
(b)
Coupon shortages, losses, unauthorized issuances, overissuances and undocumented issuances.
(1) State agencies shall be strictly liable for:
(i) Coupon shortages and losses that occur any time after coupons have been accepted by receiving points within the State and that occur during storage or the movement of coupons between bulk storage point issuers and claims collection points within the State;
(ii) Losses resulting from authorization documents lost in transit from a manufacturer to the State agency and untransacted authorization documents lost in transit from an issuer to the State agency; and
(iii) The value of coupons overissued and coupons issued without authorization, except for those duplicate issuances in the correct amount that are the result of replacement issuances made in accordance with § 274.6. Overissuances and unauthorized issuances for which State agencies are liable include, but are not limited to: Single unmatched issuances, duplicates made that are not in accordance with § 274.6, and transacted authorization documents that are altered, counterfeit, from out-of-State or expired (including those unsigned by the designated household member and/or not date stamped by the issuer).
(2) Coupon shortages and/or losses for which State agencies shall be held strictly liable include, but are not limited to, the following:
(i) Thefts;
(ii) Embezzlements;
(iii) Cashier errors (e.g., errors by the personnel of issuance offices in the counting of coupon books);
(iv) Coupons lost in natural disasters if a State agency cannot provide reasonable evidence that the coupons were destroyed and not redeemed;
(v) Issuances which cannot be supported by the required documentation;
(vi) Issuances made to households not currently certified;
(vii) Issuance loss during an official investigation, unless the investigation was reported
directly
to FNS prior to the loss; and
(viii) Unexplained causes.
(3) State agencies shall submit written reports on significant losses unless those losses were investigated by the Office of the Inspector General, USDA.
(4) A State agency shall be held strictly liable for mail issuance losses that are in excess of the tolerance level that corresponds to the preselected reporting unit. Each State agency shall select one of the three following units annually and report the selection as provided in §§ 272.2(a)(2) and 272.2(d)(1)(iii). Where reporting units issue less than $300,000 in mail issuance in a quarter, the State agency shall be liable for all losses in excess of $1,500 for the quarter.
(i) If a State agency elects to report and have liabilities based on an existing county or project area level of mail
issuance, then the State agency shall be strictly liable to FNS for the value of all mail issuance losses in excess of five-tenths (.5) percent of the dollar value of each reporting unit's quarterly mail issuance. This level shall be used if the State agency does not designate one of the three levels herein by May 15, 1989, and by August 15 in years thereafter.
(ii) If a State agency elects to report and have liabilities based on an existing administrative level higher than the county or project area provided in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, but lower than the Statewide level of mail issuance provided in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section, then the State agency shall be strictly liable to FNS for the value of all mail issuance losses in excess of thirty-five hundreths (.35) percent per quarter of the dollar value of each reporting unit's quarterly mail issuance. State agencies shall not create new administrative units for the sole purpose of reporting mail issuance losses.
(iii) If a State agency elects to report and have liabilities based on a State level of mail issuance, then the State agency shall be strictly liable to FNS for the value of all mail issuance losses in excess of thirty hundreths (.30) percent per quarter of the dollar value of each State agency's total quarterly mail issuance.
(iv) FNS reserves the right to make all determinations on reporting requirements and on administrative divisions within the State for the purpose of determining and assessing liability for mail issuance losses. FNS also reserves the right to revise such determinations as necessary. Revisions will be communicated to State agencies by FNS. The liability assessment will be based on the revised reporting requirement for the next full fiscal quarter.
(v) For the purpose of this section, “mail issuance” means all original coupon issuances distributed through the mail. “Mail loss” means all replacements of mail issuances except for replacements of returned mail issuances.
(vi) The State agency's liability shall be computed using data from Form FNS-259, Food Stamp Mail Issuance Report, or alternative reporting document accepted in advance by FNS and the State agency, which is submitted for the quarter for the particular reporting unit agreed to by FNS and the State agency, as provided in §§ 272.2(a)(2) and 272.2(d)(1)(iii).
(5) State agencies shall be held strictly liable for the following overissuances:
(i) The value of overissued coupons issued as a result of a State agency's failure to comply with a directive issued by FNS in accordance with the provisions of § 271.7, to reduce, suspend or cancel allotments;
(ii) The value of coupons overissued by the State agency as a result of a court order or settlement agreement of a court suit which was not reported to FNS in accordance with the provisions of § 272.4(e); and
(iii) The value of coupons overissued as a result of a State agency entering into an out-of-court settlement of a court suit, the terms of which violate Federal laws or regulations.
(6) Coupon shortages and losses shall be determined from the Form FNS-250, Food Coupon Accountability Report and its supporting documents and from the Form FNS-46, Issuance System Reconciliation Report. Losses of Federal moneys resulting from overissuances shall be determined from sources such as audits, Performance Reporting System Reviews, Federal reviews, investigations and explanatory reports prepared by the State agency.
(7) State agencies shall be held strictly liable for overissuances resulting from Electronic Benefit Transfer system errors and unauthorized account activities. Such overissuances shall include but not be limited to: Overissuances to household accounts that are accessed and used by households, replacement benefits to a household's account due to unauthorized use of the benefits in a household's account, benefits drawn from an EBT account after the household has reported that the EBT card is lost or stolen to the State or its agent, overdraft situations due to the use of manual back-up procedures approved by the State agency, overcredits to a retailer account and transfer of funds to an illegitimate account.
(c)
Cash Losses.
State agencies are liable to FNS for cash losses when money collected by State agencies from recipient claims has been lost, stolen or otherwise not remitted to FNS in accordance with the provision of § 273.18(l). The amount of such losses shall be determined from the sources outlined in paragraph (6) of this section.
(d)
State agency payment to FNS.
State agencies shall be billed for the exact amount of losses specified in this section. If a State agency fails to pay the billing, FNS shall offset the amount of loss from the State agency's Letter of Credit in accordance with § 277.16(c).
[54 FR 7016, Feb. 15, 1989, as amended at 54 FR 51351, Dec. 15, 1989; 57 FR 11259, Apr. 1, 1992; 57 FR 44791, Sept. 29, 1992; Amdt. 342, 59 FR 2733, Jan. 19, 1994; Amdt. 388, 65 FR 64589, Oct. 30, 2000; 75 FR 78154, Dec. 15, 2010]
§ 276.3
Negligence or fraud.
(a)
General.
If FNS determines that there has been negligence or fraud on the part of the State agency in the certification of applicant households, the State agency shall, upon demand, pay to FNS a sum equal to the amount of coupons issued as a result of such negligence or fraud.
(b)
Negligence provisions.
(1) FNS may determine that a State agency has been negligent in the certification of applicant households if a State agency disregards SNAP requirements contained in the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, the regulations issued pursuant to the Act, the FNS-approved State Plan of Operation and a loss of Federal funds results or a State agency implements procedures which deviate from SNAP requirements contained in the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, the SNAP regulations, the FNS-approved State Plan of Operation without first obtaining FNS approval, and the implementation of the procedures results in a loss of Federal funds.
(2) In computing amounts of losses of Federal funds due to negligence, FNS may use actual, documented amounts or amounts which have been determined through the use of statistically valid projections. When a statistically valid projection is used, the methodology will include a 95 percent, one-sided confidence level.
(3) FNS will base its determinations of negligence on information drawn from any of a number of sources. These information sources include, but are not limited to, State and Federal Performance Reporting reviews, State and Federal audits and investigations, State corrective action plans and any required reports.
(4) Failure by the State agency to remit payment upon demand, within the specified time period, may result in FNS recovering the lost funds through offsets to the State agency's Letter of Credit, in accordance with § 277.16(c).
(c)
Fraud provisions.
For purposes of this subsection, the term fraud shall mean the wrongful acquisition or issuance of food coupons by the State agency or its officers, employees or agents, including issuance agents, through false representation or concealment of material facts. State agencies shall be liable to FNS for the amount of loss of Federal funds as a result of fraud. Failure by the State agency to remit payment on demand by FNS, within the time period specified, may result in offsets to the Letter of Credit in accordance with § 277.16(c).
[Amdt. 168, 45 FR 77263, Nov. 21, 1980, as amended by Amdt. 262, 49 FR 50598, Dec. 31, 1984; Amdt. 356, 59 FR 29713, June 9, 1994]
§ 276.4
Suspension/disallowance of administrative funds.
(a)
General provisions.
(1) FNS shall make determinations of the efficiency and effectiveness of State agencies' administration of SNAP in accordance with the provisions of § 275.25. When making such determinations, FNS shall use all information that is available relating to State agencies' administration of the Program. This information includes, but is not limited to, information received from Performance Reporting System reviews, Federal reviews, audits, investigations, corrective action plans, financial management reviews, and the public.
(2) FNS may determine a State agency's administration of the Program to be inefficient or ineffective if the State agency fails to comply with the SNAP requirements established by the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, the regulations issued pursuant to the Act, or the FNS-approved State Plan of Operation.
(3) If FNS determines that a State agency's administration of the Program is inefficient or ineffective, FNS may warn the State agency that a suspension and/or disallowance of administrative funds is being considered. After a State agency receives a warning, FNS may either suspend or disallow administrative funds or take both actions in sequence, depending on the statement in the warning.
(b)
Suspension.
A suspension of funds is an action by FNS to temporarily withhold all or a portion of the Federal share of one or more of the cost categories of a State agency's budget for administration of SNAP. Suspensions of funds shall remain in effect until FNS determines that a State agency has taken adequate corrective action to correct the problem causing the suspension, in which event the suspension will be rescinded, or until FNS decides to disallow the suspended funds. FNS shall suspend funds in accordance with § 277.16.
(c)
Disallowance.
(1) A disallowance of funds is an action by FNS in which reimbursement is denied for otherwise reimbursable administrative costs claimed by a State agency in one or more of the cost categories of a State agency's budget for Program administration.
(2) In accordance with § 277.16, FNS has the option of disallowing funds in another cost category, or all or a portion of the entire Letter of Credit if the disallowance is based on a finding that the State agency failed to take a required action. FNS may disallow funds after previously suspending such funds or may disallow funds immediately following the expiration of the formal warning under the conditions specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
(d)
Warning process.
Prior to taking action to suspend or disallow Federal funds, except those funds which are disallowed when a State agency fails to adhere to the cost principles of part 277 and 2 CFR part 200, subparts D and E and USDA implementing regulations 2 CFR part 400 and part 415, FNS shall provide State agencies with written advance notification that such action is being considered. If a State agency does not respond to such an advance notification to the satisfaction of FNS, FNS shall provide the State agency with a formal warning of the possibility of suspension or disallowance action. However, when a State agency fails to meet the objectives in a corrective action plan, FNS may omit the advance notification and immediately issue a formal warning.
(1)
Advance notification.
Immediately upon becoming aware that a deficiency or deficiencies in a State agency's administration of the Program may warrant the suspension and/or disallowance of Federal funds, FNS shall advise the State agency in writing of the deficiency and shall provide a specific period of time for correction of such deficiency or deficiencies. The time period allowed the State agency for corrective action will vary according to the nature of the deficiency.
(2)
Formal warning.
FNS shall issue a formal warning to a State agency if the State fails to correct to the satisfaction of FNS the deficiencies noted in an advance notification within the time specified in the advance notification. FNS may also issue a formal warning to a State agency without first issuing an advance notification if a State agency fails to comply with a corrective action plan.
(i) Formal warnings shall include the following information:
(A) Specific descriptions of the deficiencies, explaining how the State agency is out of compliance with Program requirements;
(B) A Statement as to whether Federal funds will be suspended, disallowed or both, if appropriate;
(C) The amount of Federal funds that will be suspended and/or disallowed or an estimate of the amount if actual cost are unavailable; and
(D) A statement of FNS' willingness to assist State agencies is resolving the deficiencies.
(ii) A State agency shall have 30 days from receipt of a formal warning to submit evidence that it is in compliance or to submit a corrective action proposal, including the date the State agency will be in compliance.
(iii) When the deficiency cannot be corrected within 30 days of receipt of a formal warning but the State agency submits an acceptable plan for correcting the deficiency, FNS shall hold
the formal warning in abeyance pending completion of the actions contained in the plan within the time specified in the plan.
(iv) FNS shall cancel a formal warning when the State agency submits evidence that shows, to the satisfaction of FNS, that the deficiency has been eliminated.
(e)
Suspension/disallowance of funds.
The Administrator of FNS shall notify State agencies in writing by certified mail or through personal service that administrative funds are being suspended or disallowed. Such action may occur when any of the following situations arise:
(1) A State agency fails to respond to the deficiencies cited in a formal warning within 30 days of receiving the warning;
(2) The response by a State agency to the deficiencies cited in a formal warning is unsatisfactory to FNS; or
(3) A State agency fails to meet the commitments it made in its corrective action proposal and a formal warning had been held in abeyance pending completion of that corrective action.
(f)
Appeals.
After FNS has taken action to disallow Federal funds the State agency may request an appeal in accordance with the procedures specified in § 276.7.
[Amdt. 168, 45 FR 77263, Nov. 21, 1980, as amended by Amdt. 266, 52 FR 3410, Feb. 4, 1987; 79 FR 11, Jan. 2, 2014; 81 FR 66499, Sept. 28, 2016]
§ 276.5
Injunctive relief.
(a)
General.
If FNS determines that a State agency has failed to comply with the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, the regulations issued pursuant to the Act, or the FNS-approved State Plan of Operations, the Secretary may seek injunctive relief against the State agency to require compliance. The Secretary may request injunctive relief concurrently with negligence billings and sanctions against State agencies affecting administrative funds.
(b)
Requesting injunctive relief.
Prior to seeking injunctive relief to require compliance, FNS shall notify the State agency of the determination of noncompliance and provide the State agency with a specific period of time to correct the deficiency. The Secretary shall have the discretion to determine the time periods State agencies will have to correct deficiencies. If the State agency does not correct the failure within the specified time period and the Department decides to seek injunctive relief, the Secretary shall refer the matter to the Attorney General with a request that injunctive relief be sought to require compliance.
[Amdt. 168, 45 FR 77263, Nov. 21, 1980]
§ 276.6
Good cause.
(a) When a State agency has failed to comply with provisions of the Act, the regulations issued pursuant to the Act, or the FNS-approved State Plan of Operation, and, thus, is subject to the suspension/disallowance and injunctive relief provisions in §§ 276.4 and 276.5, FNS may determine that the State had good cause for the noncompliance. FNS shall evaluate good cause in these situations on a case-by-case basis, based on any one of the following criteria:
(1) Natural disasters or civil disorders that adversely affect Program operations;
(2) Strikes by State agency staff;
(3) Change in SNAP or other Federal or State programs that result in a substantial adverse impact upon a State agency's management of the Program; and
(4) Any other circumstances in which FNS determines good cause to exist.
(b) If FNS determines that food cause existed for a State agency's failure to comply with required provisions and standards, FNS shall not suspend or disallow administrative funds nor seek injunctive relief to compel compliance with the provisions and standards.
[Amdt. 168, 45 FR 77263, Nov. 21, 1980]
§ 276.7
Administrative review process.
(a)
General.
(1) Whenever FNS asserts a claim against a State agency, the State agency may appeal the claim by requesting an administrative review. FNS claims that may be appealed are billings resulting from financial losses involved in the acceptance, storage, and issuance of coupons (§ 276.2), billings based on charges of negligence or fraud (§ 276.3), and disallowances of Federal funds for State agency failures to comply with the Food and Nutrition
Act of 2008, regulations, or the FNS-approved State Plan of Operations (§ 276.4).
(2) A State agency aggrieved by a claim shall have the option of requesting a hearing to present its position in addition to a review of the record and any written submission presented by the State agency. Unless circumstances warrant differently, hearings of appeals of negligence claims and disallowances of Federal funds shall be before an Appeals Board and hearings of appeals of other claims shall be before a single hearing official. In any case, the people reviewing the claim shall be people who were not involved in the decision to file the claim.
(b)
Notice of claim.
When asserting a claim against a State agency, FNS shall provide the notice to the State agency using any delivery method as long as the method provides evidence of the delivery.
(c)
Filing an appeal.
A State agency aggrieved by claims asserted against it may file written appeals with the Secretary, U.S. Department of Agriculture, c/o the Executive Secretary, State Food Stamp Appeals Board, Food and Nutrition Service, USDA, Washington, DC 20250, requesting an opportunity to present information in support of its position. The State agency shall attach a copy of the FNS claim to its appeal. Appeals must be filed with the Executive Secretary or postmarked within 10 days of the date of delivery of the notice of claim. If the State agency does not appeal within the prescribed 10-day period, the FNS decision on the claim shall be final. No extension shall be granted in the time allowed for filing an appeal.
(d)
Computation of time.
In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed under these procedures, the day of delivery of any notice of action, acknowledgment, or reply shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday or Federal or State holiday. In that case, the period runs until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or Federal or State holiday.
(e)
Stay of administrative action.
With one exception, the filing of a timely appeal and request for administrative review shall automatically stay the action of FNS to collect the claim asserted against the State agency until a decision is reached on the acceptability of the appeal, and in the case of an acceptable appeal, until a final determination has been issued. The exceptions to this provision are those claims that are asserted against State agencies due to State agency failure to comply with an order to reduce, suspend or cancel benefits in accordance with § 271.7. In situations where a State agency does not reduce, suspend or cancel benefits as directed and FNS takes action to disallow administrative funds or bill the State agency, the disallowance and/or billing shall remain in effect during the review process. Should the Appeals Board uphold the State agency, all disallowed funds and/or funds collected as a result of the billing shall be restored to the State agency promptly.
(f)
Acknowledging an appeal.
Upon receipt of an appeal and request for administrative review, the Executive Secretary shall provide the State agency with a written acknowledgment of the appeal, including a statement of whether or not the appeal is timely and can be accepted. A copy of each acknowledgment shall be provided to FNS. The acknowledgment of a timely and acceptable appeal and request for administrative review shall also include a copy of Secretary's Memorandum No. 2003, Revised, “State Food Stamp Appeals Board,” and the identity of the Appeals Board member(s) designated by the Secretary to review the claim.
(g)
Submitting additional information.
(1) State agencies shall have 30 days from their request for an appeal to submit five sets of the following information to the Executive Secretary of the Appeals Board:
(i) A clear, concise identification of the issue or issues in dispute;
(ii) The State agency's position with respect to the issue or issues in dispute;
(iii) The pertinent facts and reasons in support of the State agency's position with respect to the issue or issues in dispute;
(iv) All pertinent documents, correspondence and records which the
State agency believes are relevant and helpful toward a more thorough understanding of the issue or issues in dispute;
(v) The relief sought by the State agency;
(vi) The identity of the person(s) presenting the State agency's position when a hearing is involved; and
(vii) A list of prospective State agency witnesses when a hearing is involved.
(2) At the request of the Executive Secretary, FNS shall promptly submit five complete sets of all documents, correspondence and records compiled by FNS in support of its claim.
(3) The Executive Secretary shall provide each person hearing an appeal and FNS with a complete set of the State agency information when it is received. The Executive Secretary shall also provide each person hearing an appeal and the State agency with a complete set of the information supplied by FNS when it is received.
(h)
Scheduling and conducting hearings.
When a hearing is afforded, the Appeals Board or hearing official has up to 60 days from receipt of the State agency's information, outlined in paragraph (g) of this section, to schedule and conduct the hearing. The Executive Secretary shall advise the State agency of the time, date and location of the hearing at least 10 days in advance of the hearing. The State agency is solely responsible for ensuring the attendance of all State agency witnesses at the hearing.
(1) A hearing is an informal proceeding designed to permit the State agency an opportunity to present its position before a neutral third party. Because the final determination is subject to judicial review and trial
de novo,
the Appeals Board and hearing official shall not be bound by the rules of civil procedure applicable in the court or by the adjudicatory requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act.
(2) The Appeals Board Chairman, his designee or the hearing official is the presiding officer at the hearing. The presiding officer shall have full authority to ensure a fair and impartial proceeding, avoid delays, maintain order and decorum, receive evidence, examine witnesses, and otherwise regulate the course of the hearing. The State agency may represent itself at the hearing or be represented by counsel.
(3) The Appeals Board or hearing official shall receive into evidence the oral testimony of State agency witnesses and any documents which are relevant and material. Neither the Department nor FNS is required to present witnesses at the hearing. However, the Department and FNS shall make staff available to provide any information or clarification requested by the Appeals Board or hearing official. Under no circumstances shall the Department or FNS introduce new evidence at the hearing. Departmental and FNS staff, as well as State agency witnesses, shall be subject to examination by the Appeals Board or hearing official. Departmental and FNS staff shall not be subject to cross-examination by State agency representative or counsel. Likewise, State agency witnesses shall not be subject to cross-examination by Departmental or FNS staff. Each side shall be permitted to make a closing statement to the Appeals Board or hearing official upon completion of the taking of evidence and testimony.
(4) FNS and the State agency shall have the opportunity to submit additional written information to the Appeals Board or hearing official within 10 days after the close of the hearing. No new factual material may be introduced except as it directly relates to evidence or testimony presented at the hearing. Five complete sets of such information must be filed with the Executive Secretary or postmarked prior to the expiration of the 10-day deadline for it to be considered.
(5) An official verbatim transcript of each hearing shall be kept on file in the Office of the Executive Secretary for public inspection. A copy shall be furnished to FNS and the State agency. Anyone wishing to purchase a copy may make arrangements to do so with the commercial reporting service involved.
(i)
Final determination.
(1) When a hearing is afforded, a final determination shall be made within 30 days of the hearing, and the final determination shall take effect 30 days after delivery of the notice of this final decision to the State agency. When a hearing is
not held, a final determination shall be made within 30 days after receipt of the State agency's information. The final determination shall take effect 30 days after delivery of the notice of the final decision to the State agency.
(2) The Appeals Board or hearing official shall either uphold the claim, deny the claim, or adjust the claim downward in such amounts and for such reasons as the Appeals Board or hearing official shall determine and declare. The final determination is not subject to reconsideration.
(j)
Judicial review.
State agencies aggrieved by the final determination may obtain judicial review and trial
de novo
by filing a complaint against the United States within 30 days after the date of delivery of the final determination, requesting the court to set aside the final determination. The final determination shall remain in effect during the period the judicial review or any appeal therefrom is pending unless the court temporarily stays such administrative action after a showing that irreparable injury will occur absent a stay and that the State agency is likely to prevail on the merits of the case.
(k)
Extension of time.
(1) No extension of time shall be permitted a State agency in which to file an initial request for an administrative review. All other requests from the State agency or from FNS for the extension of any deadline contained in § 276.7 of these regulations or imposed by the Appeals Board or hearing official shall be granted only for good cause shown and only when received by the Executive Secretary before the expiration of the particular deadline involved. All requests for an extension shall be in writing. Filing a request for an extension stops the running of the prescribed period of time. When a request for an extension is granted, the requester shall be notified in writing of the amount of additional time granted. When a request is denied for being untimely or for cause, the requester shall be notified and the prescribed period of time shall resume from the date of denial.
(2) The Appeals Board or hearing official may grant itself such additional time as it may reasonably require to complete any of its assigned responsibilities. If the Appeals Board or hearing official does find it necessary to grant itself an extension of time, the Executive Secretary shall notify all parties in writing.

§ 277.1
General purpose and scope.
(a)
Purpose.
This part establishes uniform requirements for the management of administrative funds provided to State agencies and sets forth principles for claiming costs of activities paid with administrative funds under SNAP, and the Food Distribution Program and SNAP on Indian Reservations.
(b)
Scope and applicability.

The base percentage for Federal payment shall be 50 percent of State agencies' allowable SNAP administrative costs.
(1) Funding of demonstration projects approved by FNS will be at a rate agreed to by FNS in accordance with the requirements outlined in part 282.
(2) The reimbursement of administrative costs to State agencies administering the program on Indian reservations shall be in accordance with the requirements of parts 281 and 283.
(3) The federally funded share of administrative costs, as identified in paragraph (b) of this section may be decreased based upon its payment error rate as described in § 275.23. The rates of Federal funding for the activities identified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not be reduced based upon the agency's payment error rate.
(4) Employment and training program grants, as outlined in § 273.7(d) shall be 100 percent federally-funded.

Persuasive practices constitute coercing or pressuring an individual to apply, or providing incentives to fill out an application for SNAP benefits. Communicating factual information pertaining to SNAP so that an individual can make an informed choice is not a recruitment activity designed to persuade an individual to apply for SNAP benefits.
(ii) Television, radio or billboard advertisements that are designed to promote SNAP benefits and enrollment, excepting the use of such advertisements for programmatic activities undertaken with respect to benefits provided under § 280.1 of this chapter. This restriction does not apply to radio, television, or billboard advertisements that are not designed to promote SNAP benefits and enrollment and that provide factual information identifying retail food stores where SNAP benefits are accepted.
(iii) Agreements with foreign governments that are designed to promote SNAP benefits and enrollment.
(6) Any entity that receives funding from the programs identified by this
section and § 251.4 of this chapter is prohibited from compensating any person for conducting outreach activities relating to participation in, or for recruiting individuals to apply to receive benefits under, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, if the amount of the compensation would be based on the number of individuals who apply to receive the benefits.
(c)
Matching costs.
State agency costs for Federal matching funds may consist of:
(1) Charges reported on a cash or accrual basis by the State agency as project costs.
(2) Project costs financed with cash contributed or donated to the State agency by other non-Federal public agencies and institutions.
(3) Project costs represented by services and real or personal property donated by other non-Federal public agencies and institutions.
(d) All cash or in-kind contributions except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section shall be allowable as part of the State agency's share of program costs when such contributions:
(1) Are verifiable;
(2) Are not contributed for another federally-assisted program, unless authorized by Federal legislation;
(3) Are necessary and reasonable for accomplishment of project objectives;
(4) Are charges that would be allowable under this part;
(5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another assistance agreement unless authorized under the other agreement and its subject laws and regulations; and
(6) Are in the approved budget.
(e) The value of services rendered by volunteers or the value of goods contributed by third parties, exclusive of the State and Federal agencies, are unallowable for reimbursement purposes under the SNAP. The value of services rendered by volunteers shall be allowable only to meet any matching administrative costs requirements for the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations.
(f) The expenses (e.g. travel, lodging, meals) of persons working with volunteer or nonprofit organizations which receive training and assistance pursuant to § 272.4(d)(2) are not allowable.
(g) Investigations of authorized retail or wholesale food concerns when performed in coordination with the USDA Office of Inspector General and FNS shall be funded at the 50 percent Federal reimbursement rate.

§ 277.5
Methods of payment.
(a) This section sets forth FNS methods for authorizing funds for State agencies.
(b) The “Letter of Credit” (LOC) (SF-1193A) is the document by which an official of FNS authorizes a State agency to draw funds from the United States Treasury. This shall be the preferred method of payment for State agencies which receive at least $120,000 per year and meet the requirements prescribed in 2 CFR part 200, subpart D and USDA implementing regulations 2 CFR part 400 and part 415.
(c) State agencies shall request payment(s) by submitting Request for Payment on Letter of Credit and Status of Funds Report (Treasury Form SF-183) to the appropriate United States Treasury Regional Disbursing Office with a copy to FNS.
(d) State agencies not meeting the requirements for the LOC method of payment or failing to meet LOC reporting requirements, including those requiring adjustments to cash balances to liquidate amounts owed to FNS, shall be provided funds by Treasury check in accordance with the provisions of Department of the Treasury Circular 1075.
(e) Payments for proper charges incurred by State agencies will not be withheld unless such payments are suspended or disallowed pursuant to § 277.16. When a payment is withheld, payment adjustments will be made in accordance with § 277.16. When FNS collects an indebtedness, whether due to a disallowance or an offset for amounts which the State agency has been billed but which it has failed to pay without cause acceptable to FNS, FNS shall provide reasonable notice to the State agency, and shall require appropriate
accounting adjustment to cash balances for which the State agency is accountable to the Federal government to liquidate the indebtedness.

Frequency.
The report (SF-425, using FNS-778/FNS-778A worksheet) shall be required quarterly.
(3)
Exceptions.
Those State agencies that receive payments under the U.S. Treasury check system shall submit to FNS a Quarterly Report of Federal Cash Transactions (Form SF-272).
(4)
Due dates.
Quarterly reports shall be due April 30 (for the period January through March), July 30 (April through June), October 30 (July through September), January 30 (October through December). Final reports are due December 30 for all completed Federal fiscal years (October 1 through September 30) or 90 days after termination of Federal financial support. Requests from State agencies for extension of reporting due dates may be approved, if necessary.
(d)
Time limit for State agencies to file claims.
(1) After the deadline in paragraph (c)(4) of this section for the final SF-425, using FNS-778/FNS-778A worksheet, State agencies shall use the form specified by FNS as needed within three years of the end of the Federal fiscal year to amend a prior expenditure report pertaining to such Federal fiscal year. The three-year reporting deadline may be extended by FNS if litigation, an audit, or a claim is unresolved at the end of the three-year period. The reporting form shall be used to amend prior expenditure reports, and to request reimbursement for any additional funding due, or to pay back to FNS any inadvertent prior overclaim. Requests for reimbursement will only be honored if the claim is filed within the timeframe in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. FNS reserves the right to bill State agencies for amounts due FNS resulting from an overclaim, even if no reporting form has been submitted.
(2) Subject to the availability of funds from the appropriation for the year in which the expenditure was incurred, FNS may reimburse State agencies for an allowable expenditure only if the State agency files a claim with FNS for that expenditure within two years after the calendar quarter in which the State agency (or local agency) incurred the cost. FNS will consider non-cash expenditures such as depreciation to have been made in the quarter the expenditure was recorded in the accounting records of the State agency in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
(3) For Automated Data Processing (ADP) expenditures approved under § 277.18(c), subject to the availability of funds and required FNS approval related to the Advance Planning Document, FNS may reimburse State agencies for allowable expenditures at the appropriate rate in effect at the time the equipment or service was received only if the State agency files for a claim with FNS within two years after the calendar quarter in which the cost was incurred. FNS will consider non-cash expenditures such as depreciation to have been made in the quarter the expenditure was recorded in the accounting records of the State agency in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
(4) States wishing to request an extension of the deadline in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section must submit the request in writing to FNS prior to the applicable deadline. The State agency's request for an extension must include a specific explanation, justification, and documentation of why the claim will be late and when the claim will be filed.

(i) Any claim for an adjustment to prior year costs previously claimed under an interim rate concept;
(ii) Any claim arising from an audit exception as defined in this section. An audit exception means a proposed adjustment by the Department to any expenditure claimed by a State agency by virtue of a Federal-or State-initiated
audit. The audit must comply with the requirements of § 277.17 and 2 CFR part 200, subpart F and Appendix XI, Compliance Supplement and USDA implementing regulations 2 CFR part 400 and part 415, and must have been started within 3 years of the date of submission of the final SF-425, using FNS-778/FNS-778A worksheet of the relevant Federal fiscal year to which it applies.

(iv) Any claim for which FNS determines there was good cause for the State agency's not filing it within the time limit. Good cause is lateness due to circumstances beyond the State agency's control such as Acts of God or documented action or inaction of the Federal Government. It does not include neglect or administrative inadequacy on the part of the State, State agency, legislature, or any of their offices or employees.

(1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the three-year period, the applicable records shall be retained until these have been resolved.
(2) In the case of a payment by a State agency to a subagency or contractor using program funds, the State agency, USDA, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any book, documents, papers and records of the subagency or contractor which the State agency, USDA, or the Comptroller General of the United States or any of their duly authorized representatives, determine are pertinent to administration of the specific FNS program funds, for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and transcripts.

General.
This section prescribes policies and procedures governing title, use, disposition of real and personal property for which acquisition costs were borne, in whole or in part, as a direct charge to FNS funds, and ownership rights or intangible personal property developed, in whole or in part, with FNS funds. State agencies may follow their own property management policies and procedures provided they observe the requirements of this section. With respect to property covered by this section, FNS may not impose on State agencies any requirement (including property reporting requirements) not authorized by this section unless specifically required by Federal laws.
(b)
Nonexpendable personal property
—(1)
Title.
Title to nonexpendable personal property whose acquisition cost is borne, in whole or in part, by FNS shall vest in the State agency upon acquisition, and shall be subject to the restrictions on use and dispositions set forth in this section.
(2)
Use.
(i) The State agency shall use the property in the program as long as there is a need for such property to accomplish the purpose of the program.
(ii) When there is no longer a need for the property to accomplish the purpose of the program, the State agency shall use the property where needed in administration of other programs in the following order of priority:
(A) Other federally-funded programs of FNS.
(B) Other federally-funded programs of USDA.
(C) Other federally-funded programs.
(iii) When the State agency no longer has need for such property in any of its federally financed activities, the property may be used for the State agency's own official activities in accordance with the following standards:
(A) If the property had a total acquisition cost of less than $5,000, the State agency may use the property without reimbursement to FNS.
(B) For all such property not covered under paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the State agency may retain the property for its own use, provided a fair compensation is made to FNS for the FNS share of the property. The amount of compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of FNS participation in the cost of the property to the current fair market value of the property.
(3)
Disposition.
If the State agency has no need for the property, disposition of the property shall be made as follows:
(i) If the property had a total acquisition cost of less than $5,000 per unit, the State agency may sell the property and retain the proceeds.
(ii) If the property had an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more per unit, the State agency shall:
(A) If instructed to ship the property elsewhere, the State agency shall be reimbursed with an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the State agency's participation in the cost of the property to the current fair market value of the property, plus any shipping or interim storage costs incurred.
(B) If instructed to otherwise dispose of the property, the State agency shall be reimbursed by FNS for the cost incurred in such disposition.
(C) If disposition or other instructions are not issued by FNS within 120 days of a request from the State agency, the State agency shall sell the property and reimburse FNS an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of FNS participation in the cost of the property to the sales proceeds. The State agency may, however, deduct and retain from FNS' share $500 or 10 percent of the proceeds, whichever is greater, for the State agency's selling and handling expenses.
(c)
Transfer of title to certain property.
(1) Where FNS determines that an item of nonexpendable personal property with an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more which is to be wholly borne by FNS is unique, difficult, or costly to replace, FNS may reserve the right to require the State agency to transfer title of the property to the Federal Government or to a third party named by FNS.
(2) Such reservation shall be subject to the following:
(i) The right to require transfer of title may be reserved only by means of an expressed special condition under which funds were authorized for acquisition of the property, or, if approval for the acquisition of the property is given after the funds are awarded, by means of a written stipulation at the time such approval is given.
(ii) The property must be sufficiently described to enable the State agency to determine exactly what property is involved.
(3) FNS may not exercise the right to reserve until the State agency no longer needs the property in the activity for which it was acquired. Such need shall be assumed to end with termination of the activity in which the property was used unless the State agency continues to use the property in other program-related activities after the termination date and demonstrates to FNS a continued need for such use in the program.
(4) To exercise the right, FNS must issue disposition instructions to the State agency not later than 120 days after the State agency no longer needs the property in the activity for which it was acquired. If instructions are not issued within that time, FNS's right shall lapse, and the State agency shall act in accordance with the applicable standards in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.
(5) The State agency shall be entitled to reimbursement with an amount which is computed by applying the percentages of the State agency's participation in the acquisition cost of the property to the current fair market
value of the property, and for any reasonable shipping and interim storage costs it incurs pursuant to FNS's disposition instructions.
(d)
Property management standards.
State agencies' property management standards for nonexpendable personal property covered by this section shall include the following procedural requirements:

(i) A description of the property.
(ii) Manufacturer's serial number or other identification number.
(iii) Acquisition date and cost.
(iv) Source of the property.
(v) Percentage of FNS funds used in the acquisition of the property, or sufficient information to be able to compute the percentage, if and when the property is disposed of.
(vi) Location, use and condition of the property.
(vii) Ultimate disposition data including sales price or the method used to determine current fair market value if the State agency reimburses FNS for its share.
(viii) Trade-in value of any property purchased with Federal funds where their trade-in value reduces the acquisition cost of new property.
(2) A physical inventory of property shall be taken and the results reconciled with the property records at least once every two years to verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the property.
(3) A control system shall be in effect to ensure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft to the property. Any loss, damage, or theft of nonexpendable personal property shall be investigated and properly documented.
(4) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the property in good condition.
(5) Proper sales procedures shall be implemented to keep the property in good condition.

Use.
The State agency shall use the property in the program as long as there is a need for such property to accomplish the purpose of the program.
(3)
Disposition.
When there is no longer a need for the property in the program and there is a residual inventory exceeding $5,000 the State agency shall:
(i) Use the property in other federally sponsored projects or programs;
(ii) Retain the property for use on non-federally sponsored activities; or
(iii) Sell it.
(4)
Compensation.
FNS must be compensated for its share if the alternative in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section is not followed. The amount of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as for nonexpendable personal property.
(f)
Patents and inventions.
If any program activity produced patents, patent rights, processes or inventions in the course of work aided by FNS, such fact shall be promptly and fully reported to FNS. Unless there is prior agreement between the State agency and FNS on disposition of such items, FNS shall determine whether protection on such invention or discovery shall be sought and how the rights in the invention or discovery—including rights under any patent issued thereon—shall be disposed of and administered in order to protect the public interest consistent with “Government Patent Policy” (President's Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, August 23, 1971), and State of Government Patent Policy as printed in title 37 CFR, chapters I and II.

§ 277.14
Procurement standards.
(a)
General.
This section establishes standards and guidelines for the procurement of supplies, equipment, construction and other services whose cost is borne in whole or in part by FNS program funds. These standards ensure that such materials are obtained in an effective and economical manner and in compliance with the provisions of applicable Federal law and Executive orders. No additional procurement standards will be imposed by FNS upon State agencies unless specifically required by Federal law, or Executive orders, or authorized by the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, Office of Management and Budget.
(1) These standards do not relieve the State agency of any contractual responsibilities under its contracts. The State agency is responsible, in accordance with good administrative practice and sound business judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in support of the program. These include but are not limited to sources evaluations, protests, disputes and claims. FNS shall not substitute its judgment for that of the State agency unless the matter is primarily a Federal concern. Violations of laws shall be referred to the local, State or Federal authority having jurisdiction.
(2) State agencies shall use their own procurement procedures provided that procurements paid in whole or in part with FNS program funds meet the standards set forth in this part.
(b)
Review of proposed contracts.
State agencies shall submit proposed contracts and related procurement documents to FNS for preaward review and approval when:
(1) The procurement is expected to exceed $10,000 and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to solicitation;
(2) The procurement expected to exceed $10,000 specifies a “brand name” product; or
(3) FNS has determined that the State agency's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with one or more significant aspects of this section.
(c)
Code of conduct.
The State agency shall maintain a written code or standards of conduct which shall govern the performance of its officers, employees, or agents engaged in the award and administration of contracts borne in whole or in part with FNS program funds. No employee, officer, or agent of the State agency shall participate in the selection, or in the award or administration of a contract supported in whole or in part by FNS program funds if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be involved. Such conflict would arise when:
(1) The employee, officer, or agent;
(2) Any member of his/her immediate family;
(3) His or her partner; or
(4) An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of the above, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for award. The State agency's officers, employees, or agents shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to subagreements. State agencies may set minimum rules where the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal intrinsic value. To the extent permitted by State or local law or regulations, such standards of conduct shall provide for penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of such standards by the State agency's officers, employees, or agents, or by contractors or their agents.
(d)
Procurement procedures.
The State agency shall establish procurement procedures which provide that proposed procurement actions shall be reviewed by State agency officials to avoid the purchase of unnecessary or duplicative items. Consideration should be given to consolidation or dividing the purchase into smaller units, to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an analysis shall be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any other appropriate analyses, to determine which approach would be the most economical. To foster greater economy and efficiency, State agencies are encouraged to enter into State and local intergovernmental agreements
for procurement or use of common goods and services.
(e)
Contracting with small and minority firms, women's business enterprises and labor surplus area firms.
(1) It is FNS policy to award a fair share of contracts to small and minority business firms. State agencies must take affirmative steps to assure that small and minority businesses are utilized when possible as sources of supplies, equipment, construction and services. State agency affirmative steps shall include the following:
(i) Including qualified small and minority businesses on solicitation lists.
(ii) Assuring that small and minority businesses are solicited whenever they are potential sources.
(iii) When economically feasible, dividing total requirements into smaller tasks or quantities so as to permit maximum small and minority business participation.
(iv) Where the requirement permits, establishing delivery schedules which will encourage participation by small and minority business.
(v) Using the services and assistance of the Small Business Administration, the Office of Minority Business Enterprise of the Department of Commerce and the Community Services Administration, as appropriate.
(vi) If any subcontracts are to be let, requiring the prime contractor to take the affirmative steps in paragraphs (e)(1) (i) through (v) of this section.
(2) State agencies shall take similar appropriate affirmative action in support of women's business enterprises.
(3) State agencies are encouraged to procure goods and services from labor surplus areas, as defined by the Department of Labor.
(4) FNS shall impose no additional regulations or requirements in the foregoing areas unless specifically mandated by law or Executive order.
(f)
Selection procedures.
All State agency procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner that provides maximum open and free competition with this section. Procurement procedures shall not contain features which restrict or eliminate competition. The State agency shall have written selection procedures which shall provide, as a minimum, the following procedural requirements:
(1) Solicitation of offers, whether by competitive sealed bid or competitive negotiation, shall contain a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or service desired. Descriptions shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features which unduly restrict competition. Descriptions may include a statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service desired and, when necessary, shall set forth those minimum essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use. When it is impractical or uneconomical to describe clearly and accurately the technical requirements, a “brand name or equal” description may be used to define the performance or requirements of the material, product or service desired. The specific features of the named brand which must be met by offerors shall be clearly stated. State agencies shall clearly set forth all requirements which offerors must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.
(2) State agencies shall make awards only to responsible contractors that possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical resources.
(g)
Procurement methods.
State agency procurements made in whole or in part with program funds shall be by one of the following methods:
(1)
Small purchase procedures
are those relatively simple and informal procurement methods that are sound and appropriate for a procurement of services, supplies, or other property, costing in the aggregate not more than $10,000. State agencies shall comply with State or local small purchase dollar limits under $10,000. If small purchase procedures are used for a procurement under the program, price or rate quotations shall be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources.
(2) In
competitive sealed bids
(formal advertising), sealed bids are publicly
solicited and a firm-fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is lowest in price.
(i) In order for the State agency to use this method of procurement the following conditions, as a minimum, must prevail:
(A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase description is available.
(B) Two or more responsible suppliers are willing and able to compete effectively for the State agency's business.
(C) The procurement lends itself to a firm-fixed-price contract, and selection of the successful bidder can appropriately be made principally on the basis of price.
(ii) If formal advertising is used for a procurement under a grant, the following requirements shall apply:
(A) A sufficient time prior to the date set for opening of bids, bids shall be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers. In addition, the invitation shall be publicly advertised.
(B) The invitation for bids, including specifications and pertinent attachments, shall clearly define the items or services needed in order for the bidders to properly respond to the invitation.
(C) All bids shall be opened publicly at the time and place stated in the invitation for bids.
(D) A firm-fixed-price contract award shall be made by written notice by the State agency to that responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the invitation for bids, is lowest. Where specified in the bidding documents, factors such as discounts, transportation costs and life cycle costs shall be considered in determining which bid is lowest. Payment discounts may only be used to determine low bid when prior experience of the State agency indicates that such discounts are generally taken.
(E) Any or all bids may be rejected by the State agency when there are sound documented business reasons in the best interest of the program.
(3) In
competitive negotiation,
proposals are requested from a number of sources and the Request for Proposal is publicized, negotiations are normally conducted with more than one of the sources submitting offers, and either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursable type contract is awarded, as appropriate. Competitive negotiation may be used if conditions are appropriate for the use of formal advertising. If competitive negotiation is used for procurement under a grant, the following requirements shall apply:
(i) Proposals shall be solicited from an adequate number of qualified sources to permit reasonable competition consistent with the nature and requirements of the procurement. The Request for Proposals shall be publicized and reasonable requests by other sources to compete shall be honored to the maximum extent practicable.
(ii) The Request for Proposal shall identify all significant evaluation factors, including price or cost where required and their relative importance.
(iii) The State agency shall provide procedures for technical evaluation of the proposals received, determinations of responsible offerors for the purpose of written or oral discussions, and selection for contract award.
(iv) Award may be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal will be most advantageous to the State agency, price and other factors considered. Unsuccessful offerors should be notified promptly.
(v) State agencies may utilize competitive negotiation procedures for procurement of architectural/engineering professional services whereby competitors' qualifications are evaluated and the most qualified competitor is selected subject to negotiation of fair and reasonable compensation.
(4)
Noncompetitive negotiation
is procurement through solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or after solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate. Noncompetitive negotiation may be used when the award of a contract is infeasible under small purchase, competitive bidding (formal advertising) or competitive negotiation procedures. Awards of contracts by noncompetitive negotiation are limited to the following:
(i) The item is available only from a single source;
(ii) Public exigency or emergency when the urgency for the requirement will not permit a delay incident to competitive procurement;
(iii) FNS authorizes noncompetitive procurement; or
(iv) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.
(h)
Contract pricing.
The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of construction cost method(s) of contracting may not be used by a State agency. State agencies shall perform some form of cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement action including contract modifications. Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts, paid in whole or in part by FNS program funds, shall be allowed only to the extent that costs incurred or cost estimates included in negotiated prices are consistent with Federal cost principles.
(i)
State agency procurement records.
State agencies shall maintain records sufficient to detail the significant history of a procurement. These records shall include, but are not necessarily limited to, information pertinent to the rationale for the method of procurement, the selection of contract type, the contract selection or rejection, and the basis for the cost or price.
(j)
Contract provisions.
In addition to provisions defining a sound and complete procurement contract, State agencies shall include the following contract provisions or conditions in all procurement contracts and subcontracts as required by this provision, Federal law, or FNS:
(1) Contracts other than small purchases shall contain provisions or conditions which will allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate.
(2) All contracts in excess of $10,000 shall contain suitable provisions for termination by the State agency including the manner by which it will be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition, such contracts shall describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor.
(3) All contracts awarded in excess of $10,000 by State agencies and their contractors or subagencies shall contain a provision requiring compliance with Executive Order 11246, entitled “Equal Employment Opportunity,” as amended by Executive Order 11375, and as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 60).
(4) All contracts and subcontracts for construction or repair shall include a provision for compliance with the Copeland “Anti-Kickback” Act (18 U.S.C. 874) as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 3). This Act provides that each contractor or subagency shall be prohibited from inducing, by any means, any person employed in the construction, completion, or repair of public work, to give up any part of the compensation to which he is otherwise entitled. The State agency shall report all suspected or reported violations to FNS.
(5) Where applicable, all contracts awarded by State agencies and subagencies in excess of $2,000 for construction contracts in excess of $2,500 for other contracts which involve the employment of mechanics or laborers shall include a provision for compliance with sections 103 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327 through 330) as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). Under section 103 of the Act, each contractor shall be required to compute the wages of every mechanic and laborer on the basis of a standard work day of 8 hours and a standard work week of 40 hours. Work in excess of the standard work day or work week is permissible provided that the work is compensated at a rate of not less than 1
1/2
times the basic rate for all hours worked in excess of 8 hours in any calendar day or 40 hours in the work week. Section 107 of the Act is applicable to construction work and provides that no laborer or mechanic shall be required to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to his health and safety as determined under construction, safety, and health
standards promulated by the Secretary of Labor. These requirements do not apply to the purchases of supplies or materials or articles ordinarily available on the open market, or contracts for transportation or transmission of intelligence.
(6) The contract shall include notice of FNS requirements and regulations pertaining to reporting and print rights under any contract involving research, developmental, experimental, or demonstration work with respect to any discovery or invention which arises or is developed in the course of or under such contract, and of FNS requirements and regulations pertaining to copyrights and rights to data so derived.
(7) All negotiated contracts (except those awarded by small purchases procedures) awarded by State agencies shall include a provision to the effect that the State agency, FNS, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers, and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to that specific contract, for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and transcriptions. State agencies shall require contracts to maintain all required records for three years after the State agency makes final payments or all other pending matters are closed, whichever is last.
(8) Contracts, subcontracts, and subgrants of amounts in excess of $100,000 shall contain a provision which requires compliance with all applicable standards, orders, or requirements issued under section 306 of the Clean Air Act, section 508 of the Clean Water Act, Executive Order 11738, and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations, which prohibit the use under nonexempt Federal contract, grants, or loans of facilities included on the EPA List of Violating Facilities. The provision shall require reporting of violations to the FNS and to the USEPA Assistant Administrator for Enforcement.
(9) Contracts shall recognize mandatory standards and policies relating to energy efficiency which are contained in the State energy conservation plan issued in compliance with the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (Pub. L. 94-165).
(k)
Contract administration.
State agencies shall maintain a contract administration system insuring that contractors perform in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase orders.

Suspension.
When a State agency has materially failed to comply with any of the provisions contained in the Act, regulations, or FNS-approved State Plan of Operation, FNS may, after written notification to the State agency, temporarily withhold some or all Federal reimbursements for costs of administration of SNAP in accordance with § 276.4. Adjustments will be made either by adjusting the Letter of Credit authorization or by not allowing the State agency to withdraw funds.
(b)
Disallowance.
(1) FNS may disallow costs in accordance with part 276 and effect nonpayment for some or all costs incurred by a State agency which are normally allowable but are determined by FNS to be nonreimbursable because the State agency has failed to comply with any of the provisions contained in the Act, regulations, or FNS-approved State Plan of Operation.
(2) FNS may also disallow costs and institute recovery of Federal funds when a State agency fails to adhere to the cost principles of this part and 2 CFR part 200, subpart D and USDA implementing regulations 2 CFR part 400 and part 415.
(c)
Offsets to the Letter of Credit.
(1) FNS may recover funds when owed by the State agency to FNS through offsets to the Letter of Credit. Offsets shall include:

(ii) Unallowable costs resulting from audit or investigation findings;
(iii) Amounts owed which have been billed to the State agency and which the State agency has failed to pay without cause acceptable to FNS; or
(iv) Amounts owed to FNS for title IV reimbursements and recipient claims collections which were reported on the FNS-209 and which the State agency has failed to pay.
(2) The amounts recovered through the offset procedure should be in one lump sum. If recovery of funds through the offset procedure is not possible in one lump sum, FNS shall make appropriate adjustments to recover the funds in not more than three fiscal years.
(d)
Program transfer or termination.
(1) When termination or transfer of a State program has been agreed upon by FNS, the following closeout procedure shall be observed:
(i) Upon request, FNS shall make or arrange for prompt payment to the State agency for allowable costs not covered by previous payments.
(ii) The State agency shall immediately refund to FNS any unobligated balance of cash withdrawn by the State agency for the administration of the program in the affected State or Indian reservation.
(iii) The State agency shall submit to FNS within 90 days after the date of termination of the program, all required financial, performance, and other reports. FNS may grant extensions when requested by the State agency.
(iv) FNS shall adjust the amount authorized by the Letter of Credit in order to effect payment of any amounts due the State agency, and if appropriate, shall bill the State agency for any amounts due to FNS. The amounts of such billings shall be promptly remitted to FNS.
(v) In the event a final audit has not been performed prior to the closeout of the program, FNS shall retain the right to disallow costs or recover funds resulting from the final audit findings.
(2) Provisions of § 277.13 apply for any property acquired with program funds or received from the Federal Government in connection with the program and which was in use in the affected project area or areas.

(g)
Cognizant agency responsibilities.
The cognizant agency shall have the following responsibilities:
(1) Obtain or make quality assessment reviews of the work of non-Federal audit organizations, and provide the results to other interested audit agencies. If a non-Federal audit organization is responsible for audits of State agencies that have different cognizant audit agencies, a single quality assessment review will be arranged.
(2) Assure that all audit reports of State agencies that affect federally assisted programs are received, reviewed, and distributed to appropriate Federal audit officials. These officials will be responsible for distributing audit reports to their program officials.
(3) Whenever significant inadequacies in an audit are disclosed, the State agency will be advised and the auditor will be called upon to take corrective action. If corrective action is not taken, the cognizant agency shall notify the State agency and Federal awarding agencies of the facts and its recommendation. Major inadequacies or repetitive substandard performance of independent auditors shall be referred to appropriate professional bodies.
(4) Assure that satisfactory audit coverage is provided in a timely manner and in accordance with the provisions of this section.
(5) Provide technical advice and act as a liaison between Federal agencies, independent auditors and State agencies.
(6) Maintain a followup system on audit findings and investigative matters to assure that audit findings are resolved.
(7) Inform other affected audit agencies of irregularities uncovered. The audit agencies, in turn, shall inform all appropriate officials in their agencies. State or local government law enforcement and prosecuting authorities shall also be informed of irregularities within their jurisdiction.
(8) Recipients shall require subrecipients that are local governments of Indian tribal governments to adopt the requirements in paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section.

State Systems Advance Planning Document (APD) process.
(a)
Scope and application.
This section establishes conditions for initial and continuing authority to claim Federal financial participation (FFP) for the costs of the planning, development, acquisition, installation and implementation of Information System (IS) equipment and services used in the administration of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and as prescribed by appropriate Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) directives and guidance (
i.e.
, FNS Handbook 901, OMB Circulars, etc.).
(b)
Definitions.
As used in this section:
Acquisition
means obtaining supplies or services through a purchase or lease, regardless of whether the supplies or services are already in existence or must be developed, created or evaluated.
Advance Planning Document for project planning or Planning APD
(APD or PAPD) means a brief written plan of
action that requests FFP to accomplish the planning activities necessary for a State agency to determine the need for, feasibility of, projected costs and benefits of an IS equipment or services acquisition, plan the acquisition of IS equipment and/or services, and to acquire information necessary to prepare an Implementation APD.
Advance Planning Document Update
(APDU) means a document submitted annually (Annual APDU) by the State agency to report the status of project activities and expenditures in relation to the approved Planning APD or Implementation APD; or on an as needed basis (As Needed APDU) to request funding approval for project continuation when significant project changes occur or are anticipated.

(COTS) means proprietary software products that are ready-made and available for sale to the general public at established catalog or market prices in which the software vendor is not positioned as the sole implementer or integrator of the product.
Enhancement
means modifications which change the functions of software and hardware beyond their original purposes, not just to correct errors or deficiencies which may have been present in the software or hardware, or to improve the operational performance of the software or hardware. Software enhancements that substantially increase risk or cost or functionality will require submission of an IAPD or an As Needed IAPDU.
Implementation Advance Planning Document or Implementation APD
(IAPD) means a written plan of action requesting FFP to acquire and implement information system (IS) services and/or equipment. The Implementation APD includes the design, development, testing and implementation phases of the project.
Information System

Project
means a related set of information technology related tasks, undertaken by a State, to improve the efficiency, economy and effectiveness of administration and/or operation of its human services programs. A project may also be a less comprehensive activity such as office automation, enhancements to an existing system, or an upgrade of computer hardware.
Request for Proposal (RFP)
means the document used for public solicitations of competitive proposals from qualified sources as outlined in § 277.14(g)(3).
(c)
Requirements for FNS prior approval of IS projects
—(1)
General prior approval requirements.
The State agency shall request prior FNS approval by submitting the Planning APD, the Implementation APD, an APD Update, the draft acquisition instrument, and/or the justification for the sole source acquisition if applicable, as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. A State agency must obtain written approval from FNS to receive FFP of any of the following activities:
(i) When it plans a project to enhance or replace its IS that it anticipates will have total project costs in Federal and State funds of $6 million or more.
(ii) Any IS competitive acquisition that costs $6 million or more in Federal and State funds.
(iii) When the State agency plans to acquire IS equipment or services non-competitively from a nongovernmental source, and the total State and Federal cost is more than $1 million.
(iv) For the acquisition of IS equipment or services to be utilized in an Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) system regardless of the cost of the acquisition in accordance with § 274.12 (EBT issuance system approval standards).
(2)
Specific prior approval requirements.
(i) For IS projects which require prior approval, as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the State agency shall obtain the prior written approval of FNS for:
(A) Conducting planning activities, entering into contractual agreements or making any other commitment for acquiring the necessary planning services;
(B) Conducting design, development, testing or implementation activities, entering into contractual agreements or making any other commitment for the acquisition of IS equipment or services.
(ii) For IS equipment and services acquisitions requiring prior approval as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, prior approval of the following documents associated with such acquisitions is also required:
(A)
Requests for Proposals (RFPs).
Unless specifically exempted by FNS, the State agency shall obtain prior written approval of the RFP before the RFP may be released. However, RFPs for acquisitions estimated to cost less than $6 million or competitive procurements from non-governmental sources and that are an integral part of the approved APD, need not receive prior approval from FNS. The State agency shall submit a written request to get prior written approval to acquire IS equipment or services non-competitively from a nongovernmental source when the total State and Federal cost is $1 million or more. State agencies shall submit RFPs under this threshold amount on an exception basis. The State agency shall obtain prior written approval from FNS for RFPs which are associated with an EBT system regardless of the cost.
(B)
Contracts.
All contracts must be submitted to FNS. Unless specifically exempted by FNS, the State agency shall obtain prior written approval before the contract may be signed by the State agency. However, contracts for competitive procurements costing less than $6 million and for noncompetitive acquisitions from nongovernmental sources costing less than $1 million and that are an integral part of the approved APD need not be submitted to FNS. State agencies shall submit contracts under this threshold amount on an exception basis. The State agency shall obtain prior written approval from FNS for contracts which are associated with an EBT system regardless of the cost.
(C)
Contract amendments.
All contract amendments must be submitted to FNS. Unless specifically exempted by FNS, the State agency shall obtain prior written approval from FNS of any contract amendments which cumulatively exceed 20 percent of the base contract costs before being signed by the State agency. The State agency shall obtain prior written approval from FNS for contracts which are associated with an EBT system regardless of the cost.
(iii)
Procurement requirements.
(A) Procurements of IS equipment and services are subject to § 277.14 (procurement standards) regardless of any conditions for prior approval contained in this section, except the requirements of § 277.14(b)(1) and (b)(2) regarding review of proposed contracts. Those procurement standards include a requirement for maximum practical open and free competition regardless of whether the procurement is formally advertised or negotiated.
(B) The standards prescribed by § 277.14, as well as the requirement for prior approval in this paragraph (c), apply to IS services and equipment acquired primarily to support SNAP regardless of the acquiring entity.
(C) The competitive procurement policy prescribed by § 277.14 shall be applicable except for IS services provided by the agency itself, or by other State or local agencies.
(iv) The State agency must obtain prior written approval from FNS, as specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii) of this section, to claim and receive reimbursement for the associated costs of the IS acquisition.
(3)
Document submission requirements.
(i) For IS projects requiring prior approval as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, the State agency shall submit the following documents to FNS for approval:
(A) Planning APD as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(B) Implementation APD as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(C) Annual APDU as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The Annual APDU shall be submitted to FNS 60 days prior to the expiration of the FFP approval, unless the submission date is specifically altered by FNS. In years where an As Needed APDU is required, as described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(D) of this section, FNS may waive or modify the requirement to submit the annual APDU.
(D) As Needed APDU as described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. As Needed APDU are required to obtain a commitment of FFP whenever significant project changes occur. Significant project changes are defined as changes
in cost, schedule, scope or strategy which exceed FNS-defined thresholds or triggers. Without such approval, the State agency is at risk for funding of project activities which are not in compliance with the terms and conditions of the approved APD and subsequently approved APDU until such time as approval is specifically granted by FNS.
(E) Acquisition documents as described in § 277.14(g).
(F) Emergency Acquisition Requests as described in paragraph (i) of this section.
(ii) The State agency must obtain prior FNS approval of the documents specified in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section in order to claim and receive reimbursement for the associated costs of the IS acquisition.
(4)
Approval by the State agency.
Approval by the State agency is required for all documents and acquisitions specified in § 277.18 prior to submission for FNS approval. However, the State agency may delegate approval authority to any subordinate entity for those acquisitions of IS equipment and services not requiring prior approval by FNS.
(5)
Prompt action on requests for prior approval.
FNS will reply promptly to State agency requests for prior approval. If FNS has not provided written approval, disapproval or a request for additional information within 60 days of FNS' acknowledgment of receipt of the State agency's request, the request will be deemed to have provisionally met the prior approval requirement in this paragraph (c). However, provisional approval will not exempt a State agency from having to meet all other Federal requirements which pertain to the acquisition of IS equipment and services. Such requirements remain subject to Federal audit and review.
(d)
APD content requirements
—(1)
Planning APD (PAPD).
The PAPD is a written plan of action to acquire proposed services or equipment and to perform necessary activities to investigate the feasibility, system alternatives, requirements and resources needed to replace, modify or upgrade the State agency's IS. The PAPD shall contain adequate documentation to demonstrate the need to undertake a planning process, as well as a thorough description of the proposed planning activities, and estimated costs and timeline, as specified by FNS in Handbook 901.
(2)
Implementation APD (IAPD).
The IAPD is a written plan of action to acquire the proposed IS services or equipment and to perform necessary activities to design, develop, acquire, install, test, and implement the new IS. The IAPD shall contain detailed documentation of planning and preparedness for the proposed project, as enumerated by FNS in Handbook 901, demonstrating the feasibility of the project, thorough analysis of system requirements and design, a rigorous management approach, stewardship of federal funds, a realistic schedule and budget, and preliminary plans for key project phases.
(3)
Annual APDU content requirements.
The Annual APDU is a yearly update to ongoing IS projects when planning or implementation activities occur. The Annual APDU shall contain documentation on the project activity status and a description of major tasks, milestones, budget and any changes, as specified by FNS in Handbook 901.
(4)
As Needed APDU content requirements.
The As Needed APDU document shall contain the items as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(D) of this section with emphasis on the area(s) where changes have occurred or are anticipated that triggered the submission of the APDU, as detailed by FNS in Handbook 901.
(e)
Service agreements.
The State agency shall execute service agreements when IS services are to be provided by a State central IT facility or another State or local agency. Service Agreement means the document signed by the State or local agency and the State or local central IT facility whenever an IT facility provides IT services to the State or local agency. Service agreements shall:
(1) Identify the IS services that will be provided;
(2) Include a schedule of rates for each identified IS service, and a certification that these rates apply equally to all users;
(3) Include a description of the method(s) of accounting for the services rendered under the agreement and computing services charges;
(4) Include assurances that services provided will be timely and satisfactory;
(5) Include assurances that information in the IS as well as access, use and disposal of IS data will be safeguarded in accordance with provisions of § 272.1(c) (disclosure) and § 277.13 (property);
(6) Require the provider to obtain prior approval from FNS pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section for IS equipment and IS services that are acquired from commercial sources primarily to support federally aided public assistance programs and require the provider to comply with § 277.14 (procurement standards) for procurements related to the service agreement. IS equipment and services are considered to be primarily acquired to support federally aided public assistance programs when the Programs may reasonably be expected to either be billed for more than 50 percent of the total charges made to all users of the IS equipment and services during the time period covered by the service agreement, or directly charged for the total cost of the purchase or lease of IS equipment or services;
(7) Include the beginning and ending dates of the period of time covered by the service agreement; and
(8) Include a schedule of expected total charges to the Program for the period of the service agreement.
(9)
State Agency Maintenance of Service Agreements.
The State agency shall maintain a copy of each service agreement in its files for Federal review upon request.
(f)
Conditions for receiving Federal financial participation (FFP)
—(1) A State agency may receive FFP at the 50 percent reimbursement rate for the costs of planning, design, development or installation of IS and information retrieval systems if the proposed system will:
(i) Assist the State agency in meeting the requirements of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended;
(ii) Meet the Automation of Data Processing/Computerization of Information Systems Model Plan program standards specified in § 272.10(b)(1) through (b)(3) of this chapter, except the requirements in § 272.10(b)(2)(vi), (b)(2)(vii), and (b)(3)(ix) of this chapter to eventually transmit data directly to FNS;
(iii) Be likely to provide more efficient and effective administration of the program; and
(iv) Be compatible with such other systems utilized in the administration of other State agency programs including the program of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).
(2) State agencies seeking FFP for the planning, design, development or installation of IS shall develop State wide systems which are integrated with TANF. In cases where a State agency can demonstrate that a local, dedicated, or single function (issuance or certification only) system will provide for more efficient and effective administration of the program, FNS may grant an exception to the State wide integrated requirement. These exceptions will be based on an assessment of the proposed system's ability to meet the State agency's need for automation. Systems funded as exceptions to this rule, however, should be capable to the extent necessary, of an automated data exchange with the State agency system used to administer TANF. In no circumstances will funding be available for systems which duplicate other State agency systems, whether presently operational or planned for future development.
(g)
Basis for continued Federal financial participation
(FFP)—(1) FNS will continue FFP at the levels approved in the Planning APD and the Implementation APD provided that project development proceeds in accordance with the conditions and terms of the approved APD and that IS resources are used for the purposes authorized. FNS will use the APDU to monitor IS project development. The submission of the Update as prescribed in § 277.18(d) for the duration of project development is a condition for continued FFP. In addition, periodic onsite reviews of IS project development and State and local agency IS operations may be conducted by or for FNS to assure compliance with approved APDs, proper use of
IS resources, and the adequacy of State or local agency IS operations.
(2)
Pre-implementation.
The State agency must demonstrate through thorough testing that the system meets all program functional and performance requirements. FNS may require a pre-implementation review of the system to validate system functionality prior to State agency testing.
(i)
Testing.
The State agency must provide a complete test plan prior to the start of the testing phase. The State agency must provide documentation to FNS of the results of User Acceptance Testing (UAT) before the system is piloted in a production environment. FNS concurrence to advance from testing to pilot is a condition for continued FFP. All aspects of program eligibility must be tested to ensure that the system makes accurate eligibility determinations in accordance with federal statutes and regulations and approved State policies, and that system functionality meets the required functional specifications. The State agency shall describe how all system testing will be conducted and the resources to be utilized in order to verify the system complies with SNAP requirements, system design specifications, and performance standards including responsiveness, usability, capacity and security. Testing includes but is not limited to unit testing, integration testing, performance testing, end-to-end testing, UAT and regression testing. During UAT detailed scripts covering all areas of program functionality shall be used so that any errors identified can be replicated, corrected and re-tested. At a minimum, the Test Plan shall address:
(A) The types of testing to be performed;
(B) The organization of the test team and associated responsibilities;
(C) Test database generation;
(D) Test case development;
(E) Test schedule;
(F) Documentation of test results;
(G) Acceptance testing, to include functional requirements testing, error condition handling and destructive testing, security testing, recovery testing, controls testing, stress and throughput performance testing, and regression testing; and
(H) The decision criteria, including specific test results which must be met before the State may exit the testing phase, the roles or titles of the individuals responsible for verifying that these criteria have been met, and the sign-off process which will document that the criteria have been met.
(I) FNS may require any or all of these tests to be repeated in instances where significant modifications are made to the system after these tests are initially completed or if problems that surfaced during initial testing warrant a retest. FNS reserves the right to participate and conduct independent testing, as necessary, during UAT and at appropriate times during system design, development, implementation and operations.
(ii)
Pilot.
Prior to statewide rollout of the system there must be a test of the fully operational system in a live production environment. Pilots must operate until a state of routine operation is reached with the full caseload in the pilot area. The design of this pilot shall provide an opportunity to test all components of the system as well as the data conversion process and system performance. The duration of the pilot must be for a sufficient period of time to thoroughly evaluate the system (usually a minimum duration of three months). The State agency must provide documentation to FNS of the pilot evaluation. FNS approval to implement the system more broadly is a condition for continued FFP.
(iii)
Post-implementation Review.
After the system is fully implemented, FNS may conduct a review to validate that program policy is correctly applied, whether project goals and objectives were met, that IS equipment and services are being properly used and accurate inventory records exist, and the actual costs of the project.
(h)
Disallowance of Federal financial participation
(FFP). If FNS finds that any acquisition approved under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section fails to comply with the criteria, requirements and other undertakings described in the approved or modified
APD, payment of FFP may be suspended or may be disallowed in whole or in part.
(i)
Emergency acquisition requirements.
The State agency may request FFP for the costs of IS equipment and services acquired to meet emergency situations in which the State agency can demonstrate to FNS an immediate need to acquire IS equipment or services in order to continue operation of SNAP; and the State agency can clearly document that the need could not have been anticipated or planned for and precludes the State from following the prior approval requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. FNS may provide FFP in emergency situations if the following conditions are met:
(1) The State agency must submit a written request to FNS prior to the acquisition of any IS equipment or services. The written request shall include:
(i) A brief description of the IS equipment and/or services to be acquired and an estimate of their costs;
(ii) A brief description of the circumstances which result in the State agency's need to proceed with the acquisition prior to fulfilling approval requirements at paragraph (c) of this section; and
(iii) A description of the adverse impact which would result if the State agency does not immediately acquire the IS equipment and/or services.
(2) Upon receipt of a written request for emergency acquisition FNS shall provide a written response to the State agency within 14 days. The FNS response shall:
(i) Inform the State agency that the request has been disapproved and the reason for disapproval; or,
(ii) FNS recognizes that an emergency situation exists and grants conditional approval pending receipt of the State agency's formal submission of the IAPD information specified at paragraph (d)(2) of this section within 90 days from the date of the State agency's initial written request.
(iii) If FNS approves the request submitted under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, FFP will be available from the date the State agency acquires the IS equipment and services.
(iv) If the complete IAPD submission required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section is not received by FNS within 90 days from the date of the initial written request, costs may be subject to disallowance.
(j)
General cost requirements
—(1)
Cost determination.
Actual costs must be determined in compliance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart E and USDA implementing regulations 2 CFR part 400 and part 415 and an FNS approved budget, and must be reconcilable with the approved FNS funding level. A State agency shall not claim reimbursement for costs charged to any other Federal program or uses of IS systems for purposes not connected with SNAP. The approved APD cost allocation plan includes the methods which will be used to identify and classify costs to be claimed. This methodology must be submitted to FNS as part of the request for FNS approval of funding as required in paragraph (d) of this section. Operational costs are to be allocated based on the statewide cost allocation plan rather than the APD cost plan. Approved cost allocation plans for ongoing operational costs shall not apply to IS system development costs under this section unless documentation required under paragraph (c) of this section is submitted to and approvals are obtained from FNS. Any APD-related costs approved by FNS shall be excluded in determining the State agency's administrative costs under any other section of this part.
(2)
Cost identification for purposes of FFP claims.
State agencies shall assign and claim the costs incurred under an approved APD in accordance with the following criteria:
(i)
Development costs.
Using its normal departmental accounting system, in accordance with the cost principles set forth in 2 CFR part 200, subpart E and USDA implementing regulations 2 CFR part 400 and part 415, the State agency shall specifically identify what items of costs constitute development costs, assign these costs to specific project cost centers, and distribute these costs to funding sources based on the specific identification, assignment and distribution outlined in the approved APD. The methods for distributing costs set forth in the APD should provide for assigning identifiable costs, to the extent practicable, directly to
program/functions. The State agency shall amend the cost allocation plan required by § 277.9 (administrative cost principles) to include the approved APD methodology for the identification, assignment and distribution of the development costs.
(ii)
Operational costs.
Costs incurred for the operation of an IS shall be identified and assigned by the State agency to funding sources in accordance with the approved cost allocation plan required by § 277.9 (administrative cost principles).
(iii)
Service agreement costs.
States that operate a central data processing facility shall use their approved central service cost allocation plan required by 2 CFR part 200, subpart E and USDA implementing regulations 2 CFR part 400 and part 415 to identify and assign costs incurred under service agreements with the State agency. The State agency shall then distribute these costs to funding sources in accordance with paragraphs (j)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(3)
Capital expenditures.
The State agency shall charge the costs of IT equipment having unit acquisition costs or total aggregate costs, at the time of acquisition, of more than $25,000 by means of depreciation or use allowance, unless a waiver is specifically granted by FNS. If the equipment acquisition is part of an APD that is subject to the prior approval requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the State agency may submit the waiver request as part of the APD.
(4)
Claiming costs.
Prior to claiming funding under this section the State agency shall have complied with the requirements for obtaining approval and prior approval of paragraph (c) of this section.
(5)
Budget authority.
FNS approval of requests for funding shall provide notification to the State agency of the budget authority and dollar limitations under which such funding may be claimed. FNS shall provide this amount as a total authorization for such funding which may not be exceeded unless amended by FNS. FNS's determination of the amount of this authorization shall be based on the budget submitted by the State agency. Activities not included in the approved budget, as well as continuation of approved activities beyond scheduled deadlines in the approved plan, shall require FNS approval of an As Needed APD Update as prescribed in paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(D) and (d)(4) of this section, including an amended State budget. Requests to amend the budget authorization approved by FNS shall be submitted to FNS prior to claiming such expenses.
(k)
Access to the system and records.
Access to the system in all aspects, including but not limited to design, development, and operation, including work performed by any source, and including cost records of contractors and subcontractors, shall be made available by the State agency to FNS or its authorized representatives at intervals as are deemed necessary by FNS, in order to determine whether the conditions for approval are being met and to determine the efficiency, economy and effectiveness of the system. Failure to provide full access to all parts of the system may result in suspension and/or termination of SNAP funds for the costs of the system and its operation.
(l)
Ownership rights
—(1)
Software.
(i) The State or local government shall include a clause in all procurement instruments which provides that the State or local government shall have all ownership rights in any software or modifications thereof and associated documentation designed, developed or installed with FFP under this section.
(ii) FNS reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish or otherwise use and to authorize others to use for Federal Government purposes, such software, modifications and documentation.
(iii) Proprietary operating/vendor software packages which meet the definition of COTS at paragraph (b) of this section shall not be subject to the ownership provisions in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) and (l)(1)(ii) of this section. FFP is not available for development costs for proprietary application software developed specifically for SNAP.
(2)
Information Systems equipment.
The policies and procedures governing title, use and disposition of property purchased with FFP, which appear at § 277.13 (Property) are applicable to IS equipment.
(m)
Information system security requirements and review process
—(1)
Information system security requirements.
State and local agencies are responsible for the security of all IS projects under development, and operational systems involved in the administration of SNAP. State and local agencies shall determine appropriate IS security requirements based on recognized industry standards or compliance with standards governing security of Federal information systems and information processing.
(2)
Information security program.
State agencies shall implement and maintain a comprehensive Security Program for IS and installations involved in the administration of the SNAP. Security Programs shall include the following components:
(i) Determination and implementation of appropriate security requirements as prescribed in paragraph (m)(1) of this section.
(ii) Establishment of a security plan and, as appropriate, policies and procedures to address the following areas of IS security:
(A) Physical security of IS resources;
(B) Equipment security to protect equipment from theft and unauthorized use;
(C) Software and data security;
(D) Telecommunications security;
(E) Personnel security;

Pt. 277, App. A

# Appendix A to Part 277—Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Administration of SNAP by State Agencies
This appendix sets forth the procedures implementing uniform requirements for the negotiations and approval of cost allocation plans with State agencies, in accordance with the provisions of Federal Management Circular (FMC) 74-4 and OASC-10, “Cost Principles and Procedures for Establishing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates for Grants and Contracts with the Federal Government,” U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. This material is adapted substantially from the circular; changes have been made only when necessary in order to conform with legislative constraints.
(A) Purpose and scope.
(1)
Objectives.
This appendix sets forth principles for determining the allowable costs of administering SNAP by State agency under FNS-approved State Plans of Operation. The principles are for the purpose of cost determination and are not intended to identify the circumstances or dictate the extent of Federal and State or local participation in the financing of the Program. They are designed to provide that all federally assisted programs bear their fair share of costs recognized under these principles, except where restricted or prohibited by law. No provision for profit or other increment above cost is intended.
(2)
Policy guides.
The application of these principles is based on the fundamental premises that:
(a) State agencies are responsible for the efficient and effective administration of SNAP through the application of sound management practice.
(b) The State agency assumes the responsibility for seeing that SNAP funds have been expended and accounted for consistent with underlying agreements and program objectives.
(c) Each State agency, in recognition of its own unique combination of staff facilities and experience, will have the primary responsibility for employing whatever form of organization and management techniques as
may be necessary to assure proper and efficient administration.
(3)
Application.
These principles will be applied by FNS in determining costs incurred by State agencies receiving FNS payments for administering SNAP.
(B) Definitions.
Approval or authorization by FNS means documentation evidencing consent prior to incurring specific costs.
Cognizant Federal Agency means the Federal agency recognized by OMB as having the predominate interest in terms of program dollars.
Cost allocation plan means the documentation identifying, accumulating, and distributing allowable costs of program administration together with the allocation methods used.
Cost, as used herein, means cost as determined on a cash, accrual, or other basis acceptable to FNS as a discharge of the State agency's accountability for FNS funds.
Cost center means a pool, summary account, objective or area established for the accumulation of costs. Such areas include objective organizational units, functions, objects or items of expense, as well as ultimate cost objective(s) including specific costs, products, projects, contracts, programs and other operations.
Federal agency means FNS and also any department, agency, commission, or instrumentality in the executive branch of the Federal Government which makes grants to or contracts with State or local governments.
Payments for administrative costs means reimbursement or advances for costs to State agencies pursuant to any agreement whereby FNS provides funds to carry out programs, services, or activities in connection with administration of SNAP. The principles and policies stated in this appendix as applicable to program payments in general also apply to any State agency obligations under a cost reimbursement type of agreement performed by a subagency, including contracts and subcontracts.
SNAP administration means those activities and operations of the State agency which are necessary to carry out the purposes of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, including any portion of the Program financed by the State agency.
Local unit means any political subdivision of government below the State level.
Other agencies of the State means departments or agencies of the State or local unit which provide goods, facilities, and services to a State agency.
Subagencies means the organization or person to which a State agency makes any payment for acquisition of goods, materials or services for use in administering SNAP and which is accountable to the State agency for the use of the funds provided.
Service, as used herein, means goods and facilities, as well as services.
Supporting services means auxiliary functions necessary to sustain the direct effort of administering the Program. These services may be centralized in the State agency or in some other agency, and include procurement, payroll, personnel functions, maintenance and operation of space, data processing, accounting, budgeting, auditing, mail and messenger service, and the like.
(C) Basic guidelines.
(1) Factors affecting allowability of costs. To be allowable under the Program, costs must meet the following general criteria:
(a) Be necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient administration of the Program, be allocable thereto under these principles, and, except as specifically provided herein, not be a general expense required to carry out the overall responsibilities of State or local governments.
(b) Be authorized or not prohibited under State or local laws or regulations.
(c) Conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in these principles, Federal Laws, or other governing limitations as to types or amounts of cost items.
(d) Be consistent with policies, regulations, and procedures that apply uniformly to both federally assisted and other activities of the unit of government of which the State agency is a part.
(e) Be accorded consistent treatment through application of generally accepted accounting principles appropriate to the circumstances.
(f) Not be allocable to or included as a cost to any other federally financed program in either the current or a prior period.
(g) Be the net of all applicable credits.
(2) Allocable costs.
(a) A cost allocable to a particular cost objective to the extent of benefits received by such objective.
(b) Any cost allocable to a particular program or cost objective under these principles may not be shifted to other Federal programs to overcome fund deficiencies, avoid restrictions imposed by law or grant agreement, or for other reasons.
(c) Where an allocation of joint cost will ultimately result in charges to the Program, an allocation plan will be required as prescribed in section I of these principles.
(3) Applicable credits.
(a) Applicable credits refer to those receipts or reduction of expenditure-type transactions which offset or reduce expense items allocable to programs as direct or indirect costs. Examples of such transactions are: Purchase discounts; rebates or allowances; recoveries or indemnities on losses; sale of publications, equipment, and scrap; income from personal or incidental services; and adjustments of overpayments or erroneous charges.
(b) Applicable credits may also arise when Federal funds are received or are available from sources other than FNS to finance operations or capital items donated or financed by the Federal Government to fulfill matching requirements under another program. These types of credits should likewise be used to reduce related expenditures in determining the rates or amounts applicable to a given program.
(D) Composition of cost.
(1)
Total cost.
The total cost of a program is comprised of the allowable direct cost incident to its performance, plus its allocable portion of allowable indirect costs, less applicable credit.
(2)
Classification costs.
There is no universal rule for classifying certain costs as either direct or indirect under every accounting system. A cost may be direct with respect to some specific service or function, but indirect with respect to a program or other ultimate cost objective. However, it is essential that each item of cost be treated consistently either as a direct or an indirect cost. Specific guides for determining direct and indirect costs allocable under the Program are provided in the section which follows.
(E) Direct costs.
(1)
General.
Direct costs are those that can be identified specifically with a particular cost objective. These costs may be charged directly to the Program, contracts, or to other programs against which costs are finally lodged. Direct costs may also be charged to cost objectives used for the accumulation of costs pending distribution in the course to programs and other ultimate costs objectives.
(2)
Application.
Typical direct costs chargeable to the Program are:
(a) Compensation of employees for the time and effort devoted specifically to the administration of the Program.
(b) Cost of materials acquired, consumed, or expended specifically for the purpose of the Program.
(c) Equipment and other approved capital expenditures.
(d) Other items of expense incurred specifically for efficiently and effectively administering the Program.
(e) Service furnished specifically for the Program by other agencies, provided such charges are consistent with criteria outlined in section G of these principles.
(F) Indirect costs.
(1)
General.
Indirect costs are those (a) incurred for a common or joint purpose benefiting more than one cost objective, and (b) not readily assignable to the cost objectives specifically benefited, without effort disproportionate to the result achieved. The term indirect cost as used herein applies to costs of this type originating in the State agency, as well as those incurred by other departments in supplying goods, services, and facilities, to the State agency. To facilitate equitable distribution of indirect expenses to the cost objectives served, it may be necessary to establish a number of pools of indirect costs within a State agency or in other agencies providing services to a State agency. Indirect cost pools should be distributed to benefiting cost objectives on bases which will produce an equitable result in consideration of relative benefits derived.
(2)
State agency indirect costs.
All State agency indirect costs, including the various levels of supervision, are eligible for allocation to the program provided they meet the conditions set forth in their principles. In lieu of determining the actual amount of State agency indirect cost allocable to the program the following methods may be used:
(a)
Predetermined fixed rates for indirect costs.
A predetermined fixed rate for computing indirect costs applicable to program administration may be negotiated annually in situations where the cost experience and other pertinent facts available are deemed sufficient to enable the parties to reach an informed judgment (1) as to the probable level of indirect costs in the State agency during the period to be covered by the negotiated rate, and (2) that the amount allowable under the predetermined rate would not exceed actual indirect costs.
(b)
Negotiated lump sum for overhead.
A negotiated fixed amount in lieu of indirect costs may be appropriate under circumstances where the benefits derived from a State agency's indirect services cannot be readily determined as in the case of a small self-contained or isolated activity. When this method is used, a determination should be made that the amount negotiated will be approximately the same as the actual indirect cost that may be incurred. Such amounts negotiated in lieu of indirect costs will be treated as an offset to total indirect expenses of the State agency before allocation to remaining activities. The base on which such remaining expenses are allocated should be appropriately adjusted.
(3)
Limitation on indirect costs.
(a) Some Federal programs may be subject to laws that limit the amount of indirect cost that may be allowed. Agencies that sponsor programs of this type will establish procedures which will assure that the amount actually allowed for indirect costs under each such program does not exceed the maximum allowable under the statutory limitation or the amount otherwise allowable under these principles, whichever is the smaller.
(b) When the amount allowable under a statutory limitation is less than the amount otherwise allocable as indirect costs under these principles, the amount not recoverable as indirect costs under a program may not be shifted to another federally sponsored program or contract.
(G) Cost incurred by other agencies of the State.
(1)
General.
The cost of service provided by other agencies may only include allowable direct costs of the service plus a pro rata share of allowable supporting costs and supervision directly required in performing the service, but not supervision of a general nature such as that provided by the head of a department and his staff assistants not directly involved in operations. However, supervision by the head of a department or agency whose sole function is providing the service furnished would be an eligible cost. Supporting costs include those furnished by other units of the supplying department or by other agencies.
(2)
Alternative methods of determining indirect cost.
In lieu of determining actual indirect cost related to a particular service furnished by other agencies of the State, either of the following alternative methods may be used provided only one method is used for a specific service during the fiscal year involved.
(a)
Standard indirect rate.
An amount equal to ten percent of direct labor cost in providing the service performed by other agencies of the State (excluding overtime, shift, or holiday premiums, and fringe benefits) may be allowed in lieu of actual allowable indirect cost for that service.
(b)
Predetermined fixed rate.
A predetermined fixed rate for indirect cost of the unit or activity providing service may be negotiated as set forth in section F(2)(a) of these principles.
(H) Cost incurred by State agency for others. The principles provided in section G will also be used in determining the cost of services provided by the State agency to another agency.
(I) Cost allocation plan.
(1) A cost allocation will be required to support the distribution of any indirect costs. All costs allocable to SNAP under cost allocation plans will be supported by formal accounting records which will substantiate the propriety of eventual charges.
(2) There are two types of cost allocation plans:
(a) Statewide or central service cost allocation plan identifies and distributes the cost of services provided by support organizations to those departments or units participating in Federal programs.
(b) Indirect cost proposals distribute the administrative or joint costs incurred by the State agency and the cost of service allocable to it under the Statewide or central service cost allocation plan in a ratio to all work performed by the State agency. The process involves applying a percentage relationship of indirect cost to direct cost.
(3)
Requirements.
The cost allocation plan of the State agency shall cover all allocated costs of the department as well as costs to be allocated under plans of other agencies or organizational units which are to be included in the costs of federally sponsored programs. The cost allocation plans of all the agencies rendering services to the State agency, to the extent feasible, should be presented in a single document.
(4)
Instructions for preparation of cost allocation plans.
The Department of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the other Federal agencies concerned, will be responsible for developing and issuing the instructions for use by State agencies in preparation of cost allocation plans. This responsibility applies to both central support services at the State and local government level and indirect cost proposals of individual State agencies.
(5)
Submitting plans for approval.
(a) Responsibility for approving cost allocation plans for individual State agencies has been assigned by the Office of Management and Budget to the cognizant Federal agency.
(b) State cost allocation plans must be submitted to the cognizant Federal agency within six months after the last day of the State's fiscal year. Upon request by the State agency, an extension of time for submittal of the cost allocation plan may be granted by the cognizant Federal agency. It is essential that cost allocation plans be submitted in a timely manner. Failure to submit the plans when required will cause the State agency to become delinquent. In the event a State becomes delinquent, FNS will not provide for the recovery of central service and indirect costs, and such costs already made and claimed against SNAP funds will be subject to disallowance.
(6)
Negotiation and approval of cost allocation plans for States.
The cognizant Federal agency, in collaboration with Federal agencies concerned, will be responsible for negotiation, approval, and audit of cost allocation plans.
(7)
Negotiation and approval of cost allocation plans for local governments.
Cost allocation plans will be retained at the local government level for audit by the cognizant Federal agency except in those cases where that agency requests that cost allocation plans be submitted to it for negotiation and approval.
(8) A current list of cognizant Federal agencies is maintained by the Office of Management and Budget.
(9)
Resolution of problems.
The Office of Management and Budget will lend assistance in resolving problems encountered by Federal agencies on cost allocation plans.
(10) Approval by FNS. FNS reserves the right to disapprove costs not meeting the general criteria outlined in section C of these principles. FNS shall promptly notify the State agency in writing of the disapproval, the reason for the disapproval and
the effective date. Costs incurred by State agencies after disapproval may not be charged to FNS unless if FNS subsequently approves the cost.

# Standards for Selected Items of Cost
A.
Allowable cost.
Standards for allowability of costs are established by Federal Management Circular 74-4. These standards will apply regardless of whether a particular item of cost is treated as direct or indirect. Failure to mention a particular item of cost in these standards is not intended to imply that it is either allowable or unallowable. Rather, determination of allowability in each case should be based on the treatment of standards provided for similar or related items of cost. The allowability of the selected items of cost is subject to the general policies and principles as stated in Attachment A to Federal Management Circular 74-4.
(1)
Accounting.
The cost of establishing and maintaining accounting and other information systems required for the management of SNAP is allowable. This includes costs incurred by central service agencies of the State government for these purposes. The cost of maintaining central accounting records required for overall State or local government purposes, such as appropriation and fund accounts by the Treasurer, Comptroller, or similar officials, is considered to be a general expense of government and is not allowable.
(2)
Advertising.
Advertising media includes newspapers, magazines, radio and television programs, direct mail, trade papers, and the like. The advertising costs allowable are those which are solely for:
(a) Recruitment of personnel required for the Program;
(b) Solicitation of bids for the procurement of goods and services required;
(c) Disposal of scrap or surplus materials acquired in the performance of the agreement; and
(d) Other purposes specifically provided for by FNS regulations or approved by FNS in the administration of SNAP.
(3)
Advisory councils.
Costs incurred by State advisory councils or committees established to carry out SNAP goals are allowable. The cost of like organizations is allowable when used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Program.
(4)
Audit service.
The cost of audits necessary for the administration and management of functions related to the Program is allowable.
(5)
Bonding.
Costs of premiums on bonds covering employees who handle SNAP funds or food coupons are allowable. The amount of allowable coverage shall be limited to the anticipated maximum amount of SNAP funds or food coupons handled at one time by that employee.
(6)
Budgeting.
Costs incurred for the development, preparation, and execution of budgets are allowable. Costs for services of a central budget office are generally not allowable since these are costs of general government. However, where employees of the central budget office actively participate in the State agency's budget process, the cost of services identifiable to SNAP are allowable.
(7)
Building lease management.
The administrative cost for lease management which includes review of lease proposals, maintenance of a list of available property for lease, and related activities is allowable.
(8)
Central stores.
The cost of maintaining and operating a central stores organization for supplies, equipment, and materials used either directly or indirectly for SNAP is allowable.
(9)
Communications.
Communication costs incurred for telephone calls or service, telegraph, teletype service, wide area telephone service (WATS), centrex, telpak (tie lines), postage, messenger service and similar expenses are allowable.
(10)
Compensation for personal services.
(a)
General.
Compensation for personal services includes all remuneration, paid currently or accrued, for services rendered during the period of performance in the administration of the program including but not necessarily limited to wages, salaries, and supplementary compensation and benefits as defined in section A.(13) of these principles. The costs of such compensation are allowable to the extent that total compensation for individual employees: is reasonable for the services rendered; follows an appointment made in accordance with State or local government laws and rules and which meets Federal Merit System or other requirements, where applicable; and is determined and supported as provided in section A of these principles. Compensation for employees engaged in federally assisted activities will be considered reasonable to the extent that it is consistent with that paid for similar work in other activities of the State or local government. In cases where the kinds of employees required for SNAP activities are not found in the other activities of the State or local government, compensation will be considered reasonable to the extent that it is comparable to that paid for similar work in the labor market in which the employing government competes for the kind of employees involved. Compensation surveys providing data representative of the labor market involved will be an acceptable basis for evaluating reasonableness.
(b)
Payroll and distribution of time.
Amounts charged to the program for personal services, regardless of whether treated as direct or indirect costs, will be based on payrolls documented and approved in accordance with the generally accepted practice of the State or local agency. Payrolls must be supported by
time and attendence or equivalent records for individual employees. Distribution of salaries and wages of employees chargeable to more than one program or other cost objective will be supported by appropriate time reports or approved time study methodologies. The method used should be included in the cost allocation plan and should be approved by FNS.
(11)
Depreciation and use allowance.
(a) State agencies may be compensated for the use of buildings, capital improvements, and equipment through use allowances or depreciation. Use allowances are the means of providing compensation in lieu of depreciation or other equivalent costs. However, a combination of the two methods may not be used in connection with a single class of fixed assets.
(b) The computation of depreciation or use allowances will be based on acquisition cost. Where actual cost records have not been maintained, a reasonable estimate of the original acquisition cost may be used in the computation. The computation will exclude the cost of any portion of the cost of buildings and equipment donated or borne directly or indirectly by the Federal Government through charges to Federal programs or otherwise, irrespective of where title was originally vested or where it presently resides. In addition, the computation will also exclude the cost of acquisition of land. Depreciation or a use allowance on idle or excess facilities is not allowable, except when specifically authorized by FNS.
(c) Where the depreciation method is followed, adequate property records must be maintained, and any generally accepted method of computing depreciation may be used. However, the method of computing depreciation must be consistently applied for any specific asset or class of assets for all affected federally sponsored programs and must result in equitable charges considering the extent of the use of the assets for the benefit of such programs.
(d) In lieu of depreciation, a use allowance for buildings and improvements may be computed at an annual rate not exceeding two percent of acquisition cost. The use allowance for equipment (excluding items properly capitalized as building cost) will be computed at an annual rate not exceeding six and two-thirds percent of acquisition cost of usable equipment.
(e) No depreciation or use charge may be allowed on any assets that would be considered as fully depreciated, provided, however, that reasonable use charges may be negotiated for any such assets if warranted after taking into consideration the cost of the facility or item involved, the estimated useful life remaining at time of negotiation, the effect of any increased maintenance charges or decreased efficiency due to age, and any other factors pertinent to the utilization of the facility or item for the purpose contemplated.
(12)
Disbursing service.
The cost of disbursing program funds by the State Treasurer or other designated officer is allowable. Disbursing services cover the processing of checks or warrants, from preparation to redemption, including the necessary records of accountability and reconciliation of such records with related cash accounts.
(13)
Employee fringe benefits.
Costs identified are allowable to the extent that total compensation for employees is reasonable as defined in paragraph (10)(a) of these principles.
(a) Employee benefits in the form of regular compensation paid to employees during periods of authorized absences from the job, such as for annual leave, sick leave, court leave, military leave, and the like, if they are provided pursuant to an approved leave system, and the cost thereof is equitably allocated to all related activities, including federally assisted programs.
(b) Employee benefits in the form of employers' contributions or expense for social security, employees' life and health insurance plans, unemployment insurance coverage, workers' compensation insurance, pension plans, severance pay, and the like, provided such benefits are granted under approved plans and are distributed equitably to programs and to other activities.
(14)
Employee morale, health And welfare costs.
The costs of health or first-aid clinics and/or infirmaries, recreational facilities, employees' counseling services, employee information publications, and any related expenses incurred in accordance with general State or local policy, are allowable. Income generated from any of these activities will be offset against expenses.
(15)
Exhibits.
Costs of exhibits relating specifically to SNAP are allowable.
(16)
Legal expenses.
The cost of legal expenses required in the administration of the program is allowable. Legal services furnished by the chief legal officer of a State or local government or his staff solely for the purpose of discharging his general responsibilities as legal officer are unallowable. Legal expenses for the prosecution of claims against the Federal Government is unallowable.
(17)
Maintenance and repair.
Costs incurred for necessary maintenance, repair, or upkeep of property which neither add to the permanent value of the property nor appreciably prolong its intended life, but keep it in an efficient operating condition, are allowable.
(18)
Materials and supplies.
The cost of materials and supplies necessary to carry out the program is allowable. Purchases made specifically for the program should be charged thereto at their actual prices after deducting all cash discounts, trade discounts, rebates, and allowances received by
the State agency. Withdrawals from general stores or stockrooms should be charged at cost under any recognized method of pricing consistently applied. Incoming transportation charges are a proper part of material cost.
(19)
Memberships, subscriptions and professional activities.
(a) The
cost of membership
in civic, business, technical, and professional organizations is allowable, provided:
(i) The benefit from the membership is related to the program,

Costs of investigation, prosecution, or claims collection which are performed by agencies other than the State agency shall be based on a formal agreement between the State or local agency and provider agency. These interagency agreements shall meet the requirements of this part in regard to allowable charges. Funding under these interagency agreements shall be provided by the State agency from their funds and funds made available by FNS.
(26)
Taxes.
In general, taxes or payments in lieu of taxes which the State agency is legally required to pay are allowable.
(27)

(29)
Travel.
Travel costs are allowable for expenses for transportation, lodging, subsistence, and related items incurred by employees who are in travel status on official business incident to the program. Such costs may be charged on an actual basis, on a per diem or mileage basis in lieu of actual costs incurred, or on a combination of the two. The charges must be consistent with those normally allowed in like circumstances in nonfederally sponsored activities. The difference in cost between first-class air accommodations and less-than-first-class air accommodations is unallowable except when less-than-first-class air accommodations are not reasonably available. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs C (7) and (10), travel costs of officials covered by those paragraphs, when specifically related to grant programs, are allowable with the prior approval of a grantor agency.
B.
Costs allowable with approval of FNS.
(1)
Automated Data Processing.
The costs of acquiring data processing equipment and services used in the administration of SNAP are allowable. The costs of ADP equipment and services acquisitions which exceed the prior approval cost thresholds specified in § 277.18(c) are allowable upon the prior written approval of FNS. Requests for prior approval of such costs shall be in accordance with the provisions of § 277.18.
(2)
Building space and related facilities.
The cost of space in privately or publicly owned buildings used for the benefit of the Program is allowable subject to the following conditions.
(a) The total cost of space, whether in a privately or publicly owned building, may not exceed the rental cost of comparable space and facilities in a privately owned building in the same locality.

No such approval shall be granted unless the State agency shall demonstrate to FNS that such a cost is:
(a) Necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient administration of the program, and allocable thereto under the principles provided herein; and
(b) That procurement of such item or items has been or will be made in accordance with the standards set out in § 277.14. In no case shall such a cost become a program charge against FNS prior to approval in writing by FNS of the procurement and the cost. When assets acquired with SNAP funds are (i) sold, (ii) no longer available for use in a federally sponsored program, or (iii) used for purposes not authorized by FNS, FNS's equity in the asset will be refunded in the same proportion as Federal participation in its cost. In case any assets are traded on new items, only the net cost of the newly acquired assets is allowable.

# Editorial Note:
OMB control numbers relating to this part 278 are contained in § 271.8.
§ 278.1
Approval of retail food stores and wholesale food concerns.
(a)
Application.
Any firm desiring to participate or continue to be authorized in the program shall file an application as prescribed by FNS. Such an application shall contain information which will permit a determination to be made as to whether such an applicant qualifies, or continues to qualify, for authorization under the provisions of the program. FNS may require that a retail food store or wholesale food concern be visited to confirm eligibility for program participation prior to such store or concern being authorized or reauthorized in the program. Required visits shall be conducted by an authorized employee of the Department, a designee of the Secretary, or an official of the State or local government designated by the Secretary. FNS shall approve or deny the application within 45 days of receipt of a completed application. A completed application means that all information (other than an on-site visit) that FNS deems necessary in order to make a determination on the firm's application has been received. This information includes,
but is not limited to, a completed application form, all information and documentation from the applicant, as well as any needed third-party verification and documentation.
(b)
Determination of authorization.
An applicant shall provide sufficient data and information on the nature and scope of the firm's business for FNS to determine whether the applicant's participation will further the purposes of the program. Upon request, an applicant shall provide documentation to FNS to verify information on the application. Such information may include, but is not limited to, State and local business licenses, Social Security cards, drivers' licenses, photographic identification cards, bills of sale, deeds, leases, sales contracts, State certificates of incorporation, sales records, invoice records and business-related tax records. Retail food stores and wholesale food concerns and other entities eligible for authorization also shall be required to sign a release form which will authorize FNS to verify all relevant business related tax filings with appropriate agencies. In addition, they must obtain corroborating documentation from other sources as deemed necessary to ensure the legitimacy of applicant firms, as well as the accuracy of information provided by the stores and concerns. Failure to comply with any request for information or failure to sign a written release form shall result in denial of the application for authorization or withdrawal of a firm or concern from the program. In determining whether a firm qualifies for authorization, FNS shall consider all of the following:
(1)
The nature and extent of the food business conducted by the applicant
—(i)
Retail food store.
(A) An establishment or house-to-house trade route shall normally be considered to have food business of a nature and extent that will effectuate the purposes of the program if it sells food for home preparation and consumption and meets one of the following criteria: Offer for sale, on a continuous basis, a variety of qualifying foods in each of the four categories of staple foods as defined in § 271.2 of this chapter, including perishable foods in at least three of the categories (Criterion A); or have more than 50 percent of the total gross retail sales of the establishment or route in staple foods (Criterion B).
(B) A retail food store must meet eligibility determination factors which may be based on, but not limited to, visual inspection, sales records, purchase records, counting of stockkeeping units, or other inventory or accounting recordkeeping methods that are customary or reasonable in the retail food industry. In determining eligibility, such information may be requested for verification purposes, and failure to provide such documentation may result in denial or withdrawal from the program.
(ii)
Application of Criterion A.
In order to qualify under this criterion, firms shall:
(A) Offer for sale and normally display in a public area, qualifying staple food items on a continuous basis, evidenced by having, on any given day of operation, no fewer than seven different varieties of food items in each of the four staple food categories with a minimum depth of stock of three stocking units for each qualifying staple variety and at least one variety of perishable foods in at least three staple food categories. Documentation to determine if a firm stocks a sufficient amount of required staple foods to offer them for sale on a continuous basis may be required in cases where it is not clear that the firm has made reasonable stocking efforts to meet the stocking requirement. Such documentation can be achieved through verifying information, when requested by FNS, such as invoices and receipts in order to prove that the firm had ordered and/or received a sufficient amount of required staple foods up to 21 calendar days prior to the date of the store visit. Failure to provide verifying information related to stock when requested may result in denial or withdrawal of authorization. Failure to cooperate with store visits shall result in the denial or withdrawal of authorization.
(B) Offer for sale perishable staple food items in at least three staple food categories. Perishable foods are items which are either frozen staple food items or fresh, unrefrigerated or refrigerated staple food items that will spoil
or suffer significant deterioration in quality within 2-3 weeks; and
(C) Offer a variety of staple foods which means different types of foods within each staple food category. For example: Apples, cabbage, tomatoes, bananas, pumpkins, broccoli, and grapes in the vegetables or fruits category; or cow milk, almond milk, soy yogurt, soft cheese, butter, sour cream, and cow milk yogurt in the dairy products category; or rice, bagels, pitas, bread, pasta, oatmeal, and whole wheat flour in the bread or cereals category; or chicken, beans, nuts, beef, pork, eggs, and tuna in the meat, poultry, or fish category. Variety of foods is not to be interpreted as different brands, nutrient values (e.g., low sodium and lite), flavorings (e.g., vanilla and chocolate), packaging types or styles (e.g., canned and frozen) or package sizes of the same or similar foods. Similar food items such as, but not limited to, tomatoes and tomato juice, different types of rice, whole milk and skim milk, ground beef and beefsteak, or different types of apples (e.g., Empire, Jonagold, and McIntosh), shall count as depth of stock but shall not each be counted as more than one staple food variety for the purpose of determining the number of varieties in any staple food category. Accessory foods shall not be counted as staple foods for purposes of determining eligibility to participate in SNAP as a retail food store.
(iii)
Application of Criterion B.
In order to qualify under this criterion, firms must have more than 50 percent of their total gross retail sales in staple food sales. Total gross retail sales must include all retail sales of a firm, including food and non-food merchandise, as well as services, such as rental fees, professional fees, and entertainment/sports/games income. However, a fee directly connected to the processing of staple foods, such as raw meat, poultry, or fish by the service provider, may be calculated as staple food sales under Criterion B.
(iv)
Ineligible firms.
Firms that do not meet the eligibility requirements in this section or that do not effectuate the purpose of SNAP shall not be eligible for program participation. New applicant firms that are found to be ineligible will be denied authorization to participate in the program, and authorized retail food stores found to be ineligible will be withdrawn from program participation. Ineligible firms under this paragraph include, but are not limited to, stores selling only accessory foods, including spices, candy, soft drinks, tea, or coffee; ice cream vendors selling solely ice cream; and specialty doughnut shops or bakeries not selling bread. In addition, firms that are considered to be restaurants, that is, firms that have more than 50 percent of their total gross sales in foods cooked or heated on-site by the retailer before or after purchase; and hot and/or cold prepared foods not intended for home preparation or consumption, including prepared foods that are consumed on the premises or sold for carryout, shall not qualify for participation as retail food stores under Criterion A orB. This includes firms that primarily sell prepared foods that are consumed on the premises or sold for carryout. Such firms may qualify, however, under the special restaurant programs that serve the elderly, disabled, and homeless populations, as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.
(v)
Wholesale food concerns.
Wholesale food concerns, the primary business of which is the sale of eligible food at wholesale, and which meet the staple food requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, shall normally be considered to have adequate food business for the purposes of the program, provided such concerns meet the criteria specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
(vi)
Co-located wholesale food concerns.
No co-located wholesale/retail food concern with 50 percent or less of its total sales in retail food sales may be authorized to redeem SNAP benefits unless it meets the criteria applicable to all retail firms and:
(A) It is a legitimate retail food outlet. Indicators which may establish to FNS that a firm is a legitimate retail food outlet include, but are not limited to, the following:
(
1
) The firm's marketing structure; as may be determined by factors such as, but not limited to:
(
i
) A retail business license;
(
ii
) The existence of sales tax records documenting retail food sales; and/or separate bookkeeping records; and
(
2
) The way the firm holds itself out to the public as evidenced by factors such as, but not limited to:
(
i
) The layout of the retail sales space;
(
ii
) The use of retail advertisements;
(
iii
) The posting of retail prices;
(
iv
) Offering specials to attract retail customers;
(
v
) Hours of operation for retail business;
(
vi
) Parking area for retail customers; and
(B) It has total annual retail food sales of at least $250,000; or
(C) It is a legitimate retail outlet but fails to meet the requirements in paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(B) of this section, and not authorizing such a firm would cause hardship to SNAP households. Hardship would occur in any one of the following circumstances:
(
1
) Program recipients would have difficulty in finding authorized firms to accept their coupons for eligible food;
(
2
) Special ethnic foods would not otherwise be available to recipients; or
(
3
) Recipients would be deprived of an opportunity to take advantage of unusually low prices offered by the firm if no other authorized firm in the area offers the same types of food items at comparable prices.
(2)
The volume of coupon business which FNS may reasonably expect the firm to do.
The FNS officer in charge may consider such factors as the location of a store and previous food sales volumes in evaluating the ability of an applicant firm to attract SNAP business.
(3)
The business integrity and reputation of the applicant.
FNS shall deny the authorization of any firm from participation in the program for a period of time as specified in paragraph (k) of this section based on consideration of information regarding the business integrity and reputation of the firm as follows:
(i) Conviction of or civil judgment against the owners, officers or managers of the firm for:
(A) Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public or private agreement or transaction;
(B) Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, receiving stolen property, making false claims, or obstruction of justice; or
(C) Violation of Federal, State and/or local consumer protection laws or other laws relating to alcohol, tobacco, firearms, controlled substances, and/or gaming licenses;
(ii) Administrative findings by Federal, State or local officials that do not give rise to a conviction or civil judgment but for which a firm is removed from such a program, or the firm is not removed from the program but FNS determines a pattern exists (3 or more instances) evidencing a lack of business integrity on the part of the owners, officers or managers of the firm;
(iii) Evidence of an attempt by the firm to circumvent a period of disqualification, a civil money penalty or fine imposed for violations of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 and program regulations;
(iv) Previous SNAP violations administratively and/or judicially established as having been committed by owners, officers, or managers of the firm for which a sanction had not been previously imposed and satisfied;
(v) Evidence of prior SNAP violations personally committed by the owner(s) or the officer(s) of the firm at one or more units of a multi-unit firm, or evidence of prior SNAP violations committed by management at other units of multi-unit firms which would indicate a lack of business integrity on the part of ownership and for which sanctions had not been previously imposed and satisfied; or
(vi) Commission of any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or business honesty of owners, officers or managers of the firm that seriously and directly affects the present responsibility of a person.
(4)
The submission of collateral bonds or irrevocable letters of credit for firms with previous sanctions.
(i) If the applicant firm has been sanctioned for violations of this part, by withdrawal, or disqualification for a period of more than six months, or by a civil money penalty in lieu of a disqualification period of more than six months, or if the applicant
firm has been previously sanctioned for violations and incurs a subsequent sanction, regardless of the disqualification period, FNS shall, as a condition of future authorization, require the applicant to present a collateral bond or irrevocable letter of credit that meets the following conditions:
(A) The collateral bond must be issued by a bonding agent/company recognized under the law of the State in which the applicant is conducting business and which is represented by a negotiable certificate only. The irrevocable letter of credit must be issued by a commercial bank;
(B) The collateral bond or irrevocable letter of credit must be made payable to the Food and Nutrition Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture;
(C) The collateral bond cannot be canceled by the bonding agent/company for non-payment of the premium by the applicant. The irrevocable letter of credit cannot be canceled by the commercial bank for non-payment by the applicant;
(D) The collateral bond or irrevocable letter of credit must have a face value of $1,000 or an amount equal to ten percent of the average monthly SNAP benefit redemption volume of the applicant for the immediate twelve months prior to the effective date of the most recent sanction which necessitated the collateral bond or irrevocable letter of credit, whichever amount is greater;
(E) The applicant is required to submit a collateral bond or irrevocable letter of credit that is valid for a period of five years when re-entering the program; and
(F) The collateral bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall remain in the custody of FNS unless released to the applicant as a result of the withdrawal of the applicant's authorization, without a fiscal claim established against the applicant by FNS.
(ii) Furnishing a collateral bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall not eliminate or reduce a firm's obligation to pay in full any civil money penalty or previously determined fiscal claim which may have been assessed against the firm by FNS prior to the time the bond or letter of credit was required by FNS, and furnished by the firm. A firm which has been assessed a civil money penalty shall pay FNS as required, any subsequent fiscal claim asserted by FNS. In such cases a collateral bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall be furnished to FNS with the payment, or a schedule of intended payments, of the civil money penalty. A buyer or transferee shall not, as result of the transfer or purchase of a disqualified firm, be required to furnish a bond or letter of credit prior to authorization.
(5)
Taxpayer identification numbers.
At the time of an initial request for authorization as well as reauthorization, an applicant firm must provide its employer identification number and social security numbers as described below:
(i)
Employer Identification Number.
The firm must provide its employer identification number (EIN) if one has been assigned to the firm by the Internal Revenue Service. The authority to request EINs and the guidelines for requesting EINs are set forth in section 6109(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and Treas. Reg. § 301.6109-2 (26 CFR 301.6109-2).
(ii)
Social Security Number.
In addition to the EIN, the firm must provide the social security numbers (SSNs) of the following individuals:
(A) The SSN of an owner of a sole proprietorship.
(B) The SSNs of general partners of firms which are partnerships.
(C) The SSNs of up to five of the largest shareholders (owners) of privately owned corporations. (For purposes of this section, a privately owned corporation is one which has shares or stock that are not traded on a stock exchange or available for purchase by the general public.)
(6)
Need for access.
FNS will consider whether the applicant firm is located in an area with significantly limited access to food when the applicant firm fails to meet Criterion A per paragraph (b)(1)(ii) or Criterion B per paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section so long as the applicant firm meets all other SNAP authorization requirements. In determining whether an applicant is located in such an area, FNS may consider access factors such as, but not limited to, the distance from the applicant firm to the nearest currently SNAP authorized
firm and transportation options. In determining whether to authorize an applicant despite its failure to meet Criterion A and Criterion B, FNS will also consider factors such as, but not limited to, the extent of the applicant firm's stocking deficiencies in meeting Criterion A and Criterion B and whether the store furthers the purposes of the Program. Such considerations will be conducted during the application process as described in paragraph (a) of this section.
(7)
Other factors.
Any other factors which the FNS officer in charge considers pertinent to the application under consideration.
(c)
Wholesalers.
A wholesale food concern may be authorized to accept coupons only from a specified customer or customers if it meets the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and FNS determines it is required as a redemption outlet:
(1) For one or more specified authorized drug addict or alcoholic treatment programs,
(2) For one or more specified authorized group living arrangements,
(3) For one or more specified authorized shelters for battered women and children,
(4) For one or more specified authorized nonprofit cooperative food-purchasing ventures,
(5) For one or more specified authorized public or private nonprofit homeless meal providers, or
(6) For one or more specified authorized retail food stores which are without access to an insured financial institution which will redeem their coupons.
No firm may be authorized to accept and redeem coupons concurrently as both a retail food store and a wholesale food concern. Authorizations of wholesale food concerns granted prior to January 28, 1982 shall expire on May 31, 1982. Wholesale food concerns desiring to participate in the program after that date must reapply for authorization in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.
(d)
Meal services.
A meal delivery service or communal dining facility desiring to prepare and serve meals to households eligible to use coupons for those meals in addition to meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, must establish that:
(1) It is recognized as a tax exempt organization by the Internal Revenue Service; or
(2) It is a senior citizens' center or apartment building occupied primarily by elderly persons and SSI recipients, and their spouses; or
(3) It is a restaurant operating under a contract with a State or local agency to prepare and serve (or deliver) low-cost meals to homeless persons, elderly persons and SSI recipients (and in the case of meal delivery services, to elderly persons or handicapped persons) and their spouses. Such a facility must have more than 50 percent of its total sales in food. The contracts of restaurants must specify the approximate prices which will be charged.
(e)
Treatment programs.
Drug addict or alcoholic treatment and rehabilitation programs wishing to redeem benefits shall in addition to meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b) and (d)(1) of this section, be under Part B of Title XIX of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300x
et seq.
). Approval to participate is automatically withdrawn once the treatment and rehabilitation program no longer meets the criteria which would make it eligible for funding under part B of Title XIX (in accordance with the definition in
Drug addiction or alcoholic treatment and rehabilitation program
in § 271.2).
(f)
Group living arrangements.
FNS shall authorize as retail food stores those group living arrangements wishing to redeem benefits. The group living arrangement must, in addition to meeting requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (d)(1) of this section, be certified by the appropriate agency or agencies of the State under regulations issued under section 1616(e) of the Social Security Act or under standards determined by the Secretary to be comparable to standards implemented by appropriate State agencies under section 1616(e) of the Social Security Act. Approval to participate is automatically cancelled at any time that a program loses its certification from the State agency or agencies.
(g)
Shelters for battered women and children.
FNS shall authorize as retail food stores those shelters for battered
women and children wishing to redeem benefits. The shelter must be public or private nonprofit, as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. Shelters which also serve other groups of individuals must have a portion of the facility set aside on a long-term basis to shelter battered women and children. Also required is that the shelter be a residence which serves meals or provides food to its residents.
(h)
House-to-house trade routes.
FNS shall, in consultation with the Department's Office of Inspector General, determine those locations where the operation of trade routes damages the program's integrity. FNS may limit the authorization of house-to-house trade routes to those trade routes whose services are required by participating households in such areas in order to obtain food. The FNS Officer in Charge, in deciding whether households in such areas require a trade route's services, shall consider the volume of food business the trade route does and the availability of alternate sources of comparable food. An FNS official shall inspect any applicant trade route's vehicle to ensure that the trade route is a retail food store before authorizing it to accept coupons. An FNS official may require, as a condition of continuing authorization, that the trade route vehicle be reinspected semiannually to ensure that it continues to be a retail food store.
(i)
Private homeless meal providers.
FNS may authorize as retail food stores those restaurants which contract with the appropriate State agency to serve meals to homeless persons at “concessional” (low or reduced) prices. Restaurants shall be responsible for obtaining contracts with the appropriate State agency as defined in § 272.9 and for providing a copy of the contract to FNS at the time it applies for authorization to accept SNAP benefits. Contracts must specify the approximate prices which will be charged. Examples of reduced prices include, but are not limited to, a percentage reduction, a set dollar amount reduction, a daily special meal, or an offer of a free food item or beverage (excluding alcoholic beverages).
(j)
Authorization.
Upon approval, FNS shall issue a nontransferable authorization card to the firm. The authorization card shall be valid only for the time period for which the firm is authorized to accept and redeem SNAP benefits. The authorization card shall be retained by the firm until such time as the authorization period has ended, authorization in the program is superseded, or the card is surrendered or revoked as provided in this part. All firms will be authorized in the program for a period of 5 years. The specification of an authorization period in no way precludes FNS from periodically requesting information from a firm for purposes of reauthorization in the program or from withdrawing or terminating the authorization of a firm in accordance with this part.
(k)
Denying authorization.
FNS shall deny the application of any firm if it determines that:
(1) The firm does not qualify for participation in the program as specified in paragraph (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) or (i) of this section; or
(2) The firm has failed to meet the eligibility requirements for authorization under Criterion A or Criterion B, as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section; or, for co-located wholesale/retail firms, the firm fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(vi) of this section. Any firm that has been denied authorization on these bases shall not be eligible to submit a new application for authorization in the program for a minimum period of six months from the effective date of the denial;
(3) The firm has been found to lack the necessary business integrity and reputation to further the purposes of the program. Such firms shall be denied authorization in the program for the following period of time:
(i) Firms for which records of criminal conviction or civil judgment exist that reflect on the business integrity of owners, officers, or managers as stipulated in § 278.1(b)(3)(i) shall be denied authorization permanently;
(ii) Firms which have been officially removed from other Federal, State or local government programs through administrative action shall be denied for a period equivalent to the period of
removal from any such programs; or, if the firm is not removed from the program, but FNS determines a pattern (3 or more instances) exists evidencing a lack of business integrity on the part of the owners, officers or managers of the firm, such firm shall be denied for a one year period effective from the date of denial;
(iii) Firms for which evidence exists of an attempt to circumvent a period of disqualification, a civil money penalty, or fine imposed for violations of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended, and program regulations shall be denied for a period of three years from the effective date of denial;
(iv) Firms for which evidence exists of prior SNAP violations by owners, officers, or managers of the firm for which a sanction had not been previously imposed and satisfied shall be denied for a period of time equivalent to the appropriate disqualification period for such previous violations, effective from the date of denial;
(v) Firms for which evidence exists of prior SNAP violations at other units of multi-unit firms as specified in § 278.1(b)(3)(v) for which a sanction had not been previously imposed and satisfied shall be denied for a period of time equivalent to the appropriate disqualification period for such previous violations, effective from the date of denial;
(vi) Firms for which any other evidence exists which reflects negatively on the business integrity or business honesty of the owners, officers or managers of the firm as specified in § 278.1(b)(3)(vi) shall be denied for a period of one year from the effective date of denial;
(4) The firm has filed an application that contains false or misleading information about a substantive matter, as specified in § 278.6(e). Such firms shall be denied authorization for the periods specified in § 278.6(e)(1) or § 278.6(e)(3);
(5) The firm's participation in the program will not further the purposes of the program;
(6) The firm has been found to be circumventing a period of disqualification or a civil money penalty through a purported transfer of ownership;
(7) The firm has failed to pay in full any fiscal claim assessed against the firm under § 278.7, any fines assessed under §§ 278.6(l) or 278.6(m), or a transfer of ownership civil money penalty assessed under § 278.6(f). The FNS officer in charge shall issue a notice to the firm (using any delivery method that provides evidence of delivery) to inform the firm of any authorization denial and advise the firm that it may request review of that determination.
(l)
Withdrawing authorization.
(1) FNS shall withdraw the authorization of any firm authorized to participate in the program for any of the following reasons.
(i) The firm's continued participation in the program will not further the purposes of the program;
(ii) The firm fails to meet the specifications of paragraph (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), or (i) of this section;
(iii) The firm fails to meet the requirements for eligibility under Criterion A or B, as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section; or, for co-located wholesale/retail firms, the firm fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(vi) of this section, for the time period specified in paragraph (k)(2) of this section;
(iv) The firm fails to maintain the necessary business integrity to further the purposes of the program, as specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Such firms shall be withdrawn for lack of business integrity for periods of time in accordance with those stipulated in paragraph (k)(3) of this section for specific business integrity findings;
(v) The firm has failed to pay in full any fiscal claim assessed against the firm under § 278.7 or any fines assessed under §§ 278.6(l) or 278.6(m) or a transfer of ownership civil money penalty assessed under § 278.6(f); or
(vi) The firm has failed to pay fines assessed under § 278.6(l) or § 278.6(m); or

(2) The FNS officer in charge shall issue a notice to the firm by using any delivery method as long as the method provides evidence of delivery to inform the firm of the determination and of
the review procedure. FNS shall remove the firm from the program if the firm does not request review within the period specified in part 279.
(m)
Refusal to accept correspondence or to respond to inquiries.
FNS may withdraw or deny the authorization of any firm which:
(1) Refuses to accept correspondence from FNS;
(2) Fails to respond to inquiries from FNS within a reasonable time; or
(3) Cannot be located by FNS with reasonable effort.
(n)
Periodic reauthorization.
At the request of FNS a retail food store or wholesale food concern will be required to undergo a periodic reauthorization determination by updating any or all of the information on the firm's application form. Failure to cooperate in the reauthorization process will result in withdrawal of the firm's approval to participate in the program.
(o)
Applications containing false information.
The filing of any application containing false or misleading information may result in the denial of approval for participation in the program, as specified in paragraph (k) of this section, or disqualification of a firm from participation in the program, as specified in § 278.6, and may subject the firm and persons responsible to civil or criminal action.
(p)
Administrative review.
Any withdrawal or denial of authorization to participate in the program shall be subject to administrative review under part 279.
(q)
Use and disclosure of information provided by firms.
With the exception of EINs and SSNs, any information collected from retail food stores and wholesale food concerns, such as ownership information and sales and redemption data, may be disclosed for purposes directly connected with the administration and enforcement of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 and these regulations, and can be disclosed to and used by State agencies that administer the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). Such information may also be disclosed to and used by Federal and State law enforcement and investigative agencies for the purpose of administering or enforcing other Federal or State law, and the regulations issued under such other law. Such disclosure and use shall also include companies or individuals under contract for the operation by, or on behalf of FNS to accomplish an FNS function. Such purposes include the audit and examination of such information by the Comptroller General of the United States authorized by any other provision of law. Any person who publishes, divulges, discloses, or makes known in any manner or to any extent not authorized by Federal law or regulations any information obtained under this paragraph shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both. Safeguards with respect to employee identification numbers (EINs) are contained in paragraph (q)(2) of this section. Safeguards with respect to Social Security numbers (SSNs) are contained in paragraph (q)(3) of this section.
(1)
Criteria for requesting information.
FNS shall determine what information can be disclosed and which government agencies have access to that information based on the following criteria:
(i) Federal and State law enforcement or investigative agencies or instrumentalities administering or enforcing specified Federal and State laws, or regulations issued under those laws, have access to certain information maintained by FNS. Such agencies or instrumentalities must have among their responsibilities the enforcement of law or the investigation of suspected violations of law. However, only certain Federal entities have access to information involving SSNs and EINs in accordance with paragraph (q)(1)(ii) of this section;
(ii) Except for SSNs and EINs, information provided to FNS by applicants and authorized firms participating in the FSP may be disclosed and used by qualifying Federal and State entities in accordance with paragraph (q)(1)(i) of this section. The disclosure of SSNs and EINs is limited only to qualifying Federal agencies or instrumentalities which otherwise have access to SSNs and EINs based on law and routine use. Release of information under this paragraph shall be limited to information
relevant to the administration or enforcement of the specified laws and regulations, as determined by FNS;
(iii) Requests for information must be submitted in writing, including electronic communication, and must clearly indicate the specific provision of law or regulations which would be administered or enforced by access to requested information, and the relevance of the information to those purposes. If a formal agreement exists between FNS and another agency or instrumentality, individual written requests may be unnecessary. FNS may request additional information if needed to clarify a request;
(iv) Disclosure by FNS is limited to: Information about applicant stores and concerns with applications on file; information about authorized stores participating in the FSP; and information about unauthorized entities or individuals illegally accepting or redeeming SNAP benefits;
(v) Requests for information disclosure by FNS may involve a specific store or concern, or some or all stores and concerns covered by paragraph (q)(1)(iv) of this section. In addition, FNS may sign agreements allowing certain government entities direct access to appropriate FNS data, with access to EINs and SSNs limited only to other Federal agencies and instrumentalities that otherwise have access to such numbers.
(2)
Employer identification numbers.
(i) The Department may have access to the EINs obtained pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section for the purpose of establishing and maintaining a list of the names and EINs of the stores and concerns for use in determining those applicants who previously have been sanctioned or convicted under sections 12 and 15 of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended, (7 U.S.C. 2021 or 2024). The Department also may share EINs with other Federal agencies and instrumentalities that otherwise have access to EINs if the Department determines that such sharing would assist in verifying and matching such information against information maintained by such other agency or instrumentality. Any such information shared pursuant to this paragraph may be used by the Department or such other agency or instrumentality for the purpose of effective administration and enforcement of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended, or for the purpose of investigating violations of other Federal laws or enforcing such laws. See Treas. Reg. § 301.6109-2 (b) and (c) (26 CFR 301.6109-2 (b) and (c)).
(ii) The only persons permitted access to EINs obtained pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section are officers and employees of the United States, who otherwise have access and whose duties or responsibilities require access to the EINs for the administration or enforcement of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended, or for the purpose of investigating violations of other Federal laws or enforcing such laws. See Treas. Reg. § 301.6109-2(d)(1) (26 CFR 301.6109-2(d)(1)).
(iii) The Department or any agency or instrumentality of the United States shall provide for any additional safeguards that the Secretary of the Treasury determines to be necessary or appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the EINs. The Department may also provide for any additional safeguards to protect the confidentiality of EINs so long as these safeguards are consistent with any safeguards determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to be necessary or appropriate. See Treas. Reg. § 301.6109-2(d)(2) (26 CFR 301.6109-2(d)(2)).
(iv) EINs maintained by the Department or maintained by any agency or instrumentality of the United States pursuant to § 278.1(b)(5) are confidential. Except as provided in paragraph (q)(2)(ii) of this section above, no officer or employee of the United States who has or had access to any such EIN may disclose that number in any manner. For purposes of paragraph (q)(2)(iv) of this section the term
officer or employee
includes a former officer or employee. See Treas. Reg. § 301.6109-2(e) (26 CFR 301.6109(e)).
(v) Sections 7213(a) (1), (2) and (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 apply with respect to the unauthorized, willful disclosure to any person of EINs obtained by the Department pursuant to § 278.1(b)(5) in the same manner and to the same extent as sections 7213(a) (1),
(2) and (3) apply with respect to unauthorized disclosure of returns and return information described in those sections. Section 7213(a)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 applies with respect to the willful offer of any item of material value in exchange for any EIN obtained by the Department pursuant to § 278.1(b)(5) in the same manner and to the same extent as section 7213(a)(4) applies with respect to offers (in exchange for any return or return information) described in that section. See Treas. Reg. § 301.6109-2(f) (26 CFR 301.6109-2(f)).
(3)
Social Security numbers.
(i) The Department may have access to SSNs obtained pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section for the purpose of establishing and maintaining a list of names and SSNs of stores and concerns for use in determining those applicants who previously have been sanctioned or convicted under section 12 or 15 of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended, (7 U.S.C. 2021 or 2024). The Department may use this determination of sanctions and convictions in administering sections 12 and 15 of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended, (7 U.S.C. 2018, 2021). The Department also may share SSNs with other Federal agencies and instrumentalities if the Department determines that such sharing would assist in verifying and matching such information against information maintained by the Department or such other agency or instrumentality. Any such information shared pursuant to this paragraph shall be used for the purpose of effective administration and enforcement of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended, or for the purpose of investigating violations of other Federal laws or enforcing such laws.
(ii) The only persons permitted access to SSNs obtained pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section are officers and employees of the United States, who otherwise have access, and whose duties or responsibilities require access to the SSNs for the administration or enforcement of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended, or for the purpose of investigating violations of other Federal laws or enforcing such laws. Such access shall also include companies or individuals under contract for the operation by, or on behalf of FNS to accomplish an FNS function.
(iii) The Department shall provide for all additional safeguards that the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration determines to be necessary or appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the SSNs. The Department may also provide for any additional safeguards to protect the confidentiality of SSNs so long as these safeguards are consistent with any safeguards determined by the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration to be necessary or appropriate.
(iv) The SSNs and related records that are obtained or maintained by authorized persons are confidential, and no officer or employee shall disclose any such SSN or related record except as authorized. The term “related record” means any record, list, or compilation that indicates, directly or indirectly, the identity of any individual with respect to whom a request for a SSN is maintained. For purposes of paragraph (r)(3)(iv) of this section the term “officer or employee” includes a former officer or employee.
(v) The sanctions under sections 7213(a) (1), (2) and (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will apply with respect to the unauthorized, willful disclosure to any person of SSNs and related records obtained or maintained in the same manner and to the same extent as sections 7213(a) (1), (2) and (3) apply with respect to unauthorized disclosures of returns and return information described in those sections. The sanction under section 7213(a)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will apply with respect to the willful offer of any item of material value in exchange for any SSN or related record in the same manner and to the same extent as section 7213(a)(4) applies with respect to offers (in exchange for any return or return information) described in that section.
(4)
FNS initiated matches.
Under the restrictions noted in paragraph (r) of this section, FNS will periodically initiate cross matches of retailer data with other Federal and State agencies' files for the purpose of verifying information provided by applicant and participating firms, and for the purposes
of administering and enforcing other Federal or State laws. Such matches could involve all firms participating after implementation for the purpose of verifying information such as, but not limited to, SSNs and retail sales data.
(5)
Public disclosure of firms sanctioned for SNAP violations.
FNS may disclose information to the public when a retail food store has been disqualified or otherwise sanctioned for violations of the Program after the time for administrative and judicial appeals has expired. This information is limited to the name and address of the store, the owner(s') name(s) and information about the sanction itself. FNS may continue to disclose this information for as long as the duration of the sanction. In the event that a sanctioned firm is assigned a civil penalty in lieu of a period of disqualification, as described in § 278.6(a), FNS may continue to disclose this information for as long as the duration of the period of disqualification or until the civil penalty has been paid in full, whichever is longer.
(r)
Public and Private Nonprofit Homeless Meal Providers.
FNS shall authorize as retail food stores, those public and private nonprofit homeless meal providers which apply and qualify for authorization to accept SNAP benefits from homless SNAP recipients. Such meal providers must be public or private nonprofit organizations as defined by the Internal Revenue Service (I.R.C. 501(c)(3)), must serve meals that include food purchased by the provider, must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and must be approved by an appropriate State or local agency, pursuant to § 272.9. Public and private nonprofit homeless meal providers shall be responsible for obtaining approval from an appropriate State or local agency and shall provide written documentation of such approval to FNS prior to approval of the meal provider's application for authorization. (If such approval is subsequently withdrawn, FNS authorization shall be withdrawn). Public and private nonprofit homeless meal providers serving meals which consist wholly of donated foods shall not be eligible for authorization. In an area in which FNS, in consultation with the Department's Office of Inspector General, finds evidence that the authorization of a public and private nonprofit homeless meal provider would damage SNAP's integrity, FNS shall limit the participation of that public and private nonprofit homeless meal provider, unless FNS determines that the establishment or shelter is the only one of its kind serving the area.
(s) Each authorized retail food store shall post in a suitable and conspicuous location in the store a sign designed and provided by FNS which provides information on how persons may report abuses they have observed in the operation of the program. Refusal or repeated failure to display such a sign by an authorized retail food store may result in the withdrawal of the firm's approval to participate in the program.
(t)
Periodic notification.
The FNS will issue periodic notification to participating retail stores and wholesale food concerns to clarify program eligibility criteria, including the definitions of “Retail food store”, “Staple foods”, “Eligible foods”, and “Perishable foods”. At a minimum, such information will be provided to stores at the time of authorization, reauthorization and upon request.

# Effective Date Note:
At 61 FR 53600, Oct. 15, 1996, in § 278.1, paragraph (i) was redesignated as paragraph (j) and a new paragraph (i) was added. This paragraph contains information collection and recordkeeping requirements and will not become effective until approval has been given by the Office of Management and Budget.
§ 278.2
Participation of retail food stores.
(a)
Use of coupons.
Coupons may be accepted by an authorized retail food store only from eligible households or the households' authorized representative, and only in exchange for eligible food. Coupons may not be accepted in exchange for cash, except when cash is returned as change in a transaction in
which coupons were accepted in payment for eligible food under pargraph (d) of this section. Coupons may not be accepted in payment of interest on loans or for any other nonfood use. An authorized retail food store may not accept coupons from another retail food store, except that public or private nonprofit homeless meal providers may redeem coupons for eligible food through authorized retail food stores.
(b)
Equal treatment for coupon customers.
Coupons shall be accepted for eligible foods at the same prices and on the same terms and conditions applicable to cash purchases of the same foods at the same store except that tax shall not be charged on eligible foods purchased with coupons. However, nothing in this part may be construed as authorizing FNS to specify the prices at which retail food stores may sell food. However, public or private nonprofit homeless meal providers may only request
voluntary
use of SNAP benefits from homeless SNAP recipients and may not request such household using SNAP benefits to pay more than the average cost of the food
purchased
by the public or private nonprofit homeless meal provider contained in a meal served to the patrons of the meal service. For purposes of this section, “average cost” is determined by averaging food costs over a period of up to one calendar month. Voluntary payments by SNAP recipients in excess of such costs may be accepted by the meal providers. The value of donated foods from any source shall not be considered in determining the amount to be requested from SNAP recipients. All indirect costs, such as those incurred in the acquisition, storage, or preparation of the foods used in meals shall also be excluded. In addition, if others have the option of eating free or making a monetary donation, SNAP recipients must be provided the same option of eating free or making a donation in money or SNAP benefits. No retail food store may single out coupon users for special treatment in any way.
(c)
Accepting coupons.
No authorized retail food store may accept coupons marked “paid,” “canceled,” or “specimen.” Nor may a retail food store accept coupons bearing any cancellation or endorsement, or coupons of other than the 1-dollar denomination which have been detached from the coupon books prior to the time of purchase or delivery of eligible food unless the detached coupons are accompanied by the coupon books which bear the same serial numbers that appear on the detached coupons. However, in the case of public or private nonprofit homeless meal providers, retail food stores may accept detached coupons which have been accepted by the homeless meal provider. It is the right of the household member or the authorized representative to detach the coupons from the book.
(d)
Making change.
An authorized retail food store shall use, for the purpose of making change, uncanceled and unmarked 1-dollar coupons which were previously accepted for eligible foods. If change in an amount of less than 1-dollar is required, the eligible household shall receive the change in cash. However, in the case of public or private nonprofit homeless meal providers, neither cash change nor credit slips shall be provided under any circumstances when SNAP benefits are used to purchase meals. At no time may cash change in excess of 99 cents be returned in a coupon transaction. An authorized retail food store may not engage in a series of coupon transactions the purpose of which is to provide the same SNAP customer an amount of cash change greater than the maximum 99 cents cash change allowed in one transaction.
(e)
Accepting coupons before delivery.
Food retailers may not accept coupons before delivering the food, retain custody of any unspent coupons, or in any way prevent an eligible household from using coupons in making purchases from other authorized firms. However, a nonprofit cooperative food purchasing venture may accept coupons from a member of the cooperative at the time the member places a food order. The food ordered must be made available to the member within 14 days from the day the cooperative receives the member's coupons.
(f)
Paying credit accounts.
SNAP benefits shall not be accepted by an authorized retail food store in payment for items sold to a household on credit. A firm that commits such violations
shall be disqualified from participation in SNAP for a period of one year.
(g)(1)
Redeeming coupons.
Authorized retail food stores may exchange coupons accepted in accordance with this part for face value upon presentation through the banking system or through a wholesale food concern authorized to accept coupons from that retailer. Authorized drug addict or alcoholic treatment and rehabilitation programs, group living arrangements, and shelters for battered women and children may present coupons for redemption through authorized wholesale food concerns. A drug addict or alcoholic treatment center, group living arrangement, or shelter for battered women and children may purchase food in authorized retail food stores as the authorized representative of its participating households. Public or private nonprofit homeless meal providers may purchase food in authorized retail food stores and through authorized wholesale food concerns. Authorized drug addict and alcoholic treatment and rehabilitation programs, group living arrangements, shelters for battered women and children, and public or private nonprofit homeless meal providers for homeless SNAP households shall not present coupons directly to an insured financial institution for redemption.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1) of this section, authorized drug addict and alcoholic treatment and rehabilitation programs, group living arrangements, shelters for battered women and children, and public or private nonprofit homeless meal providers for homeless SNAP households may be authorized to redeem EBT benefits directly through an insured financial institution in areas where an Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) system has been implemented.
(h)
Identifying benefit users.
Retailers must accept payment from EBT cardholders who have a valid PIN regardless of which State the card is from or whether the individual is pictured on the card. Where photo EBT cards are in use, the person presenting the photo EBT card need not be pictured on the card, nor does the individual's name need to match the one on the card if the State includes names on the card. However, benefits may not knowingly be accepted from persons who have no right to possession of benefits. If fraud is suspected, retailers shall report the individual to the USDA OIG Fraud Hotline.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Checking hunting and fishing equipment users.
Authorized Alaskan retailers shall require coupon customers wanting to purchase hunting and fishing equipment with coupons to show their ID cards to determine that they live in an area designated by FNS as one in which persons are dependent upon hunting and fishing for subsistence.
(k) [Reserved]
(l)
Checking public or private nonprofit homeless meal provider recipients.
Public or private nonprofit homeless meal providers shall establish a SNAP patron's right to purchase meals with coupons.

§ 278.3
Participation of wholesale food concerns.
(a)
Accepting coupons.
An authorized wholesale food concern may accept endorsed coupons from one or more specified authorized retail food stores, from one or more specified authorized nonprofit cooperative food-purchasing ventures, from one or more specified authorized group living arrangements, from one or more specified authorized drug addict or alcoholic treatment programs, from one or more specified authorized shelters for battered women and children, or, from one or more specified public or private nonprofit homeless meal providers if the coupons are accompanied by a properly filled-out and signed redemption certificate, and are not marked “paid,” “canceled,” or “specimen.” A wholesaler authorized to accept coupons from an authorized drug addict or alcoholic treatment program, or from an authorized group living arrangement, or from an authorized shelter for battered women and children, or from one or
more public or private nonprofit homeless meal providers may accept coupons from that treatment program, or group living arrangement, or shelter for battered women and children, or from one or more public or private nonprofit homeless meal providers, only in exchange for food.
(b)
Accepting legally obtained coupons.
No authorized wholesale food concern may accept coupons if the wholesaler knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the coupons were not legally obtained for eligible food.
(c)
Redeeming coupons.
An authorized wholesale food concern may redeem coupons, properly accepted from retailers, through the banking system, upon presentation of the coupons with:
(1) The authorized retail food store's properly filled-out and signed redemption certificate for the coupons; and
(2) The authorized wholesale food concern's properly filled-out and signed redemption certificate.
(d)
Handling retailer redemption certificates.
No authorized wholesale food concern may alter, prepare, or complete an authorized retail food store's redemption certificate.
[Amdt. 136, 43 FR 43274, Sept. 22, 1978, as amended by Amdt. 173, 46 FR 62810, Dec. 29, 1981; Amdt. 286, 52 FR 7558, Mar. 11, 1987; Amdt. 344, 56 FR 54778, Oct. 23, 1991; Amdt. 343, 61 FR 53601, Oct. 15, 1996]
§ 278.4
Procedure for redeeming coupons.
(a)
Coupons accepted without authorization.
Coupons accepted by a retail food store or a wholesale food concern before the receipt by the firm of an authorization card from FNS may not be presented for redemption unless the FNS officer in charge has approved the redemption under § 278.7(b). Burned or mutilated coupons shall be presented for redemption to the FNS officer in charge as provided in § 278.7(c).
(b)
Endorsing coupons.
Each authorized retail food store or authorized wholesale food concern shall mark its authorization number or name on each coupon before it presents the coupons for redemption.
(c)
Using redemption certificates.
FNS will provide all authorized firms with redemption certificates. Wholesale food concerns and retail food stores, except for drug addict and alcoholic treatment and rehabilitation programs and public or private nonprofit homeless meal providers, shall use the redemption certificates to present coupons to insured financial institutions for credit or for cash. All retail food stores which wish to redeem coupons at wholesale food concerns shall use the redemption certificates for that purpose. An authorized retail firm using redemption certificates to redeem coupons shall fill out the redemption certificate to show the value of the coupons redeemed, the name of the insured financial institution or wholesaler, the date, and the signature and title of the official of the firm redeeming coupons.
[Amdt. 136, 43 FR 43274, Sept. 22, 1978, as amended by Amdt. 286, 52 FR 7558, Mar. 11, 1987; Amdt. 344, 56 FR 54778, Oct. 23, 1991; Amdt. 343, 61 FR 53601, Oct. 15, 1996]
§ 278.5
Participation of insured financial institutions.
(a)
Accepting coupons.
(1) Financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or financial institutions which are insured under the Federal Credit Union Act and which have retail food stores or wholesale food concerns in their field of membership may redeem coupons only from authorized retail food stores, meal services, and wholesale food concerns in accordance with the rules contained in this part and instructions of the Federal Reserve Banks. No financial institution may impose on or collect from a retail food store a fee or other charge for redemption of coupons that are submitted to the financial institution in a manner consistent with the requirements, except for coupon cancellation, for the presentation of coupons by the financial institution to the Federal Reserve banks. Coupons submitted to insured financial institutions for credit or cash must be properly endorsed in accordance with § 278.4 of this part and shall be accompanied by a properly completed and signed redemption certificate. All verified and encoded redemption certificates accepted by insured financial institutions shall be forwarded with the corresponding coupon deposits to the Federal Reserve Bank along with the accompanying Food Coupon
Deposit Document (Form FNS-521). In accordance with Federal Reserve requirements, the coupon deposit value entered on the Food Coupon Deposit Document must be equal to the actual value of coupons being deposited and to the total value of verified amounts encoded on the corresponding redemption certificates.
(2) An insured financial institution shall verify the amount of the coupons being redeemed and record the amount in the designated space on the redemption certificate. In order to conform with Federal Reserve requirements, the verified amount shall be recorded in the appropriate field on the redemption certificate using Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) encoding. Redemption certificates accepted by insured financial institutions shall be forwarded with the corresponding coupon deposits to the Federal Reserve Bank along with the Food Coupon Deposit Document (Form FNS-521).
(3) Redeemed coupons must be indelibly cancelled on the face of the coupon by the first insured financial institution receiving them. If the cancellation on the coupon face does not show the depositing institution's name or its routing symbol transit number, this identifying information must appear on the straps affixed to each bundle of coupons of like denomination. Deposits not meeting these cancellation requirements may be returned to the depositing institution for reprocessing. Retail food stores may not be required to cancel the coupons by the insured financial institution nor may the insured financial institution charge the retail food stores a fee or other charge for cancellation of coupons. A portion of a coupon consisting of less than three-fifths of a whole coupon may not be redeemed.
(4) Insured financial institutions which are members of the Federal Reserve System, insured nonmember clearing institutions, and insured nonmember institutions which have arranged with a Federal Reserve Bank to deposit coupons for credit to the account of a member institution on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank may forward coupons directly to the Federal Reserve Bank. Other insured financial institutions may forward cancelled coupons through ordinary collection channels.
(b)
Role of Federal Reserve Banks.
Federal Reserve Banks, acting as fiscal agents of the United States, will receive canceled coupons for collection as cash items from armed forces installations, member insured financial institutions of the Federal Reserve System, nonmember clearing insured financial institutions, and nonmember insured financial institutions which have arranged with a Federal Reserve Bank to deposit coupons for credit to the account of a member insured financial institution on the books of the Federal Reserve Bank, and will charge those items to the general account of the Treasurer of the United States.
(c)
FNS liability for losses.
FNS shall not be liable for the value of any coupons lost, stolen, or destroyed while in the custody of an insured financial institution or for the value of coupons lost, stolen, or destroyed while in transit from an insured financial institution to a Federal Reserve Bank.
(d)
FNS use of coupons to detect violations.
Regardless of any other provision in these regulations, coupons may be issued to, purchased by, or redeemed by persons authorized by FNS to use those coupons in examining and inspecting program operations, and for other purposes determined by FNS to be required for proper administration of the program. Coupons which have been so issued and used, as well as any coupons which have been issued under paragraph (g) of this section, or which FNS believes may have been issued, transferred, negotiated, used, or received in violation of this subchapter or of any applicable statute, shall at the request of FNS and on issuance of a receipt for them be turned over to FNS by the insured financial institution receiving the coupons, or by any other person to whom the request is addressed, together with any certificate(s) of redemption accompanying the coupons. Any coupons so requested shall not be eligible for redemption through Federal Reserve Banks or other collection channels. However, FNS may redeem coupons from any insured financial institution or person by payment of the
face amount of the coupons upon determination by FNS that this direct redemption of coupons is warranted. FNS shall determine the proper disposition of any coupons held by FNS on completion of the examination or inspection in which the coupons were used. Claims or demands for unredeemed coupons surrendered to FNS may be mailed to the local FNS field office for the project area involved.
(e)
Selling coupons to stores for internal checks.
FNS may sell coupons at face value to any authorized retail food store which wishes to use coupons to conduct internal checks of coupon transactions. The retail food store must submit a written request to FNS which shall include a certification that the store recognizes that its use of coupons will not affect FNS action to enforce program regulations and that the requested coupons will be used only for internal checks of the store's employees and only to uncover sales of items other than eligible foods. The request shall also include the name of the city or county in which the stores to be checked through the use of the requested coupons are located and the name and address of any outside agency with which the retail food store has or will have a contract to conduct checks of the store's employees using coupons. The request shall be directed to the Benefit Redemption Division, FSP, FNS, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 3101 Park Center Drive, Alexandria, VA 22302, and shall be accompanied by a check or money order made payable to the Food and Nutrition Service to cover the face value cost of the coupons requested. Coupons bought by retail food stores for use in internal checks may be later redeemed for full value in accordance with § 278.4, and in redeeming those coupons, retail food stores are authorized to make the certification required for redemption.
(f)
Continued participation of households under investigation.
Upon the written request of Federal, State, or local government agencies which have authority to investigate, and are investigating, suspected violations of Federal or State statutes concerning the enforcement of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 or the regulations, the State agency may allow ineligible households to continue program participation. The State agency may allow the households to continue participation in the program until the earlier of (1) expiration of the period of 90 days after the request is received or any longer period which FNS, upon request of the State agency, may approve in a particular case, or (2) receipt of notification from the investigative agency that participation may be terminated or that the investigation has been completed. Regardless of any other provision of these regulations, FNS may not hold the State agency liable for the value of any coupons issued to households under this paragraph.

§ 278.6
Disqualification of retail food stores and wholesale food concerns, and imposition of civil money penalties in lieu of disqualifications.
(a)
Authority to disqualify or subject to a civil money penalty.
FNS may disqualify any authorized retail food store or authorized wholesale food concern from further participation in the program if the firm fails to comply with the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended, or this part. Such disqualification shall result from a finding of a violation on the basis of evidence that may include facts established through on-site investigations, inconsistent redemption data, evidence obtained through a transaction report under an electronic benefit transfer system, or the disqualification of a firm from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), as specified in paragraph (e)(8) of this section. Disqualification shall be for a period of 6 months to 5 years for the firm's first sanction; for period of 12 months to 10 years for a firm's second sanction; and disqualification shall be permanent for a disqualification based on paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Any firm which has been disqualified and which wishes to be reinstated at the end of the period of disqualification, or at any later time,
shall file a new application under § 278.1 so that FNS may determine whether reauthorization is appropriate. The application may be filed no earlier than 10 days before the end of the period of disqualification. FNS may, in lieu of a disqualification, subject a firm to a civil money penalty of up to an amount specified in § 3.91(b)(3)(i) of this title for each violation if FNS determines that a disqualification would cause hardship to participating households. FNS may impose a civil money penalty of up to an amount specified in § 3.91(b)(3)(ii) of this title for each violation in lieu of a permanent disqualification for trafficking, as defined in § 271.2 of this chapter, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (i) and (j) of this section.
(b)
Charge letter
—(1)
General provisions.
Any firm considered for disqualification or imposition of a civil money penalty under paragraph (a) of this section or a fine as specified under paragraph (l) or (m) of this section shall have full opportunity to submit to FNS information, explanation, or evidence concerning any instances of noncompliance before FNS makes a final administrative determination. The FNS regional office shall send the firm a letter of charges before making such determination. The letter shall specify the violations or actions which FNS believes constitute a basis for disqualification or imposition of a civil money penalty or fine. The letter shall specify the violations or actions which FNS believes constitute a basis for disqualification or imposition of a civil money penalty. The letter shall inform the firm that it may respond either orally or in writing to the charges contained in the letter within 10 days of receiving the letter. The firm's response shall set forth a statement of evidence, information, or explanation concerning the specified violations or acts. The firm shall make its response, if any, to the officer in charge of the FNS field office which has responsibility for the project area in which the firm is located. In the case of a firm for which action is taken in accordance with paragraph (e)(8) of this section, the charge letter shall inform such firm that the disqualification action is not subject to administrative or judicial review, as specified in paragraph (e)(8) of this section.
(2)
Charge letter for trafficking.
(i) The charge letter shall advise a firm being considered for permanent disqualification based on evidence of trafficking as defined in § 271.2 that the firm must notify FNS if the firm desires FNS to consider the sanction of a civil money penalty in lieu of permanent disqualification. The charge letter shall also advise the firm that the permanent disqualification shall be effective immediately upon the date of receipt of the notice of determination, regardless of whether a request for review is filed in accordance with part 279 of this chapter. If the disqualification is reversed through administrative or judicial review, the Secretary shall not be liable for the value of any sales lost during the disqualification period. Firms that request and are determined eligible for a civil money penalty in lieu of permanent disqualification for trafficking may continue to participate in the program pending review and shall not be required to pay the civil money penalty pending appeal of the trafficking determination action.
(ii) Firms that request consideration of a civil money penalty in lieu of a permanent disqualification for trafficking shall have the opportunity to submit to FNS information and evidence as specified in § 278.6(i), that establishes the firm's eligibility for a civil money penalty in lieu of a permanent disqualification in accordance with the criteria included in § 278.6(i). This information and evidence shall be submitted within 10 days, as specified in § 278.6(b)(1).
(iii) If a firm fails to request consideration for a civil money penalty in lieu of a permanent disqualification for trafficking and submit documentation and evidence of its eligibility within the 10 days specified in § 278.6(b)(1), the firm shall not be eligible for such a penalty.
(c)
Review of evidence.
The letter of charges, the response, and any other information available to FNS shall be reviewed and considered by the appropriate FNS regional office, which shall then issue the determination. In the case of a firm subject to permanent disqualification under paragraph (e)(1) of
this section, the determination shall inform such a firm that action to permanently disqualify the firm shall be effective immediately upon the date of receipt of the notice of determination from FNS, regardless of whether a request for review is filed in accordance with part 279 of this chapter. If the disqualification is reversed through administrative or judicial review, the Secretary shall not be liable for the value of any sales lost during the disqualification period. Firms that request and are determined eligible to a civil money penalty in lieu of permanent disqualification for trafficking may continue to participate in the program pending review and shall not be required to pay the civil money penalty pending appeal of the trafficking determination action. In the case of a firm for which action is taken in accordance with paragraph (e)(8) of this section, the determination notice shall inform such firm that the disqualification action is not subject to administrative or judicial review, as specified in paragraph (e)(8) of this section.
(d)
Basis for determination.
The FNS regional office making a disqualification or penalty determination shall consider:
(1) The nature and scope of the violations committed by personnel of the firm,
(2) Any prior action taken by FNS to warn the firm about the possibility that violations are occurring, and
(3) Any other evidence that shows the firm's intent to violate the regulations.
(e)
Penalties.
FNS shall take action as follows against any firm determined to have violated the Act or regulations. For the purposes of assigning a period of disqualification, a warning letter shall not be considered to be a sanction. A civil money penalty and a disqualification shall be considered sanctions for such purposes. The FNS regional office shall:
(1) Disqualify a firm permanently if:
(i) Personnel of the firm have trafficked as defined in § 271.2; or
(ii) Violations such as, but not limited to, the sale of ineligible items occurred and the firm had twice before been sanctioned.
(iii) It is determined that personnel of the firm knowingly submitted information on the application that contains false information of a substantive nature that could affect the eligibility of the firm for authorization in the program, such as, but not limited to, information related to:
(A) Eligibility requirements under § 278.1(b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h);
(B) Staple food stock;
(C) Annual gross sales for firms seeking to qualify for authorization under Criterion B as specified in the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended;
(D) Annual staple food sales;
(E) Total annual gross retail food sales for firms seeking authorization as co-located wholesale/retail firms;
(F) Ownership of the firm;
(G) Employer Identification Numbers and Social Security Numbers;
(H) SNAP history, business practices, business ethics, WIC disqualification or authorization status, when the store did (or will) open for business under the current ownership, business, health or other licenses, and whether or not the firm is a retail and wholesale firm operating at the same location; or
(I) Any other information of a substantive nature that could affect the eligibility of a firm.
(2) Disqualify the firm for 5 years if it is to be the firm's first sanction, the firm had been previously advised of the possibility that violations were occurring and of possible consequences of violating the regulations, and the evidence shows that:
(i) It is the firm's practice to sell expensive or conspicuous nonfood items, cartons of cigarettes, or alcoholic beverages in exchange for food coupons; or
(ii) The firm's coupon redemptions for a specified period of time exceed its food sales for the same period of time; or
(iii) A wholesale food concern's redemptions of coupons for a specified period of time exceed the redemptions of all the specified authorized retail food stores, nonprofit cooperative food-purchasing ventures, group living arrangements, drug addict and alcoholic treatment programs, homeless meal providers, and shelters for battered women and children which the wholesale food concern was authorized to serve during that time; or
(iv) A wholesale food concern's stated redemptions of coupons for a particular retail food store, nonprofit cooperative food-purchasing venture, group living arrangement, drug addict and alcoholic treatment program, homeless meal providers, or shelters for battered women and children exceeded the actual amount of coupons which that firm or organization redeemed through the wholesaler; or
(v) Personnel of the firm knowingly accepted coupons from an unauthorized firm or an individual known not to be legally entitled to possess coupons.
(3) Disqualify the firm for 3 years if it is to be the first sanction for the firm and the evidence shows that:
(i) It is the firm's practice to commit violations such as the sale of common nonfood items in amounts normally found in a shopping basket and the firm was previously advised of the possibility that violations were occurring and of the possible consequences of violating the regulations; or
(ii) Any of the situations described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section occurred and FNS had not previously advised the firm of the possibility that violations were occurring and of the possible consequences of violating the regulations; or
(iii) The firm is an authorized communal dining facility, drug addiction or alcoholic treatment and rehabilitation program, group living arrangement, homeless meal provider, meal delivery service, or shelter for battered women and children and it is the firm's practice to sell meals in exchange for food coupons to persons not eligible to purchase meals with food coupons and the firm has been previously advised of the possibility that violations were occurring and of the possible consequences of violating the regulations; or
(iv) A wholesale food concern accepted coupons from an authorized firm which it was not authorized to serve and the wholesale food concern had been previously advised of the possibility that violations were occurring and of possible consequences of violating the regulations; or
(v) The firm is an authorized retail food store and personnel of the firm have engaged in food coupon transactions with other authorized retail stores, not including treatment programs, group living arrangements, homeless meal providers, or shelters for battered women and children, and the firm had been previously advised of the possibility that violations were occurring and of the possible consequences of violating the regulations.
(vi) Personnel of the firm knowingly submitted information on the application that contained false information of a substantive nature related to the ability of FNS to monitor compliance of the firm with FSP requirements, such as, but not limited to, information related to:
(A) Annual eligible retail food sales;
(B) Store location and store address and mailing address;
(C) Financial institution information; or
(D) Store name, type of ownership, number of cash registers, and non-food inventory and services.
(4) Disqualify the firm for 1 year if:
(i) It is to be the first sanction for the firm and the ownership or management personnel of the firm have committed violations such as the sale of common nonfood items in amounts normally found in a shopping basket, and FNS had not previously advised the firm of the possibility that violations were occurring and of the possible consequences of violating the regulations; or
(ii) The firm has accepted SNAP benefits in payment for items sold to a household on credit.
(5) Disqualify the firm for 6 months if it is to be the first sanction for the firm and the evidence shows that personnel of the firm have committed violations such as but not limited to the sale of common nonfood items due to carelessness or poor supervision by the firm's ownership or management.
(6) Double the appropriate period of disqualification prescribed in paragraphs (e) (2) through (5) of this section as warranted by the evidence of violations if the same firm has once before been assigned a sanction.
(7) Send the firm a warning letter if violations are too limited to warrant a disqualification.
(8) FNS shall disqualify from SNAP any firm which is disqualified from the WIC Program:
(i) Based in whole or in part on any act which constitutes a violation of that program's regulation and which is shown to constitute a misdemeanor or felony violation of law, or for any of the following specific program violations:
(A) A pattern of claiming reimbursement for the sale of an amount of a specific food item which exceeds the store's documented inventory of that food item for a specified period of time;
(B) Exchanging WIC food instruments for cash, credit or consideration other than eligible food; or the exchange of firearms, ammunition, explosives or controlled substances, as defined in section 802 of title 21 of the United States Code, for food instruments;
(C) A pattern of receiving, transacting and/or redeeming WIC food instruments outside of authorized channels;
(D) A pattern of exchanging non-food items for a WIC food instrument;
(E) A pattern of charging WIC customers more for food than non-WIC customers or charging WIC customers more than the current shelf price; or
(F) A pattern of charging for food items not received by the WIC customer or for foods provided in excess of those listed on the food instrument.
(ii) FNS shall not disqualify a firm from SNAP on the basis of a WIC disqualification unless:
(A) Prior to the time prescribed for securing administrative review of the WIC disqualification action, the firm was provided individual and specific notice that it could be disqualified from SNAP based on the WIC violations committed by the firm;
(B) A signed and dated copy of such notice is provided to FNS by the WIC administering agency; and
(C) A determination is made in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section that such action will not cause a hardship for participating SNAP households.
(iii) Such a SNAP disqualification:
(A) Shall be for the same length of time as the WIC disqualification;
(B) May begin at a later date than the WIC disqualification; and
(C) Shall not be subject to administrative or judicial review under SNAP.
(f)
Criteria for civil money penalties for hardship and transfer of ownership.
(1) FNS may impose a civil money penalty as a sanction in lieu of disqualification when the firm subject to a disqualification is selling a substantial variety of staple food items, and the firm's disqualification would cause hardship to SNAP households because there is no other authorized retail food store in the area selling as large a variety of staple food items at comparable prices. FNS may disqualify a store which meets the criteria for a civil money penalty if the store had previously been assigned a sanction. A civil money penalty for hardship to SNAP households may not be imposed in lieu of a permanent disqualification.
(2) In the event any retail food store or wholesale food concern which has been disqualified is sold or the ownership thereof is otherwise transferred to a purchaser or transferee, the person or other legal entity who sells or otherwise transfers ownership of the retail food store or wholesale food concern shall be subjected to and liable for a civil money penalty in an amount to reflect that portion of the disqualification period that has not expired, to be calculated using the method found at § 278.6(g). If the retail food store or wholesale food concern has been permanently disqualified, the civil money penalty shall be double the penalty for a ten year disqualification period. The disqualification shall continue in effect at the disqualified location for the person or other legal entity who transfers ownership of the retail food store or wholesale food concern notwithstanding the imposition of a civil money penalty under this paragraph.
(3) At any time after a civil money penalty imposed under paragraph (f) (2) of this section has become final under the provisions of part 279, the Food and Consumer Service may request the Attorney General institute a civil action to collect the penalty from the person or persons subject to the penalty in a district court of the United States for any district in which such person or persons are found, reside, or transact business.
(4) A bona fide transferee of a retail food store shall not be required to pay a civil money penalty imposed on the firm prior to its transfer. A buyer or transferee (other than a bona fide buyer or transferee) may not be authorized to accept or redeem coupons and may not accept or redeem coupons until the Secretary receives full payment of any penalty imposed on such store or concern.
(g)
Amount of civil money penalties for hardship and transfer of ownership.
FNS shall determine the amount of the civil money penalty as follows:
(1) Determine the firm's average monthly redemptions of coupons for the 12-month period ending with the month immediately preceding that month during which the firm was charged with violations.
(2) Multiply the average monthly redemption figure by 10 percent.
(3) Multiply the product arrived at in paragraph (g)(2) by the number of months for which the firm would have been disqualified under paragraph (e) of this section. The civil money penalty may not exceed an amount specified in § 3.91(b)(3)(i) of this title for each violation.
(h)
Notifying the firm of civil money penalties for hardship and transfer of ownership.
A firm has 15 days from the date the FNS regional office notifies the firm in writing in which to pay the civil money penalty, or to notify the regional office in writing of its intent to pay in installments as specified by the regional office. The firm must present to FNS a collateral bond or irrevocable letter of credit as specified in § 278.1(b)(4), within the same 15-day period. The civil money penalty must be paid in full by the end of the period for which the firm would have been disqualified. FNS shall:
(1) Disqualify the firm for the period determined to be appropriate under paragraph (e) of this section if the firm refuses to pay any of the civil money penalty;
(2) Disqualify the firm for a period corresponding to the unpaid part of the civil money penalty if the firm does not pay the civil money penalty in full or in installments as specified by the FNS regional office; or
(3) Disqualify the firm for the prescribed period if the firm does not present a collateral bond or irrevocable letter of credit within the required 15 days. Any payment on a civil money penalty which have been received by FNS shall be returned to the firm. If the firm presents the required bond or irrevocable letter of credit during the disqualification period, the civil money penalty may be reinstated for the duration of the disqualification period.
(i)
Criteria for eligibility for a civil money penalty in lieu of permanent disqualification for trafficking.
FNS may impose a civil money penalty in lieu of a permanent disqualification for trafficking as defined in § 271.2 if the firm timely submits to FNS substantial evidence which demonstrates that the firm had established and implemented an effective compliance policy and program to prevent violations of the Program. Firms assessed a CMP under this paragraph shall be subject to the applicable penalties included in § 278.6(e) (2) through (6) for the sale of ineligible items. Only those firms for which a permanent disqualification for trafficking took effect on or after October 1, 1988, are eligible for a civil money penalty in lieu of permanent disqualification for trafficking, except that firms that have been disqualified but are awaiting a judicial review decision are eligible for a civil money penalty in lieu of a permanent disqualification. In determining the minimum standards of eligibility of a firm for a civil money penalty in lieu of a permanent disqualification for trafficking, the firm shall, at a minimum, establish by substantial evidence its fulfillment of each of the following criteria:
Criterion 1.
The firm shall have developed an effective compliance policy as specified in § 278.6(i)(1); and
Criterion 2.
The firm shall establish that both its compliance policy and program were in operation at the location where the violation(s) occurred
prior
to the occurrence of violations cited in the charge letter sent to the firm; and
Criterion 3.
The firm had developed and instituted an effective personnel training program as specified in § 278.6(i)(2); and
Criterion 4.
Firm ownership was not aware of, did not approve, did not benefit from, or was not in any way involved in the conduct or approval of trafficking violations; or it is only the first occasion in which a member of
firm management was aware of, approved, benefited from, or was involved in the conduct of any trafficking violations by the firm. Upon the second occasion of trafficking involvement by any member of firm management uncovered during a subsequent investigation, a firm shall not be eligible for a civil money penalty in lieu of permanent disqualification. Notwithstanding the above provision, if trafficking violations consisted of the sale of firearms, ammunition, explosives or controlled substances, as defined in 21 U.S.C. § 802, and such trafficking was conducted by the ownership or management of the firm, the firm shall not be eligible for a civil money penalty in lieu of permanent disqualification. For purposes of this section, a person is considered to be part of firm management if that individual has substantial supervisory responsibilities with regard to directing the activities and work assignments of store employees. Such supervisory responsibilities shall include the authority to hire employees for the store or to terminate the employment of individuals working for the store.
(1)
Compliance policy standards.
As specified in Criterion 1 above, in determining whether a firm has established an effective policy to prevent violations, FNS shall consider written and dated statements of firm policy which reflect a commitment to ensure that the firm is operated in a manner consistent with this part 278 of current FSP regulations and current FSP policy on the proper acceptance and handling of food coupons. As required by Criterion 2, such policy statements shall be considered only if documentation is supplied which establishes that the policy statements were provided to the violating employee(s) prior to the commission of the violation. In addition, in evaluating the effectiveness of the firm's policy and program to ensure FSP compliance and to prevent FSP violations, FNS may consider the following:
(i) Documentation reflecting the development and/or operation of a policy to terminate the employment of any firm employee found violating FSP regulations;
(ii) Documentation of the development and/or continued operation of firm policy and procedures resulting in appropriate corrective action following complaints of FSP violations or irregularities committed by firm personnel;
(iii) Documentation of the development and/or continued operation of procedures for internal review of firm employees' compliance with FSP regulations;
(iv) The nature and scope of the violations charged against the firm;
(v) Any record of previous firm violations under the same ownership; and
(vi) Any other information the firm may present to FNS for consideration.
(2)
Compliance training program standards.
As prescribed in Criterion 3 above, the firm shall have developed and implemented an effective training program for all managers and employees on the acceptance and handling of food coupons in accordance with this part 278. A firm which seeks a civil money penalty in lieu of a permanent disqualification shall document its training activity by submitting to FNS its dated training curricula and records of dates training sessions were conducted; a record of dates of employment of firm personnel; and contemporaneous documentation of the participation of the violating employee(s) in initial and any follow-up training held prior to the violation(s). FNS shall consider a training program effective if it meets or is otherwise equivalent to the following standards:
(i) Training for all managers and employees whose work brings them into contact with SNAP benefits or who are assigned to a location where SNAP benefits are accepted, handled or processed shall be conducted within one month of the institution of the compliance policy under Criterion 1 above. Employees hired subsequent to the institution of the compliance policy shall be trained within one month of employment. All employees shall be trained periodically thereafter;
(ii) Training shall be designed to establish a level of competence that assures compliance with Program requirements as included in this part 278;
(iii) Written materials, which may include FNS publications and program regulations that are available to all authorized firms, are used in the training program. Training materials shall clearly state that the following acts are prohibited and are in violation of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 and regulations: the exchange of food coupons, ATP cards or other program access devices for cash; and, in exchange
for coupons, the sale of firearms, ammunition, explosives or controlled substances, as the term is defined in section 802 of title 21, United States Code.
(j)
Amount of civil money penalty in lieu of permanent disqualification for trafficking.
A civil money penalty assessed in accordance with § 278.6(i) shall not exceed the amount specified in § 3.91(b)(3)(ii) of this title for each violation and shall not exceed the amount specified in § 3.91(b)(3)(ii) of this title for all violations occurring during a single investigation. FNS shall determine the amount of the civil money penalty as follows:
(1) Determine the firm's average monthly redemptions for the 12-month period ending with the month immediately preceding the month during which the firm was charged with violations;
(2) Multiply the average monthly redemption figure by 10 percent;
(3) For the first trafficking offense by a firm, multiply the product obtained in § 278.6(j)(2) by 60 if the largest amount of food coupons, ATP cards, or other benefit instruments involved in a single trafficking transaction had a face value of $99 or less. If the face value of coupons, ATP cards or other benefit instruments involved in the largest single trafficking transaction was $100 or more, the amount of the product obtained in this paragraph shall be doubled;
(4) For a second trafficking offense by a firm, multiply the product obtained in § 278.6(j)(2) by 120 if the largest amount of food coupons, ATP cards, or other benefit instruments involved in a single trafficking transaction had a face value of $99 or less and the same firm has once before been sanctioned for trafficking in food coupons, ATP cards, or other benefit instruments. If the face value of food coupons, ATP cards, or other benefit instruments involved in the largest single trafficking transaction was $100 or more, the amount of the product obtained in this paragraph shall be doubled; and
(5) If a third trafficking offense is committed by the firm, the firm shall not be eligible for a civil money penalty in lieu of disqualification.
(k)
Payment of civil money penalty in lieu of a permanent disqualification for trafficking.
Payment of the full amount of the civil money penalty in lieu of permanent disqualification for trafficking shall be made within 30 days of the date the final determination was received by the firm. If payment is not made within the prescribed period, the right to the civil money penalty in lieu of a permanent disqualification is forfeited and disqualification shall become effective immediately.
(l)
Fines for the acceptance of loose coupons.
FNS may impose a fine against any retail food store or wholesale food concern that accepts coupons that are not accompanied by the corresponding book cover, other than the denomination of coupons used for making change as specified in § 278.2(d) or coupons accepted from homeless meal providers as specified in § 278.2(c). The fine to be assessed against a firm found to be accepting loose coupons shall be $500 per investigation
plus
an amount equal to double the face value of each loose coupon accepted, and may be assessed and collected in addition to any fiscal claim established by FNS. The fine shall be paid in full within 30 days of the firm's receipt of FNS' notification to pay the fine. The Attorney General of the United States may institute judicial action in any court of competent jurisdiction against the store or concern to collect the fine. FNS may withdraw the authorization of the store, as well as other authorized locations of a multi-unit firm which are under the same ownership, for failure to pay such a fine as specified under § 278.1(k). FNS may deny the authorization of any firm that has failed to pay such fines as specified under § 278.1(j).
(m)
Fines for unauthorized third parties that accept SNAP benefits.
FNS may impose a fine against any individual, sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation or other legal entity not approved by FNS to accept and redeem food coupons for any violation of the provisions of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 or the program regulations, including violations involving the acceptance of coupons. The fine shall be $1,000 for each violation
plus
an amount equal to three times the face value of the illegally accepted food coupons. The fine shall be paid in full within 30 days of
the individual's or legal entity's receipt of FNS' notification to pay the fine. The Attorney General of the United States may institute judicial action in any court of competent jurisdiction against the person to collect the fine. FNS may withdraw the authorization of any firm that is under the same ownership as an unauthorized firm that has failed to pay such a fine, as specified under § 278.1(k). FNS may deny authorization to any firm that has failed to pay such a fine, as specified under § 278.1(j).
(n)
Review of determination.
The determination of FNS shall be final and not subject to further administrative or judicial review unless a written request for review is filed within the period stated in part 279 of this chapter.
Notwithstanding the above, any FNS determination made on the basis of paragraph (e)(8) of this section shall not be subject to further administrative or judicial review.
(o)
Delivery of notice.
The delivery by any method that provides evidence of delivery of any notice required of FNS by this part will constitute notice to the addressee of its contents.
(p)
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and appeals.
A FOIA request or appeal for records shall not delay or prohibit FNS from making a determination regarding disqualification or penalty against a firm under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, or delay the effective date of a disqualification or penalty listed in paragraph (e) of this section.

§ 278.7
Determination and disposition of claims—retail food stores and wholesale food concerns.
(a)
Claims against violators.
FNS may establish and pursue claims against firms or other entities which have accepted or redeemed coupons in violation of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 or this part regardless of whether the firms or entities are authorized to accept SNAP benefits. If a firm fails to pay a claim, FNS may collect the claim by offsetting against amounts due the firm on redemption of other coupons or by deducting the amounts due from bonds posted by firms in compliance with the provisions of § 278.1(b)(4). FNS shall deny an application for authorization or reauthorization by a firm which has failed to pay a claim.
(b)
Forfeiture of a collateral bond or draw down on an irrevocable letter of credit.
If FNS establishes a claim against an authorized firm which has previously been sanctioned, collection of the claim may be through total or partial forfeiture of the collateral bond or draw down of the irrevocable letter of credit. If FNS determines that forfeiture or a draw down is required for collection of the claim, FNS shall take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate.
(1) Determine the amount of the bond to be forfeited or irrevocable letter of credit drawn down on the basis of the loss to the Government through violations of the Act, and this Part, as detailed in a letter of charges to the firm;
(2) Send written notification by method of proof of delivery to the firm and the bonding agent or commercial bank of FNS' determination regarding forfeiture or draw down of all or specified part of the collateral bond or irrevocable letter of credit and the reasons for the forfeiture or draw down action;
(3) Advise the firm and the bonding agent or commercial bank of the firm's right to administrative review of the claim determination;
(4) Advise the firm and the bonding agent or commercial bank that if payment of the current claim is not received directly from the firm, FNS shall obtain full payment through forfeiture of the bond or draw down of the irrevocable letter of credit;
(5) Proceed with collection of the bond or irrevocable letter of credit in the amount forfeited or drawn down if a request for review is not filed by the firm within the period established in § 279.5 of this chapter, or if such review is unsuccessful; and
(6) Upon the expiration of time permitted for the filing of a request for administrative and/or judicial review, deposit the bond or irrevocable letter of
credit in a Federal Reserve Bank account or in the Treasury Account, General. If FNS requires only a portion of the face value of the bond or irrevocable letter of credit to satisfy a claim, the entire bond or irrevocable letter of credit will be negotiated, and the remaining amount returned to the firm.
(c)
Coupons accepted without authorization.
(1) The FNS officer in charge may approve the redemption under § 278.4 of coupons accepted by firms before the receipt of an authorization card from FNS if the following conditions exist:
(i) The coupons were received in accordance with the requirements of this part governing acceptance of coupons except the requirement that the firm be authorized before acceptance;
(ii) The coupons were accepted by the firm in good faith, and without intent to circumvent this part; and
(iii) The firm receives authorization to participate in the program.
(2) Firms seeking approval to redeem coupons accepted without authorization shall present a written application for approval to the local FNS field office. This application shall be accompanied by a written statement signed by the firm of all the facts about the acceptance of the coupons. The statement shall also include a certification that the coupons were accepted in good faith, and without any intent to circumvent this part.
(d)
Burned or mutilated coupons.
FNS may redeem burned or mutilated coupons only to the extent that the Bureau of Engraving and Printing of the United States Treasury Department can determine the value of the coupons. The firm presenting burned or mutilated coupons for redemption shall submit the coupons to the local FNS field office with a properly filled-out redemption certificate. In the section of the redemption certificate for entering the amount of coupons to be redeemed, an estimate of the value of the burned or mutilated coupons submitted for redemption shall be entered if the exact value of the coupons is unknown. The phrase “Deputy Administrator for Fiscal Management, FNS, USDA,” should be entered in the section of the redemption certificate for entering the name and address of the insured financial institution or wholesaler.
(e)
Old series coupons.
FNS may redeem the old series food coupons issued in 50-cent, 2-dollar, and 5-dollar denominations when they are presented for redemption. Firms presenting the coupons for redemption shall submit the coupons to the local FNS field office with a properly completed redemption certificate and a written statement, signed by a representative of the firm, detailing the circumstances of the acceptance of the coupons.
(f)
Denials of claims brought by authorized firms against FNS.
If a claim brought by a firm against FNS under this section is denied in whole or in part, notification of this action shall be sent to the firm by using any delivery method as long as the method provides evidence of delivery. If the firm is aggrieved by this action, it may seek administrative review as provided in part 279.
(g)
Lost or stolen coupons.
FNS may not be held liable for claims from retail food stores, meal services, or wholesale food concerns for lost or stolen coupons.

Identifying the request.
Requests for review shall clearly identify the administrative action from which the review is requested. This identification shall include the date of the letter or other written communication notifying the firm of the administrative action, the name and title of the person who signed the letter or other communication, and whether the action under appeal concerns a denial of an application or a withdrawal of authorization to
participate, a disqualification from further participation, a civil money penalty, or a denial of all or any part of a claim or a fine.
(b)
Supporting the request.
The request shall include information in support of the request showing the grounds on which review is being sought, or shall state that supporting information will be filed in writing at a later date.

Action upon receipt of a request for review.
(a)
Holding action.
Upon receipt of a request for review of administrative action, the administrative action shall be held in abeyance until the designated reviewer has made a determination. However, permanent disqualifications for trafficking shall not be held in abeyance and shall be effective immediately as specified in 278.6(b)(2) of this chapter. If the disqualification is reversed through administrative or judicial review, the Secretary shall not be held liable for the value of any sales lost during the disqualification period. If the administrative action in question involves the denial of a claim brought by a firm against FNS, or the forfeiture of a collateral bond or the draw down on an irrevocable letter of credit, the designated reviewer shall direct the firm not be approved for participation, not be paid any part of the disputed claim, or not be reimbursed for any bond forfeiture or irrevocable letter of credit withdrawal, as appropriate until the designated reviewer has made a determination.
(b)
Filing supporting information.
If the request filed by the firm includes a request for an opportunity to file written information in support of its position at a later date, the designated reviewer shall promptly notify the firm of the date by which the information shall be filed. If the firm fails to file any information in support of its position by the designated date, the information submitted with the original request shall be considered to be the only information submitted by the firm. In that case, if no information in support of the firm's position was submitted with the original request, the action of the appropriate FNS office shall be final.
(c)
Extensions of time.
Upon timely written request to FNS by the firm requesting the review, FNS may grant extensions of time if, in FNS' discretion, additional time is required for the firm to fully present information in support of its position. Additionally, FNS may not grant extensions of time or hold the administrative review process in abeyance solely on the basis of a pending FOIA request or appeal. No extension may be made in the time allowed for the filing of a request for review.

Judicial review.
(a)
Filing for judicial review.
Except for firms disqualified from the program in accordance with § 278.6(e)(8) of this chapter, a firm aggrieved by the determination of the designated reviewer may obtain judicial review of the determination by filing a complaint against the United States in the U.S. district court for the district in which the owner resides or is engaged in business, or in any court of record of the State having competent jurisdiction. The complaint must be filed within 30 days after the date of delivery or service upon the firm of the notice of determination of the designated reviewer in accordance with § 279.5(e); otherwise the determination shall be final.

(c)
Trial de novo.
The suit in the U.S. district court or in the State court, as the case may be, shall be a trial de novo by the court in which the court shall determine the validity of the questioned administrative action. If the court determines that the administrative action is invalid, it shall enter a judgment or order which it determines is in accordance with the law and the evidence.
(d)
Stay of action.
During the pendency of any judicial review, or any appeal therefrom, the administrative action under review shall remain in force unless the firm makes a timely application to the court and after hearing thereon, the court stays the administrative action after a showing that irreparable injury will occur absent a stay and that the firm is likely to prevail on the merits of the case. However, permanent disqualification actions taken in accordance with § 278.6(e)(1) of this chapter shall not be subject to such a stay of administrative action. If the disqualification action is reversed through administrative or judicial review, the Secretary shall not be liable for the value of any sales lost during the disqualification period.

§ 280.1
Interim disaster procedures.
The Secretary shall, after consultation with the official empowered to exercise the authority provided for by section 302(a) of the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, establish temporary emergency standards of eligibility for the duration of the emergency for households who are victims of a disaster which disrupts commercial channels of food distribution, if such households are in need of temporary food assistance and if commercial channels of food distribution have again become available to meet the temporary food needs of such households. Such standards as are prescribed for individual emergencies may be promulgated without regard to section 4(c) of this Act or the procedures set forth in section 553 of Title 5 of the United States Code. In addition to establishing temporary emergency standards of eligibility, the Secretary shall provide for emergency allotments to eligible households to replace food destroyed in a disaster. Such emergency allotments would be equal to the value of the food actually lost in such disaster but not greater than the applicable maximum monthly allotment for the household size. The Secretary may also approve alternate methods for issuing SNAP benefits during a disaster when reliance on Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) systems is impracticable.

§ 281.1
General purpose and scope.
(a) These regulations govern the operation of SNAP on Indian reservations either separately or concurrently with the Food distribution program. In order to assure that SNAP is responsive to the needs of Indians on reservations, State agencies are required to consult with Indian tribal organizations about the implementation and operation of SNAP on reservations. Also, under certain specified conditions Indian tribal organizations on reservations can administer SNAP. The Act authorizes the Secretary to pay such amounts for administrative costs as are determined to be necessary for the effective operation of SNAP on Indian reservations.
(b) The operation of SNAP on Indian reservations is governed by all of the terms and conditions set forth in the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 as amended and the regulations of this chapter.
(c) Additionally, under no circumstances shall any household participate simultaneously in SNAP and the Food Distribution Program. Policy governing this prohibition is found in § 253.7(e).
[44 FR 35925, June 19, 1979, as amended at 78 FR 11972, Feb. 21, 2013]
§ 281.2
Administration.
(a)
Qualification.
(1) The appropriate ITO of an established Indian reservation will qualify for participation under the provisions of this part, when that ITO files an application which demonstrates the status of an area as an established reservation, unless FNS determines that such area(s) does not qualify as a reservation, as that term is defined in these regulations. For purposes of this part, established reservation means the geographically defined area(s) currently recognized and established by Federal or State treaty or by Federal statute whereby such geographically defined area(s) is set aside for the use of Indians. Where such established areas exist, the appropriate ITO is presumed to exercise governmental jurisdiction, unless otherwise determined by FNS:
(2) The appropriate ITO for other areas, in order to qualify as reservations for the provisions of this part, must show to FNS:
(i) That the ITO exercises governmental jurisdiction over a geographic area(s) which enjoys legal recognition from the Federal or a State government and is set aside for the use of Indians.
(ii) A clear and precise description of the boundaries of such geographic area(s).
(3) Otherwise qualified areas for which the responsible ITO has requested operation of the Food Distribution Program alone in accordance with § 283.4, rather than concurrent operation with SNAP, shall be exempt from the requirements of this part, and shall not be considered SNAP areas for any other purposes of this subchapter. Indian tribal households (households in which at least one adult member is recognized by the appropriate ITO as a tribal member) resident in these areas shall be ineligible for SNAP benefits. However, non-Indian tribal households resident in these areas may apply and be certified for SNAP benefits at the State agency's certification office which would otherwise service the area. Otherwise qualified areas for which the responsible ITO has requested operation of the food distribution Program concurrently with SNAP or areas within the reservation where FNS has determined that concurrent operation is necessary in accordance with § 283.3(b)(2) shall be subject to all requirements of this part and subchapter.
(b)
State plan.
In addition to the public comment requirements in § 272.2, the State agency shall submit for comment its service plans, and all other portions of the State plan that directly pertains to the operation of the Program for residents on the reservation to the responsible ITO for reservations that qualify under paragraph (a) of this section. The ITO shall have 30 days to provide comments in writing to the State agency. The State agency shall, if appropriate and to the extent practicable, incorporate into its plans any suggestions made by the ITO. Additionally, the State agency shall administer SNAP in a manner that is responsive to the needs of the Indians on the reservation, as determined by ongoing
consultation with the ITO and by other means, regarding such areas of program operation as project area designation, operating procedures, locations and hours of certification and issuance, staffing and corrective action plans. The State agency shall maintain records of consultations on State plans and ongoing consultations held with ITO's for review by FNS. FNS shall study these records as part of reviews in accord with § 281.3 and Management Evaluation Reviews of the State agency.
(c)
Project area designation.
(1) An Indian reservation shall be designated as a separate project area or areas for the purpose of improving the accessibility of program services to Indians on the reservation unless:
(i) The State agency demonstrates to FNS that the size or population of the reservation does not warrant such designation;
(ii) The State agency demonstrates to FNS that the tribe can be adequately served by the existing or a planned project area because of the location of certification and issuance offices;
(iii) The State agency demonstrates to FNS that such designation would reduce the availability of certification and issuance offices; or
(iv) The State agency otherwise demonstrates to FNS that such designation would impair its Statewide administration of the Program.
(2) In the case where the Indian reservation boundaries cross State lines, the ITO and the appropriate State agencies may jointly request FNS approval that a single State agency administer SNAP on all or part of the Indian reservation. A single agency of the State government would have to administer the Program under the same terms and conditions applied to all other political subdivisions within its jurisdiction. An ITO designated as a State agency pursuant to § 281.4(d) would have to administer the Program under the same terms and conditions on all areas of the reservation.
(d)
Contracts with an Indian tribal organization.
The State agency may contract program functions to an ITO. These functions include, but are not limited to, outreach, preparation of bilingual materials on issuance. The State agency may also use the ITO in prescreening, translations, interpretive services and other noncertification functions. The State agency shall not contract responsibility for certification activities such as interviews or eligibility determinations. In all cases, the State agency shall retain full responsibility for program administration.
[44 FR 35925, June 19, 1979, as amended by Amdt. 207, 47 FR 52338, Nov. 19, 1982]
§ 281.3
Determination of failure.
(a)
Request for determination of State government agency failure.
FNS shall examine State agency administration of SNAP on all or part of a reservation when requested by the ITO, the State agency or at FNS' discretion. When FNS determines that a deficiency in a State agency operation of SNAP on all or part of an Indian reservation may be serious enough to warrant a review, FNS shall advise the State agency and the ITO in writing of the alleged deficiencies and of its plans to conduct the review and document deficiencies, if any are found. Subsequent to October 1, 1979 FNS shall complete these reviews within 90 days from receipt of an ITO's or State agency's request except under unusual circumstances such as the receipt of a large number of simultaneous requests.
(b)
Review
—(1)
Content of the review for State agency performance.
The review shall be designed to determine whether or not the State agency is properly administering SNAP on a specific reservation. When an agency of State government is administering the Program on a reservation, FNS shall as a part of the review consult with the ITO about the operation of the Program on the reservation. The review should, depending on the nature of the complaint, include but not be limited to, an analysis of some or all of the following data:
(i) The records of State agency consultation with the ITO required under § 281.2(a);
(ii) The estimated percentage of all eligible Indians on the reservation who are participating the Program;
(iii) The nature and extent of violations, if any, of the 30-day and other processing standards for Indians;
(iv) The percentage of errors made in determining eligibility and/or the amount of benefits overissued or underissued;
(v) Compliance with standards for location and hours of certification and issuance offices as required in § 272.5;
(vi) Compliance with bilingual requirements of this regulation, where appropriate;
(vii) Compliance with nondiscrimination requirements of this regulation;
(viii) Compliance with other significant program requirements;
(ix) Comparison with services provided in all other areas of the State; and
(x) Any other relevant information that becomes available during the course of reviews including information received through contacts with the Indian tribe.
(2)
Finding of no or of minor deficiencies.
If after the review FNS determines either that deficiencies do not exist or that only minor deficiencies exist, FNS shall issue a report documenting its findings to both the State agency and the ITO and shall work closely with the State agency to achieve corrective action.
(c)
Formal warning.
After the review is completed, if FNS determines that major deficiencies exist, a formal warning shall be issued to the State, with a copy to the ITO. At a minimum, such warning shall indicate the State agency deficiencies and shall detail the basis upon which deficiencies were determined. The State shall have 30 days to respond with evidence that it is in compliance or to submit a corrective action proposal under part 276. If satisfactory compliance is achieved by the State agency on deficiencies cited in a formal warning, FNS shall notify the State, with a copy to the ITO, that the warning for those deficiences is satisfied.
(d)
Determination of failure and sanctions.
If at any time after the formal warning period, or during or after the corrective action period, FNS determines that major deficiencies still exist which the State agency has not satisfactorily addressed or is not satisfactorily addressing, FNS shall determine State failure and may impose appropriate Federal sanctions on the State agency as specified in part 276.
(e)
ITO operations.
If FNS has determined State failure and FNS has also determined that the ITO is capable of administering a SNAP in accordance with the terms and requirements for participating State agencies as established in the Act and regulations, then the ITO shall assume administration of SNAP on the reservation. The State agency shall continue to administer SNAP on the reservation until an effective termination and transition arrangement has been completed in accordance with § 281.8.
§ 281.4
Determining Indian tribal organization capability.
(a)
Determining capability of ITO.
If the ITO wishes to administer its own SNAP on the reservation FNS shall determine the ITO's potential capability for administering SNAP in accordance with the criteria listed in § 281.4(b). FNS shall begin to evaluate the ITO's capability for all aspects of SNAP administration, allowing for fulfillment of that potential through necessary training and technical assistance, not later than the date of the issuance of the formal warning to the State agency.
(b)
ITO responsibility.
(1) The ITO must satisfy FNS that it is capable (if provided with any needed training and technical assistance) of administering SNAP effectively and efficiently, and of complying with all provisions of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended, and the regulations of this chapter, including provisions governing quality control procedures, fraud determinations, and establishment and collection of claims for both Indian and any non-Indian participants. The ITO shall provide FNS with the following information:
(i)
Operation of government programs.
The ITO shall provide FNS a list of all government programs that the ITO administers and has recently administered. FNS may ask the ITO to provide the names of appropriate officials of the government organizations having jurisdiction over these programs so FNS can obtain all relevant audits, GAO reports, program evaluations and any other documents pertaining to the
effectiveness and efficiency of tribal administration of these programs. The ITO shall also provide FNS a list of its recent contractual responsibilities, if any, for SNAP under § 281.2(b).
(ii)
Fiscal capabilities.
The ITO shall provide FNS documentation of its bookeeping and accounting procedures, including procedures in use for fiscal accountability under part 277 and for other government programs that the ITO administers.
(iii)
Projected certification and issuance facilities.
The ITO shall provide FNS with a description of the location of projected certification and issuance facilities.
(iv)
Fraud hearings and claims.
The ITO shall provide FNS with a description of how it will pursue fraud hearings and claims against Indian and non-Indian participants.
(v)
Staffing.
The ITO shall provide FNS with sufficient information to determine that personnel who will be used in the certification process will be employed under standards equivalent to current standards for a Merit System of Personnel Administration or any standards later prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management under section 208 of the Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970.
(vi)
Civil rights assurance.
The ITO shall provide FNS an assurance that the ITO shall comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Pub. L. 88-352), the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (Pub. L. 94-135), the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 99-112), section 504), and section 11(c) of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 and all pertinent regulations or directives to the effect that no person in the United States shall, on the grounds of sex, race, color, age, political belief, religion, handicap, or national origin, be denied benefits or otherwise be subject to discrimination under SNAP. Where appropriate, FNS shall consider the adequacy of measures taken by the ITO to ensure that there shall be no discrimination.
(2) Prior to the determination of ITO capability, FNS shall consult with other sources such as the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to obtain any information relevant to the capability determination.
(3) If it is determined by FNS, after consultation with other sources such as the BIA, that the ITO is not capable of operating an efficient and effective SNAP, the agency of the State government shall continue to operate the Program on the reservation in accordance with § 281.3.
(c)
Training and technical assistance.
Upon determining that the State agency has failed to properly administer SNAP and that the ITO is potentially capable of operating an effective and efficient SNAP, FNS shall determine, based on information provided by the ITO and other sources such as BIA, the training and technical assistance which is necessary to assure efficient and effective program administration. FNS will assure that appropriate training and technical assistance is provided as expeditiously as possible prior to the ITO's assumption of the administration of SNAP.
(d)
Assumption of duties.
When FNS is satisfied that the ITO has successfully completed (c) of this section, FNS shall designate the ITO as a State agency, contingent on the following:
(1)
State plans.
The ITO shall prepare and submit to FNS a Plan of Operation as provided in § 272.2. In completing the Plan of Operation the ITO shall affirm that it will comply with the Civil Rights assurances detailed in (b)(1)(vi) of this section.
(2)
Proposed budget.
As part of the Plan of Operation, the ITO shall annually submit to FNS a proposed statement which shall provide a summary of program information and amounts budgeted to carry out the various program functions. This information shall be submitted to FNS for approval prior to the commitment of any Federal funds for administrative costs for that year. FNS shall provide the ITO any technical assistance which is necessary to prepare this information.
(3)
Termination and transition arrangement.
An effective termination and transition arrangement shall be established as required in § 281.8.
§ 281.5
Responsibilities of an Indian tribal organization designated as State agency.
An ITO administering SNAP on a reservation shall adhere to the Food and
Nutrition Act of 2008, all subsequent amendments, and all regulations issued pursuant to that law in the same manner as any other State agency. The ITO may contract certain administrative functions to private organizations as provided in parts 274 and 277. The ITO may not, however, contract responsibility for certification activities such as interviews or eligibility determinations. The ITO shall retain full responsibility for program administration.
§ 281.6
Liabilities and sanctions.
An ITO administering SNAP on a reservation is subject to the same liabilities and Federal sanctions as is any other State agency. FNS shall monitor administration of the Program and conduct reviews through the Performance Reporting System described in part 275. When necessary, warning procedures and other Federal sanctions prescribed in part 276 will be implemented.
§ 281.7
Indian tribal organization failure.
When Performance Reporting System reviews indicate that continuing deficiencies exist and corrective action proposals (including training and technical assistance to overcome these deficiencies), and/or appropriate sanctions have not, in the opinion of FNS, resulted in a sufficient degree of improvement, FNS will conduct a review to determine if the ITO has failed to properly administer SNAP. FNS shall examine the relevant factors specified in § 281.3(b)(1) and shall follow the notification and determination procedures set forth in § 281.3 (c) and (d). If ITO failure is determined, FNS shall require the appropriate agency of the State government to resume administration of the Program on the reservation in accordance with an approved termination and transition arrangement.
§ 281.8
Transfer of program administration.
The transfer of program administration from an agency of the State government to an ITO pursuant to a determination of failure as provided for in § 281.3, or from an ITO to an agency of the State government pursuant to § 281.7, shall be contingent on the establishment of an effective termination and transition arrangement and an approved Plan of Operation from the State agency assuming program administration. Grant closeout procedures shall be followed in accordance with part 277. FNS shall approve the transition plan, monitor its implementation and resolve any issues which may arise during the transition and after the transfer of program administration.

§ 283.7
Procedures upon failure to file an answer.
The failure by FNS to file an answer shall constitute a waiver of hearing.

If meritorious objections are not filed, the ALJ shall issue an initial decision without further procedures or hearing. Copies of the initial decision or denial of the State agency's motion shall be served on each of the parties and shall be included as part of the official record. Where the decision as proposed by the State agency is adopted as the ALJ's initial decision, such decision of the ALJ shall become final and effective 30 days after service in accordance with § 283.17(c)(2) unless reconsideration or review by the Judicial Officer is sought as discussed in §§ 283.17(d) and 283.20.

answer may be amended without prior authorization by the ALJ. Thereafter, such an amendment may only be made as authorized by the ALJ upon a showing of cause.
§ 283.9
Withdrawal of appeal.

Objections to questions or documents shall be in the short form, stating the grounds of objections relied upon. The questions propounded, together with all objections made (but not including argument or debate), shall be recorded verbatim. In lieu of oral examination, parties may transmit written questions to the officer prior to the examination and the officer shall propound such questions to the deponent.
(ii) The party taking the deposition shall arrange for the examination of the witness either by oral examination, or by written questions upon agreement of the parties or as directed by the ALJ. If the examination is conducted by means of written questions, copies of the questions shall be served upon the other party to the appeal and filed with the officer at least 10 days prior to the date set for the examination unless otherwise agreed, and the other party may serve cross questions and file them with the officer at any time prior to the time of the examination.

(5)
Certification by the officer.

appeal, in which case there should be another copy for each additional party), in an envelope and mail the same by registered or certified mail to the Hearing Clerk.
(6)
Corrections to the transcript.
(i) At any time prior to the hearing, any party may file a motion proposing corrections to the transcript of the deposition.

(iii) At any time prior to the use of the deposition in accordance with paragraph (a)(7) of this section and after consideration of any objections filed thereto, the ALJ may issue an order making any corrections in the transcript which the ALJ finds are warranted, and these corrections shall be entered onto the original transcript by the Hearing Clerk (without obscuring the original text).

If the party upon whose motion the deposition was taken refuses to offer it in evidence, any other party may offer the deposition or any part thereof in evidence. If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, any other party may require the introduction of any other part which is relevant be considered with the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other parts.
(b)
Interrogatories, requests for admissions and requests for production of documents

A party may submit written interrogatories to any other party to an appeal. The time for submitting and responding to written interrogatories shall be set by the ALJ at the pre-hearing conference, but in no event shall the time for response be less than 20 days from the date of service or within such time as determined upon motion to the ALJ. The number of interrogatories submitted by each party shall not exceed twenty-five questions including subparts, unless additional interrogatories are authorized by the ALJ. Each interrogatory should be answered separately and fully in writing, unless it is objected to, in which event the reasons for objection should be stated in lieu of an answer. The answers are to be signed under penalty of perjury by the person making them. Objections shall be signed by the attorney of record in the appeal or by the responding party's authorized representative.
(2)
Request for admissions.
A party may submit a written request for admission of the truth of any matters relevant to the appeal to any other party to the appeal. The time for submitting a written request for admission shall be set by the ALJ at the pre-hearing conference. The number of admissions contained in a request submitted by a party shall not exceed twenty-five unless additional admissions are authorized by the ALJ. The matter is admitted unless, within 20 days after service thereof, or within such time as determined upon motion to the ALJ, the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting the admission a written answer or objection addressed to the matter signed by the party, counsel or designated representative. If objection is made, the reasons therefor should be stated. The answer should specifically deny the matter or set forth in detail why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter. An answering party may not give lack of information or knowledge as a reason for the failure to admit or deny unless it is stated that reasonable inquiry has been
made and that the information known or readily obtainable is insufficient to enable the party to admit or deny. A party who considers that a matter for which an admission has been requested presents a genuine issue for hearing may not, on that ground alone, object to the request; the party may deny the matter or set forth reasons why the matter cannot be admitted or denied.
(3)
Request for production of documents.
(i) Any party may serve upon any other party to the appeal a request for production of documents which are in the possession or control of the party upon whom the request is served. The time for service and response to such a request shall be set by the ALJ at the pre-hearing conference. Upon payment of fees for search and duplication of documents, any party to the appeal may obtain copies of such documents.
(ii) Parties may request production of any documents regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action. Grounds for objection will not exist if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
(iii) If such documents include privileged information or information the disclosure of which is proscribed by the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended, such documents need not be produced.
(c)
Supplementation of response.
A party who knows or later learns that a response is incorrect is under a duty to correct such response as soon as possible. A party who has responded to a request for discovery with a response that was complete when made is under a duty to supplement the response to include information thereafter acquired. A party is under a duty to supplement responses with respect to any question directly addressed to:
(1) The identity and location of persons having knowledge of discoverable matters, and
(2) The identity of each person expected to be called as an expert witness at the hearing, the subject matter on which such expert(s) is expected to testify, and the substance of the testimony.
(d)
Frequency and use of discovery.
The ALJ shall limit, upon motion of a party, the frequency or extent of discovery if the ALJ determines that:
(1) The discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;
(2) The party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by discovery in the action to obtain the information sought; or
(3) The discovery is unduly burdensome or expensive, taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, limitations on the parties' resources, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation.
(e)
Protective orders
—(1)
Request for protective order.
A party served with such a request may file a motion for a protective order before the date on which a response to the discovery request is due, stating why discovery should be limited or should not be required.
(2)
Issuance of protective order.
In issuing a protective order, the ALJ may make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression or undue burden or expense, including one or more of the following:
(i) That discovery not be had;
(ii) That the discovery may be had only through a method of discovery other than that requested;
(iii) That certain matters not be inquired into, or that the scope of discovery be limited to certain matters;
(iv) That discovery be conducted with no one present except persons designated by the ALJ; and
(v) That the contents of discovery or evidence be sealed.
(f)
Failure to respond to discovery
—(1)
Motions to compel.
If a deponent fails to respond or gives an evasive or incomplete answer to a question propounded at a deposition pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section or a party fails to respond or gives evasive or incomplete answers to written interrogatories or admissions, or fails to respond, in full or in part, to a request for production of documents served pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the party seeking discovery may apply for an
order compelling an answer by filing and serving a motion on all parties and deponents.
(2)
Filing motion to compel.
(i) Such motion must be filed within 20 days following the service of the unresponsive answer upon deposition or within 20 days after expiration of the period allowed for answers to interrogatories or production of documents.
(ii) On matters related to an oral examination, the proponent of the question may complete or adjourn the examination before he applies for an order.
(3)
Responding to motion to compel.
A response to the motion may be filed in accordance with § 283.18(d).
(g)
Decision of the ALJ.
(1) The ALJ may grant a motion to compel production or deny a motion for a protective order only if the ALJ finds that the discovery sought is necessary for the expeditious, fair, and reasonable consideration of the issues; it is not unduly costly or burdensome; it will not unduly delay the proceeding; and the information sought is not privileged.
(2) The initial decision of the ALJ regarding the motion to compel the production of privileged documents or the motion for a protective order shall become final and effective 10 days after service unless either party pursues the options as discussed in §§ 283.17(d) and 283.20.
(h)
Failure to comply with an order.
(1) If a party or other witness refuses to be sworn or refuses to answer any question after being directed to do so by order of the ALJ, such refusal may subject the refusing party to proceedings to compel compliance with the ALJ's order in the appropriate United States district court.
(2) If any party or other person refuses to obey an order made under this section requiring an answer to designated questions or production of documents, the ALJ may order that the matters regarding which questions were asked or the contents of the document or documents or any other designated facts should be taken to be established for the purposes of the proceeding in accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the order.
(i)
Postponements or delays.
No hearing, proceeding or other matter under this part shall be postponed or otherwise delayed pending the response or resolution of issues pertaining to a request for information pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.
§ 283.13
Subpoenas.
(a)
Issuance of subpoenas.
The attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence from any place in the United States on behalf of any party to the appeal may be required by subpoena at the designated place of hearing. Except for cause shown, requests for subpoenas shall be filed at least 15 days prior to the date of the hearing. Subpoenas shall be issued by the ALJ, over the facsimile signature of the Secretary, upon a reasonable showing by the applicant of the grounds, necessity and reasonable scope thereof.
(b)
Service of subpoenas.
(1) When the ALJ issues a subpoena under this section, the party who requested such subpoena shall serve all other parties with a copy of the subpoena, notice of the names and addresses of the individuals subpoenaed and specify any documents required to be produced.
(2) Subpoenas may be served:
(i) By a U.S. Marshal or deputy marshal,
(ii) By any other person who is not less than 18 years of age, or
(iii) By registering and mailing a copy of the subpoena addressed to the person to be served at the last known principal place of business or residence.
(3) Proof of service may be made:
(i) By the return of service on the subpoena by the U.S. Marshal or deputy marshal,
(ii) If served by an employee of the Department, by a certificate stating that he personally served the subpoena upon the person named therein,
(iii) If served by another person, by an affidavit of such person stating that he personally served the subpoena upon the person named therein, or
(iv) If service was by registered mail, by an affidavit made by the person mailing the subpoena that it was mailed as provided herein and by the signed return post-office receipt. Where the subpoena is issued on behalf of the Secretary and service is by mail, the
return receipt without an affidavit or certificate of mailing shall be sufficient proof of service.
(4) In making personal service, the person making service shall leave a copy of the subpoena with the person subpoenaed, or, if such person is not immediately available, with any other responsible person authorized to accept service residing or employed at the place of residence or business of the person subpoenaed.
(5) The original of the subpoena, bearing or accompanied by the required proof of service, shall be returned to the official who issued the same. The party at whose request the subpoena is issued shall be responsible for the service thereof.
§ 283.14
Fees of witnesses.
Witnesses summoned under these rules shall be paid the same fees and expenses that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States. Fees shall be paid by the party at whose request the witness appears. Current Federal, State, or local government employees shall not be eligible to receive witness fees.
§ 283.15
Procedure for hearing.
(a)
Request for hearing.
A party may request a hearing on the facts by including such request in its Appeal Petition or Answer, whichever is appropriate. Failure to request a hearing within the time specified shall constitute a waiver of the opportunity for such a hearing, except as provided for under § 283.4(i). In the event FNS denies any material facts and fails to request a hearing, the matter may be set down for hearing on motion of the State agency or upon the ALJ's own motion.
(b)
Time and place.
If any material issue of fact is joined by the pleadings, the ALJ, upon motion of any party, stating that the matter is ready for hearing, shall set a time for the hearing, as soon as feasible thereafter, with due regard for the public interest and the convenience and necessity of the State agency and FNS. The hearing shall be held at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC. Upon a showing of unusual or extraordinary circumstances, the ALJ may order that the hearing be held at another location. The ALJ shall file a notice stating the time and place of the hearing. If any change in the time of the hearing is made, the ALJ shall file a notice of such change, which notice shall be served upon the parties, unless it is made during the course of an oral hearing and made a part of the transcript or actual notice given to the parties.
(c)
Appearances.
The parties may appear in person or by attorney of record in the appeal or by any other designated representative. Any person who appears as attorney or as a party's designated representative must conform to the standards of ethical conduct required by practitioners before the courts of the United States.
(d)
Exchange of witness and rebuttal witness lists, statements and exhibits.
(1) Witness and rebuttal witness lists, copies of prior statements of proposed witnesses, and copies of proposed hearing exhibits, including copies of any written statements or depositions that a party intends to offer in lieu of live testimony in accordance with § 283.12(a)(7), shall be exchanged at least 15 days in advance of the hearing or at such other time as may be set by the ALJ.
(2) A witness whose name does not appear on the witness list shall not be permitted to testify and exhibits which were not provided to the opposing party as provided above shall not be admitted into evidence at the hearing absent a showing of cause and as authorized by the ALJ.
(e)
Deparment of attorney or representative.
(1) Whenever an ALJ finds that a person acting as attorney or designated representative for any party to the appeal is guilty of unethical or contumacious conduct in, or in connection with an appeal, the ALJ may order that such person be precluded from further acting as attorney or representative in the appeal. Review by the Judicial Officer may be taken on any such order, but no appeal of the QC claim shall be delayed or suspended pending disposition of the debarment review by the Judicial Officer. Provided, however, that the ALJ shall suspend the appeal of the QC claim for a reasonable time for the purpose of enabling the party to obtain another attorney or representative.
(2) Whenever it is found, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that a person who is acting or who has acted as attorney or representative for another person in any proceeding before the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is unfit to act as such counsel because of such unethical or contumacious conduct, such person will be precluded from acting as the attorney or representative in any or all proceedings before the Department as found to be appropriate.
(f)
Failure to appear.
(1) If FNS or the State agency, after being duly notified, fails to appear at the hearing without cause, that party shall be deemed to have waived the opportunity for an oral hearing and to have admitted any facts which may be presented at the hearing. Such failure by either party shall also constitute an admission of all the material allegations of fact contained in any pleadings submitted by the other party. The party who appears shall have the option of whether to follow the procedure under § 283.7 or to present evidence, in whole or in part, in the form of declarations or by oral testimony before the ALJ.
(2) Failure to appear at a hearing shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the right to be served with a copy of the ALJ's initial decision, to file a motion for reconsideration pursuant to § 283.17(d) or to seek review by the Judicial Officer in accordance with § 283.20.
(g)
Order of proceeding.
Except as may be decided otherwise by the ALJ, FNS shall proceed first at the hearing. FNS has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, the QC claim against the State agency for a QC error rate in excess of the tolerance level. The State agency will proceed second and must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, the facts upon which it bases its appeal.
(h)
Evidence.
(1) The testimony of witnesses at a hearing shall be on oath or affirmation and subject to cross-examination.
(2) Upon a finding of cause, the ALJ may order that any witness be examined separately and apart from all other witnesses except those who may be parties to the appeal or whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of the party's cause.
(3) After a witness called by either party has testified on direct examination, any other party may request and obtain the production of any statement, or part thereof, of such witness in the possession of the opposing party which relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified. Such production shall be made according to the procedures and subject to the definitions and limitations prescribed in the Jencks Act (18 U.S.C. 3500).
(4) Evidence which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not of the sort upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely, shall be excluded by order of the ALJ insofar as practicable.
(i)
Inclusion in the record.
At the oral hearing or as ordered by the ALJ, depositions to the extent deemed admissible, written interrogatories, written requests for admission and respective responses may be offered in evidence by the party at whose instance they were taken. If not offered by such party, they may be offered in whole or in part by any other party. If only part of a deposition, written interrogatory, written request for admission or response thereto is offered in evidence by a party, any other party may require that all of it, which is relevant to the part introduced, be offered, and any party may introduce any other parts. Such depositions, written interrogatories, written requests for admission and respective responses thereto shall be admissible in evidence subject to such objections as to relevancy, materiality or competency of the testimony as were noted at the time of their taking or are made at the time they are offered in evidence.
(j)
Objections.
(1) If a party objects to the admission of any evidence or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or cross examination or to any other ruling by the ALJ, the party shall state briefly the grounds of such objection, whereupon an automatic exception will follow if the objection is overruled by the ALJ.
(2) Only objections made before the ALJ may be subsequently relied upon on review by the Judicial Officer.
(k)
Exhibits.
Four copies of each exhibit shall be filed with the ALJ. However, where there are more than two parties in the appeal, an additional copy shall be filed for each additional party. A true copy of an exhibit may be substituted for the original.
(l)
Official records or documents.
An official government record or document or entry therein, if admissible for any purpose, shall be admissible in evidence without the production of the person who made or prepared the same, and shall be prima facie evidence of the relevant facts stated therein. Such record or document shall be evidenced by an official publication thereof or by a copy certified by a person having legal authority to make such certification.
(m)
Official notice.
Official notice shall be taken of such matters as are judicially noticed by the courts of the United States and of any other matter of technical, scientific, or commercial fact of established character. Provided, that the parties shall be given adequate opportunity to show that such facts are erroneously noticed.
(n)
Offer of proof.
Whenever evidence is excluded by the ALJ, the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be included in the transcript. The offer of proof shall consist of a brief statement describing the evidence excluded. If the evidence consists of a brief oral statement, it shall be included in the transcript in toto. If the evidence consists of a document or other exhibit, it shall be marked for identification and inserted in the hearing record. In either event, if the Judicial Officer, upon review, determines that the ALJ's ruling excluding the evidence was erroneous and prejudicial, the evidence shall be considered a part of the transcript and hearing record. If the Judicial Officer determines that the ALJ's ruling excluding the evidence was erroneous and prejudicial, and that it would inappropriate to have such evidence considered a part of the hearing record without reopening the hearing, the Judicial Officer may direct that the hearing be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence or for any other purpose in connection with the excluded evidence.
(o)
Transcript.
Hearings shall be recorded and transcribed verbatim. The party requesting the hearing shall bear the transcription cost of producing the transcript and the duplication cost for one transcript provided to the ALJ and to the other parties to the appeal.
§ 283.16
Consolidation of issues.
Similar issues involved in appeals by two or more State agencies may be consolidated upon motion by the State agencies, FNS, or at the discretion of the ALJ if it is decided that consolidation would help to promote administrative efficiency.
(a)
Disposition of consolidated issues.
If the ALJ orders consolidation, the issues consolidated will be considered first. If a hearing has been requested by any of the parties that have had issues consolidated, arguments on the consolidated issues will be heard before arguments on dissimilar issues. The ALJ will take the information into consideration along with arguments on other issues in preparing initial decisions for QC appeals in which some issues have been consolidated.
(b)
Initial decision.
(1) If the ALJ decides the evidence and arguments by the State agencies on the consolidated issues cannot be overcome by the evidence presented by FNS and are sufficient to grant the relief requested by a State agency or all State agencies in which the issue is involved, the ALJ shall prepare an initial decision as provided in § 283.17(c).
(2) FNS may file a motion for reconsideration pursuant to § 283.17(d) or seek review by the Judicial Officer in accordance with § 283.20.

record. The transcript shall be deemed to be certified without further action by the ALJ.
(3) At any time prior to the filing of the ALJ's initial decision and after consideration of any objections filed as to the transcript, the ALJ may issue an order making any corrections in the transcript that the ALJ finds are warranted. Such corrections shall be entered into the original transcript by the Hearing Clerk (without obscuring the original text).
(b)
Proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, order, and briefs.
The parties may file proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law and orders based solely upon the record and on officially noticed matters, and briefs in support thereof. briefs may be filed at the discretion of the ALJ.

(1) The ALJ shall decide the appeal not later than 60 days after receipt of rebuttal evidence submitted by the State agency or, if the State agency does not submit rebuttal evidence, not later than 90 days after the State agency submits the notice of appeal and evidence in support of the appeal. In accordance with § 283.22(f), the ALJ may, upon motion or
sua sponte,
extend this deadline for cause shown.
(2) The ALJ shall prepare, upon the basis of the record and officially noticed matters, and shall file, an initial decision which shall include a decision on a request for good cause relief, a copy of which shall be served upon each of the parties.
(3) Such initial decision shall be considered final for purposes of judicial review without further proceedings, unless there is a motion for reconsideration filed pursuant to § 283.17(d) or review by the Judicial Officer is sought pursuant to § 283.20.
(4) If no motion for reconsideration or review by the Judicial Officer is filed, the initial decision shall constitute the final notice of determination for purposes of judicial review and shall become effective 30 day after service.
(d)
Motion for reconsideration.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, any party may file a motion for reconsideration of the initial decision within 30 days of service of the initial decision. If served by mail, the time for filing a motion for reconsideration will be 5 days longer in accordance with § 283.22.
(2) Every such motion must set forth the mattes claimed to have been erroneously decided and the basis of the alleged errors. Such motion shall be accompanied by a supporting brief.
(3) Responses to such motions shall be filed in accordance with § 283.18(d).
(4) No party may file a motion for reconsideration of an initial decision that has been revised in response to a previous motion for reconsideration.
(5) The ALJ may dispose of a motion for reconsideration by denying it or by issuing a revised initial decision.
(6) If the ALJ denies a motion for reconsideration, the initial decision shall constitute the final notice of determination for purposes of judicial review and shall become effective 30 days after service unless review by the Judicial Officer is sought in accordance with § 283.20.
(7) If the ALJ issues a revised initial decision, that decision shall constitute the final notice of determination for purposes of judicial review and shall become effective 30 days after service unless review by the Judicial Officer is sought in accordance with § 283.20.
§ 283.18

If any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Judicial Officer that additional evidence not presented to the ALJ is material, not cumulative, and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to present such evidence to the ALJ, the Judicial Officer shall remand the matter to the ALJ for consideration of such additional evidence.
(j)
Decision of the Judicial Officer on review.

A State agency may appeal the bill for collection from FNS for a QC claim of less than $50,000 for a SNAP QC error rate in excess of the tolerance level. A State agency must file a written notice of appeal, in accordance with this section, within 10 days of receipt of the bill for collection from FNS for a QC claim of less than $50,000.

(c)
Filing.
The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk.
(d)
Content of the notice of appeal.
(1) A notice of appeal, in order to be considered acceptable must contain the following information:
(i) A brief and clear statement that it is an appeal from a QC claim of less than $50,000 identifying the period the claim covers, the date and amount of the bill for collection, and the date of receipt of the bill for collection;
(ii) Identification of the State agency as the appellant and FNS as the appellee;
(iii) A statement that the notice of appeal is filed pursuant to section 14(a) of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008;
(iv) A true copy of the bill for collection which constitutes the basis for the filing of the notice of appeal shall be attached to the notice.
(2) Failure to file an acceptable notice of appeal may result in a challenge by FNS to the notice and dismissal of the notice by the ALJ and a waiver of the opportunity for further appeal or review by the Judicial Officer unless the State agency pursues the options as discussed in §§ 283.17(d) and 283.20.
(e)
Receipt of notice of appeal and assignment of docket number.
Upon receipt of a notice of appeal, the Hearing Clerk shall assign the appeal a docket number. The Hearing Clerk shall:
(1) Send the State agency a letter which shall include the following information:
(i) Advise that the notice of appeal has been received and the date of receipt;
(ii) The docket number assigned to the appeal and instructions that all future communications related to the appeal shall reference the docket number, and;
(iii) That the State agency must file and serve its appeal petition, as set forth in § 283.22 not later than 60 days after receiving a notice of the claim. Failure to file a timely appeal petition may result in a waiver of further appeal rights.
(2) Send FNS a copy of the notice of appeal and a copy of the letter to the State agency.
(f)
Stay of collection.
The filing of a timely notice of appeal shall automatically stay the action of FNS to collect the QC claim asserted against the State agency until a decision is reached on the acceptability of the appeal, and in the case of an acceptable appeal, until a final administrative determination has been issued. However, interest will accrue on the outstanding claim amount during the stay as provided in section 13(a)(1) of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2022(a)(1)).

(2) The nature of the relief sought.
(h)
FNS answer.
Upon service of the State agency appeal petition, FNS shall file an answer, pursuant to § 283.6, not later than 60 days after the State agency submits its appeal petition.
§ 283.26
Request that appeals be handled under procedures in subpart B for appeals of QC claims of $50,000 or more.
(a) If, after the filing of its appeal petition, the State agency does not believe that the summary procedure provided in this subpart is adequate for handling the appeal and that an oral hearing is necessary, the State agency may file, no later than the date established for the conclusion of any discovery pursuant to § 283.29, a motion that its appeal be handled under the procedures in subpart B of this part.
(b) The motion shall specify why the State agency believes that the summary procedure is inadequate and what harm will result if an oral hearing is not held.

(d) The ALJ will review the State agency's motion and the information submitted by FNS and decide which procedures shall be used in the appeal.
§ 283.27
Procedures upon failure to file an answer.
The failure by FNS to file an answer shall constitute a waiver of the opportunity to file a cross motion for summary judgment pursuant to § 283.30. Upon such failure to file, the State agency shall file a proposed decision, along with a motion for adoption thereof, both of which shall be served upon FNS by the State agency. Within 10 days after service of such motion and proposed decision, FNS may file with the Hearing Clerk objections thereto. If the ALJ finds that meritorious objections have been filed, the State agency's motion shall be denied
with supporting reasons. If meritorious objections are not filed, the ALJ shall issue an initial decision without further procedures. Copies of the decision or denial of State agency's motion shall be served on each of the parties and shall be included as part of the official record. Where the decision as proposed by the State agency is adopted as the ALJ's initial decision, such decision of the ALJ shall become final and effective 30 days after service unless reconsideration or review by the Judicial Officer is sought as discussed in §§ 283.17(d) and 283.20.
§ 283.28

§ 285.1
General purpose and scope.
This part describes the general terms and conditions under which grant funds shall be provided by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) to the government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for the purpose of designing and conducting a nutrition assistance program for needy persons. The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is authorized to establish eligibility and benefit levels for the nutrition assistance program. In addition, with FNS approval, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico may employ a small proportion of the grant funds to finance projects that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico believes likely to improve or stimulate agriculture, food production, and food distribution.
§ 285.2
Funding.
(a) FNS shall, consistent with the plan of operation required by § 285.3 of this part, and subject to availability of funds, provide nutrition assistance grant funds to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to cover 100 percent of the expenditures related to food assistance provided to needy persons and 50 percent of the administrative expenses related to the food assistance. The amount of the grant funds provided to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico shall not exceed amounts appropriated for this purpose for each fiscal year.
(b) FNS shall, subject to the provisions in §§ 285.3 and 285.5 in this part, and limited by the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, pay to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for the applicable fiscal year, the amount estimated by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico pursuant to § 285.3(b)(4). Payments shall be made no less frequently than on a monthly basis prior to the beginning of each month consistent with the Treasury Fiscal Requirement Manual, Volume I, part 6, section 2030; these letters of credit shall be drawn on an as-needed basis. The amount shall be reduced or increased to the extent of
any prior overpayment or underpayment which FNS determines has been made and which has not been previoulsy adjusted. The payment(s) received by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for a fiscal year shall not exceed the total authorized for the grant, or the total cost for the nutrition assistance program eligible for funding, whichever is less, for that fiscal year.
(c) FNS may recover from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, through offsets to funding during any fiscal year, funds previously paid to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and later determined by the Secretary to have been overpayments. Funds which may be recovered include, but are not limited to:
(1) Costs not included in the approved plan of operation;
(2) Unallowable costs discovered in audit or investigation findings;
(3) Funds allocated to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico which exceeded expenditures during the fiscal year for which the funds were authorized; or
(4) Amounts owed to FNS as a result of the nutrition assistance grant which have been billed to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and which the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has failed to pay without cause acceptable to FNS.
(d) Funds for payment of any prior fiscal year expenditures shall be claimed from the funding for that prior year. The payment of funds shall not exceed the authorization for that prior fiscal year.
[Amdt. 209, 47 FR 32409, July 27, 1982, as amended by Amdt. 243, 49 FR 49585, Dec. 21, 1984; Amdt. 274, 51 FR 18752, May 21, 1986; Amdt. 371, 61 FR 60012, Nov. 26, 1996]
§ 285.3
Plan of operation.

(3) A description of the program for nutrition assistance including:
(i) A general description of the nutrition assistance to be provided the needy persons who will receive assistance, and any agencies designated to provide such assistance; and

(2) Reasonably targeted to the most needy persons as defined in the plan of operation;
(3) Supported by an assessment of the food and nutrition needs of needy persons;
(4) Reasonable in terms of the funds requested;

(6) Consistent with all applicable Federal laws.
(e) FNS shall approve or disapprove any amendments to those provisions of the plan of operation specified in paragraph (b) of this section. If FNS fails either to approve or deny the amendment, or to request additional information within 30 days, the amendment to the plan of operation is approved.

The State Summer EBT agency may request FFP for the costs of IS equipment and services acquired to meet emergency situations in which the agency can demonstrate to FNS an immediate need to acquire IS equipment or services in order to continue operation of Summer EBT; and the State Summer EBT agency can clearly document that the need could not have been anticipated or planned for and precludes the State from following the prior approval requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. FNS may provide FFP in emergency situations if the following conditions are met:
(1) The State Summer EBT agency must submit a written request to FNS prior to the acquisition of any IS equipment or services. The written request must include:
(i) A brief description of the IS equipment and/or services to be acquired and an estimate of their costs;
(ii) A brief description of the circumstances which result in the State Summer EBT agency's need to proceed with the acquisition prior to fulfilling approval requirements at paragraph (c) of this section; and
(iii) A description of the adverse impact which would result if the State Summer EBT agency does not immediately acquire the IS equipment and/or services.
(2) Upon receipt of a written request for emergency acquisition FNS must provide a written response to the State Summer EBT agency within 14 days. The FNS response must:
(i) Inform the State Summer EBT agency that the request has been disapproved and the reason for disapproval.
(ii) If FNS approves the request submitted under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, FFP will be available from the date the State Summer EBT agency acquires the IS equipment and services.
(iii) FNS recognizes that an emergency situation exists and grants conditional approval pending receipt of the State Summer EBT agency's formal submission of the IAPD information specified at paragraph (b)(4) of this section within 90 days from the date of the agency's initial written request.
(iv) If the complete IAPD submission required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section is not received by FNS within 90 days from the date of the initial written request, costs may be subject to disallowance.
(k)
General cost requirements
—(1)
Cost determination.
Actual costs must be determined in compliance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, and USDA implementing regulations in 2 CFR parts 400
and 415 and an FNS approved budget and must be reconcilable with the approved FNS funding level. A State Summer EBT agency must not claim reimbursement for costs charged to any other Federal program or uses of IS systems for purposes not connected with Summer EBT. The approved APD cost allocation plan includes the methods which will be used to identify and classify costs to be claimed. This methodology must be submitted to FNS as part of the request for FNS approval of funding as required in this section. Operational costs are to be allocated based on the statewide cost allocation plan rather than the APD cost plan. Approved cost allocation plans for ongoing operational costs must not apply to IS system development costs under this section unless documentation required under paragraph (b) of this section is submitted to and approvals are obtained from FNS. Any APD-related costs approved by FNS must be excluded in determining the Summer EBT agency's administrative costs under any other section of this part.
(2)
Cost identification for purposes of FFP claims.
State Summer EBT agencies must assign and claim the costs incurred under an approved APD in accordance with the following criteria:

Development costs.
Using its normal departmental accounting system, in accordance with the cost principles set forth in 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, and USDA implementing regulations in 2 CFR parts 400 and 415, the State Summer EBT agency must specifically identify what items of costs constitute development costs, assign these costs to specific project cost centers, and distribute these costs to funding sources based on the specific identification, assignment and distribution outlined in the approved APD. The methods for distributing costs set forth in the APD should provide for assigning identifiable costs, to the extent practicable, directly to program/functions. The State Summer EBT agency must amend the cost allocation plan required by 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, to include the approved APD methodology for the identification, assignment, and distribution of the development costs.
(ii)
Operational costs.
Costs incurred for the operation of an IS must be identified and assigned by the State Summer EBT agency to funding sources in accordance with the approved cost allocation plan required by 2 CFR part 200, subpart E.
(iii)
Service agreement costs.
States that operate a central data processing facility must use their approved central service cost allocation plan required by 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, and USDA implementing regulations in 2 CFR parts 400 and 415 to identify and assign costs incurred under service agreements with the State Summer EBT agency. The State Summer EBT agency must then distribute these costs to funding sources in accordance with the development and operational costs outlined in this section.
(iv)
Claiming costs.
Prior to claiming funding under this section the State Summer EBT agency must have complied with the requirements for obtaining approval and prior approval of paragraph (b) of this section.
(v)
Budget authority.
FNS approval of requests for funding must provide notification to the State Summer EBT agency of the budget authority and dollar limitations under which such funding may be claimed. FNS must provide this amount as a total authorization for such funding which may not be exceeded unless amended by FNS. FNS's determination of the amount of this authorization must be based on the budget submitted by the State Summer EBT agency. Activities not included in the approved budget, as well as continuation of approved activities beyond scheduled deadlines in the approved plan, must require FNS approval of an As Needed APDU as prescribed in paragraphs (b)(4) and (f)(4) of this section, including an amended State budget. Requests to amend the budget authorization approved by FNS must be submitted to FNS prior to claiming such expenses.
(l)
Access to the system and records.
Access to the system in all aspects, including but not limited to design, development, and operation, including work performed by any source, and including cost records of contractors and subcontractors, must be made available by the State Summer EBT agency
to FNS or its authorized representatives at intervals as are deemed necessary by FNS, in order to determine whether the conditions for approval are being met and to determine the efficiency, economy and effectiveness of the system. Failure to provide full access to all parts of the system may result in suspension and/or termination of Summer EBT funds for the costs of the system and its operation.
(m)
Ownership rights.
The State Summer EBT agency must comply with the requirements under this part and the requirement for intangible property in 2 CFR 200.315.
(n)

(ii) Summer EBT agencies that intend to propose alternative procedures must include a detailed description of their plan in their POM submission. Proposals are subject to USDA approval.
(b)
Replacing applications.
The Summer EBT agency may, on a case-by-case basis, replace up to ten percent of applications that are randomly selected as part of the verification sample. Applications may be replaced if the Summer EBT agency determines that the household would be unable to satisfactorily respond to the verification request.
(c)
Rolling verification sample selection. Summer EBT agencies may choose to conduct verification on a rolling basis, as long as the sample size requirements in paragraph (a)(3) of this section are met.
(1) If conducting rolling verification, the Summer EBT agency must:
(i)(A) Include in each sample pool only applications approved since the last sample was selected; and
(B) Select three (3) percent of approved applications, as required by the sampling method, each time, but round down to the nearest whole number to prevent over-sampling. If rounding down results in a zero, no applications should be verified for the sample period, and the applications received in that sample period should be included in the next sample pool.
(ii) Select the final sample on April 1.
(A) Selecting only from the applications approved since the last sampling;
(B) Summing the number of applications selected for verification to date
(including the final, April 1 sample); and
(C) Calculating three (3) percent of all applications approved as of April 1, and rounding up to the next whole number.
(2) If the number of applications summed per paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section is less than the three (3) percent calculated per paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C) of this section, the Summer EBT agency must fill the remainder of the sample by selecting randomly from all applications.
(3) Summer EBT agencies may choose to sample at any frequency prior to April 1, but may not sample any applications after April 1.
(d)
Verification after April 1.
Applications that come in after April 1 are still subject to verification for cause, on a case-by-case basis, per paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

Data records are subject to the timeframe specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(1) Direct verification must be conducted prior to contacting the household for documentation.
(2) For the purposes of direct verification, documentation may indicate participation in an applicable program or income at any point during the period of eligibility. The information provided only needs to indicate eligibility at a single point in time during the period of eligibility, not that the child was eligible at the time of application or verification.
(3) Summer EBT agencies must include in their POM submission all sources of administrative data that is intended to be used for direct verification.
(f)
Verification procedures and assistance for households
—(1)
Exceptions from verification.
Verification is not required of households if all children in the household are determined eligible based on documentation provided by the State or local agency responsible for the administration of the SNAP, FDPIR, TANF, or another means tested program, as approved by the Secretary, or if all children in the household are determined to be foster, homeless, migrant, or runaway, as defined in § 245.2 of this chapter.
(2)
Notification of selection.
Households selected for verification must be notified in writing that their applications were selected for verification. The written statement must include a telephone number to contact for assistance. Any communications with households concerning verification must be in an understandable and uniform format and, to the maximum extent practicable, in a language that parents and guardians can understand. These households must be advised of the type of information or documents that will be expected. Households selected for verification must be informed that:
(i) They are required to submit the requested information to verify eligibility for Summer EBT benefits, by the date determined by the Summer EBT agency.
(ii) They may, instead, submit proof that the children receive assistance under SNAP, FDPIR, TANF, or another means tested program, as approved by the Secretary.
(iii) They may, instead, request that the Summer EBT agency contact the appropriate officials to confirm that their children are foster, homeless, migrant, or runaway.
(iv) Failure to cooperate with verification efforts will result in the termination of benefits.
(3)
Sources of information.
For the purposes of this section, sources of information for verification may include, but are not limited to, written evidence, individuals outside of the child's household who can verify the child's circumstances, and systems of records as follows:
(i) Written evidence must be used as the primary source of information for verification. Written evidence includes written confirmation of a household's circumstances, such as wage stubs,
award letters, and letters from employers. Whenever written evidence is insufficient to confirm income information on the application or current eligibility, the verifying agency may require confirmation from a person outside of the child's household, or accept a statement from an adult member of the child's household.
(ii) Verbal confirmations of a household's circumstances by a person outside of the household may be made in person or by phone. The verifying official may select a person to contact if the household fails to designate one or designates one which is unacceptable to the verifying official. If the verifying official designates a person, contact must not be made without providing written or oral notice to the household. At the time of this notice, the household must be informed that it may consent to the contact or provide acceptable documentation in another form. If the household refuses to choose one of these options, its eligibility must be terminated in accordance with the normal procedures for failure to cooperate with verification efforts. Individuals outside of the child's household who can verify the child's circumstances could include but are not limited to: employers, social service agencies, school officials, and migrant agencies.
(iii) Agency records to which the verifying agency may have access are not considered to be the same as a person outside of the child's household who can verify their circumstances. Information concerning income, household size, or SNAP, FDPIR, or TANF eligibility, maintained by other government agencies to which the verifying agency can legally gain access, must be used to confirm a household's income, size, or receipt of benefits, as applicable. Information may also be obtained from individuals or agencies serving categorically eligible children, as defined in § 292.2, including foster, homeless, migrant, or runaway children.
(iv) Households which dispute the validity of income information acquired through an individual outside of the child's household or a system of records must be given the opportunity to provide other documentation.
(4)
Documentation timeframe.
Households selected and notified of their selection for verification must provide documentation of income. The documentation must indicate the source, amount and frequency of all household income and may indicate eligibility at any point during the period of eligibility. The information provided only needs to indicate eligibility for participation in the program at a single point in time during the period of eligibility, not that the child was certified for that program's benefits at the time of application or verification.
(5)
Household cooperation.
If a household refuses to cooperate with efforts to verify, eligibility for Summer EBT benefits must be terminated.
(6)
Telephone assistance.
The Summer EBT agency must provide a telephone number to households selected for verification to call free of charge to obtain information about the verification process. The telephone number must be prominently displayed on the letter to households selected for verification.
(7)
Follow-up attempts.
The Summer EBT agency must make at least two attempts, at least one week apart, to contact any household that does not respond to a verification request. The attempt may be through a telephone call, email, or mail, and must be documented. Non-response to the initial request for verification includes no response and incomplete or ambiguous responses that do not permit the Summer EBT agency to resolve the children's eligibility for Summer EBT benefits.
(8)
Eligibility changes.
The Summer EBT agency must complete the following activities if there is an eligibility change as a result of verification:
(i) Make appropriate modifications to the initial eligibility determinations.
(ii) Notify the household of any change in eligibility as a result of verification.
(iii)(A) The notice must advise the household of:
(
1
) The change;
(

) The reasons for the change;
(
3
) Notification of the right to appeal and when the appeal must be filed;
(
4
) Instructions on how to appeal; and
(
5
) The right to reapply at any time during the instructional year or summer operational period.
(B) Properly document and retain on file at the Summer EBT agency the reasons for ineligibility.
(9)
Issuance of benefits.
Benefits cannot be issued for applications selected for verification until the verification process is completed with the exception of verification for cause, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(10)
Timing of verification for continuous school calendars.
In the case of children who are enrolled in a school operating on a continuous school calendar, the Summer EBT agency must receive approval from USDA for any alternative plans for the timing of conducting verification, in accordance with the State or ITO's approved POM.
(11)
Verification after benefit issuance.
If a Summer EBT agency is alerted to a questionable application after initial approval or issuance of benefits, no further benefits should be issued until verification for cause, as outlined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is complete and eligibility is confirmed.
(12)
Nondiscrimination.
The verification efforts must be applied without regard to race, sex, color, national origin, age, or disability.
(g)
Verification of alternative income applications in 2024.
In 2024, Summer EBT agencies or LEAs should, on a case-by-case basis, verify for cause any questionable Summer EBT application or alternate income applications used to confer Summer EBT eligibility and follow the procedures in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.

(3) Requirements for notifying households about disqualification penalties that are specified at § 273.16(d) of this chapter apply to Summer EBT.
(4) Disqualification hearing procedures for individuals accused of intentional Program violation specified at § 273.16(e)(f) through (h) of this chapter also apply to Summer EBT.
(5) Each State Summer EBT agency must report to FNS information concerning individuals disqualified for an intentional Program violation in accordance with § 273.16(i) of this chapter for Summer EBT.
(6) In cases where the determination of intentional program violation is reversed by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the State agency must reinstate the individual in the program if the household is eligible.
(f)
Restoration of lost benefits
—(1)
Entitlement.
(i) The Summer EBT agency must restore benefits which were lost whenever the loss was caused by an error by the Summer EBT agency or by an administrative disqualification for intentional Program violation which was subsequently reversed, or if there is a statement elsewhere in the regulations specifically stating that the household is entitled to restoration of lost benefits. Furthermore, unless there is a statement elsewhere in this part that a household is entitled to lost benefits for a longer period, benefits shall be restored for not more than twelve months prior to whichever of the following occurred first:
(A) The date the Summer EBT agency receives a request for restoration from a household; or
(B) The date the Summer EBT agency is notified or otherwise discovers that a loss to a household has occurred.
(ii) The Summer EBT agency must restore benefits which were found by any judicial action to have been wrongfully withheld. If the judicial action is the first action the recipient has taken to obtain restoration of lost benefits, then benefits must be restored for a period of not more than twelve months from the date the court action was initiated. When the judicial action is a review of a Summer EBT agency action, the benefits must be restored for a period of not more than twelve months from the first of the following dates:
(A) The date the Summer EBT agency receives a request for restoration.
(B) If no request for restoration is received, the date the fair hearing action was initiated; but
(C) Never more than one year from when the Summer EBT agency is notified of, or discovers, the loss.
(D) Benefits must be restored even if the child is currently ineligible.
(2)
Errors discovered by the Summer EBT agency.
If the Summer EBT agency determines that a loss of benefits has occurred, and the household is entitled to restoration of those benefits, the Summer EBT agency must automatically take action to restore any benefits that were lost. No action by the household is necessary. However, benefits must not be restored if the benefits were lost more than 12 months prior to the month the loss was discovered by the State agency in the normal course of business, or were lost more than 12 months prior to the month the State agency was notified in writing or orally of a possible loss to a specific household. The State agency shall notify the household of its entitlement, the amount of benefits to be restored, any offsetting that was done, the method of restoration, and the right to appeal through the fair hearing process if the household disagrees with any aspect of the proposed lost benefit restoration.
(3)
Disputed benefits.
(i) If the Summer EBT agency determines that a household is entitled to restoration of lost benefits, but the household does not agree with the amount to be restored as calculated by the Summer EBT agency or any other action taken by the Summer EBT agency to restore lost benefits, the household may request a fair hearing within 90 days of the date the household is notified of its entitlement to restoration of lost benefits. If a fair hearing is requested prior to or during the time lost benefits are being restored, the household shall receive the lost benefits as determined by the Summer EBT agency pending the results of the fair hearing. If the fair hearing decision is favorable to the household, the Summer EBT agency must restore the lost benefits in accordance with that decision.
(ii) If a household believes it is entitled to restoration of lost benefits but
the Summer EBT agency, after reviewing the case file, does not agree, the household has 90 days from the date of the Summer EBT agency determination to request a fair hearing. The Summer EBT agency must restore lost benefits to the household only if the fair hearing decision is favorable to the household. Benefits lost more than 12 months prior to the date the Summer EBT agency was initially informed of the household's possible entitlement to lost benefits shall not be restored.
(4)
Lost benefits to individuals disqualified for intentional Program violation.
Individuals disqualified for intentional Program violation are entitled to restoration of any benefits lost during the months that they were disqualified, not to exceed twelve months prior to the date of Summer EBT agency notification, only if the decision which resulted in disqualification is subsequently reversed.
(5)
Method of restoration.
Regardless of whether a household is currently eligible or ineligible, the Summer EBT agency must restore lost benefits to a household by issuing an allotment equal to the amount of benefits that were lost. The amount restored shall be issued in addition to the allotment currently eligible households are entitled to receive.
(6)
Accounting procedures.
The Summer EBT agency shall be responsible for maintaining an accounting system for documenting a child's entitlement to restoration of lost benefits and for recording the balance of lost benefits that must be restored. The Summer EBT agency must at a minimum, document how the amount to be restored was calculated and the reason lost benefits must be restored. The accounting system must be designed to readily identify those situations where a claim against a household can be used to offset the amount to be restored.
(g)
Retailers.
Retail food operations authorized to participate as a SNAP retailer must also accept State Summer EBT benefits.
(h)
Record retentions and forms of security.
The State Summer EBT agency must maintain issuance, inventory, reconciliation, and other accountability records related to Summer EBT.
(1)
Availability of records.
(i) The State Summer EBT agency shall maintain issuance, inventory, reconciliation, and other accountability records for a period of three years. This period may be extended at the written request of FNS.
(ii) In lieu of the records themselves, easily retrievable microfilm, microfiche, or computer tapes which contain the required information may be maintained.
(2)
Control of issuance documents.
The State Summer EBT agency shall control all issuance documents which establish household eligibility while the documents are transferred and processed within the State Summer EBT agency. The State Summer EBT agency shall use numbers, batching, inventory control logs, or similar controls from the point of initial receipt through the issuance and reconciliation process.
(3)
Accountable documents.
(i) EBT cards shall be considered accountable documents. The State Summer EBT agency shall provide the following minimum security and control procedures for these documents:
(A) Secure storage;
(B) Access limited to authorized personnel;
(C) Bulk inventory control records;
(D) Subsequent control records maintained through the point of issuance or use; and
(E) Periodic review and validation of inventory controls and records by parties not otherwise involved in maintaining control records.
(ii) For notices of change which initiate, update or terminate the master issuance file, the State Summer EBT agency shall, at a minimum, provide secure storage and shall limit access to authorized personnel.
(i)
Benefit redemption by eligible households
—(1)
Eligible food.
Program benefits may be used only by the household, or other persons the household selects, to purchase eligible food for the household from SNAP-authorized retailers, which includes, for certain households, the purchase of prepared meals, and for other households residing in certain designated areas of Alaska, the purchase of hunting and fishing equipment with benefits.
(2)
Prior payment prohibition.
Program benefits must not be used to pay for any eligible food purchased prior to the time at which an EBT card is presented to authorized retailers or meal services. Benefits must not be used to pay for any eligible food in advance of the receipt of food, except when prior payment is for food purchased from a nonprofit cooperative food purchasing venture.
(3)
Transaction limits.
No minimum dollar amount per transaction or maximum limit on the number of transactions can be established. In addition, no transaction fees can be imposed on Summer EBT households utilizing the EBT system to access their benefits.
(4)
Access to balances.
(i) Households shall be permitted to determine their Summer EBT account balances without making a purchase or standing in a checkout line.
(ii) The Summer EBT agency must ensure that the EBT system is capable of providing a transaction history for a period of up to 2 calendar months to households upon request.
(iii) Households must be provided printed receipts at the time of transaction. At a minimum this information must:
(A) State the date, merchant's name and location, transaction type, transaction amount and remaining balance for the Summer EBT account;
(B) Comply with the requirements of 12 CFR part 205 (Regulation E) in addition to the requirements of this section; and
(C) Identify the Summer EBT households member's account number using a truncated number or coded transaction number. The child's name must not appear on the receipt except when a signature is required when utilizing a manual transaction voucher.
(5)
Equal treatment.
The EBT system must be implemented and operated in a manner that maintains equal treatment for Summer EBT households. Summer EBT benefits must be accepted for eligible foods at the same prices and on the same terms and conditions applicable to cash purchases of the same foods at the same store. However, nothing in this part may be construed as authorizing FNS to specify the prices at which retail food stores may sell food. However, public or private nonprofit homeless meal providers may only request voluntary use of Summer EBT benefits from homeless Summer EBT recipients and may not request such household using Summer EBT benefits to pay more than the average cost of the food purchased by the public or private nonprofit homeless meal provider contained in a meal served to the patrons of the meal service. For purposes of this section, “average cost” is determined by averaging food costs over a period of up to one calendar month. Voluntary payments by Summer EBT recipients in excess of such costs may be accepted by the meal providers. The value of donated foods from any source must not be considered in determining the amount to be requested from Summer EBT recipients. All indirect costs, such as those incurred in the acquisition, storage, or preparation of the foods used in meals shall also be excluded. In addition, if others have the option of eating free or making a monetary donation, Summer EBT recipients must be provided the same option of eating free or making a donation in money or Summer EBT benefits. No retail food store may single out Summer EBT recipients for special treatment in any way. The following requirements for the equal treatment of Summer EBT households must directly apply to EBT systems:
(i) Retailers must not establish special checkout lanes which are only for Summer EBT households. If special lanes are designated for the purpose of accepting other electronic debit or credit cards and/or other payment methods such as checks, Summer EBT customers with EBT cards may also be assigned to such lanes as long as other commercial customers are assigned there as well.
(ii) Checkout lanes equipped with POS devices shall be made available to Summer EBT households during all retail store hours of operation.
(6)
Households eligible for prepared meals
—(i)
Meals-on-wheels.
Eligible guardians of Summer EBT recipients 60 years of age or over or guardians who
are housebound, physically handicapped, or otherwise disabled to the extent that they are unable to adequately prepare meals may use Summer EBT benefits to purchase meals for the participant that are prepared for and delivered to them by a nonprofit meal delivery service authorized by FNS.
(ii)
Communal dining facilities.
Eligible guardians of Summer EBT recipients 60 years of age or over may use Summer EBT benefits issued to purchase meals for the participant that are prepared at communal dining facilities authorized by FNS for that purpose.
(iii)

(A) Eligible residents of a group living arrangement may use Summer EBT benefits issued to them to purchase meals prepared especially for them at a group living arrangement which is authorized by FNS to redeem Summer EBT benefits in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
(B) Residents of shelters for battered women and children may use their Program benefits to purchase meals prepared especially for the participant at a shelter which is authorized by FNS to redeem benefits in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
(iv)
Homeless households.
(A) Homeless Summer EBT households may use their benefits to purchase prepared meals for the participant from authorized homeless meal providers.
(B) Eligible homeless Summer EBT households may use their benefits to purchase meals for the participant from restaurants authorized by FNS for such purpose.
(7)
Allowable purchase of equipment for hunting and fishing.
Eligible Summer EBT households residing in areas of Alaska determined by FNS as areas where access to authorized retailers is difficult and which rely substantially on hunting and fishing for subsistence may use all or any part of their benefits issued to purchase hunting and fishing equipment such as nets, hooks, rods, harpoons and knives, but may not use benefits to purchase firearms, ammunition, and other explosives.
(8)
Limiting hunting and fishing purchases to eligible households.
State Summer EBT agencies shall implement a method to ensure that access to prepared meals and hunting and fishing equipment is limited to eligible households as described in paragraphs (i)(6) and (7) of this section.
(9)
Container deposit fees.
Program benefits may not be used to pay for deposit fees in excess of the amount of the State fee reimbursement required to purchase any food or food product contained in a returnable bottle or can, regardless of whether the fee is included in the shelf price posted for item. The returnable container type and fee must be included in State law in order for the customer to be able to pay for the upfront deposit with Summer EBT benefits. If a Summer EBT eligible product has a State deposit fee associated with it, the product remains eligible for purchase with Summer EBT benefits, and the State deposit fee may be paid with Summer EBT benefits as well; however, any fee in excess of the State deposit fee must be paid in cash or other form of payment other than with Summer EBT benefits.
(j)
Reconciliation.
State Summer EBT agencies must account for all issuance through a reconciliation process as described by USDA.

The Summer EBT agency must promptly investigate complaints received or irregularities noted in connection with the operation of the Program and must take appropriate action to correct any irregularities. The Summer EBT agency must maintain on file all evidence relating to such investigations and actions. The Summer EBT agency must inform the appropriate FNSRO of any suspected fraud or criminal abuse in the Program which would result in a loss or misuse of Federal funds. The Department may make
investigations at the request of the Summer EBT agency, or where the Department determines investigations are appropriate.
§ 292.26
Hearing procedure for families and Summer EBT agencies.
(a) Each Summer EBT agency must establish a fair hearing procedure that is applicable to the State or ITO program as a whole. Fair hearing procedures must:
(1) Allow a household to appeal, within 90 days after the end of the summer operational period, a decision made with respect to:
(i)(A) An application the household has made for Summer EBT benefits;
(B) A streamlined certification for Summer EBT benefits; or
(C) A verification process or procedure.
(ii) Any adverse action taken against the household by the Summer EBT agency.
(2) Require the State to provide a household with back-benefits for Summer EBT if the fair hearing determines that the Summer EBT agency erroneously failed to issue such benefits in the correct amount to an eligible family, an administrative disqualification for intentional Program violation was subsequently reversed, or if there is a statement elsewhere in this part specifically stating that the household is entitled to restoration of lost benefits.
(b) In response to an appeal, the Summer EBT agency may defend its initial decision to deny the eligibility of the child for Summer EBT benefits or take an adverse action against a household. The fair hearing procedure must provide for both the household and the Summer EBT agency:
(1) A simple, publicly announced method to make an oral or written request for a hearing;
(2) An opportunity to be assisted or represented by an attorney or other person;
(3) An opportunity to examine, prior to and during the hearing, any documents and records presented to support the decision under appeal;
(4) That the hearing must be held with reasonable promptness and convenience, and that adequate notice must be given as to the time and place of the hearing;
(5) An opportunity to present oral or documentary evidence and arguments supporting a position without undue interference;
(6) An opportunity to question or refute any testimony or other evidence and to confront and cross-examine any adverse witnesses;
(7) That the hearing must be conducted and the decision made by a hearing official who did not participate in making the decision under appeal or in any previously held conference;
(8) That the decision of the hearing official must be based on the oral and documentary evidence presented at the hearing and made a part of the hearing record;
(9) That the parties concerned and any designated representative must be notified in writing of the decision of the hearing official;
(10) That a written record must be prepared with respect to each hearing, which must include the challenge or the decision under appeal, any documentary evidence and a summary of any oral testimony presented at the hearing, the decision of the hearing official, including the reasons therefor, and a copy of the notification to the parties concerned of the decision of the hearing official; and
(11) That the written record of each hearing must be preserved for a period of 3 years and must be available for examination by the parties concerned or their representatives at any reasonable time and place during that period.
(12) That the household may request a conference to provide the opportunity for the household to discuss the situation, present information, and obtain an explanation of the data submitted in the application or the decision rendered. The request for a conference must not in any way prejudice or diminish the right to a fair hearing. The Summer EBT agency must promptly schedule a fair hearing, if requested.
(13) Any communication with households related to fair hearings must be in an understandable and uniform format and, to the maximum extent practicable, in a language that parents and guardians can understand.
§ 292.27
Claims.
(a)
Basis for claims.
Summer EBT agencies are responsible to ensure that program benefits are provided only to eligible children and in the correct amount in accordance with program regulations in this part. Erroneous issuances include, but are not limited to:
(1) Benefits issued to ineligible children or in the incorrect amount.
(2) Duplicate benefit issuances, including situations where the Summer EBT agency allows an eligible household to access more than one Summer EBT account for the same time period, or an eligible household receives program benefits from more than one State or ITO for the same time period.
(b)
Claims against Summer EBT agencies.
(1) USDA may hold Summer EBT agencies liable for erroneous payments. USDA may pursue erroneous claims in the aggregate when merited, based on the nature of the error that gave rise to the over-issuance, the size of the error, and whether such action would advance program purposes.
(2) Summer EBT agencies must develop a process to allow households to submit a claim for benefits that were not issued or issued in the incorrect amount.
(c)
Claims against households.
(1) Summer EBT agencies must develop a process to manage cases of erroneous issuances and pursue claims against a household, as appropriate.
(2) Summer EBT agencies have the discretion to determine when to pursue a claim based on cost effectiveness or the individual circumstances. To the maximum extent practicable, Summer EBT agencies should limit claims against households to situations where there is evidence that the household knowingly obtained benefits through fraudulent activities.
(i) Summer EBT agencies must include in their POM submission a proposed plan for identifying instances of fraudulent activity for use in pursuing claims against households.
(ii) Procedures described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section must outline steps the Summer EBT agency will take to ensure that Civil Rights provision at § 292.29(a) are upheld.
(3) Summer EBT agencies must not reclaim Summer EBT benefits by reducing a household's SNAP, NAP, or WIC benefit.
§ 292.28
Procurement standards.
(a)
Applicability of the Advance Planning Document (APD) process.
If an EBT services contract established for the purpose of benefit issuance includes Summer EBT, the State Systems Advance Planning Document (APD) process must be followed in accordance with § 292.11(b)(3) for States and § 292.11(u) for ITOs, respectively.
(b)
General requirements on the procurement of goods and services with Federal funds.
All other Summer EBT agency and local agency costs, including eligibility systems, must comply with the requirements of this part and 2 CFR part 200, subpart D, and USDA implementing regulations in 2 CFR parts 400 and 415, as applicable, which implement the applicable requirements concerning the procurement of all goods and services with Federal funds.
(c)
Contractual responsibilities.
The standards contained in this part and 2 CFR part 200, subpart D, and USDA implementing regulations in 2 CFR parts 400 and 415, as applicable, do not relieve any Summer EBT agency or local agency of any contractual responsibilities under its contracts. The Summer EBT agency or local agency is the responsible authority, without recourse to USDA, regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in connection with the Program. This includes, but is not limited to, source evaluation, protests, disputes, claims, or other matters of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of law are to be referred to the local, State, or Federal authority that has proper jurisdiction.
(d)
Procedures.
The Summer EBT agency must follow either the State or ITO laws, policies and procedures as authorized by 2 CFR 200.317, or the procurement standards for other governmental grantees and all governmental subgrantees in accordance with 2 CFR 200.318 through 200.326. Regardless of the option selected, Summer EBT agencies must ensure that all contracts include any clauses required by Federal
statutes and Executive orders and that the requirements in 2 CFR 200.236 and 2 CFR part 200, appendix II, are followed.
§ 292.29
Miscellaneous administrative provisions.
(a)
Civil rights.
In the operation of the Program, no child may be denied benefits or be otherwise discriminated against because of race, color, national origin, age, sex, or disability. Summer EBT agencies and LEAs must comply with the requirements of: Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972; section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; the Age Discrimination Act of 1975; and Department of Agriculture regulations on nondiscrimination (7 CFR parts 15, 15a, and 15b).
(b)
Program evaluations.
States, ITOs, Summer EBT agencies, LEAs, schools, and contractors must cooperate in studies and evaluations conducted by or on behalf of the Department related to programs authorized under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966.
(c)
General responsibilities.
The criminal penalties and provisions established in section 12(g) of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1760(g)) provide that whoever embezzles, willfully misapplies, steals, or obtains by fraud any funds, assets, or property that are the subject of a grant or other form of assistance under the Act or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771
et seq.
), whether received directly or indirectly from the United States Department of Agriculture, or whoever receives, conceals, or retains such funds, assets, or property to personal use or gain, knowing such funds, assets, or property have been embezzled, willfully misapplied, stolen, or obtained by fraud must, if such funds, assets, or property are of the value of $100 or more, be fined not more than $25,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both, or, if such funds, assets, or property are of a value of less than $100, must be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.
§ 292.30
Severability.
Any provision of this part held to be invalid or unenforceable as applied to any person or circumstance shall be construed so as to continue to give the maximum effect to the provision permitted by law, including as applied to persons not similarly situated or to dissimilar circumstances, unless such holding is that the provision of this part is invalid and unenforceable in all circumstances, in which event the provision shall be severable from the remainder of this part and shall not affect the remainder thereof.
