(B) The basis of the distributed U.S. real property interest in the hands of the distributee is no greater than the adjusted basis of such property before the distribution, increased by the amount of gain (if any) recognized by the distributing corporation upon the distribution and added to the adjusted basis under the otherwise applicable provisions; and
(C) The distributing corporation complies with the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Section 332 liquidations
—(A)
In general.
A distributing foreign corporation that meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(i) in a section 332(a) liquidation shall not recognize gain on the distribution of U.S. real property interests to a foreign corporation meeting the stock ownership requirements of section 332(b) if the distributing corporation complies with the procedural requirements of paragraph
(d)(1)(iii). Whether a foreign corporation recognizes gain on the distribution of U.S. real property interests to a U.S. corporation meeting the stock ownership requirements of section 332(b) depends upon whether the U.S. corporation satisfies the subject to tax requirement provided in paragraph (d)(1)(i) (in addition to the procedural requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii)). With respect to section 332 distributions by a foreign corporation occurring after July 31, 1986, section 367(e)(2) shall not affect the application of section 337(a) (as in effect after the Tax Reform Act of 1986) and paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section to the distribution of a U.S. real property interest.
(B)
Recognition of gain required in certain section 332 liquidations.
Notwithstanding the other rules of this paragraph (c), a foreign corporation shall, pursuant to the authority conferred by section 897(e)(2), recognize gain on its distribution after May 5, 1988 of a U.S. real property interest to a domestic corporation meeting the stock ownership requirements of section 332(b) if—
(
1
) The foreign corporation has not made an election under section 897(i), and any gain on the stock in the foreign corporation would be subject to U.S. taxation if an election were made on the date of the liquidation; and
(
2
) The distribution of the U.S. real property interest by the foreign corporation to the domestic corporation pursuant to section 332(a) occurs less than five years after the date of the last gain from the disposition of stock of the foreign corporation that would be subject to payment of tax under § 1.897-3(d)(2)(i) if an election under section 897(i) were made by the foreign corporation on the date of its liquidation.
With regard to the treatment of certain foreign corporations as domestic corporations under section 897(i), however, see §§ 1.897-3 and 1.897-8T.
(iii)
Examples.
The rules of this paragraph (c)(2) may be illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
(i) DC, a domestic corporation, owns 100 percent of the stock of FC, a Country F corporation, FC's only asset is Parcel P, a U.S. real property interest, with a fair market value of $500x and an adjusted basis of $100x. In September 1987, FC liquidates under section 332(a) and transfers Parcel P to DC. The transitional rules contained in section 633 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 concerning the repeal of the
General Utilities
doctrine would not be applicable to a subsequent distribution or disposition of assets by DC.
(ii) Assume that FC complies with the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii). DC will be subject to U.S. income taxation on a subsequent disposition of Parcel P under the rules of paragraph (d)(1). The basis of Parcel P in the hands of DC will be $100x under section 334(b)(1), and thus no greater than the basis of Parcel P in the hands of FC. FC does not recognize any gain under the rules of paragraph (c)(1) of this section on the distribution because the exception of paragraph (d)(2)(i) applies.

# Example 2.
If in
Example
(1) the distribution by FC to DC occurred in September 1985, and DC sold or exchanged Parcel P under sections 336(a) or 337(a) as in effect prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, then FC must recognize gain of $400x on the distribution of Parcel P. The gain must be recognized because Parcel P in the hands of DC is not considered subject to U.S. income taxation on a subsequent disposition under the rules of paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(3)
Limitation of gain recognized under paragraph (c)(1) of this section for certain section 355 distributions
—(i)
In general.
Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a foreign corporation that distributes stock in a domestic corporation that constitutes a U.S. real property interest in a distribution to which section 355 applies shall recognize gain on the distribution to the extent that the fair market value of the distributed stock exceeds its adjusted basis in the hands of the distributing foreign corporation. The gain recognized shall be limited under this paragraph (c)(3), however, to the amount by which the aggregate basis of the distributed stock in the hands of the distributees exceeds the aggregate adjusted basis of the distributed stock in the hands of the distributing corporation. The distributees' basis in the distributed U.S. real property interest shall be determined under the otherwise applicable provisions of section 358. (Thus, the distributees' basis in the distributed U.S. real property interest shall be determined without any increase for any gain recognized by the foreign corporation).
(ii)
Example.
The rules of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section may be illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
(i) C is a citizen and resident of Country F. C owns all of the stock of FC, a Country F corporation. The fair market value of the FC stock is 1000x, and C has a basis of 600x in the FC stock. Country F does not have an income tax treaty with the United States.
(ii) In a transaction qualifying as a distribution of stock of a controlled corporation under section 355(a), FC distributes to C all of the stock of DC, a U.S. real property holding corporation. C does not surrender any of the FC stock. The DC stock has a fair market value of 600x, and FC has an adjusted basis of 200x in the DC stock. After the distribution, the FC stock has a fair market value of 400x.
(iii) Under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, FC must recognize gain on the distribution of the DC stock to C equal to the difference between the fair market value of the DC stock (600x) and FC's adjusted basis in the DC stock (200x). This results in a potential gain of 400x. Under section 358, C takes a 360x adjusted basis in the DC stock. Provided that FC complies with the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, the gain recognized by FC is limited under paragraph (c)(3)(i) to 160x because (A) this is the amount by which the basis of the DC stock in the hands of C (360x) exceeds the adjusted basis of the DC stock in the hands of FC (200x), and (B) at the time of receipt of the DC stock, C would be subject to U.S. taxation on a subsequent disposition of the stock.
(iv) C's adjusted basis in the DC stock is not increased by the 160x recognized by FC.
(4)
Distribution by a foreign corporation in certain reorganizations
—(i)
In general.
Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a foreign corporation that transfers property to another corporation in an exchange under section 361(a) for stock of a domestic corporation which is a United States real property holding corporation immediately after the transfer in a reorganization under section 368(a)(1) (C), (D), or (F) shall recognize gain under section 897(d)(1) on the distribution (whether actual or deemed) of the stock of the domestic corporation received by the foreign corporation to its shareholders (whether domestic or foreign). See § 1.897-6T(a) of the regulations for the consequences to the foreign corporation of the exchange of its property for the domestic corporation stock.
(ii)
Statutory exception.
Pursuant to the exception provided in section 897(d)(2)(A), no gain shall be recognized by the foreign corporation on its distribution of the domestic corporation stock if—
(A) At the time of the distribution, the distributee (
i.e.,
the exchanging shareholder in the section 354 exchange) would be subject to U.S. taxation on a subsequent disposition of the stock of the domestic corporation, determined in accordance with the rules of paragraph (d)(1) of this section;
(B) The distributee's adjusted basis in the stock of the foreign corporation immediately before the distribution was no greater than the foreign corporation's basis in the stock of the domestic corporation determined under section 358; and
(C) The distributing corporation complies with the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.
(iii)
Regulatory limitation on gain recognized.
If the requirements of subdivisions (A) and (C) of paragraph (c)(4)(ii) are met, the amount of any gain recognized by the foreign corporation shall not exceed the excess of the distributee's adjusted basis in the stock of the foreign corporation immediately before the distribution over the foreign corporation's basis in the stock of the domestic corporation immediately before the distribution as determined under section 358.
(iv)
Examples.
The rules of paragraph (c)(4) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
(i) A, a nonresident alien, organized FC, a Country W corporation, in September 1980 to invest in U.S. real estate. In 1986, FC's only asset is Parcel P, a U.S. real property interest with a fair market value of $600,000 and an adjusted basis to FC of $200,000. Parcel P is subject to a mortgage with an outstanding balance of $100,000. The fair market value of the FC stock is $500,000, and A's adjusted basis in the stock is $100,000. FC does not have liabilities in excess of the adjusted basis in Parcel P. The United States does not have a treaty with Country W that entitles FC to nondiscriminatory treatment as described in section 1.897-3(b)(2) of the regulations.
(ii) Pursuant to a plan of reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(D), FC transfers Parcel P to DC, a newly formed domestic corporation, in exchange for DC stock. FC distributes the DC stock to A in exchange for A's FC stock.
(iii) FC's exchange of Parcel P for the DC stock is a disposition of a U.S. real property
interest. Under § 1.897-6T(a)(1), there is an exchange of a U.S. real property interest (Parcel P) for another U.S. real property interest (DC stock) so that no gain is recognized on the exchange under section 897(e). DC takes FC's basis of $200,000 in Parcel P under section 362(b). Under section 358(a)(1), FC takes a $100,000 basis in the DC stock because FC's substituted basis of $200,000 in the DC stock is reduced by the $100,000 of liabilities to which Parcel P is subject.
(iv) Under section 897(d)(1) and paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, FC generally must recognize gain on the distribution of the DC stock received in exchange for FC's assets equal to the difference between the fair market value of the DC stock ($500,000) and FC's adjusted basis in the DC stock prior to the distribution ($100,000). This results in a potential gain of $400,000. Under section 358(a)(1), A takes a basis in the DC stock equal to its basis in the FC stock of $100,000. Provided that FC complies with the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, no gain is recognized by FC on the distribution of the DC stock under the statutory exception to the general rule of section 897(d)(1) provided in section 897(d)(2)(A) and paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section because (
1
) A's basis in the DC stock ($100,000) does not exceed FC's adjusted basis in the DC stock ($100,000) immediately prior to the distribution and (
2
) A, at the time of receipt of the DC stock, would be subject to U.S. taxation on a subsequent disposition of the stock.
(v) The FC stock in the hands of A is not a U.S. real property interest because FC is a foreign corporation that has not elected to be treated as a domestic corporation under section 897(i). Accordingly, the exchange of the FC stock by A for DC stock is not a disposition of a U.S. real property interest under section 897(a).

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that A purchased the FC stock in September 1983 for $100,000 from S, a nonresident alien, and that S had a basis of $40,000 in the FC stock at the time of the sale to A. The results are the same as in Example 1.

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example
1, except that A's adjusted basis in the FC stock prior to the reorganization is $300,000. Following the distribution, A takes its basis of $300,000 in the FC stock as its basis in the DC stock pursuant to section 358(a)(1).
(ii) FC does not qualify under the statutory exception of paragraph (c)(4)(ii) to the general recognition rule of section 897(d)(1) and paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section because A's basis in the DC stock ($300,000) exceeds FC's adjusted basis in the DC stock ($100,000) immediately prior to the distribution. However, provided that FC complies with the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, the gain recognized by FC is limited to $200,000 under the regulatory limitation of gain provided by paragraph (c)(4)(iii). This is the excess of A's basis in the FC stock immediately before the distribution ($300,000) over A's adjusted basis in the DC stock immediately before the distribution ($100,000).
(iii) A takes a basis of $300,000 in the DC stock under section 358(a)(1). A's basis in the DC stock is not increased by the gain recognized by FC. DC takes a basis of $200,000 in Parcel P under section 362(b).

# Example 4.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example
3, except that the United States has an income tax treaty with Country W entitling FC to nondiscriminatory treatment under section 1.897-3(b)(2) of the regulations. A valid election under section 897(i) is made to treat FC as a U.S. corporation.
(ii) FC is treated as a domestic corporation for purposes of section 897 and is not required to recognize gain under section 897(d)(1) and paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section on the distribution of the DC stock as described in
Example
3. (If a valid section 897(i) election were not made, the result would be same as in
Example
3.)
(iii) The FC stock in the hands of A is a U.S. real property interest because an election was made under section 897(i) to treat FC as a U.S. corporation. The exchange of the FC stock for DC stock by A is a disposition of a U.S. real property interest. Under section 897(e)(1) and paragraph (a) of § 1.897-6T, A does not recognize gain on the exchange because there is an exchange of a U.S. real property interest (the FC stock) for another U.S. real property interest (the DC stock). Under section 358(a)(1), A takes as its basis in the DC stock A's basis in the FC stock ($300,000).
(5)
Sales of U.S. real property interests by foreign corporations under section 337.
Section 337 as in effect prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 shall not apply to any sale or exchange (including a deemed section 337 sale pursuant to an election under section 338(a) to treat a stock purchase as an asset acquisition) of a U.S. real property interest by a foreign corporation.
(6)
Section 897(l) credit.
If a foreign corporation adopts a plan of complete liquidation and if, solely by reason of section 897(d) and this section, section 337(a) (as in effect before the Tax Reform Act of 1986) does not apply to sales or exchanges of, or section 336 (as in effect before the Tax Reform Act of 1986) does not apply to distributions of, United States real property interests by the liquidating corporation, then—
(i) The amount realized by the shareholder on the distribution shall be increased by its proportionate share of the amount by which the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code, as modified by the provisions of any applicable U.S. income tax treaty, on the liquidating corporation would have been reduced if section 897(d) and this section had not been applicable, and
(ii) For purposes of the Code, the shareholder shall be deemed to have paid, on the last day prescribed by law for the payment of the tax imposed by subtitle A of the Code on the shareholder for the taxable year, an amount of tax equal to the amount of increase in the amount realized described in subdivison (i) of this paragraph (c).
The special rule provided by this paragraph (c)(5) applies only to shareholders who are United States citizens or residents, and who have held stock in the liquidating corporation continuously since June 18, 1980. This special rule also only applies for the first taxable year of any such shareholder in which the shareholder receives a distribution in complete liquidation from the foreign corporation.
(7)
Other applicable rules.
For rules concerning exemption of gain pursuant to a U.S. income tax treaty, withholding of tax from distributions, and other applicable rules, see paragraph (d) of this section. For the treatment of liquidations described in section 334(b)(2)(A) of certain foreign corporations acquired before November 6, 1980, see § 1.897-4.
(d)
Rules of general application
—(1)
Interests subject to taxation upon later disposition
—(i)
In general.
Pursuant to the otherwise applicable rules of this section and § 1.897-6T, nonrecognition of gain or loss may apply with respect to certain distribution or exchanges of U.S. real property interests if any gain from a subsequent disposition of the interests that are distributed or received by the transferor in the exchange would be included in the gross income of the distributee or transferor and be subject to U.S. taxation. Gain is considered subject to U.S. taxation if the gain is included on the income tax return of a U.S. tax paying entity even if there is no U.S. tax liability (for example, because of net operating losses or an investment tax credit). Gain is not considered subject to U.S. taxation if the gain is derived by a tax exempt entity. A real estate investment trust is considered to be a pass-through entity for purposes of the rule of taxability of this paragraph (d)(1)(i). Thus, for example, a tax exempt entity holding an interest in a real estate investment trust is not subject to tax. A domestic corporation (including a foreign corporation that makes an effective section 897(i) election after receipt of the U.S. real property interest) shall not be considered subject to U.S. taxation on a subsequent disposition of a U.S. real property interest if it received the U.S. real property interest prior to the effective date of the repeal of section 336(a) or 337(a) as in effect prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, unless the U.S. real property interest has not been sold or exchanged by the domestic corporation prior to such effective date in a transaction to which either section 336(a) or section 337(a) (as in effect prior to such effective date) applied. In addition, an interest shall be considered to be subject to U.S. taxation upon its subsequent disposition only if the requirements set forth in subdivision (iii) of this paragraph (d)(1) are met.
(ii)
Effects of income tax treaties
—(A)
Effect of treaty exemption from tax.
Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (C) of this paragraph (d)(1)(ii), a U.S. real property interest shall not be considered to be subject to U.S. taxation upon a subsequent disposition if, at the time of its distribution or exchange, the recipient is entitled pursuant to the provisions of a U.S. income tax treaty to an exemption from U.S. taxation upon a disposition of the interest.
(B)
Effect of treaty reduction of tax.
If, at the time of a distribution or exchange, a distributee of a U.S. real property interest in a distribution or a transferor who receives a U.S. real property interest in an exchange would be entitled pursuant to the provisions of a U.S. income tax treaty to reduced U.S. taxation upon the disposition of the interest, then a portion of the interest received shall be treated as an interest subject to U.S. taxation upon its disposition, and, therefore, that
portion shall be entitled to nonrecognition treatment under the rules of this section or § 1.897-6T. The portion of the interest that is treated as subject to U.S. taxation is determined by multiplying the fair market value of the interest by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the amount of tax that would be due pursuant to the provisions of the applicable U.S. income tax treaty upon the recipient's disposition of the interest, determined as of the date of the distribution or transfer. The denominator of the fraction is the amount of tax that would be due upon such disposition but for the provisions of the treaty. However, nonrecognition treatment may be preserved in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (C) of this paragraph (d)(1)(ii). With regard to the provisions of this paragraph, see Article XIII (9) of the United States-Canada Income Tax Convention.
(C)
Waiver of treaty benefits to preserve nonrecognition.
Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions (A) and (B) of this paragraph (d)(1)(ii), an interest shall be considered to be subject to U.S. taxation upon its subsequent disposition if, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(F) of this section, the recipient waives the benefits of a U.S. income tax treaty that would otherwise entitle the recipient to an exemption from (or reduction of) U.S. tax upon a disposition of the interest.
(iii)
Procedural requirements.
If a U.S. real property interest is distributed or transferred after December 31, 1987, the transferor or distributor (that is a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation) shall file an income tax return for the taxable year of the distribution or transfer. Also, if a U.S. real property interest is distributed or transferred in a transaction before January 1, 1988, with respect to which nonrecognition treatment would not have been available under the express provisions of section 897 (d) or (e) of the Code but is available under the provisions of this section or § 1.897-6T, then the person that would otherwise be subject to tax by reason of the operation of section 897 must file an income tax return for the taxable year of the distribution or transfer. This requirement is satisfied by filing a tax return or an amended tax return for the year of the distribution or transfer by May 5, 1989, or by the date that the filing of the return is otherwise required. The person filing the return must attach thereto a document setting forth the following:
(A) A statement that the distribution or transfer is one to which section 897 applies;
(B) A description of the U.S. real property interest distributed or transferred, including its location, its adjusted basis in the hands of the distributor or tranferor immediately before the distribution or transfer, and the date of the distribution or transfer;
(C) A description of the U.S. real property interest received in an exchange;
(D) A declaration signed by an officer of the corporation that the distributing foreign corporation has substantiated the adjusted basis of the shareholder in its stock if the distributing corporation has nonrecognition or recognition limitation under paragraph (c) (3) or (4) of this section;
(E) The amount of any gain recognized and tax withheld by any person with respect to the distribution or transfer;
(F) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.897-5(d)(1)(iii)(F).
(G) The treaty and article (if any) under which the distributee or transferor would be exempt from U.S. taxation on a sale of the distributed U.S. real property interest or the U.S. real property interest received in the transfer; and
(H) A declaration, signed by the distributee or transferor or its authorized legal representative, that the distributee or transferor shall treat any subsequent sale, exchange, or other disposition of the U.S. real property interest as a disposition that is subject to U.S. taxation, notwithstanding the provisions of any U.S. income tax treaty or intervening change in circumstances.
A person who has provided or filed a notice described in § 1.1445-2(d)(2)(iii) or § 1.1445-5(b)(2)(ii) in connection with a transaction may satisfy the requirement of this paragraph (d)(1)(iii) by attaching to his return a copy of that notice together with any information or
declaration required by this subdivision not contained in that notice.
(2)
Treaty exception to imposition of tax.
If gain that would be currently recognized pursuant to the provisions of this section or § 1.897-6T is subject to an exemption from (or reduction of) U.S. tax pursuant to a U.S. income tax treaty, then gain shall be recognized only as provided by that treaty, for dispositions occurring before January 1, 1985. For dispositions occurring after December 31, 1984, all gain shall be recognized as provided in section 897 and the regulations thereunder, except as provided by Articles XIII (9) and XXX (5) of the United States-Canada Income Tax Convention or other income tax treaty entered into force after June 6, 1988.
With regard to Article XXX (5) of the Income Tax Treaty with Canada, see, Rev. Rul. 85-76, 1985-1 C.B. 409. With regard to basis adjustments for certain related person transactions, see, § 1.897-6T(c)(3).
(3)
Withholding.
Under sections 1441 and 1442, as modified by the provisions of any applicable U.S. income tax treaty, a corporation must withhold tax from a dividend distribution to which section 301 applies to a shareholder that is a foreign person, if the dividend is considered to be from sources inside the United States. For a description of dividends that are considered to be from sources inside the United States, see section 861(a)(2). Under section 1445, withholding is required with respect to certain dispositions and distributions of U.S. real property interests.
(4)
Effect on earnings and profits.
With respect to adjustments to earnings and profits for gain recognized to a distributing corporation on a distribution, see section 312 and the regulations thereunder.
(e)
Effective date.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in the text of these regulations, this section shall be effective for transfers, exchanges, distributions and other dispositions occurring after June 18, 1980.
[T.D. 8198, 53 FR 16217, May 5, 1988; 53 FR 18022, May 19, 1988; T.D. 9082, 68 FR 46084, Aug. 5, 2003]
§ 1.897-6T
Nonrecognition exchanges applicable to corporations, their shareholders, and other taxpayers, and certain transfers of property in corporate reorganizations (temporary).
(a)
Nonrecognition exchanges
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this section and in § 1.897-5T, for purposes of section 897(e) any nonrecognition provision shall apply to a transfer by a foreign person of a U.S. real property interest on which gain is realized only to the extent that the transferred U.S. real property interest is exchanged for a U.S. real property interest which, immediately following the exchange, would be subject to U.S. taxation upon its disposition, and the transferor complies with the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of § 1.897-5T. No loss shall be recognized pursuant to section 897(e) or the rules of this section unless such loss is otherwise permitted to be recognized. In the case of an exchange of a U.S. real property interest for stock in a domestic corporation (that is otherwise treated as a U.S. real property interest), such stock shall not be considered a U.S. real property interest unless the domestic corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation immediately after the exchange. Whether an interest would be subject to U.S. taxation in the hands of the transferor upon its disposition shall be determined in accordance with the rules of § 1.897-5T(d)(1).
(2)
Definition of “nonrecognition” provision.
A “nonrecognition provision” is any provision of the Code which provides that gain or loss shall not be recognized if the requirements of that provision are met. Nonrecognition provisions relevant to this section include, but are not limited to, sections 332, 351, 354, 355, 361, 721, 731, 1031, 1033, and 1036. For purposes of section 897(e), sections 121 and 453 are not nonrecognition provisions.
(3)
Consequence of nonapplication of nonrecognition provisions.
If a nonrecognition provision does not apply to a transaction, then the U.S. real property interest transferred shall be considered exchanged pursuant to a transaction that is subject to U.S. taxation by reason of the operation of section
897. See, however, § 1.897-5T (d)(2) with respect to the treaty exceptions to the imposition of tax. If a U.S. real property interest is exchanged for an interest the disposition of which is only partially subject to taxation under chapter 1 of the Code (as modified by the provisions of any applicable U.S. income tax treaty), then any nonrecognition provision shall apply only to the extent that the interest received in the exchange would be subject to taxation under chapter 1 of the Code, as modified. For example, the exchange of a U.S. real property interest for an interest in a partnership will receive nonrecognition treatment pursuant to section 721 only to the extent that a disposition of the partnership interest will be subject to U.S. taxation by reason of the operation of section 897(g).
(4)
Section 355 distributions treated as exchanges.
If a domestic corporation, stock in which is treated as a U.S. real property interest, distributes stock in a foreign corporation or stock in a domestic corporation that is not a U.S. real property holding corporation to a foreign person under section 355(a), then the foreign person shall be considered as having exchanged a proportionate part of the stock in the domestic corporation that is treated as a U.S. real property interest for stock that is not treated as a U.S. real property interest.
(5) [Reserved]
(6)
Determination of basis.
If a nonrecognition provision applies to the transfer of a U.S. real property interest pursuant to the provisions of this section, then the basis of the property received in the exchange shall be determined in accordance with the rules generally applicable with respect to such nonrecognition provision. Similarly, the basis of the exchanged property in the hands of the transferee shall be determined in accordance with the rules that generally apply to such transfer.
(7)
Examples.
The rules of paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples. In each instance, the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of § 1.897-5T have been satisfied.

# Example 1.
(i) A is a citizen and resident of Country F with which the U.S. does not have an income tax treaty. A owns Parcel P, a U.S. real property interest, with a fair market value of $500,000 and an adjusted basis of $300,000. A transfers Parcel P to DC, a newly formed U.S. real property holding corporation wholly owned by A, in exchange for DC stock.
(ii) Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, A has exchanged a U.S. real property interest (Parcel P) for another U.S. real property interest (DC stock) which is subject to U.S. taxation upon its disposition. The nonrecognition provisions of section 351(a) apply to A's transfer of Parcel P.
(iii) Under paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the basis of the DC stock received by A is determined in accordance with the rules generally applicable to the transfer. A takes a $300,000 adjusted basis in the DC stock under the rules of section 358(a)(1).

# Examples 2-3.
[Reserved]

# Example 4.
(i) B is a citizen and resident of Country F with which the U.S. does not have an income tax treaty. B owns stock in DC1, a U.S. real property holding corporation. In a reorganization qualifying for nonrecognition under section 368(a)(1)(B), B exchanges the DC1 stock under section 354(a) for stock in DC2, a U.S. real property holding corporation.
(ii) A does not recognize any gain under paragraph (a)(1) of this section on the exchange of the DC1 stock for DC2 stock because there is an exchange of a U.S. real property interest (the DC1 stock) for another U.S. real property interest (the DC2 stock) which is subject to U.S. taxation upon its disposition.

# Example 5.
(i) C is a citizen and resident of Country F with which the U.S. does not have an income tax treaty. C owns all of the stock of DC, a U.S. real property holding corporation. The fair market value of the DC stock is 500x, and C has a basis of 100x in the DC stock.
(ii) In a transaction qualifying as a distribution of stock of a controlled corporation under section 355(a), DC distributes to C all of the stock of FC, a foreign corporation that has not made a section 897(i) election. C does not surrender any of the DC stock. The FC stock has a fair market value of 200x. After the distribution, the DC stock has a fair market value of 300x.
(iii) Under the rules of paragraph (a)(4) of this section, C is considered to have exchanged DC stock with a fair market value of 200x and an adjusted basis of 40x for FC stock with a fair market value of 200x. Because the FC stock is not a U.S. real property interest, C must recognize gain of 160x under section 897(a) on the distribution. C takes a basis of 200x in the FC stock. C's basis in the DC stock is reduced to 60x pursuant to section 358(c).

# Example.
(i) A is an individual citizen and resident of Country F. F has an income tax
treaty with the United States that exempts gain from the sale of stock, but not real property, by a resident of F from U.S. taxation. In 1981, A transferred Parcel P, an appreciated U.S. real property interest, to DC, a U.S. real property holding corporation, in exchange for DC stock. A owned all of the stock of DC.
(ii) Under the rules of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, A must recognize gain on the transfer of Parcel P. Even though there is an exchange of a U.S. real property interest for another U.S. real property interest, there is gain recognition because the U.S. real property interest received (the DC stock) would not have been subject to U.S. taxation upon a disposition immediately following the exchange. A may not convert a U.S. real property interest that was subject to taxation under section 897 into a U.S. real property interest that could be sold without taxation under section 897 due to a treaty exemption.

# Example 7.
(i) A, a nonresident alien, organized FC1, a Country W corporation in September 1980 to invest in U.S. real property. FC1's only asset is Parcel P, a U.S. real property interest with a fair market value of $500,000 and an adjusted basis of $200,000. The FCI stock has a fair market value of $500,000 and A's basis in the FC1 stock is $100,000. The United States does not have a treaty with Country W.
(ii) A, organized FC2, a Country W corporation in July 1987. FC2 organized DC in August 1987. Pursuant to a plan of reorganization under section 368 (a)(1)(C), FC1 transfers Parcel P to DC in exchange for FC2 voting stock. As a result of the transfer, DC is a U.S. real property holding corporation wholly owned by FC2. The FC2 stock used by DC in the acquisition had been transferred by FC2 to DC as part of the plan of reorganization. FC1 distributes the FC2 stock to A in exchange for A's FC1 stock.
(iii) FC1's exchange of Parcel P for the FC2 stock under section 361(a) is a disposition of a U.S. real property interest. FC1 must recognize gain of $300,000 under section 897(e) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section on the exchange because the FC2 stock received in exchange for Parcel P is not a U.S. real property interest.
(iv) Under section 362(b), DC takes a basis of $500,000 in Parcel P. FC2 takes a basis of $500,000 in the DC stock. A takes a basis of $100,000 in the FC2 stock under section 358(a)(1). Section 897(d) and paragraph (c)(1) of § 1.897-5T do not apply to FC1's distribution of the FC2 stock because the FC2 stock is not a U.S. real property interest.

# Example 8.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 7,
except that the United States has a treaty with Country W that entitles FC1 and FC2 to nondiscriminatory treatment as described in § 1.897-3(b)(2). FC1, but not FC2, makes a valid section 897(i) election prior to the transaction.
(ii) FC1's transfer of Parcel P to DC in exchange for FC2 stock is not subject to section 897(e) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section because FC1 made an election under section 897(i). DC takes a basis of $200,000 in Parcel P under section 362(b).
(iii) FC1's distribution of the FC2 stock to A in exchange for the FC1 stock is not subject to the section 897(d) and paragraph (c)(1) of § 1.897-5T because FC1 made an election under section 897(i).
(iv) A must recognize gain on the exchange under section 354(a) of the FC1 stock for the FC2 stock. A exchanged a U.S. real property interest (the FC1 stock) for an interest which is not a U.S. real property interest (the FC2 stock). A recognizes gain of $400,000. Under section 1012, A takes a $500,000 basis in the FC2 stock.

# Example 9.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 7
except that the United States has a treaty with Country W that entitles FC1 and FC2 to nondiscriminatory treatment as described in § 1.897-3(b)(2). FC2, but not FC1, makes a valid section 897(i) election prior to the transaction.
(ii) FC1's exchange of Parcel P for the FC2 stock under section 361(a) is a disposition of a U.S. real property interest. FC1 does not recognize any gain under section 897(e) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section because there is an exchange of a U.S. real property interest (Parcel P) for another U.S. real property interest (the FC2 stock). DC takes a basis of $200,000 in Parcel P under section 362(b). FC2 takes a basis of $200,000 in the DC stock.
(iii) FC1's distribution of the FC2 stock to A in exchange for the FC1 stock is subject to section 897(d) and paragraph (c)(1) of § 1.897-5T. Because A takes a basis of $100,000 in the FC2 stock under section 358(a) (which is less than the $200,000 basis of the FC2 stock in the hands of FC1), and A would be subject to U.S. taxation under section 897(a) on a subsequent disposition of the FC2 stock, FC1 does not recognize any gain under paragraph (c)(1) of § 1.897-5T due to the statutory exception of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of that section, provided that FC1 complies with the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(C) of § 1.897-5T.
(iv) Since, the FC1 stock was not a U.S. real property interest, its disposition by A in the section 354(a) exchange for FC2 stock is not subject to section 897(e) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

# Example 10.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 7,
except that the United States has a treaty with Country W that entitles FC1 and FC2 to nondiscriminatory treatment as described in § 1.897-3(b)(2). FC1 and FC2 made valid section 897(i) elections prior to the transactions.
(ii) FC1's transfer of Parcel P to DC in exchange for FC2 stock is not subject to section 897(e) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section because FC1 made an election under section 897(i). DC takes a basis of $200,000 in
Parcel P under section 362(a). FC2 takes a basis of $200,000 in the DC stock.
(iii) FC1's distribution of the FC2 stock to A in exchange for the FC1 stock is not subject to section 897(d) and paragraph (c)(1) of § 1.897-5T because FC1 made an election under section 897(i).
(iv) A does not recognize any gain on the exchange of the FC1 stock for the FC2 stock under section 354(a). Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, there is an exchange of a U.S. real property interest (FC1 stock) for another U.S. real property interest (FC2 stock). A takes a basis of $100,000 in the FC2 stock under section 358(a).
(8)
Treatment of nonqualifying property
—(i)
In general.
If, under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a nonrecognition provision would apply to an exchange but for the fact that nonqualifying property (cash or property other than U.S. real property interests) is received in addition to property (U.S. real property interests) that is permitted to be received under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, then the transferor shall recognize gain under this section equal to the lesser of—
(A) The sum of the cash received plus the fair market value of the nonqualifying property received, or
(B) The gain realized with respect to the U.S. real property interest transferred. However, no loss shall be recognized pursuant to this paragraph (a)(8) unless such loss is otherwise permitted to be recognized.
(ii)
Treatment of mixed exchanges.
In a mixed exchange where both a U.S. real property interest and other property (including cash) is transferred in exchange both for property the receipt of which would qualify for nonrecognition treatment pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section and for other property (including cash) which would not so qualify, the transferor will recognize gain in accordance with the rules set forth in subdivisions (A) through (C) of this paragraph (a)(8)(ii).
(A)
Allocation of nonqualifying property.
The amount of nonqualifying property (including cash) considered to be received in exchange for U.S. real property interests shall be determined by multiplying the fair market value of the nonqualifying property received by a fraction (“real property fraction”). The numerator of the fraction is the fair market value of the U.S. real property interest transferred in the exchange. The denominator of the fraction is the fair market value of all property transferred in the exchange.
(B)
Recognition of gain.
The amount of gain that must be recognized, and that shall be subject to U.S. taxation by reason of the operation of section 897, shall be equal to the lesser of:
(
1
) The amount determined under subdivision (A) of this paragraph (a)(8)(ii), or
(
2
) The gain or loss realized with respect to the U.S. real property interest exchanged.
(C)
Treatment of other amounts.
The treatment of other amounts received in a mixed exchange shall be determined as follows:
(
1
) The amount of nonqualifying property (including cash) considered to be received in exchange for property (including cash) other than U.S. real property interests shall be treated in the manner provided in the relevant nonrecognition provision. Such amounts shall be determined by subtracting the amount determined under subdivision (A) of this paragraph (a)(8)(ii) from the total amount of nonqualifying property received in the exchange.
(
2
) The amount of qualifying property considered to be received in exchange for U.S. real property interests shall be treated in the manner provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Such amount shall be determined by multiplying the total fair market value of qualifying property received in the exchange by the real property fraction described in subdivision (A) of this paragraph (a)(8)(ii).
(
3
) The amount of qualifying property considered to be received in exchange for property other than U.S. real property interests shall be treated in the manner provided in the relevant nonrecognition provision. Such amount shall be determined by subtracting the amount determined under subdivision (
2
) of this paragraph (a)(8)(ii)(C) from the total fair market value of qualifying property received in the exchange.
(iii)
Example.
The rules of paragraph (a)(8)(ii) of this section may be illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
(i) A is an individual citizen and resident of country F. Country F does not have an income tax treaty with the United States. A is the sole proprietor of a business located in the United States, the assets of which consist of a U.S. real property interest with a fair market value of $1,000,000 and an adjusted basis of $700,000, and equipment used in the business with a fair market value of $500,000 and an adjusted basis of $250,000. A decides to incorporate the business, and on January 1, 1987, A transfers his assets to domestic corporation DC in exchange for 100 percent of the stock of DC, with a fair market value of $900,000. In addition, A receives a long term note (constituting a security) from DC for $600,000, bearing arm's length interest and repayment terms. DC has no assets other than those received in the exchange with A. Pursuant to section 897(c)(2) and § 1.897-2, DC is a U.S. real property holding corporation. Therefore, the stock of DC is a U.S. real property interest. Assume that the note from DC constitutes an interest in the corporation solely as a creditor as provided by § 1.897-1(d)(4) of the regulation. A complies with the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of § 1.897-5T.
(ii) Because the note from DC would not be subject to U.S. taxation upon its disposition, it is nonqualifying property for purposes of determining whether A is entitled to receive nonrecognition treatment pursuant to section 351 with respect to his exchange of the U.S. real property interest. Thus, A must recognize gain in the manner provided in paragraph (a)(8)(ii) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(8)(ii)(A), the amount of nonqualifying property received in exchange for the real property interests is determined by multiplying the fair market value of such property ($600,000) by the real property fraction. The numerator of the fraction is $1,000,000, the fair market value of the real property transferred by A. The denominator is $1,500,000, the fair market value of all property transferred by A. Thus, A is considered to have received $400,000 of the note in exchange for the real property ($600,000 × $1,000,000/$1,500,000). Pursuant to paragraph (a)(8)(ii)(B), A must recognize the lesser of the amount initially determined or the gain realized with respect to the U.S. real property interest. Therefore, A must recognize the $300,000 gain realized with respect to the real property.
(iii) Pursuant to paragraph (a)(8)(ii)(C) of this section, A is considered to have received $200,000 of the note in exchange for equipment ($600,000 [total value of note received] minus $400,000 [portion of note received in exchange for real property]), $600,000 of the stock in exchange for real property ($900,000 [total value of stock received] times $1,000,000/1,500,000) [proportion of property exchanged consisting of real property]), and $300,000 of the stock in exchange for equipment ($900,000 [total value of stock received] minus $600,000 [portion of stock received in exchange for real property]). All three amounts are entitled to nonrecognition treatment pursuant to section 351.
(iv) Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, A's basis in the stock and note received and DC's basis in the U.S. real property interest and equipment will be determined in accordance with the generally applicable rules. The $400,000 portion of the note received in exchange for the real property interest is other property. Pursuant to section 358(a)(2), A takes a fair market value ($400,000) basis for that portion of the note. Pursuant to section 358(a)(1), A's basis in the property received without the recognition of gain (the DC stock and the other portion of the note) will be equal to the basis of the property transferred ($950,000 [$700,000 basis of U.S. real property interest plus $250,000 basis of equipment]), decreased by the fair market value of the other property received ($400,000 portion of the note), and increased by the amount of gain recognized to A on the transaction ($300,000). Thus, A's basis in the stock and the nonrecognition portion of the note is $850,000 ($950,000-$400,000 + $300,000). Under § 1.358-2(b)(2) of the regulations, the $850,000 is allocated between the stock and the nonrecognition portion of the note in proportion to their fair market values. A takes a basis of $697,000 in the DC stock ($850,000 × 900,000/1,100,000). A takes a basis of $153,000 in the nonrecognition portion of the note ($850,000 × 200,000/1,100,000). A's basis in the note is $553,000 ($400,000 + $153,000). DC's basis in the property received from A will be determined under section 362(a). DC takes a basis of $1,000,000 in the real property interest (A's basis of $700,000 increased by the $300,000 of gain recognized by A on it). DC takes a basis of $250,000 in the equipment (A's basis of $250,000).
(9)
Treaty exception to imposition of tax.
If gain that would be currently recognized pursuant to the provisions of this section is subject to an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. tax pursuant to a U.S. income tax treaty, then gain shall be recognized only as provided by that treaty for dispositions occurring before January 1, 1985. For dispositions occurring after December 31, 1984, all gain shall be recognized as provided in section 897 and the regulations thereunder, except as provided by Articles XII (9) and XXX (5) of the United States-Canada Income Tax Convention or other income tax treaty entered into after June 6, 1988. In regard to Article XXX (5) the Income Tax Treaty with Canada, see, Rev. Rul. 85-76, 1985-1 C.B. 409.
(b)
Certain foreign to foreign exchanges
—(1)
Exceptions to the general rule.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and pursuant to authority conferred by section 897(e)(2), a foreign person shall not recognize gain, in the instances described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, on the transfer of a U.S. real property interest to a foreign corporation in exchange for stock in a foreign corporation, but only if the transferee's subsequent disposition of the transferred U.S. real property interest would be subject to U.S. taxation, as determined in accordance with the provisions of § 1.897-5T(d)(1), if the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of § 1.897-5T have been satisfied, if one of the five conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(2) exists, and if one of the following three forms of exchange takes place.
(i) The exchange is made by a foreign corporation pursuant to section 361(a) in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1) (D) or (F) and there is an exchange of the transferor corporation stock for the transferee corporation stock under section 354(a); or
(ii) The exchange is made by a foreign corporation pursuant to section 361(a) in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C); there is an exchange of the transferor corporation stock for the transferee corporation stock (or stock of the transferee corporation's parent in the case of a parenthetical C reorganization) under section 354(a); and the transferor corporation's shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting stock of the transferee corporation (or stock of the transferee corporation's parent in the case of a parenthetical C reorganization) immediately after the reorganization; or
(iii) The U.S. real property interest exchanged is stock in a U.S. real property holding corporation; the exchange qualifies under section 351(a) of section 354(a) in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B); and immediately after the exchange, all of the outstanding stock of the transferee corporation (or stock of the transferee corporation's parent in the case of a parenthetical B reorganization) is owned in the same proportions by the same nonresident alien individuals and foreign corporations that, immediately before the exchange, owned the stock of the U.S. real property holding corporation.
If, however, a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation which received stock in an exchange described in subdivision (iii) of this paragraph (b)(1) (or the transferee corporation's parent) disposes of any of such foreign stock within three years from the date of its receipt, then that individual or corporation shall recognize that portion of the gain realized with respect to the stock in the U.S. real property holding corporation for which foreign stock disposed of was received.
(2)
Applicability of exception.
The exception to the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) provided by paragraph (b)(1) shall apply only if one of the following five conditions exists.
(i) Each of the interests exchanged or received in a transferor corporation or transferee corporation would not be a U.S. real property interest as defined in § 1.897-1(c)(1) if such corporations were domestic corporations; or
(ii) The transferee corporation (and the transferee corporation's parent in the case of a parenthetical B or C reorganization) is incorporated in a foreign country that maintains an income tax treaty with the United States that contains an information exchange provision; the transfer occurs after May 5, 1988; and the transferee corporation (and the transferee corporation's parent in the case of a parenthetical B or C reorganization) submit a binding waiver of all benefits of the respective income tax treaty (including the opportunity to make an election under section 897 (i)), which must be attached to each of the transferor and transferee corporation's income tax returns for the year of the transfer; or
(iii) The transferee foreign corporation (and the transferee corporation's parent in the case of a parenthetical B or C reorganization) is a qualified resident as defined in section 884(e) and any regulations thereunder of the foreign country in which it is incorporated; or
(iv) The transferee foreign corporation (and the transferee corporation's parent in the case of a parenthetical B or C reorganization) is incorporated in
the same foreign country as the transferor foreign corporation; and there is an income tax treaty in force between that foreign country and the United States at the time of the transfer that contains an exchange of information provision; or
(v) The transferee foreign corporation is incorporated in the same foreign country as the transferor foreign corporation; and the transfer is incident to a mere change in identity, form, or place of organization of one corporation under section 368(a)(1)(F).
For purposes of any election by a transferee foreign corporation (or the transferee corporation's parent in the case of a parenthetical C reorganization) to be treated as a domestic corporation under section 897(i) and § 1.897-3 where the exchange was described in subdivisions (i) or (ii) of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, any prior dispositions of the transferor foreign corporation stock will be subject to the requirements of § 1.897-3(d)(2) upon an election under section 897(i) by the transferee foreign corporation (or the transferee corporation's parent in the case of a parenthetical C reorganization).
(3)
No exceptions.
No exception to recognition of gain under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is provided for the transfer of a U.S. real property interest by a foreign person to a foreign corporation in exchange for stock in a foreign corporation other than as provided in this paragraph (b). Thus, no exception is provided where—
(i) Such exchange is made pursuant to section 351 and the U.S. real property interest transferred is not stock in a U.S. real property holding corporation; or
(ii) Such exchange is made pursuant to section 361(a) in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1) that does not qualify for nonrecognition of gain under this paragraph (b). With regard to the treatment of certain foreign corporations as domestic corporations under section 897(i), see §§ 1.897-3 and 1.897-8T.
(4)
Examples.
The rules of paragraph (b)(1) and (2) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples. In each instance, the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of § 1.897-5T have been satisfied.

# Example 1.
(i) FC is a Country F corporation that has not made a section 897 (i) election. FC owns Parcel P, a U.S. real property interest, with a fair market value of $450x and an adjusted basis of 100x.
(ii) FC transfers Parcel P to FS, its wholly owned Country F subsidiary, in exchange for FS stock under section 351 (a). FS has not made a section 897(i) election. Under the rules of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, FC must recognize gain of 350x under section 897 (a) because the FS stock received in the exchange is not a U.S. real property interest. No exception to the recognition rule of paragraph (a)(1) is provided under this paragraph (b) for a transfer under section 351 (a) of a U.S. real property interest (that is not stock in a U.S. real property holding corporation) by a foreign corporation to another foreign corporation in exchange for stock to the transferee corporation.

# Example 2.
(i) FC is a Country F corporation that has not made a section 897(i) election. FC owns several U.S. real property interests that have appreciated in value since FC purchased the interests. FP, a Country F corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of FC. Country F maintains an income tax treaty with the United States.
(ii) For valid business purposes, FC transferred substantially all of its assets including all of its U.S. real property interests to FS in 1989 under section 361(a) in a reorganization in exchange for FS stock. FS is a newly formed Country F corporation that is owned by FC. The transfer qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(D). FC immediately distributes the FS stock to FP in exchange for the FC stock and FC dissolves. FP has no gain or loss on the exchange of the FC stock for the FS stock under section 354(a).
(iii) Under the rules of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, FC does not recognize any gain on the transfer of the U.S. real property interests to FS under section 361(a) in the reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(D) because FS would be subject to U.S. taxation on a subsequent disposition of the interests, as required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section; there is an exchange of stock under section 354(a), as required by paragraph (b)(1)(i); and FC and FS are incorporated in Country F which maintains an income tax treaty with the United States, as required by paragraph (b)(2)(iv).
(5)
Contributions of property.
A foreign person that contributes a U.S. real property interest to a foreign corporation as paid in surplus or as a contribution to capital (including a contribution provided in section 304(a)) shall be treated, for purposes of section 897(j)
and this section, as exchanging the U.S. real property interest for stock in the foreign corporation.
(c)
Denial of nonrecognition with respect to certain tax avoidance transfers
—(1)
In general.
The provisions of § 1.897-5T and paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are subject to the rules of this paragraph (c).
(2)
Certain transfers to domestic corporations
—(i)
General rule.
If a foreign person transfers property, that is not a U.S. real property interest, to a domestic corporation in a nonrecognition exchange, where—
(A) The adjusted basis of such property transferred exceeded its fair market value on the date of the transfer to the domestic corporation;
(B) The property transferred will not immediately be used in, or held by the domestic corporation for use in, the conduct of a trade or business as defined in § 1.897-1(f); and
(C) Within two years of the transfer to the domestic corporation, the property transferred is sold at a loss;
then, it will be presumed, absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, that the purpose for transferring the loss property was the avoidance of taxation on the disposition of U.S. real property interests by the domestic corporation. Any loss recognized by the domestic corporation on the sale or exchange of such property shall not be used by the domestic corporation, either by direct offset or as part of a net operating loss or capital loss carryback or carryover to offset any gain recognized from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest by the domestic corporation.
(ii)
Example.
The rules of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section may be illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
A is an individual citizen and resident of country F, which does not have an income tax treaty with the U.S. On January 1, 1987, A transfers a U.S. real property interest with a basis of $100,000 and a fair market value of $600,000 to domestic corporation DC in exchange for all of the stock of DC. On October 20, 1987, A transfers stock of a publicly traded domestic corporation with a basis in his hands of $900,000 and a fair market value of $500,000, in exchange for additional stock of DC. The stock of the publicly traded domestic corporation does not constitute an asset used or held for use in DC's trade or business. If DC sells the stock of the publicly traded domestic corporation before October 20, 1989 and recognizes a loss, the loss may not be used to offset any gain recognized on the sale of the U.S. real property interests by DC.
(3)
Basis adjustment for certain related person transactions.
In the case of any disposition after December 31, 1979, of a U.S. real property interest to a related person (within the meaning of section 453(f)(1)), the basis of the interest in the hands of the person acquiring such interest shall be reduced by the amount of any gain which is not subject to taxation under section 871(b)(1) or 882(a)(1) because the disposition occurred before June 19, 1980 or because of any treaty obligation of the United States. If a foreign corporation makes an election under section 897(i), and the stock of such corporation was transferred between related persons after December 31, 1979 and before June 19, 1980, then such stock shall be treated as a U.S. real property interest solely for purposes of this paragraph (c)(3).
(4)
Rearrangement of ownership to gain treaty benefit.
A foreign person who directly or indirectly owns a U.S. real property interest may not directly or indirectly rearrange the incidents of ownership of the U.S. real property interest through the use of nonrecognition provisions in order to gain the benefit of a treaty exemption from taxation. Such nonrecognition will not apply to the foreign transferor. The transferor will recognize gain but not loss on the transfer under section 897(a).
(d)
Effective date.
Except as specifically provided otherwise in the text of the regulations, paragraphs (a) through (c) shall be effective for transfers, exchanges and other dispositions occurring after June 18, 1980. Paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section shall be effective for exchanges and elections occurring after June 6, 1988.

(a)-(b) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.897-7T(a) through (b).
(c)
Coordination with section 864(c)(8).
Except as provided in § 1.864(c)(8)-1, the amount of any money, and the fair market value of any property, received by a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation in exchange for all or part of its interest in a partnership, trust, or estate will, to the extent attributable to United States real property interests, be considered as an amount received from the sale or exchange in the United States of such property. See also § 1.864(c)(8)-1(h) for an anti-stuffing rule that may apply to transactions subject to section 897. This paragraph applies to transfers occurring on or after December 26, 2018, and to amounts received on or after December 26, 2018, pursuant to an installment sale (as defined in section 453(b)) occurring on or after November 27, 2017.

§ 1.897-7T
Treatment of certain partnership interests as entirely U.S. real property interests under sections 897(g) and 1445(e) (temporary).
(a)
Rule.
Pursuant to section 897(g), an interest in a partnership in which, directly or indirectly, fifty percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests, and ninety percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests plus any cash or cash equivalents shall, for purposes of section 1445, be treated as entirely a U.S. real property interest. For purposes of section 897(g), such interest shall be treated as a U.S. real property interest only to the extent that the gain on the disposition is attributable to U.S. real property interests (and not cash, cash equivalents or other property). Consequently, a disposition of any portion of such partnership interest shall be subject to partial taxation under section 897(a) and full withholding under section 1445(a). For purposes of this paragraph, cash equivalent means any asset readily convertible into cash (whether or not denominated in U.S. dollars) including, but not limited to, bank accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, commercial paper, U.S. and foreign treasury obligations and bonds, corporate obligations and bonds, precious metals or commodities, and publicly traded instruments.
(b)
Effective date.
Section 1.897-7T shall be effective for transfers, exchanges, distributions and other dispositions occurring after June 6, 1988.
(c)
Coordination with section 864(c)(8).

§ 1.897-8T
Status as a U.S. real property holding corporation as a condition for electing section 897(i) pursuant to § 1.897-3 (temporary).
(a)
Purpose and scope.
This section provides a temporary regulation that if and when adopted as a final regulation, will be added to paragraph (b) of § 1.897-3. Paragraph (b) of this section would then appear as paragraph (b)(4) of § 1.897-3.
(b)
General conditions.
The foreign corporation upon making an election under section 897(i) (including any retroactive election) must qualify as a U.S. real property holding corporation as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.897-2.
(c)
Effective Date.
Section 1.897-8T shall be effective as of June 6, 1988, with respect to foreign corporations making an election under section 897(i) after May 5, 1988.
[T.D. 8198, 53 FR 16229, May 5, 1988]
§ 1.897-9T
Treatment of certain interest in publicly traded corporations, definition of foreign person, and foreign governments and international organizations (temporary).
(a)
Purpose and scope.
This section provides a temporary regulation that, if and when adopted as a final regulation will be added as new paragraphs (c)(2)(iii)(B), (k), (n) and (q) of § 1.897-1. Paragraph (b) of this section would then appear as paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of § 1.897-1. Paragraph (c) of this section would then appear as paragraph (k) of § 1.897-1. Paragraph (d) of this section would then appear as paragraph (n) of § 1.897-1. Paragraph (e) of this section would then appear as paragraph (q) of § 1.897-1.
(b) Any other interest in the corporation (other than an interest solely as a
creditor) if on the date such interest was acquired by its present holder it had a fair market value greater than the fair market value on that date of 5 percent of the regularly traded class of the corporation's stock with the lowest fair market value. However, if a non-regularly traded class of interests in the corporation is convertible into a regularly traded class of interests in the corporation, an interest in such non-regularly traded class shall be treated as a U.S. real property interest if on the date it was acquired by its present holder it had a fair market value greater than the fair market value on that date of 5 percent of the regularly traded class of the corporation's stock into which it is convertible. If a person holds interests in a corporation of a class that is not regularly traded, and subsequently acquires additional interests of the same class, then all such interests must be aggregated and valued as of the date of the subsequent acquisition. If the subsequent acquisition causes that person's interests to exceed the applicable limitation, then all such interests shall be treated as U.S. real property interests, regardless of when acquired. In addition, if a person holds interests in a corporation of separate classes that are not regularly traded, and if such interests were separately acquired for a principal purpose of avoiding the applicable 5 percent limitation of this paragraph, then such interests shall be aggregated for purposes of applying that limitation. This rule shall not apply to interests of separate classes acquired in transactions more than three years apart. For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of § 1.897-1, section 318(a) shall apply (except that section 318(a)(2)(C) and (3)(C) shall each be applied by substituting “5 percent” for “50 percent”).
(c) [Reserved]
(d)
Regularly traded
—(1)
General rule
—(i)
Trading requirements.
A class of interests that is traded on one or more established securities markets is considered to be regularly traded on such market or markets for any calendar quarter during which—
(A) Trades in such class are effected, other than in
de minimis
quantities, on at least 15 days during the calendar quarter;
(B) The aggregate number of the interests in such class traded is at least 7.5 percent or more of the average number of interests in such class outstanding during the calendar quarter; and
(C) The requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section are met.
(ii)
Exceptions
—(A) in the case of the class of interests which is held by 2,500 or more record shareholders, the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) of this section shall be applied by substituting “2.5 percent” for “7.5 percent”.
(B) If at any time during the calendar quarter 100 or fewer persons own 50 percent or more of the outstanding shares of a class of interests, such class shall not be considered to be regularly traded for purposes of sections 897, 1445 and 6039C. Related persons shall be treated as one person for purposes of this paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B).
(iii)
Anti-abuse rule.
Trades between related persons shall be disregarded. In addition, a class of interests shall not be treated as regularly traded if there is an arrangement or a pattern of trades designed to meet the requirements of this paragraph (d)(1). For example, trades between two persons that occur several times during the calendar quarter may be treated as an arrangement or a pattern of trades designed to meet the requirements of this paragraph (d)(1).
(2)
Interests traded on domestic established securities markets.
For purposes of sections 897, 1445 and 6039C, a class of interests that is traded on an established securities market located in the United States is considered to be regularly traded for any calendar quarter during which it is regularly quoted by brokers or dealers making a market in such interests. A broker or dealer makes a market in a class of interests only if the broker or dealer holds himself out to buy or sell interests in such class at the quoted price. Stock of a corporation that is described in section 851(a)(1) and units of a unit investment trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. sections 80a-1 to 80a-2) shall be treated as regularly traded within the meaning of this paragraph.
(3)
Reporting requirement for interests traded on foreign securities markets.
A class of interests in a domestic corporation that is traded on one or more established securities markets located outside the United States shall not be considered to be regularly traded on such market or markets unless such class is traded in registered form, and—
(i) The corporation registers such class of interests pursuant to section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. section 78, or
(ii) The corporation attaches to its Federal income tax return a statement providing the following:
(A) A caption which states “The following information concerning certain shareholders of this corporation is provided in accordance with the requirements of § 1.897-9T.”
(B) The name under which the corporation is incorporated, the state in which such corporation is incorporated, the principal place of business of the corporation, and its employer identification number, if any;
(C) The identity of each person who, at any time during the corporation's taxable year, was the beneficial owner of more than 5 percent of any class of interests of the corporation to which this paragraph (d)(3) applies;
(D) The title, and the total number of shares issued, of any class of interests so owned; and
(E) With respect to each beneficial owner of more than 5 percent of any class of interests of the corporation, the number of shares owned, the percentage of the class represented thereby, and the nature of the beneficial ownership of each class of shares so owned.
Interests in a domestic corporation which has filed a report pursuant to this paragraph (d)(3)(ii) shall be considered to be regularly traded on an established securities market only for the taxable year of the corporation with respect to which such a report is filed.
(4)
Coordination with section 1445.
For purposes of section 1445, a class of interests in a corporation shall be presumed to be regularly traded during a calendar quarter if such interests were regularly traded within the meaning of this paragraph during the previous calendar quarter.
(e)
Foreign governments and international organizations.
A foreign government shall be treated as a foreign person with respect to U.S. real property interests, and shall be subject to sections 897, 1445, and 6039C on the disposition of a U.S. real property interest except to the extent specifically otherwise provided in the regulations in this chapter issued under section 892. An international organization (as defined in section 7701(a)(18)) is not a foreign person with respect to U.S. real property interests, and is not subject to sections 897, 1445, and 6039C on the disposition of a U.S. real property interest.
See
§ 1.897-1(c)(3)(iv)(B) regarding the treatment of international organizations as foreign persons for purposes of section 897(h)(4)(B). Buildings or parts of buildings and the land ancillary thereto (including the residence of the head of the diplomatic mission) used by the foreign government for a diplomatic mission shall not be a U.S. real property interest in the hands of the respective foreign government.
(f)
Effective date.
Section 1.897-9T with the exception of paragraph (e) shall be effective for transfers, exchanges, distributions and other dispositions occurring on or after June 6, 1988. Paragraph (e) of this section shall be effective for transfers, exchanges, distributions and other dispositions occurring on or after July 1, 1986.

Exception for interests held by foreign pension funds.
(a)
Scope and overview.
This section provides rules regarding the exception from section 897 for qualified holders. The definitions and requirements in this section apply only for purposes of this section (including as applicable by cross-reference from other sections), and no inference is to be drawn with respect to the definitions and requirements in this section, including with respect to the meaning of a pension fund, for any other purpose.

(c)
Qualified foreign pension fund requirements
—(1)
In general.
An eligible fund is a qualified foreign pension fund if it satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (c).

Applicable requirements
—(i)
Created or organized.
An eligible fund must be created, organized, or established under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(i), a governmental unit is treated as created or organized in the foreign jurisdiction with respect to which it is, or is a part of, the foreign government.
(ii)
Establishment of eligible fund
—(A)
General requirement
—(
1
)
Purpose of and parties establishing eligible fund.
An eligible fund must be established—
(
i
) By, or at the direction of, the foreign jurisdiction in which it is created or organized to provide retirement and pension benefits to participants or beneficiaries that are current or former employees or persons designated by such employees as a result of services rendered by such employees to their employers; or
(
ii
) By one or more employers (including a governmental unit in its capacity as an employer) to provide retirement and pension benefits to participants or beneficiaries that are current or former employees or persons designated by such employees in consideration for services rendered by such employees to such employers.
(
2
)
Identification of type of eligible fund.
An eligible fund that is described in both paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
1
)(
i
) and (
ii
) of this section shall be treated solely as described in the latter paragraph.
(
3
)
Role of parties other than the foreign jurisdiction or employer.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section, the determination of whether an eligible fund is established by, or at the direction of, a foreign jurisdiction or established by an employer is made without regard to whether one or more persons that are not the foreign jurisdiction or employer administer or otherwise provide services with regard to the eligible fund (including holding assets in a qualified segregated account as part of or on behalf of the eligible fund).
(B)
Established to provide retirement or pension benefits.
An eligible fund is established to provide retirement or pension benefits for purposes of the general requirement in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section if—
(
1
) All of the benefits that an eligible fund provides are qualified benefits provided to qualified recipients;
(
2
) At least 85 percent of the present value of the qualified benefits that the eligible fund reasonably expects to provide to qualified recipients in the future are retirement and pension benefits; and
(
3
) No more than five percent of the present value of the qualified benefits the eligible fund reasonably expects to provide to qualified recipients in the future are non-ancillary benefits.
(C)
Present valuation
—(
1
)
In general.
For purposes of satisfying the requirements in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) and
(
3
) of this section, an eligible fund must determine, on at least an annual basis, the present value of the qualified benefits that the eligible fund reasonably expects to provide to qualified recipients during the entire period during which the eligible fund is expected to be in existence. An eligible fund may utilize any reasonable method for performing the present valuation.
(
2
)
48-month average alternative calculation.
An eligible fund that does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) or (
3
) of this section based on the present value determination under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section may satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) or (
3
) of this section based on the alternative calculation in this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
). The alternative calculation in this paragraph is satisfied if the average of the present values of the future qualified benefits that the eligible fund reasonably expected to provide, as determined during the 48-month period preceding (and including) the most recent present valuation determination, satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) or (
3
) of this section, respectively. The determination of such average must be based on the valuations described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section that were carried out during the 48-month period preceding (and including) the most recent present value determination, and must use the values (not percentages) of the qualified benefits the eligible fund reasonably expected to provide. The determination described in this paragraph must be calculated using a weighted average whereby values are adjusted if the relevant valuations are applicable for different periods (as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
3
) of this section) because an eligible fund performs valulations more frequently than on an annual basis. If an eligible fund has been in existence for less than 48 months, this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
) is applied to the period that the eligible fund has been in existence. The alternative calculation in this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
) may be satisfied based on any reasonable determination of the present valuation described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section for any period that starts before the date that the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section first apply to an organization or arrangement and ends on or before December 29, 2022.
(
3
)
Application of present valuation.
An eligible fund must use the present value determination made as of the most recent valuation under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section or the alternative calculation provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section (to the extent the eligible fund did not satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) and (
3
) of this section in the most recent valuation) for purposes of meeting the requirements in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) and (
3
) of this section with respect to dispositions of United States real property interests or distributions described in section 897(h) occurring in the twelve months succeeding the most recent valuation, or until a new present value determination is made, whichever occurs first.
(D)
Certain distributions from eligible funds.
The following distributions are not taken into account for purposes of determining whether an eligible fund satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section—
(
1
) A loan to a qualified recipient pursuant to terms set by the eligible fund (other than a loan with respect to which a qualified recipient defaults and is not required to repay in whole or part, unless the default is subject to tax and penalty in such foreign jurisdiction);
(
2
) A distribution (as permitted by the laws of the foreign jurisdiction in which the eligible fund is established or operates) made before the participant or beneficiary reaches the retirement age (as determined under the relevant foreign laws), provided that the distribution is to a designee that is a qualified holder or to another arrangement subject to similar distribution or tax rules under the laws of the foreign jurisdiction; and
(
3
) A withdrawal of funds before the participant or beneficiary reaches the retirement age (as determined under the relevant foreign laws) to satisfy a financial need (under principles similar to the U.S. hardship distribution rules, see § 1.401(k)-1(d)(3)) as permitted under the laws of the foreign jurisdiction in
which the eligible fund is established or operates, provided the distribution (or at least the portion of the distribution exceeding basis) is subject to tax and penalty in such foreign jurisdiction.
(E)
Certain employers and employees.
For purposes of this section, the following rules apply—
(
1
) A self-employed individual is treated as both an employer and an employee;
(
2
) Employees of an individual, trust, corporation, or partnership that is a member of an employer group are treated as employees of each member of the employer group that includes the individual, trust, corporation, or partnership; and
(
3
) An eligible fund established by a trade union, professional association, or similar group, either alone or in combination with the employer or group of employers, is treated as established by any employer that funds, in whole or in part, the eligible fund.
(iii)
Single participant or beneficiary
—(A)
In general.
An eligible fund may not have a single qualified recipient that has a right to more than five percent of the assets or income of the eligible fund.
(B)
Constructive ownership.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, an individual is considered to have a right to the assets or income of an eligible fund to which any person who bears a relationship to the individual described in section 267(b) or 707(b) has a right.
(iv)
Regulation and information reporting
—(A)
In general.
The eligible fund must be subject to government regulation and annually provide to the relevant tax authorities (or other relevant governmental units) in the foreign jurisdiction in which the eligible fund is established or operates information about the amount of qualified benefits (if any) provided to each qualified recipient by the eligible fund, or such information must otherwise be available to the relevant tax authorities (or other relevant governmental units). An eligible fund is not treated as failing to satisfy the requirement of this paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(A) as a result of the eligible fund not being required to provide information to the relevant tax authorities (or other relevant governmental units) in a year in which no qualified benefits are provided to qualified recipients.
(B)
Treatment of certain eligible funds established by foreign jurisdictions.
An eligible fund that is described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
1
)(
i
) of this section is deemed to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(A) of this section.
(v)
Tax treatment
—(A)
In general.
The tax laws of the foreign jurisdiction in which the eligible fund is established or operates must provide that, due to the status of the eligible fund as a retirement or pension fund, either—
(
1
) Contributions to the eligible fund that would otherwise be subject to tax under such laws are deductible or excluded from the gross income of the eligible fund or taxed at a reduced rate; or
(
2
) Taxation of any investment income of the eligible fund is deferred or excluded from the gross income of the eligible fund or such income is taxed at a reduced rate.
(B)
Income subject to preferential tax treatment.
An eligible fund is treated as satisfying the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section in a taxable year if, under the tax laws of the foreign jurisdiction in which the eligible fund is established or operates—
(
1
) At least 85 percent of the contributions to the eligible fund are subject to the tax treatment described in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A)(
1
) of this section, or
(
2
) At least 85 percent of the investment income of the eligible fund is subject to the tax treatment described in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A)(
2
) of this section.
(C)
Income not subject to tax.
An eligible fund is treated as satisfying the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section if the eligible fund is exempt from the income tax of the foreign jurisdiction in which it is established or operates or the foreign jurisdiction in which it is established or operates has no income tax.
(D)
Other preferential tax regimes.
An eligible fund that does not receive the tax treatment described in either paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A)(
1
) or (
2
) of this section is nonetheless treated as satisfying the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section if the eligible
fund establishes that each of the conditions described in paragraphs (c)(2)(v)(D)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section is satisfied:
(
1
) Under the tax laws of the foreign jurisdiction in which the eligible fund is established or operates, the eligible fund is subject to a preferential tax regime due to its status as a retirement or pension fund; and
(
2
) The preferential tax regime described in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(D)(
1
) of this section has a substantially similar effect as the tax treatment described in paragraphs (c)(2)(v)(A)(
1
) or (
2
) of this section.
(E)
Tax law of subnational jurisdictions.
Solely for purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(v), a reference to the tax law of a foreign jurisdiction includes the tax law of a political subdivision or other local authority of a foreign jurisdiction, provided that income taxes imposed under the subnational tax law are treated as covered taxes under an income tax treaty between that foreign jurisdiction and the United States.
(3)
Operating rules
—(i)
Rules on the application of the requirements in paragraph (c)(2) of this section
—(A)
Organizations or arrangements.
An organization or arrangement is treated as a single entity for purposes of determining whether the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section are satisfied, except that each person or governmental unit that is part of or party to an organization or arrangement must satisfy the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
(B)
Relevant income, assets, and functions.
The determination of whether an eligible fund satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section is made solely with respect to the assets and income of the eligible fund held in one or more qualified segregated accounts, the qualified benefits funded by the qualified segregated accounts, the information reporting and regulation related to the qualified segregated accounts, and the qualified recipients whose benefits are funded by the qualified segregated accounts. For this purpose, all assets held by an eligible fund in qualified segregated accounts (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(13)(ii) of this section) are treated as a single qualified segregated account.
(ii)
Aggregate approach to partnerships.
For purposes of this section, assets held by a partnership shall be treated as held proportionately by its partners, and activities conducted by a partnership shall be treated as conducted by its partners.
(iii)
Recordkeeping.
An eligible fund that claims the exemption under section 897(l) must have records sufficient to establish that it satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. See section 6001 and § 1.6001-1, requiring records to be maintained.
(d)
Qualified holder requirements
—(1)
In general.
With respect to a disposition described in section 897(a) or a distribution described in section 897(h), a qualified foreign pension fund (including a part of a qualified foreign pension fund) or a qualified controlled entity is a qualified holder only if it satisfies the requirement of paragraph (d)(2) or (3) of this section.
(2)
Qualified holders that did not hold U.S. real property interests.
The requirement of this paragraph (d)(2) is satisfied if the qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity owned no United States real property interests as of the earliest date during an uninterrupted period, ending on the date of the disposition or distribution, in which the qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity satisfied the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section or paragraph (e)(9) of this section, as applicable.
(3)
Qualified holders that satisfy the testing period

For purposes of paragraph (e)(13)(i) of this section, an identifiable pool of assets of an eligible fund is treated as maintained for the sole purpose of funding qualified benefits to qualified recipients, and hence as a qualified segregated account, only if the terms applicable to the eligible fund or the laws of the foreign jurisdiction in which the eligible fund is established or operates require that all the assets in the pool, and all the income earned with respect to such assets, be used exclusively to fund the provision of qualified benefits to qualified recipients or to satisfy necessary reasonable expenses of the eligible fund, and that such assets or income may not inure to the benefit of a person other than a qualified recipient. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(13)(ii), the fact that assets or income may inure to the benefit of a governmental unit by operation of escheat or similar laws, or may revert (such as upon plan termination or dissolution
(after all obligations to qualified recipients and creditors have been satisfied) or the qualified recipients' benefits failing to vest) to the governmental unit or employer in accordance with applicable foreign law is ignored, so long as contributions to the plan are not more than reasonably necessary to fund the qualified benefits to be provided to qualified recipients.
(iii)
Assets held by qualified controlled entities.
For purposes of paragraph (e)(13)(i) of this section, the assets of a qualified controlled entity are treated as an identifiable pool of assets maintained for the sole purpose of funding qualified benefits to qualified recipients only if both of the following requirements are satisfied:

Retirement and pension benefits may be based on one or more of the following factors: contributions, investment performance, years of service with an employer, or compensation received by the qualified recipient.
(f)
Examples.
This paragraph (f) provides examples that illustrate the rules of this section. The examples do not illustrate the application of the applicable withholding rules, including sections 1445 and 1446 and the regulations thereunder. It is assumed that no person is entitled to more than five percent of any eligible fund's assets or income, taking into account the constructive ownership rules in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, and that the eligible fund owns no United States real property interests other than as described.
(1)
Example 1: No legal entity
—(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 2023, Country A establishes Retirement Plan for the sole purpose of providing retirement and pension benefits to citizens of Country A aged 65 or older. Retirement Plan is composed of Asset Pool and Agency. Asset Pool is a group of accounts maintained on the balance sheet of the government of Country A. Pursuant to the laws of Country A, income and gain earned by Asset Pool is used solely to support the provision of retirement and pension benefits by Retirement Plan. Agency is a Country A agency that administers the provision of benefits by Retirement Plan and manages Asset Pool's investments. Under the laws of Country A, investment income earned by Retirement Plan is not subject to Country A's income tax. At the end of each calendar year, Retirement Plan performs a present valuation of the retirement and pension benefits it reasonably expects to provide in the future, and all of the benefits that Retirement Plan reasonably expects to provide are retirement and pension benefits. On January 1, 2024, Agency purchases Property, which is an interest in real property located in the United States owned by Asset Pool. On June 1, 2026, Agency sells Property, realizing $100x of gain with respect to Property that would be subject to tax under section 897(a) unless paragraph (b) of this section applies with respect to the gain.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) Retirement Plan, which is composed of Asset Pool and Agency, includes one or more governmental units described in paragraph
(e)(5) of this section. Accordingly, Retirement Plan is an organization or arrangement described in paragraph (e)(7) of this section. Furthermore, Retirement Plan maintains a qualified segregated account in the form of Asset Pool, an identifiable pool of assets maintained for the sole purpose of funding retirement and pension benefits to beneficiaries of the Retirement Fund (qualified recipients as defined in paragraph (e)(12)(i)(A) of this section). Therefore, Retirement Plan is an eligible fund within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(B) Paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section applies for purposes of determining whether Retirement Plan is an eligible fund that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section and would therefore be treated as a qualified foreign pension fund. Accordingly, the activities of Asset Pool and Agency are integrated and treated as undertaken by a single entity to determine whether the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section are met. However, Asset Pool and Agency must independently satisfy the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
(C) Retirement Plan is composed of Asset Pool and Agency, each of which is a governmental unit and treated as created or organized under the laws of Country A for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. Accordingly, Retirement Plan satisfies the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
(D) Retirement Plan is established by Country A as an eligible fund described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
1
)(
i
) of this section to provide retirement and pension benefits, which are qualified benefits described in paragraph (e)(8) of this section, to citizens of Country A, who are qualified recipients described in paragraph (e)(12)(i)(A) of this section because they are eligible to be participants or beneficiaries of Retirement Plan. Accordingly, all of the benefits that Retirement Plan provides are qualified benefits provided to qualified recipients. In addition, Retirement Plan satisfies the requirements of the present valuation test as described in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section. Accordingly, Retirement Plan satisfies the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
(E) Retirement Plan provides retirement and pension benefits to citizens of Country A aged 65 or older, with no citizen entitled to more than five percent of Retirement Fund's assets or to more than five percent of the income of the eligible fund. Accordingly, Retirement Plan satisfies the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.
(F) Retirement Plan is composed solely of governmental units within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5) of this section. Accordingly, under paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, Retirement Plan is treated as satisfying the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(A) of this section.
(G) Investment income earned by Retirement Plan is not subject to income tax in Country A. Accordingly, Retirement Plan satisfies the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section.
(H) Because Retirement Plan satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Retirement Plan is a qualified foreign pension fund. Because Retirement Plan held no United States real property interests as of January 1, 2023, the earliest date during an uninterrupted period ending on June 1, 2026, the date of the disposition, in which it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Retirement Plan is a qualified holder under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Retirement Plan's gain with respect to Property is attributable solely to Asset Pool, a qualified segregated account maintained by Retirement Plan. Accordingly, under paragraph (b) of this section, the $100x gain realized by Retirement Plan attributable to the disposition of Property is not subject to section 897(a).
(2)
Example 2: Fund established by an employer
—(i)
Facts.
Employer, a corporation organized in Country B, establishes Fund to provide retirement and pension benefits to current and former employees of Employer and S1, a Country B corporation that is wholly owned by Employer. On January 1, 2023, Fund is established as a trust under the laws of Country B, and Employer retains discretion to invest assets and to administer benefits on Fund's behalf.
Fund receives contributions from Employer and S1 and contributions from employees of Employer and S1 who are beneficiaries of Fund. All contributions to Fund and all of Fund's earnings are separately accounted for on Fund's books and records and are required by Fund's organizational documents to exclusively fund the provision of benefits to Fund's beneficiaries, except as necessary to satisfy reasonable expenses of Fund. Fund currently has over 100 beneficiaries, a number that is reasonably expected to grow as Employer expands. Fund will pay benefits to employees upon retirement based on years of service and employee contributions, but, if a beneficiary dies before retirement, Fund will pay an incidental death benefit in addition to payment of any accrued retirement and pension benefits to the beneficiary's designee (or deemed designee under local laws if the beneficiary fails to identify a designee). Fund annually performs a present valuation of the benefits it reasonably expects to provide to Fund's beneficiaries, and the valuation concludes that more than 85 percent of the present value of the total benefits it reasonably expects to pay to its beneficiaries in the future are retirement and pension benefits. In addition, it is reasonably expected that the incidental death benefits paid by Fund will account for less than fifteen percent of the present value of the total benefits that Fund expects to provide in the future, and Fund does not reasonably expect to pay any other types of benefits to its beneficiaries in the future. Fund annually provides to the tax authorities of Country B the amount of benefits distributed to each participant (or designee). Country B's tax authorities prescribe rules and regulations governing Fund's operations. Under the laws of Country B, Fund is not taxed on its investment income. On January 1, 2024, Fund purchases Property, which is an interest in real property located in the United States. On June 1, 2026, Fund sells Property, realizing $100x of gain with respect to Property that would be subject to tax under section 897(a) unless paragraph (b) of this section applies with respect to the gain.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) Fund is a trust that maintains an identifiable pool of assets for the sole purpose of funding retirement and pension benefits and ancillary benefits to current and former employees of the employer group (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3) of this section) that includes Employer and S1 (current and former employees of Employer and S1 constitute qualified recipients, as defined in paragraph (e)(12)(i)(B) of this section). All assets held by Fund and all income earned by Fund are used to provide such benefits. Therefore, Fund is a trust that maintains a qualified segregated account within the meaning of paragraph (e)(13) of this section. Accordingly, Fund is an eligible fund within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(B) Because Fund is created or organized under the laws of Country B, Fund satisfies the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
(C) The only benefits that Fund provides are retirement and pension benefits described in paragraph (e)(14) of this section and ancillary benefits (that is, the incidental death benefits) described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, both of which constitute qualified benefits described in paragraph (e)(8) of this section, to qualified recipients, described in paragraph (e)(12)(i)(B) of this section. Furthermore, Fund satisfies the requirements of the present valuation test as described in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section. Accordingly, Fund is established by Employer to provide retirement and pension benefits to qualified recipients in consideration for services rendered by such qualified recipients to Employer and S1, and Fund satisfies the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
(D) No single qualified recipient has a right to more than five percent of the assets or income of the eligible fund. Accordingly, Fund satisfies the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.
(E) Fund is regulated and annually provides to the relevant tax authorities in the foreign jurisdiction in which it is established or operates the amount of qualified benefits provided to each qualified recipient by the eligible fund. Accordingly, Fund satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.
(F) Fund is not subject to income tax on its investment income. Accordingly, Fund satisfies the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section.
(G) Because Fund meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Fund is treated as a qualified foreign pension fund. Furthermore, because Fund held no United States real property interests as of January 1, 2023, the earliest date during an uninterrupted period ending on June 1, 2026, the date of the disposition, in which it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Fund is a qualified holder under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. All of Fund's assets are held in a qualified segregated account within the meaning of paragraph (e)(13) of this section. Accordingly, under paragraph (b) of this section, the $100x gain attributable to the disposition of Property is not subject to section 897(a).
(3)
Example 3: Fund established by an employer at the direction of a foreign jurisdiction
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(2) of this section (
Example 2
), except that Fund was established by Employer at the direction of Country B and, in addition to being established to provide retirement and pension benefits to current and former employees of Employer and S1, Fund was also established to provide retirement and pension benefits to other employees. All employees that are beneficiaries provide contributions to Fund. Fund makes a determination on at least an annual basis using a reasonable method to measure the number of participants in the Fund who are not current and former employees of Employer and S1. Each time such a determination is made, Fund finds that such employees constitute less than five percent of Fund's total qualified recipients and do not have a right to more than five percent of the assets or income of Fund.
(ii)
Analysis.
Fund satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
1
)(
i
) of this section because it was established by, or at the direction of, Country B to provide retirement and pension benefits to participants or beneficiaries that are current or former employees or persons designated by such employees as a result of services rendered by such employees to their employers. Fund also satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section because it was established by Employer to provide retirement and pension benefits to participants or beneficiaries that are current or former employees or persons designated by such employees in consideration for services rendered by such employees to Employer and S1. Because it satisfies the requirements of both such provisions, under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section, Fund will be treated solely as an eligible fund under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section. As a result, Fund must meet the reporting requirements described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(A) of this section and must apply the definition of qualified recipient described in paragraphs (e)(12)(i)(B) and (C) of this section. Because Fund makes a determination on at least an annual basis using a reasonable method to measure the number of participants in the Fund who are not current and former employees of Employer and S1, finding that such employees constitute less than five percent of Fund's total qualified recipients and do not have a right to more than five percent of the assets or income of Fund, the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section, requiring that all of the benefits that an eligible fund provides are provided to qualified recipients, is considered satisfied. Because Fund meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Fund is treated as a qualified foreign pension fund under paragraph (b) of this section. Accordingly, the $100x gain attributable to the disposition of Property is not subject to section 897(a).
(4)
Example 4: Employer controlled organization or arrangement
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(2) of this section (
Example 2
), except that S2, a Country B corporation that is wholly owned by Employer, performs all tax compliance functions for Employer, S1, and S2, including information reporting with respect to Fund participants.
(ii)
Analysis.
For purposes of the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Fund and S2 are an organization or arrangement that is treated as
a single entity under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section and an eligible fund under paragraph (e)(2) of this section with respect to the qualified segregated account held by Fund. Because the eligible fund composed of Fund and S2 satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section (including the rule under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section that each entity satisfy the foreign organization requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section) with respect to the qualified benefits provided to the qualified recipients out of the eligible fund's qualified segregated account (determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section), the eligible fund that is composed of Fund and S2 constitutes a qualified foreign pension fund. Furthermore, the requirements for qualified holder status are satisfied, as described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Thus, under paragraph (b) of this section, the $100x gain attributable to the disposition of Property is not subject to section 897(a).
(5)
Example 5: Third-party assumption of pension liabilities
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(2) of this section (
Example 2
), except that Fund does not purchase Property on January 1, 2024. In addition, Fund anticipates $100x of qualified benefits will be paid each year beginning on January 1, 2028. Fund enters into an agreement with Guarantor, a privately held Country B corporation, which provides that Fund will, on January 30, 2023, cede a portion of its assets to Guarantor in exchange for annual payments of $100x beginning on January 1, 2028 and continuing until one or more previously identified participants (and their designees) ceases to be eligible to receive benefits. Guarantor has discretion to invest the ceded assets as it chooses, subject to certain agreed upon investment restrictions. Pursuant to its agreement with Fund, Guarantor must maintain Segregated Pool, a pool of assets securing its obligations under its agreement with Fund. The value of Segregated Pool must exceed a specified amount (determined based on an agreed upon formula) until Guarantor's payment obligations are completed, and any remaining assets in Segregated Pool (that is, assets exceeding the required payments to Fund) are retained by Guarantor. Guarantor bears all investment risk with respect to Segregated Pool. Accordingly, Guarantor is required to make annual payments of $100x to Fund regardless of the performance of Segregated Pool. On January 1, 2024, Guarantor purchases stock in Company A, a United States real property holding company that is a United States real property interest, and holds the Company A stock in Segregated Pool. On June 1, 2027, Guarantor sells the stock in Company A, realizing a gain of $100x.
(ii)
Analysis.
The Segregated Pool is not a qualified segregated account, because it is not maintained for the sole purpose of funding qualified benefits to qualified recipients, and because income attributable to assets in the Segregated Pool (including the Company A stock) may inure to Guarantor, which is not a qualified recipient. Accordingly, Fund and Guarantor do not qualify as an organization or arrangement that is an eligible fund with respect to the Company A stock. Therefore, Guarantor is not exempt under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to the $100x of gain realized in connection with the sale of its shares in Company A.
(6)
Example 6: Asset manager
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(5) of this section (
Example 5
) except that instead of ceding legal ownership of a portion of its assets to Guarantor, Fund transfers the assets into Trust with respect to which Fund is the sole beneficiary on January 30, 2023, and Trust purchases stock in Company A on January 1, 2024. Guarantor has exclusive management authority over the Trust assets and is entitled to a reasonable fixed management fee which it withdraws annually from Trust's assets. On June 1, 2027, Trust sells the stock in Company A, realizing a gain of $100x.
(ii)
Analysis.
For purposes of testing the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Fund and Trust are an organization or arrangement that is treated as a single entity under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section and an eligible fund under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Assets held by Trust are held in a qualified segregated account,
and those assets are the assets that are relevant for purposes of determining whether the eligible fund composed of Fund and Trust meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The eligible fund that is composed of Fund and Trust is treated as established by Employer notwithstanding that Guarantor provides management services. See paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
3
) of this section. Paragraph (e)(13)(ii) of this section provides that the assets held by an eligible fund in a qualified segregated account may be used to satisfy reasonable expenses of the eligible fund, such that the reasonable fixed management fee paid to Guarantor does not cause the assets held in Trust to fail to be treated as held in a qualified segregated account. All of the other requirements for qualified foreign pension fund status are satisfied by the eligible fund that is composed of Fund and Trust, as described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. The eligible fund that is composed of Fund and Trust is a qualified holder under paragraph (d)(2) of this section because it held no United States real property interests on January 1, 2023, the earliest date during an uninterrupted period ending on June 1, 2027, the date of the disposition of Company A stock, in which it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The eligible fund that is composed of Fund and Trust is therefore exempt under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to the $100x of gain realized in connection with the sale by Trust of the shares in Company A.
(7)
Example 7: Partnership
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(5) of this section (
Example 5
) except that instead of ceding legal ownership of the assets to Guarantor, Fund contributes the assets to a partnership (PRS) formed with Guarantor and PRS purchases stock in Company A on January 30, 2023. Guarantor receives a profits interest in the partnership that is reasonable in light of Guarantor's management activity. Guarantor has no direct or indirect ownership in PRS assets, and the partnership agreement provides that upon dissolution, PRS assets would be distributed to Fund. Guarantor serves as the general partner of PRS and has discretionary authority to buy and sell PRS assets without approval from Fund. On June 1, 2027, PRS sells the stock in Company A, realizing a gain of $100x.
(ii)
Analysis.
All of Fund's assets, including the assets held by PRS that are treated as held proportionately by Fund under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, are held in a qualified segregated account within the meaning of paragraph (e)(13) of this section. See paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section (
Example 2
). The eligible fund that is composed of Fund is treated as established by Employer notwithstanding that Guarantor provides management services to PRS. See paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
3
) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section. All of the other requirements for qualified foreign pension fund status are satisfied by Fund as described in paragraphs (f)(2)(ii)(B) through (F) of this section, and Fund is a qualified holder as described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(G) of this section. Accordingly, Fund is exempt under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to its allocable share of the $100x of gain realized in connection with the sale by PRS of the shares in Company A. Guarantor is not exempt under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to its allocable share of the $100x of gain realized in connection with the sale by PRS of the shares in Company A because Guarantor is neither part of the organization or arrangement that forms Fund nor a qualified holder under paragraph (d) of this section that maintains qualified segregated accounts.
(8)
Example 8: Not a qualified holder
—(i)
Facts.
Fund is a qualified foreign pension fund organized in Country C that meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Fund owns all the outstanding stock of OpCo, a manufacturing corporation organized in Country C, in a qualified segregated account maintained by Fund. OpCo was originally formed by a person other than Fund on January 1, 2023. Fund purchased all of the stock of OpCo on November 1, 2023 for the purpose of conducting the manufacturing business and utilizing the business profits to fund pension liabilities. During the period from January 1, 2023, through October 31, 2023, OpCo was not a qualified
foreign pension fund, a part of a qualified foreign pension fund, or a qualified controlled entity. On January 30, 2023, OpCo purchased Property A, a United States real property interest, from a third party. For all periods after Fund acquired OpCo, OpCo must either retain or distribute to Fund all of its net earnings, and upon dissolution, must distribute all of its assets to its stockholder (that is, Fund) after satisfaction of liabilities to its creditors. On June 1, 2024, OpCo realizes $100x of gain on the disposition of Property A.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) A qualified controlled entity described in paragraph (e)(9) of this section includes any corporation organized under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction all the interests of which are owned by one or more qualified foreign pension funds directly or indirectly through one or more qualified controlled entities. Fund is a qualified foreign pension fund that wholly owns OpCo. Accordingly, OpCo is a qualified controlled entity for the period when it is owned by Fund beginning on November 1, 2023.
(B) Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, a qualified controlled entity is a qualified holder only if either, under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the qualified controlled entity owned no United States real property interests as of the earliest date during an uninterrupted period ending on the date of the disposition or distribution in which the qualified controlled entity satisfied the requirements of paragraph (e)(9) of this section, or, under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the qualified controlled entity satisfies the requirements of paragraph (e)(9) of this section throughout the entire testing period. Because OpCo owned a United States real property interest as of November 1, 2023, the earliest date during an uninterrupted period ending on the date of the disposition during which it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (e)(9) of this section, OpCo cannot satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section and must instead satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section to be a qualified holder. Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, a qualified holder does not include any entity that was not a qualified foreign pension fund, a part of a qualified foreign pension fund, or a qualified controlled entity at any time during the testing period. The testing period with respect to OpCo is the period from January 1, 2023 (the date of OpCo's formation), to June 1, 2024 (the date of the disposition). Because OpCo was not a qualified foreign pension fund, a part of a qualified foreign pension fund, or a qualified controlled entity from January 1, 2023, to October 31, 2023, OpCo was not a qualified foreign pension fund, a part of a qualified foreign pension fund, or a qualified controlled entity at all times during the testing period. Accordingly, OpCo is not a qualified holder with respect to the disposition of Property A, and the $100x of gain recognized by OpCo is not exempt from tax under section 897(l), regardless of the amount of unrealized gain in Property A as of November 1, 2023.

Example 9: 48-month alternative test
—(i)
Facts.
Fund is a qualified foreign pension fund organized in Country C that, except as otherwise noted, meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Fund owns all the outstanding stock of OpCo, a manufacturing corporation organized in Country C and formed by Fund on January 1, 2023, in a qualified segregated account maintained by Fund. On January 30, 2023, OpCo purchased Property A, a United States real property interest, from a third party. OpCo either retains or distributes to Fund all of its net earnings, and upon dissolution, must distribute all of its assets to its stockholder (that is, Fund) after satisfaction of liabilities to its creditors. On June 1, 2027, OpCo realizes $100x of gain on the disposition of Property A. Fund reasonably expected to provide $90x of retirement and pension benefits and $100x of qualified benefits for the valuations that it performed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section on December 31, 2023, December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2025. Fund reasonably expected to provide $160x of retirement and pension benefits and $200x of qualified benefits for the valuation that it performed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section on December 31, 2026.
(ii)
Analysis.
In each of the years ending on December 31, 2023, December 31,
2024, and December 31, 2025, the valuation performed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section demonstrates that that the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section have been met because $90x of retirement and pension benefits constitutes 90 percent of the total $100x of qualified benefits. For the year ending on December 31, 2026, the valuation performed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section does not demonstrate that that the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section have been met because $160x of retirement and pension benefits constitutes only 80 percent of the total $200x of qualified benefits. Thus, Fund does not meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section for the year ending on December 31, 2026. However, under the 48-month alternative calculation in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section, Fund satisfies the requirement that it reasonably expects to provide 85 percent retirement and pension benefits to qualified recipients as of December 31, 2026. This is because when averaging the values (not percentages) of the qualified benefits and retirement and pension benefits that Fund reasonably expected to provide from the valuations performed over the preceding 48 months (including the most recent valuation), Fund divides the total retirement and pension benefits of $430x ($90x + $90x + $90x + $160x) by the total qualified benefits that it reasonably expected to provide of $500x ($100x + $100x + $100x + $200x) for an average of 86 percent. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
3
) of this section, Fund may rely on either the most recent present valuation described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section or the alternative calculation in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section, both of which are determined as of December 31, 2026. Because Fund satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section under the test in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section, even though it does not do so under the test in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section, Fund is a qualified foreign pension fund with respect to the disposition on June 1, 2027. Because OpCo is held by a qualified foreign pension fund as of the date of the disposition, OpCo is a qualified controlled entity within the meaning of paragraph (e)(9) of this section. Accordingly, the $100x of gain realized by OpCo is exempt from tax under section 897(l).
(10)
Example 10: 48-month alternative test with multiple valuations in the same year
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(9) of this section (Example 9), except that in the year ending December 31, 2023, Fund carried out two valuations pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section, one on June 30, 2023 and the second on December 31, 2023. For each valuation, Fund reasonably expected to provide $90x of retirement and pension benefits and $100x of qualified benefits. In addition, in the year ending on December 31, 2026, pursuant to a valuation carried out under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section, Fund reasonably expected to provide $150x retirement and pension benefits and $200x of qualified benefits.
(ii)
Analysis.
In each of the years ending on December 31, 2023, December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2025 (including the two valuations performed in 2023), the valuation performed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section demonstrates that the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section have been met because $90x of retirement and pension benefits constitutes 90 percent of the total $100x of qualified benefits. For the year ending on December 31, 2026, the valuation performed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section does not demonstrate that the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section have been met because $150x of retirement and pension benefits constitutes 75 percent of the total $200x of qualified benefits. Thus, Fund does not meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section for the year ending on December 31, 2026. Under the 48-month alternative calculation in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section, Fund also does not satisfy the requirement that it reasonably expects to provide 85 percent retirement and pension benefits to qualified recipients as of December 31, 2026. This is because when averaging the values (not percentages) of the qualified benefits and retirement and pension benefits
that Fund reasonably expected to provide from the valuations performed over the preceding 48 months (including the most recent valuation), Fund must use a weighted average whereby values are adjusted when the length of valuation periods differs. In this case, each of the two valuations in 2023 must be divided by two for a total weighted average for each valuation of $45x retirement and pension benefits and $50x of qualified benefits. When Fund then divides the total retirement and pension benefits that it reasonably expected to provide of $420x ($45x + $45x + $90x + $90x + $150x) by the total qualified benefits that it reasonably expected to provide of $500x ($50x + $50x + $100x + $100x + $200x), the average is 84 percent. Because Fund does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section under the test in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section or the test in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section, Fund is not a qualified foreign pension fund with respect to the disposition on June 1, 2027. Because OpCo is not held by a qualified foreign pension fund as of the date of the disposition, OpCo is not a qualified controlled entity within the meaning of paragraph (e)(9) of this section. Accordingly, the $100x of gain realized by OpCo is not exempt from tax under section 897(l).
(11)
Example 11: Qualified foreign pension fund as qualified holder
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(10) of this section (Example 10), except that OpCo does not dispose of Property A on June 1, 2027 and Fund reasonably expects to provide 85 percent of retirement and pension benefits to qualified recipients in the future in each of the annual present valuations it performs as of December 31, 2027 through December 31, 2033. Fund also satisfies the other requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section during this period. On April 1, 2029, Fund purchases Property B, a United States real property interest, and holds it in a qualified segregated account. On June 1, 2034, Fund realizes $100x of gain on the disposition of Property B and OpCo realizes $100x of gain on the disposition of Property A. At least 85 percent and no more than five percent of the actual value of the aggregate benefits provided by Fund before December 31, 2033, the most recent present value determination, were retirement and pension benefits and non-ancillary benefits, respectively.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) Because Fund reasonably expected to provide 85 percent of retirement and pension benefits to qualified recipients as of the valuation performed on December 31, 2033, and it met the other requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Fund is a qualified foreign pension fund under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
3
) of this section for the twelve months succeeding the most recent valuation, which includes June 1, 2034, the date of the disposition of Property A and Property B.
(B) Fund is a qualified holder under paragraph (d)(2) of this section because Fund did not own any United States real property interests as of December 31, 2027, the earliest date during the uninterrupted period ending on the date of the disposition, June 1, 2034, during which it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section and therefore qualified as a qualified foreign pension fund. Fund is eligible for the exemption under section 897(l) with respect to the disposition of Property B because it held Property B in a qualified segregated account. Thus, the $100x of gain realized by Fund on the disposition of Property B is exempt from tax under section 897(l).
(C) Because OpCo owned Property A, a United States real property interest, as of December 31, 2027, the earliest date during an uninterrupted period ending on the date of the disposition, June 1, 2034, during which it was a qualified controlled entity, OpCo cannot satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section and must instead satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section to be a qualified holder. The testing period with respect to OpCo, determined under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, ends on June 1, 2034 (the date of the disposition) and begins on June 1, 2024 (the date that is ten years before the disposition date). Because Fund failed to qualify as a qualified foreign pension fund as of December 31, 2026, OpCo was not continuously owned by a qualified foreign pension fund for the duration of the testing period, and thus
did not qualify as a qualified foreign pension fund, part of a qualified foreign pension fund, or a qualified controlled entity for the duration of the testing period. As a result, OpCo is not a qualified holder under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Accordingly, the $100x of gain recognized by OpCo on the disposition of Property A is not exempt from tax under section 897(l).
(12)
Example 12: Qualified controlled entity as qualified holder
—(i)
Facts.
Fund is a qualified foreign pension fund organized in Country C that meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023. Fund purchases an interest in Company A, a United States real property holding company, on June 1, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, Fund fails to satisfy the present valuation requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section and does not satisfy the alternative calculation under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section. From December 31, 2025, through December 31, 2030, Fund satisfies the present valuation requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section and meets all other requirements in paragraph (c)(2) of this section to be treated as a qualified foreign pension fund. On June 1, 2026, Fund purchases all of the stock of Company B, a Country C corporation that owns no United States real property interests and is not a qualified foreign pension fund, a part of a qualified foreign pension fund, or a qualified controlled entity. On January 1, 2027, Company B purchases Property D, a United States real property interest. Company B retains or distributes to Fund all of its net earnings, and upon dissolution, must distribute all of its assets to its stockholders (that is, Fund) after satisfaction of liabilities to its creditors. On June 1, 2031, Fund realizes $100x of gain on the disposition of stock in Company A, and Company B realizes $100x of gain on the disposition of Property D.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) Fund owned Company A, a United States real property holding company, as of December 31, 2025, the earliest date during an uninterrupted period ending on the date of the disposition, June 1, 2031, during which Fund satisfied the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Accordingly, to be a qualified holder, Fund must satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The testing period with respect to Fund, determined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, ends on June 1, 2031 (the date of disposition) and begins on June 1, 2021 (the date that is ten years before the disposition date). Fund is not a qualified holder because it failed to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section as of December 31, 2024 and, thus, has not satisfied the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section continuously for the duration of the testing period. Accordingly, the $100x of gain realized by Fund on the disposition of the stock of Company A is not exempt from tax under section 897(l).
(B) Although Fund is not a qualified holder as of June 1, 2031, the date of Company B's disposition of Property D, Fund is still a qualified foreign pension fund because it satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Company B is therefore a qualified controlled entity within the meaning of paragraph (e)(9) of this section as of June 1, 2031, because it is wholly owned by Fund, a qualified foreign pension fund. Notwithstanding that Fund is not a qualified holder under either paragraph (d)(2) or (3) of this section, Company B is a qualified holder under paragraph (d)(2) of this section because Company B did not own a United States real property interest as of June 1, 2026, the earliest date during an uninterrupted period ending on June 1, 2031 (the date of the disposition) during which Company B was a qualified controlled entity. Lastly, all of Company B's assets constitute a qualified segregated account. Accordingly, the $100x of gain realized by Company B on the disposition of Property D is exempt from tax under section 897(l).

# Income From Sources Without the United States

# foreign tax credit
§ 1.901-1
Allowance of credit for foreign income taxes.
(a)
In general.
Citizens of the United States, domestic corporations, certain aliens resident in the United States or Puerto Rico, and certain estates and trusts may choose to claim a credit, as provided in section 901, against the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) for certain taxes paid or accrued to foreign countries and possessions of the United States, subject to the conditions prescribed in this section.
(1)
Citizen of the United States.
An individual who is a citizen of the United States, whether resident or nonresident, may claim a credit for—
(i) The amount of any foreign income taxes, as defined in § 1.901-2(a), paid or accrued (as the case may be, depending on the individual's method of accounting for such taxes) during the taxable year;
(ii) The individual's share of any such taxes of a partnership of which the individual is a member, or of an estate or trust of which the individual is a beneficiary; and
(iii) In the case of an individual who has made an election under section 962, the taxes deemed to have been paid under section 960 (see § 1.962-1(b)(2)).
(2)
Domestic corporation.
A domestic corporation may claim a credit for—
(i) The amount of any foreign income taxes, as defined in § 1.901-2(a), paid or accrued (as the case may be, depending on the corporation's method of accounting for such taxes) during the taxable year;
(ii) The corporation's share of any such taxes of a partnership of which the corporation is a member, or of an estate or trust of which the corporation is a beneficiary; and
(iii) The taxes deemed to have been paid under section 960.
(3)
Alien resident of the United States or Puerto Rico.
Except as provided in a Presidential proclamation described in section 901(c), an individual who is a resident alien of the United States (as defined in section 7701(b)), or an individual who is a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico (as defined in section 937(a)) during the entire taxable year, may claim a credit for—
(i) The amount of any foreign income taxes, as defined in § 1.901-2(a), paid or accrued (as the case may be, depending on the individual's method of accounting for such taxes) during the taxable year;
(ii) The individual's share of any such taxes of a partnership of which the individual is a member, or of an estate or trust of which the individual is a beneficiary; and
(iii) In the case of an individual who has made an election under section 962, the taxes deemed to have been paid under section 960 (see § 1.962-1(b)(2)).
(4)
Estates and trusts.
An estate or trust may claim a credit for—
(i) The amount of any foreign income taxes, as defined in § 1.901-2(a), paid or accrued (as the case may be, depending on the estate or trust's method of accounting for such taxes) during the taxable year to the extent not allocable to and taken into account by its beneficiaries under paragraph (a)(1)(ii), (a)(2)(ii), or (a)(3)(ii) of this section (see section 642(a)); and
(ii) In the case of an estate or trust that has made an election under section 962, the taxes deemed to have been paid under section 960 (see § 1.962-1(b)(2)).
(b)
Limitations.
Certain Code sections, including sections 245A(d) and (e)(3),
814, 901(e) through (m), 904, 906, 907, 908, 909, 911, 965(g), 999, and 6038, reduce, defer, or otherwise limit the credit against the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code for certain amounts of foreign income taxes.
(c)
Deduction denied if credit claimed
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section, if a taxpayer chooses with respect to any taxable year to claim a credit under section 901 to any extent, such choice will apply to all of the foreign income taxes paid or accrued (as the case may be, depending on the taxpayer's method of accounting for such taxes) by the taxpayer in such taxable year, and no deduction from gross income is allowed for any portion of such taxes in any taxable year. See section 275(a)(4).
(2)
Exception for taxes not subject to section 275.
A deduction may be allowed under section 164(a)(3) for foreign income tax for which a credit is disallowed under any Code section and to which section 275 does not apply. See, for example, sections 901(f), 901(j)(3), 901(k)(7), 901(l)(4), 901(m)(6), and 908(b). For rules on the taxable year in which a deduction for foreign income taxes is allowed under section 164(a)(3), see §§ 1.446-1(c)(1)(ii), 1.461-2(a)(2), and 1.461-4(g)(6)(iii)(B).
(3)
Exception for taxes paid by an accrual basis taxpayer that relate to a prior year in which the taxpayer deducted foreign income taxes.
If a taxpayer claims a credit for foreign income taxes accrued in a taxable year (including a cash method taxpayer that elects under section 905(a) to claim a credit in the year the taxes accrue), a deduction may be claimed in that taxable year for additional foreign income taxes that are finally determined and paid as a result of a foreign tax redetermination in that taxable year if the additional foreign income taxes relate to a prior taxable year in which the taxpayer claimed a deduction, rather than a credit, for foreign income taxes paid or accrued (as the case may be, depending on the taxpayer's overall method of accounting) in that prior year.
(4)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(i)
Facts.
U.S.C. is a domestic corporation that is engaged in a trade or business in Country X through a branch. U.S.C. uses the accrual method of accounting and a calendar year for U.S. and Country X tax purposes. For taxable Years 1 through 3, U.S.C. deducted foreign income taxes accrued in those years. In Years 4 through 6, U.S.C. claimed a credit for foreign income taxes accrued in those years. In Year 6, U.S.C. paid an additional $50x tax to Country X that relates to Year 1 because of the close of a Country X tax audit.
(ii)
Analysis.
The additional $50x Country X tax paid by U.S.C. in Year 6 that relates to Year 1 cannot be claimed by U.S.C. as a deduction on an amended return for Year 1 because the additional tax accrued in Year 6. See section 461(f) (flush language); §§ 1.461-1(a)(2)(i) and 1.461-2(a)(2). In addition, because the additional $50x Country X tax relates to and is considered to accrue in Year 1 for foreign tax credit purposes, U.S.C. cannot claim a credit for the additional $50x Country X tax on its Federal income tax return for Year 6. See § 1.905-1(d)(1). However, pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, U.S.C. can claim a deduction for the additional $50x Country X tax that relates to Year 1 on its Federal income tax return for Year 6, even though it claims a credit for foreign income taxes that accrue in Year 6 and that relate to Year 6.
(d)
Period during which election can be made or changed
—(1)
In general.
The taxpayer may, for a particular taxable year, elect to claim a credit under section 901 (or claim a deduction in lieu of electing to claim a credit) at any time before the expiration of the period within which a claim for credit or refund of Federal income tax for such taxable year that is attributable to such credit or deduction, as the case may be, may be made (or, if longer, the period prescribed by section 6511(c) if the refund period for that taxable year is extended by an agreement to extend the assessment period under section 6501(c)(4)). Thus, an election to claim a credit for foreign income taxes paid or accrued (as the case may be, depending
on the taxpayer's method of accounting for such taxes) in a particular taxable year can be made within the period prescribed by section 6511(d)(3)(A) for claiming a credit or refund of Federal income tax for that taxable year that is attributable to a credit for the foreign income taxes paid or accrued in that particular taxable year or, if longer, the period prescribed by section 6511(c) with respect to that particular taxable year. A choice to claim a deduction under section 164(a)(3), rather than a credit under section 901, for foreign income taxes paid or accrued in a particular taxable year can be made within the period prescribed by section 6511(a) or 6511(c), as applicable, for claiming a credit or refund of Federal income tax for that particular taxable year.
(2)
Manner in which election is made or changed.
A taxpayer claims a deduction or a credit for foreign income taxes paid or accrued in a particular taxable year by filing an original or amended return for that taxable year within the relevant period specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. A claim for a credit shall be accompanied by Form 1116 in the case of an individual, estate or trust, and by Form 1118 in the case of a corporation (and an individual, estate or trust making an election under section 962). See §§ 1.905-3 and 1.905-4 for rules requiring the filing of amended returns for all affected years when a timely change in the taxpayer's election to claim a deduction or credit results in U.S. tax deficiencies.
(e)
Joint return.
In the case of spouses making a joint return, credit for taxes paid or accrued to any foreign country or to any possession of the United States shall be computed upon the basis of the total taxes so paid by or accrued against the spouses.
(f)
Taxes against which credit is allowed.
The credit for foreign income taxes is allowed only against the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code. The credit is not allowed against a tax that, under section 26(b)(2), is not treated as a tax imposed by such chapter.
(g)
Taxpayers to whom credit not allowed.
Among those to whom the credit for taxes is not allowed are the following:
(1) Except as provided in section 906, a foreign corporation.
(2) Except as provided in section 906, a nonresident alien individual who is not described in section 876 (see sections 874(c) and 901(b)(4)).
(3) A nonresident alien individual described in section 876 other than a bona fide resident (as defined in section 937(a) and the regulations under that section) of Puerto Rico during the entire taxable year (see sections 901(b)(3) and (4)).
(4) A U.S. citizen or resident alien individual who is a bona fide resident of a section 931 possession (as defined in § 1.931-1(c)(1)), the U.S. Virgin Islands, or Puerto Rico, and who excludes certain income from U.S. gross income to the extent of taxes allocable to the income so excluded (see sections 931(b)(2), 933(1), and 932(c)(4)).
(h)
Taxpayers denied credit in a particular taxable year.
Taxpayers who are denied the credit for taxes for particular taxable years are the following:
(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section, a taxpayer that claims a deduction for foreign income taxes paid or accrued (as the case may be, depending on the taxpayer's method of accounting for such taxes) for that taxable year (see sections 164 and 275); and
(2) A regulated investment company which has exercised the election under section 853.
(i)
Dividends from a DISC treated as foreign.
For purposes of sections 901 through 906 and the regulations thereunder, any amount treated as a dividend from a corporation which is a DISC or former DISC (as defined in section 992(a) (1) or (3) as the case may be) will be treated as a dividend from a foreign corporation to the extent such dividend is treated under section 861(a)(2)(D) as income from sources without the United States.

§ 1.901-2
Income, war profits, or excess profits tax paid or accrued.
(a)
Definition of foreign income tax
—(1)
Overview and scope.
Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section define a foreign income tax for purposes of section 901. Paragraph (c) of this section is reserved. Paragraph (d) of this section contains rules describing what constitutes a separate levy. Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules for determining the amount of foreign income tax paid by a taxpayer. Paragraph (f) of this section contains rules for determining by whom foreign income tax is paid. Paragraph (g) of this section defines the terms used in this section, and in particular provides that the term “paid” means “paid” or “accrued,” depending on the taxpayer's method of accounting for foreign income taxes. Paragraph (h) of this section provides the applicability date for this section.
(i)
In general.
Section 901 allows a credit for the amount of income, war profits, and excess profits taxes paid during the taxable year to any foreign country, and section 903 provides that for purposes of Part III of subchapter N of the Code and sections 164(a) and 275(a), such taxes include a tax paid in lieu of a tax on income, war profits or excess profits that is otherwise generally imposed by a foreign country (collectively, for purposes of this section, a “foreign income tax”). Whether a foreign levy is a foreign income tax is determined independently for each separate levy. A foreign tax either is or is not a foreign income tax, in its entirety, for all persons subject to the foreign tax.
(ii)
Requirements.
A foreign levy is a foreign income tax only if—
(A) It is a foreign tax; and
(B) Either:
(
1
) The foreign tax is a net income tax, as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section; or
(
2
) The foreign tax is a tax in lieu of an income tax, as defined in § 1.903-1(b).
(iii)
Coordination with treaties.
A foreign levy that is treated as an income tax under the relief from double taxation article of an income tax treaty entered into by the United States and the foreign country imposing the levy is a foreign income tax if the levy is, as determined under such income tax treaty, paid by a citizen or resident of the United States that elects benefits under the treaty. In addition, a foreign levy (including a foreign levy paid by a controlled foreign corporation) that is modified by an applicable income tax treaty to which the foreign country imposing the levy is a party may qualify as a foreign income tax notwithstanding that the unmodified foreign levy does not satisfy the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section or the requirements of § 1.903-1(b) if the levy, as modified by such treaty, satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section or the requirements of § 1.903-1(b). See paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section for rules treating as a separate levy a foreign tax that is limited in its application or otherwise modified by the terms of an income tax treaty to which the foreign country imposing the tax is a party.
(2)
Tax
—(i)
In general.
A foreign levy is a tax if it requires a compulsory payment pursuant to the authority of a foreign country to levy taxes. A penalty, fine, interest, or similar obligation is not a tax, nor is a customs duty a tax. Whether a foreign levy requires a compulsory payment pursuant to a foreign country's authority to levy taxes is determined by principles of U.S. law and not by principles of law of the foreign country. Therefore, the assertion by a foreign country that a levy is pursuant to the foreign country's authority to levy taxes is not determinative that, under U.S. principles, it is pursuant thereto. Notwithstanding any assertion of a foreign country to the contrary, a foreign levy is not pursuant to a foreign country's authority to levy taxes, and thus is not a tax, to the extent a person subject to the levy receives (or will receive), directly or indirectly, a specific economic benefit (as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) from the foreign country in exchange for payment pursuant to the levy. Rather, to that extent, such levy requires a compulsory payment in exchange for such specific economic benefit. If, applying U.S. principles, a foreign levy requires
a compulsory payment pursuant to the authority of a foreign country to levy taxes and also requires a compulsory payment in exchange for a specific economic benefit, the levy is considered to have two distinct elements: A tax and a requirement of compulsory payment in exchange for such specific economic benefit. In such a situation, these two distinct elements of the foreign levy (and the amount paid pursuant to each such element) must be separated. No credit is allowable for a payment pursuant to a foreign levy by a dual capacity taxpayer (as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section) unless the person claiming such credit establishes the amount that is paid pursuant to the distinct element of the foreign levy that is a tax. See paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section and § 1.901-2A.
(ii)
Dual capacity taxpayers
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of this section and §§ 1.901-2A and 1.903-1, a person who is subject to a levy of a foreign state or of a possession of the United States or of a political subdivision of such a state or possession and who also, directly or indirectly (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(E) of this section) receives (or will receive) a specific economic benefit from the state or possession or from a political subdivision of such state or possession or from an agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing is referred to as a “dual capacity taxpayer.” Dual capacity taxpayers are subject to the special rules of § 1.901-2A.
(B)
Specific economic benefit.
For purposes of this section and §§ 1.901-2A and 1.903-1, the term “specific economic benefit” means an economic benefit that is not made available on substantially the same terms to substantially all persons who are subject to the income tax that is generally imposed by the foreign country, or, if there is no such generally imposed income tax, an economic benefit that is not made available on substantially the same terms to the population of the country in general. Thus, a concession to extract government-owned petroleum is a specific economic benefit, but the right to travel or to ship freight on a government-owned airline is not, because the latter, but not the former, is made generally available on substantially the same terms. An economic benefit includes property; a service; a fee or other payment; a right to use, acquire or extract resources, patents or other property that a foreign country owns or controls (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(D) of this section); or a reduction or discharge of a contractual obligation. It does not include the right or privilege merely to engage in business generally or to engage in business in a particular form.
(C)
Pension, unemployment, and disability fund payments.
A foreign levy imposed on individuals to finance retirement, old-age, death, survivor, unemployment, illness, or disability benefits, or for some substantially similar purpose, is not a requirement of compulsory payment in exchange for a specific economic benefit, as long as the amounts required to be paid by the individuals subject to the levy are not computed on a basis reflecting the respective ages, life expectancies or similar characteristics of such individuals.
(D)
Control of property.
A foreign country controls property that it does not own if the country exhibits substantial indicia of ownership with respect to the property, for example, by both regulating the quantity of property that may be extracted and establishing the minimum price at which it may be disposed of.
(E)
Indirect receipt of a benefit.
A person is considered to receive a specific economic benefit indirectly if another person receives a specific economic benefit and that other person—
(
1
) Owns or controls, directly or indirectly, the first person or is owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the first person or by the same persons that own or control, directly or indirectly, the first person; or
(
2
) Engages in a transaction with the first person under terms and conditions such that the first person receives, directly or indirectly, all or part of the value of the specific economic benefit.
(3)
Net income tax.
A foreign tax is a net income tax only if the foreign tax meets the net gain requirement in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Net gain requirement
—(1)
In general.
A foreign tax satisfies the net gain requirement only if the tax satisfies
the realization, gross receipts, cost recovery, and attribution requirements in paragraphs (b)(2), (3), (4), and (5) of this section, respectively, or if the foreign tax is a surtax described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. Paragraphs (b)(2) through (6) of this section are applied with respect to a foreign tax solely on the basis of the foreign tax law governing the calculation of the foreign taxable base, unless otherwise provided, and without any consideration of the rate of tax imposed on the foreign taxable base.
(2)
Realization requirement
—(i)
In general.
A foreign tax satisfies the realization requirement if it is imposed upon one or more of the events described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section. If a foreign tax meets the realization requirement in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section except with respect to one or more specific and defined classes of nonrealization events (such as, for example, imputed rental income from a personal residence used by the owner), and as judged based on the application of the foreign tax to all taxpayers subject to the foreign tax, the incidence and amounts of gross receipts attributable to such nonrealization events is insignificant relative to the incidence and amounts of gross receipts attributable to events covered by the foreign tax that do meet the realization requirement, then the foreign tax is treated as meeting the realization requirement in paragraph (b)(2) of this section (despite the fact that the foreign tax is also imposed on the basis of some nonrealization events, and that some persons subject to the foreign tax may only be taxed on nonrealization events).
(A)
Realization events.
The foreign tax is imposed upon or after the occurrence of events (“realization events”) that result in the realization of income under the income tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
(B)
Pre-realization recapture events.
The foreign tax is imposed upon the occurrence of an event before a realization event (a “pre-realization event”) that results in the recapture (in whole or part) of a tax deduction, tax credit, or other tax allowance previously accorded to the taxpayer (for example, the recapture of an incentive tax credit if required investments are not completed within a specified period).
(C)
Pre-realization timing difference events.
The foreign tax is imposed upon the occurrence of a pre-realization event, other than one described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, but only if the foreign country does not, upon the occurrence of a later event, impose tax under the same or a separate levy (a “second tax”) on the same taxpayer (for purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C), treating a disregarded entity as defined in § 301.7701-3(b)(2)(i)(C) of this chapter as a taxpayer separate from its owner), with respect to the income on which tax is imposed by reason of such pre-realization event (or, if it does impose a second tax, a credit or other comparable relief is available against the liability for such a second tax for tax paid on the occurrence of the pre-realization event) and—
(
1
) The imposition of the tax upon such pre-realization event is based on the difference in the fair market value of property at the beginning and end of a period;
(
2
) The pre-realization event is the physical transfer, processing, or export of readily marketable property (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section) and the imposition of the tax upon the pre-realization event is based on the fair market value of such property; or
(
3
) The pre-realization event relates to a deemed distribution (for example, by a corporation to a shareholder) or inclusion (for example, under a controlled foreign corporation inclusion regime) of amounts (such as earnings and profits) that meet the realization requirement in paragraph (b)(2) of this section in the hands of the person that, under foreign tax law, is deemed to distribute such amounts.
(ii)
Readily marketable property.
Property is readily marketable if—
(A) It is stock in trade or other property of a kind that properly would be included in inventory if on hand at the close of the taxable year or if it is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, and
(B) It can be sold on the open market without further processing or it is exported from the foreign country.
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (b)(2) of this section:
(A)
Example 1.
Residents of Country X are subject to a tax of 10 percent on the aggregate net appreciation in fair market value during the calendar year of all shares of stock held by them at the end of the year. In addition, all such residents are subject to a Country X tax that qualifies as a net income tax within the meaning of paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Included in the base of the net income tax are gains and losses realized on the sale of stock, and the basis of stock for purposes of determining such gain or loss is its cost. The operation of the stock appreciation tax and the net income tax as applied to sales of stock is exemplified as follows: A, a resident of Country X, purchases stock in June of Year 1 for 100u (units of Country X currency) and sells it in May of Year 3 for 160u. On December 31, Year 1, the stock is worth 120u and on December 31, Year 2, it is worth 155u. Pursuant to the stock appreciation tax, A pays 2u for Year 1 (10 percent of (120u−100u)), 3.5u for Year 2 (10 percent of (155u−120u)), and nothing for Year 3 because no stock was held at the end of that year. For purposes of the net income tax, A must include 60u (160u−100u) in his income for Year 3, the year of sale. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section, the stock appreciation tax does not satisfy the realization requirement because Country X imposes a second tax upon the occurrence of a later event (that is, the sale of stock) with respect to the income that was taxed by the stock appreciation tax and no credit or comparable relief is available against such second tax for the stock appreciation tax paid.
(B)
Example 2.
The facts are the same as those in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that if stock was held on the December 31 last preceding the date of its sale, the basis of such stock for purposes of computing gain or loss under the net income tax is the value of the stock on such December 31. Thus, in Year 3, A includes only 5u (160u−155u) as income from the sale for purposes of the net income tax. Because the net income tax imposed upon the occurrence of a later event (the sale) does not impose a tax with respect to the income that was taxed by the stock appreciation tax, under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section, the stock appreciation tax satisfies the realization requirement. The result would be the same if, instead of a basis adjustment to reflect taxation pursuant to the stock appreciation tax, the Country X net income tax allowed a credit (or other comparable relief) to take account of the stock appreciation tax. If a credit mechanism is used, see also paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section.
(C)
Example 3.
Country X imposes a tax on the realized net income of corporations that do business in Country X. Country X also imposes a branch profits tax on corporations organized under the law of a country other than Country X that do business in Country X. The branch profits tax is imposed when realized net income is remitted or deemed to be remitted by branches in Country X to home offices outside of Country X. Because the branch profits tax is imposed subsequent to the occurrence of events that would result in realization of income by corporations subject to such tax under the income tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section the branch profits tax satisfies the realization requirement.
(D)
Example 4.
Country X imposes a tax on the realized net income of corporations that do business in Country X (the “Country X corporate tax”). Country X also imposes a separate tax on shareholders of such corporations (the “Country X shareholder tax”). The Country X shareholder tax is imposed on the sum of the actual distributions received during the taxable year by such a shareholder from the corporation's realized net income for that year (that is, income from past years is not taxed in a later year when it is actually distributed) plus the distributions deemed to be received by such a shareholder. Deemed distributions are defined as a shareholder's pro rata share of the corporation's realized net income for the taxable year, less such shareholder's pro rata share of the corporation's Country X corporate tax for that year, less actual distributions made by such corporation to such shareholder from such net income. A
shareholder's receipt of actual distributions is a realization event within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section. The deemed distributions are not realization events, but they are described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C)(
3
) of this section. Accordingly, the Country X shareholder tax satisfies the realization requirement.
(3)
Gross receipts requirement
—(i)
Rule.
A foreign tax satisfies the gross receipts requirement if it is imposed on the basis of the amounts described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (D) of this section.
(A) Actual gross receipts.
(B) In the case of either an insignificant nonrealization event described in the second sentence of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section or a realization event described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section that does not result in actual gross receipts, deemed gross receipts in an amount that is reasonably calculated to produce an amount that is not greater than fair market value.
(C) Deemed gross receipts in the amount of a tax deduction that is recaptured by reason of a pre-realization recapture event described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
(D) The amount of deemed gross receipts arising from pre-realization timing difference events described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.
(A)
Example 1: Cost-plus tax
—(
1
)
Facts.
Country X imposes a “cost-plus tax” on Country X corporations that serve as regional headquarters companies for affiliated nonresident corporations, and this tax is a separate levy (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this section). A headquarters company for purposes of this tax is a corporation that performs administrative, management or coordination functions solely for nonresident affiliated entities. Due to the difficulty of determining on a case-by-case basis the arm's length gross receipts that headquarters companies would charge affiliates for such services, gross receipts of a headquarters company are deemed, for purposes of this tax, to equal 110 percent of the business expenses incurred by the headquarters company.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Because the cost-plus tax is based on costs and not on actual gross receipts, the cost-plus tax does not satisfy the gross receipts requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.
(B)
Example 2: Actual gross receipts determined under appropriate transfer pricing methodology
—(
1
)
Facts.
Country X imposes a tax on resident corporations that meets the attribution requirement of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. The Country X tax is based on actual gross receipts, including gross receipts recorded on the taxpayer's books and records as due from related and unrelated persons. Corporation A, a resident of Country X, properly determines the arm's length transfer price for services provided to related persons using a cost-plus methodology, recording on its books and records receivables for the arm's length amounts due from those related persons and using those amounts to determine the realized gross receipts included in the base of the Country X tax.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Because the Country X tax is based on actual gross receipts, it satisfies the gross receipts requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.
(C)
Example 3: Petroleum taxed on extraction
—(
1
)
Facts.
Country X imposes a tax that is a separate levy (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this section) on income from the extraction of petroleum. Under the terms of that tax, gross receipts from extraction income are deemed to equal 105 percent of the fair market value of petroleum extracted.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Because it is imposed on deemed gross receipts that exceed the fair market value of the petroleum extracted, the tax on extraction income does not satisfy the gross receipts requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.
(4)
Cost recovery requirement
—(i)
Costs and expenses that must be recovered
—(A)
In general.
A foreign tax satisfies the cost recovery requirement if the base of the tax is computed by reducing gross receipts (as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) to permit recovery of the significant costs and
expenses (including capital expenditures) described in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C) of this section attributable, under reasonable principles, to such gross receipts. A foreign tax need not permit recovery of significant costs and expenses, such as certain personal expenses, that are not attributable, under reasonable principles, to gross receipts included in the foreign taxable base. A foreign tax whose base is gross receipts, with no reduction for costs and expenses, satisfies the cost recovery requirement only if there are no significant costs and expenses attributable to the gross receipts included in the foreign tax base that must be recovered under the rules of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C)(
1
) of this section. See paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A) of this section (
Example 1
). A foreign tax that provides an alternative cost allowance satisfies the cost recovery requirement only as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of this section. See paragraph (b)(4)(i)(D) of this section for rules regarding principles for attributing costs and expenses to gross receipts.
(B)
Alternative cost allowances
—(
1
)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B)(
2
) of this section, if foreign tax law does not permit recovery of one or more significant costs and expenses in computing the base of the foreign tax but provides an alternative cost allowance, the foreign tax satisfies the cost recovery requirement only if the alternative allowance permits recovery of an amount that by its terms may be greater, but can never be less, than the actual amounts of such significant costs and expenses (for example, under a provision identical to percentage depletion allowed under section 613). If foreign tax law provides an optional alternative cost allowance or an election to recover costs and expenses under an alternative method, the foreign tax satisfies the cost recovery requirement if the foreign tax law also expressly provides an option to recover actual costs and expenses. See § 1.901-2(e)(5) for rules limiting the amount of foreign income tax paid to the amount due under the option that minimizes the taxpayer's liability for foreign income tax over time. If foreign tax law provides an alternative cost allowance that does not by its terms permit recovery of an amount equal to or greater than the actual amounts of significant costs and expenses, the foreign tax does not satisfy the cost recovery requirement, even if, in practice, the amounts recovered under the alternative allowance equal or exceed the amount of actual costs and expenses.
(
2
)
Small business exception.
If foreign tax law provides an alternative method for determining the amount of costs and expenses allowed in computing the taxable base of small business enterprises, the foreign tax satisfies the cost recovery requirement if the foreign tax law contains reasonable limits on the maximum size of business enterprises to which the alternative cost allowance applies (for example, business enterprises having asset values or annual gross revenues below specified thresholds). See paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(B) of this section (
Example 2
).
(C)
Significant costs and expenses
—(
1
)
Amounts that must be recovered.
Whether a cost or expense is significant for purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(i) is determined based on whether, for all taxpayers in the aggregate to which the foreign tax applies, the item of cost or expense constitutes a significant portion of the taxpayers' total costs and expenses. Costs and expenses (as characterized under foreign law) related to capital expenditures, interest, rents, royalties, wages or other payments for services, and research and experimentation are always treated as significant costs or expenses for purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(i). Significant costs and expenses (such as interest expense) are not considered to be recovered by reason of the time value of money attributable to the acceleration of a tax benefit or other economic benefit attributable to the timing of the recovery of other costs and expenses (such as the current expensing of debt-financed capital expenditures). Foreign tax law is considered to permit recovery of significant costs and expenses even if recovery of all or a portion of certain costs or expenses is disallowed, if such disallowance is consistent with any principle underlying the disallowances required under the Internal Revenue Code, including the principles of limiting base erosion or profit shifting and public policy concerns. For example, a
foreign tax is considered to permit recovery of significant costs and expenses if the foreign tax law limits interest deductions based on a measure of taxable income (determined either before or after depreciation and amortization), disallows deductions in connection with hybrid transactions, disallows deductions attributable to gross receipts that in whole or in part are excluded, exempt or eliminated from taxable income, or disallows certain deductions based on public policy considerations similar to those underlying the disallowances contained in section 162. See paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(C) of this section (
Example 3
).
(
2
)
Amounts that need not be recovered.
A foreign tax is considered to permit recovery of significant costs and expenses even if the foreign tax law does not permit recovery of any costs and expenses attributable to wage income or to investment income that is not derived from a trade or business. In addition, in determining whether a foreign tax (the “tested foreign tax”) meets the cost recovery requirement, it is immaterial whether the tested foreign tax allows a deduction for other taxes that would qualify as foreign income taxes (determined without regard to whether such other tax allows a deduction for the tested foreign tax). See paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(D) and (E) of this section (
Examples 4
and
5
).
(
3
)
Timing of recovery.
A foreign tax law permits recovery of significant costs and expenses even if such costs and expenses are recovered earlier or later than they are recovered under the Internal Revenue Code unless the time of recovery is so much later as effectively to constitute a denial of such recovery. The amount of costs and expenses that is recovered under the foreign tax law is neither discounted nor augmented by taking into account the time value of money attributable to any acceleration or deferral of a tax benefit resulting from the foreign law cost recovery method compared to when tax would be paid under the Internal Revenue Code. Therefore, a foreign tax satisfies the cost recovery requirement if items deductible under the Internal Revenue Code are capitalized under the foreign tax law and recovered either immediately, on a recurring basis over time, or upon the occurrence of some future event (for example, upon the property becoming worthless or being disposed of), or if the recovery of items capitalized under the Internal Revenue Code occurs more or less rapidly than under the foreign tax law.
(D)
Attribution of costs and expenses to gross receipts.
Principles used in the foreign tax law to attribute costs and expenses to gross receipts may be reasonable even if they differ from principles that apply under the Internal Revenue Code (for example, principles that apply under section 265, 465 or 861(b) of the Internal Revenue Code). See also paragraph (b)(5) of this section for additional requirements relating to foreign tax law rules for attributing costs and expenses to gross receipts.
(ii)
Consolidation of profits and losses.
In determining whether a foreign tax satisfies the cost recovery requirement, one of the factors to be taken into account is whether, in computing the base of the tax, a loss incurred in one activity (for example, a contract area in the case of oil and gas exploration) in a trade or business is allowed to offset profit earned by the same person in another activity (for example, a separate contract area) in the same trade or business. If such an offset is allowed, it is immaterial whether the offset may be made in the taxable period in which the loss is incurred or only in a different taxable period, unless the period is such that under the circumstances there is effectively a denial of the ability to offset the loss against profit. In determining whether a foreign tax satisfies the cost recovery requirement, it is immaterial that no such offset is allowed if a loss incurred in one such activity may be applied to offset profit earned in that activity in a different taxable period, unless the period is such that under the circumstances there is effectively a denial of the ability to offset such loss against profit. In determining whether a foreign tax satisfies the cost recovery requirement, it is immaterial whether a person's profits and losses from one trade or business (for example, oil and gas extraction) are allowed to offset its profits and losses from another trade
or business (for example, oil and gas refining and processing), or whether a person's business profits and losses and its passive investment profits and losses are allowed to offset each other in computing the base of the foreign tax. Moreover, it is immaterial whether foreign tax law permits or prohibits consolidation of profits and losses of related persons, unless foreign tax law requires separate entities to be used to carry on separate activities in the same trade or business. If foreign tax law requires that separate entities carry on such separate activities, the determination whether the cost recovery requirement is satisfied is made by applying the same considerations as if such separate activities were carried on by a single entity.
(iii)
Carryovers.
In determining whether a foreign tax satisfies the cost recovery requirement, it is immaterial, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, whether losses incurred during one taxable period may be carried over to offset profits incurred in different taxable periods.
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(A)
Example 1: Tax on gross interest income of certain residents; no deductions allowed
—(
1
)
Facts.
Country X imposes a net income tax on corporations resident in Country X. Country X imposes a second tax (the “bank tax”) of 1 percent on the gross amount of interest income derived by banks resident in Country X; no deductions are allowed in determining the base of the bank tax. Banks resident in Country X incur substantial costs and expenses, including interest expense, attributable to their interest income.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Because the terms of the bank tax do not permit recovery of significant costs and expenses attributable to the gross receipts included in the tax base, the bank tax does not satisfy the cost recovery requirement of paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section.
(B)
Example 2: Small business alternative allowance
—(
1
)
Facts.
Country X imposes a tax on the income of corporations resident in Country X. Under Country X tax law, corporations are generally allowed to deduct actual costs and expenses attributable to the realized gross receipts included in the Country X tax base. However, in lieu of deductions for actual costs and expenses, businesses with gross revenues of less than the Country X currency equivalent of $500,000 are allowed a flat cost allowance of 50 percent of gross revenues.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B)(
2
) of this section, the alternative cost allowance for small businesses provided under Country X tax law satisfies the cost recovery requirement.
(C)
Example 3: Permissible deduction disallowance
—(
1
)
Facts.
Country X imposes a tax on the income of corporations resident in Country X. Under Country X tax law, deductions for the significant costs and expenses attributable to the gross receipts included in the Country X tax base are allowed, except that deductions for interest expense incurred by corporations are limited to 30 percent of the corporation's earnings before income taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and unused interest expense may be carried forward for a period of 5 years. In addition, Country X tax law contains anti-hybrid rules that deny deductions for interest, royalties, rents, and services payments made by a Country X resident to a related entity outside Country X that is treated as a transparent entity in the jurisdiction in which it is organized but as a separate entity in the jurisdiction of the entity's owners (a “reverse hybrid entity”) to the extent that the payment is not included in the income of the reverse hybrid entity or its owners.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C)(
1
) of this section, costs and expenses related to interest, rents, royalties, and payments for services are treated as significant costs or expenses that must be recoverable under Country X tax law. However, because the interest expense limitation rule and the anti-hybrid rules in Country X tax law are consistent with the principles underlying the disallowances required under the Internal Revenue Code (namely, section 163(j) and section 267A), the Country X tax satisfies the cost recovery requirement.

Example 4:
Gross basis tax on wages

)
Facts.
A foreign country imposes payroll tax on resident employees at the rate of 10 percent of the amount of gross wages; no deductions are allowed in computing the base of the payroll tax.
(

)
Analysis.
Although the foreign tax law does not allow for the recovery of any costs and expenses attributable to gross receipts included in the taxable base, under paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C)(
2
) of this section, because the only gross receipts included in the taxable base are from wages, the payroll tax satisfies the cost recovery requirement.
(E)
Example 5: No deduction for another net income tax
—(
1
)
Facts.
Each of Country X and Province Y (a political subdivision of Country X) imposes a tax on resident corporations, called the “Country X income tax” and the “Province Y income tax,” respectively. Each tax has an identical base, which is computed by reducing a corporation's realized gross receipts by deductions that, based on the laws of Country X and Province Y, generally permit recovery of the significant costs and expenses (including significant capital expenditures) that are attributable under reasonable principles to such gross receipts. However, the Country X income tax does not allow a deduction for the Province Y income tax for which a taxpayer is liable, nor does the Province Y income tax allow a deduction for the Country X income tax for which a taxpayer is liable.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, each of the Country X income tax and the Province Y income tax is a separate levy. Without regard to whether the Province Y income tax may allow a deduction for the Country X income tax, and without regard to whether the Country X income tax may allow a deduction for the Province Y income tax, both taxes would qualify as net income taxes under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Therefore, under paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C)(
2
) of this section the fact that neither levy's base allows a deduction for the other levy is immaterial, and both levies satisfy the cost recovery requirement.
(5)
Attribution requirement.
A foreign tax satisfies the attribution requirement if the amount of gross receipts and costs that are included in the base of the foreign tax are determined based on rules described in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section (with respect to a separate levy imposed on nonresidents of the foreign country) or paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section (with respect to a separate levy imposed on residents of the foreign country).
(i)
Tax on nonresidents.
The gross receipts and costs attributable to each of the items of income of nonresidents of a foreign country that is included in the base of the foreign tax must satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A), (B), or (C) of this section.
(A)
Income attribution based on activities.
The gross receipts and costs that are included in the base of the foreign tax are limited to gross receipts and costs that are attributable, under reasonable principles, to the nonresident's activities within the foreign country imposing the foreign tax (including the nonresident's functions, assets, and risks located in the foreign country). For purposes of the preceding sentence, attribution of gross receipts under reasonable principles includes rules similar to those for determining effectively connected income under section 864(c) but does not include rules that take into account as a significant factor the mere location of customers, users, or any other similar destination-based criterion, or the mere location of persons from whom the nonresident makes purchases in the foreign country. In addition, for purposes of the first sentence of this paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A), reasonable principles do not include rules that deem the existence of a trade or business or permanent establishment based on the activities of another person (other than an agent or other person acting on behalf of the nonresident or a pass-through entity of which the nonresident is an owner), or that attribute gross receipts or costs to a nonresident based upon the activities of another person (other than an agent or other person acting on behalf of the nonresident or a pass-through entity of which the nonresident is an owner).
(B)
Income attribution based on source.
The amount of gross income arising from gross receipts (other than gross receipts from sales or other dispositions of property) that is included in
the base of the foreign tax on the basis of source (instead of on the basis of activities or the situs of property as described in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) and (C) of this section) is limited to gross income arising from sources within the foreign country that imposes the tax, and the sourcing rules of the foreign tax law are reasonably similar to the sourcing rules that apply under the Internal Revenue Code. A foreign tax law's application of such sourcing rules need not conform in all respects to the application of those sourcing rules for Federal income tax purposes. For purposes of determining whether the sourcing rules of the foreign tax law are reasonably similar to the sourcing rules that apply under the Internal Revenue Code, the character of gross income arising from gross receipts is determined under the foreign tax law (except as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B)(
3
) of this section), and the following rules apply:
(
1
)
Services.
Under the foreign tax law, gross income from services must be sourced based on where the services are performed, as determined under reasonable principles (which do not include determining the place of performance of the services based on the location of the service recipient).
(
2
)
Royalties.
A foreign tax on gross income from royalties must be sourced based on the place of use of, or the right to use, the intangible property.
(
3
)
Sales of property.
Gross income arising from gross receipts from sales or other dispositions of property (including copyrighted articles sold through an electronic medium) must be included in the foreign tax base on the basis of the rules in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) or (C) of this section, and not on the basis of source. In the case of sales of copyrighted articles (as determined under rules similar to § 1.861-18), a foreign tax satisfies the attribution requirement of paragraph (b)(5) of this section only if the transaction is treated as a sale of tangible property and not as a license of intangible property.
(C)
Attribution based on situs of property.
A foreign tax on gains of nonresidents from the sale or disposition of property, including shares in a corporation or an interest in a partnership or other pass-through entity, based on the situs of property satisfies the attribution requirement only as provided in this paragraph (b)(5)(i)(C). The amount of gross receipts from the sale or disposition of property that is included in the base of the foreign tax on the basis of the situs of real property (instead of on the basis of activities as described in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) of this section) may only include gross receipts that are attributable to the disposition of real property situated in the foreign country imposing the foreign tax (or an interest in a resident corporation or other entity that owns such real property) under rules reasonably similar to the rules in section 897. The amount of gross receipts from the sale or disposition of property other than shares in a corporation, including an interest in a partnership or other pass-through entity, that is included in the base of the foreign tax on the basis of the situs of property other than real property may only include gross receipts that are attributable to property forming part of the business property of a taxable presence in the foreign country imposing the foreign tax under rules that are reasonably similar to the rules in section 864(c).
(ii)
Tax on residents.
The base of a foreign tax imposed on residents of the foreign country imposing the foreign tax may include all of the worldwide gross receipts of the resident. The foreign tax law must provide that any allocation to or from the resident of income, gain, deduction, or loss with respect to transactions between such resident and organizations, trades, or businesses owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests (that is, any allocation made pursuant to the foreign country's transfer pricing rules) is determined under arm's length principles, without taking into account as a significant factor the location of customers, users, or any other similar destination-based criterion.
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
(A)
Example 1
—(
1
)
Facts.
Country X imposes a separate levy on nonresident companies that furnish, from a location outside of Country X, specified
types of electronically supplied services to users located in Country X (the “ESS tax”). The base of the ESS tax is computed by taking the nonresident company's overall net income related to supplying electronically supplied services, and deeming a portion of such net income to be attributable to a deemed permanent establishment of the nonresident company in Country X. The amount of the nonresident company's net income attributable to the deemed permanent establishment is determined on a formulary basis based on the percentage of the nonresident company's total users that are located in Country X.
(
2
)
Analysis.
The taxable base of the ESS tax is not computed based on a nonresident company's activities located in Country X, but instead takes into account the location of the nonresident company's users. Therefore, the ESS tax does not meet the requirement in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) of this section. The ESS tax also does not meet the requirement in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section because it is not imposed on the basis of source, and it does not meet the requirement in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(C) of this section because it is not imposed on the sale or other disposition of property.
(B)
Example 2
—(
1
)
Facts.
The facts are the same as those in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(A)(
1
) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that instead of imposing the ESS tax by deeming nonresident companies to have a permanent establishment in Country X, Country X treats gross income from electronically supplied services provided to users located in Country X as sourced in Country X. The gross income sourced to Country X is reduced by costs that are reasonably attributed to such gross income, to arrive at the taxable base of the ESS tax. The amount of the nonresident's gross income and costs that are sourced to Country X is determined by multiplying the nonresident's total gross income and costs by the percentage of its total users that are located in Country X.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Country X tax law's rule for sourcing electronically supplied services is not based on where the services are performed and is instead based on the location of the service recipient. Therefore, the ESS tax, which is imposed on the basis of source, does not meet the requirement in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section. The ESS tax also does not meet the requirement in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) of this section because it is not imposed on the basis of a nonresident's activities located in Country X, and it does not meet the requirement in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(C) of this section because it is not imposed on the sale or other disposition of property.
(6)
Surtax on net income tax.
A foreign tax satisfies the net gain requirement in this paragraph (b) if the base of the foreign tax is the amount of a net income tax. For example, if a tax (surtax) is computed as a percentage of a separate levy that is itself a net income tax, then such surtax is considered to satisfy the net gain requirement.
(c) [Reserved]
(d)
Separate levies
—(1)
In general.
Each foreign levy must be analyzed separately to determine whether it is a net income tax within the meaning of paragraph (a)(3) of this section and whether it is a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of § 1.903-1(b)(2). Whether a single levy or separate levies are imposed by a foreign country depends on U.S. principles and not on whether foreign tax law imposes the levy or levies pursuant to a single or separate statutes. A foreign levy is a separate levy described in this paragraph (d)(1) if it is described in paragraph (d)(1)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section. In the case of levies that apply to dual capacity taxpayers, see also § 1.901-2A(a).
(i)
Taxing authority.
A levy imposed by one taxing authority (for example, the national government of a foreign country) is always separate from a levy imposed by another taxing authority (for example, a political subdivision of that foreign country), even if the base of the levy is the same.
(ii)
Different taxable base.
Where the base of a foreign levy is computed differently for different classes of persons subject to the levy, the levy is considered to impose separate levies with respect to each such class of persons. For example, foreign levies identical to the
taxes imposed by sections 1, 11, 541, 871(a), 871(b), 881, 882, 3101 and 3111 of the Internal Revenue Code are each separate levies, because the levies are imposed on different classes of taxpayers, and the base of each of those levies contains different items than the base of each of the others. A taxable base of a separate levy may consist of a particular type of income (for example, wage income, investment income, or income from self-employment). The taxable base of a separate levy may also consist of an amount unrelated to income (for example, wage expense or assets). A separate levy may provide that items included in the base of the tax are computed separately merely for purposes of a preliminary computation and are then combined as a single taxable base. Income included in the taxable base of a separate levy may also be included in the taxable base of another levy (which may or may not also include other items of income); separate levies are considered to be imposed if the taxable bases are not combined as a single taxable base, even if the taxable bases are determined using the same computational rules. For example, a foreign levy identical to the tax imposed by section 1 is a separate levy from a foreign levy identical to the tax imposed by section 1411, because tax is imposed under each levy on a separate taxable base that is not combined with the other as a single taxable base. Where foreign tax law imposes a levy that is the sum of two or more separately computed amounts of tax, and each such amount is computed by reference to a different base, separate levies are considered to be imposed. Levies are not separate merely because different rates apply to different classes of taxpayers that are subject to the same provisions in computing the base of the tax. For example, a foreign levy identical to the tax imposed on U.S. citizens and resident alien individuals by section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code is a single levy notwithstanding that the levy has graduated rates and applies different rate schedules to unmarried individuals, married individuals who file separate returns, and married individuals who file joint returns. In addition, in general, levies are not separate merely because some provisions determining the base of the levy apply, by their terms or in practice, to some, but not all, persons subject to the levy. For example, a foreign levy identical to the tax imposed by section 11 of the Internal Revenue Code is a single levy even though some provisions apply by their terms to some but not all corporations subject to the section 11 tax (for example, section 465 is by its terms applicable to corporations described in sections 465(a)(1)(B), but not to other corporations), and even though some provisions apply in practice to some but not all corporations subject to the section 11 tax (for example, section 611 does not, in practice, apply to any corporation that does not have a qualifying interest in the type of property described in section 611(a)).
(iii)
Tax imposed on nonresidents.
A foreign levy imposed on nonresidents is always treated as a separate levy from that imposed on residents, even if the base of the tax as applied to residents and nonresidents is the same, and even if the levies are treated as a single levy under foreign tax law. In addition, a withholding tax (as defined in section 901(k)(1)(B)) that is imposed on gross income of nonresidents is treated as a separate levy as to each separate class of income described in section 61 (for example, interest, dividends, rents, or royalties) subject to the withholding tax. If two or more subsets of a separate class of income are subject to a withholding tax based on different income attribution rules (for example, if technical services are subject to tax based on the residence of the payor and other services are subject to tax based on where the services are performed), separate levies are considered to be imposed with respect to each subset of that separate class of income.
(iv)
Foreign levy modified by an applicable income tax treaty.
A foreign levy that is limited in its application by, or is otherwise modified by, an income tax treaty to which the foreign country imposing the levy is a party is a separate levy from the levy imposed under the domestic law (without regard to the treaty) of the foreign country, and is also a separate levy from the foreign levy as modified by a different income tax treaty to which the foreign country
imposing the levy is a party, even if the two treaties modify the foreign levy in exactly the same manner. Accordingly, a foreign levy paid by taxpayers that qualify for and claim benefits under an income tax treaty is a separate levy from the levy as applied to taxpayers that are ineligible for, or that do not claim, benefits under that treaty, even if the two foreign levies would apply in the same manner to a particular taxpayer, and regardless of whether the unmodified foreign levy is a foreign income tax within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.
(2)
Contractual modifications.
Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, if foreign tax law imposing a levy is modified for one or more persons subject to the levy by a contract entered into by such person or persons and the foreign country, then the foreign tax law is considered for purposes of sections 901 and 903 to impose a separate levy for all persons to whom such contractual modification of the levy applies, as contrasted to the levy as applied to all persons to whom such contractual modification does not apply.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(i)
Example 1: Separate taxable bases
—(A)
Facts.
A foreign statute imposes a levy on corporations equal to the sum of 15% of the corporation's realized net income plus 3% of its net worth.
(B)
Analysis.
As the levy is the sum of two separately computed amounts, each of which is computed by reference to a separate base, under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section each of the portion of the levy based on income and the portion of the levy based on net worth is considered, for purposes of sections 901 and 903, to be a separate levy.
(ii)
Example 2: Separate taxable bases
—(A)
Facts.
A foreign statute imposes a levy on nonresident alien individuals analogous to the taxes imposed by section 871 of the Internal Revenue Code.
(B)
Analysis.
As the levy is imposed on separately computed amounts, each of which is computed by reference to a separate taxable base and portions of which comprise withholding tax on gross income of nonresidents, under paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section, each of the portions of the foreign levy imposed on each separate class of gross income analogous to the tax imposed by section 871(a) and the portion of the foreign levy analogous to the tax imposed by sections 871(b) and 1 is considered, for purposes of sections 901 and 903, to be a separate levy.
(iii)
Example 3: Separate taxable bases
—(A)
Facts.
(
1
) A single foreign statute or separate foreign statutes impose a foreign levy that is the sum of the products of specified rates applied to specified bases, as follows:
Table 1 to paragraph (
d
)(3)(iii)(A)(
1
)
Base
Rate
(percent)
Net income from mining
45
Net income from manufacturing
50
Net income from technical services
50
Net income from other services
45
Net income from investments
15
All other net income
50
(
2
) In computing each such base, deductible expenditures are allocated to the type of income they generate. If allocated deductible expenditures exceed the gross amount of a specified type of income, the excess may not be applied against income of a different specified type.
(B)
Analysis.
The levy is the sum of several separately computed amounts, each of which is computed by reference to a separate base. Accordingly, under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, each of the levies on mining net income, manufacturing net income, technical services net income, other services net income, investment net income and other net income is considered, for purposes of sections 901 and 903, to be a separate levy.
(iv)
Example 4: Combined taxable base after preliminary separate computation
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as those in paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 3
), except that excess deductible expenditures allocated to one type of income are applied against other types of income to which the same rate applies.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the levies on mining net income and other services net income together are considered, for purposes of sections 901 and 903, to be a
single levy since, despite a separate preliminary computation of the bases, by reason of the permitted application of excess allocated deductible expenditures the bases are not separately computed. For the same reason, the levies on manufacturing net income, technical services net income and other net income together are considered, for purposes of sections 901 and 903, to be a single levy. The levy on investment net income is considered, for purposes of sections 901 and 903, to be a separate levy. These results are not dependent on whether the application of excess allocated deductible expenditures to a different type of income is permitted in the same taxable period in which the expenditures are taken into account for purposes of the preliminary computation, or only in a different (for example, later) taxable period.
(v)
Example 5: Combined taxable base with income subject to different rates
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as those in paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 3
), except that excess deductible expenditures allocated to any type of income other than investment income are applied against the other types of income (including investment income) according to a specified set of priorities of application. Excess deductible expenditures allocated to investment income are not applied against any other type of income.
(B)
Analysis.
For the same reasons as those set forth in paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(B) of this section (the analysis in
Example 4
), all of the levies are together considered, for purposes of sections 901 and 903, to be a single levy.
(vi)
Example 6: Minimum Tax
—(A)
Facts.
Country X imposes a net income tax (“Income Tax”) and a minimum tax (“Minimum Tax”) on its residents. Under Country X tax law, alternative minimum taxable income for purposes of the Minimum Tax equals the taxable income under the Income Tax increased by certain disallowed deductions. The Minimum Tax equals the excess, if any, of the alternative minimum taxable income times the Minimum Tax rate over the amount of the Income Tax.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the Minimum Tax is a separate levy from the Income Tax, because the taxable base of each levy is separately computed and not combined as a single taxable base. The result would be the same if under Country X tax law the Minimum Tax equaled the alternative minimum taxable income times the Minimum Tax rate, and residents of Country X were required to pay the greater of the Income Tax or the Minimum Tax (rather than the Income Tax plus the excess, if any, of the Minimum Tax over the Income Tax).
(vii)
Example 7: Diverted Profits Tax
—(A)
Facts.
Country X imposes a 20% net income tax (“Income Tax”) and a 25% “Diverted Profits Tax” on nonresident corporations. Under Country X tax law, taxable income under the Diverted Profits Tax is determined first by attributing gross receipts of the nonresident corporation to a hypothetical permanent establishment in Country X. Country X applies the same computational rules that apply under the Income Tax to determine the taxable income attributable to a hypothetical permanent establishment under the Diverted Profits Tax.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the Diverted Profits Tax is a separate levy from the Income Tax, because the taxable income under the Diverted Profits Tax is not combined with the taxable income under the Income Tax as a single taxable base.
(viii)
Example 8: Modified Income Tax
—(A)
Facts.
Country X imposes a net income tax (“Income Tax”) on nonresident corporations that carry on a trade or business in Country X through a permanent establishment. Under Country X tax law, the taxable base of the Income Tax as initially enacted is determined by attributing profits of the nonresident corporation to its permanent establishment in Country X based upon rules similar to Articles 5 and 7 of the 2016 U.S. Model Income Tax Convention. However, Country X later amends the Income Tax to provide that nonresident corporations that are engaged in certain digital transactions in Country X and earning revenues above certain thresholds are
deemed to have a permanent establishment; under the Income Tax as originally enacted, such activities would not have created a permanent establishment in Country X.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the Income Tax as applied to nonresident corporations engaged in digital transactions and deemed to have a permanent establishment under the modified Income Tax is not a separate levy from the Income Tax as applied to the same or other nonresident corporations that would have permanent establishments under the Income Tax as originally enacted, because income attributable to both actual and deemed permanent establishments is combined as a single taxable base.
(ix)
Example 9: Disallowed deductions
—(A)
Facts.
Country X imposes a net income tax (“Income Tax”) on resident corporations. In determining the taxable base for the Income Tax, Country X tax law has a cap on allowed interest deductions for companies engaged in the extraction, production, or refinement of oil or natural gas.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the Income Tax as applied to corporations engaged in the extraction, production, or refinement of oil or natural gas is not a separate levy from the Income Tax as applied to other corporations subject to the levy. The Income Tax is a single levy even though the cap on allowed interest expense deductions applies by its terms to some, but not all, corporations subject to the Income Tax.
(x)
Example 10: Different taxable base for class of taxpayers
—(A)
Facts.
Country X imposes a net income tax (“Income Tax”) and an oil tax. The oil tax applies only to resident corporations engaged in the extraction, production, or refinement of oil, and resident corporations subject to the oil tax are not subject to the Income Tax. The taxable base under the oil tax is the taxable income under the Income Tax increased by disallowed interest expense.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the oil tax is a separate levy from the Income Tax, because the taxable income under the oil tax is not combined with the taxable income under the Income Tax as a single taxable base. The levies are imposed on different classes of taxpayers (resident taxpayers engaged in the extraction, production, or refinement of oil, in the case of the oil tax, and all other resident corporations, in the case of the Income Tax), and the base of each of those levies contains different items.
(e)
Amount of foreign income tax that is creditable
—(1)
In general.
Credit is allowed under section 901 for the amount of foreign income tax that is paid by the taxpayer. Under paragraph (g) of this section, the term “paid” means “paid” or “accrued,” depending on the taxpayer's method of accounting for such taxes. The amount of foreign income tax paid by the taxpayer is determined separately for each taxpayer under the rules in this paragraph (e).
(2)
Refunds and credits
—(i)
Refundable amounts.
An amount remitted to a foreign country is not an amount of foreign income tax paid to the extent that it is reasonably certain that the amount will be refunded, rebated, abated, or forgiven. It is reasonably certain that an amount will be refunded, rebated, abated, or forgiven to the extent the amount exceeds a reasonable approximation of final foreign income tax liability to the foreign country. See section 905(c) and § 1.905-3 for the required redeterminations if amounts claimed as a credit (on either the cash or accrual basis) exceed the amount of the final foreign income tax liability.
(ii)
Credits.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, an amount of foreign income tax liability is not an amount of foreign income tax paid to the extent the foreign income tax liability is reduced, satisfied, or otherwise offset by a tax credit, including a tax credit that under the foreign tax law is payable in cash only to the extent it exceeds the taxpayer's liability for foreign income tax or a tax credit acquired from another taxpayer.
(iii)
Exception for overpayments and other fully refundable credits.
An amount of foreign income tax paid is not reduced (or treated as constructively refunded) solely by reason of the fact that a credit is allowed (or may be allowed) for the amount paid to reduce the amount of a different separate levy
owed by the taxpayer. See paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) and (e)(4) of this section. However, under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section (and taking into account any redetermination required under section 905(c) and § 1.905-3), an amount remitted with respect to a separate levy for a foreign taxable period that constitutes an overpayment of the taxpayer's final liability for that levy for that period, and that is refundable in cash at the taxpayer's option, is not an amount of tax paid. Therefore, if such an overpayment of one tax is applied as a credit against a different foreign income tax liability of the taxpayer for the same or a different taxable period, the credited amount of the overpayment may qualify as an amount paid of that different foreign income tax, if the credited amount does not exceed a reasonable approximation of the taxpayer's final foreign income tax liability for the taxable period to which the overpayment is applied. Similarly, if under the foreign tax law, the full amount of a tax credit is payable in cash at the taxpayer's option, the taxpayer's choice to apply all or a portion of the tax credit in satisfaction of a foreign income tax liability of the taxpayer is treated as a constructive payment of cash to the taxpayer in the amount so applied, followed by a constructive payment of the foreign income tax liability against which the credit is applied. An overpayment or other tax credit that under the foreign tax law is otherwise fully payable in cash at the taxpayer's option and that is applied in part in satisfaction of a foreign income tax liability is treated as an amount of foreign income tax paid notwithstanding that a portion of the amount otherwise payable in cash to the taxpayer is subject to a lien or otherwise seized in order to satisfy a different, pre-existing liability of the taxpayer to the foreign government or to a third party.
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(A)
Example 1.
The domestic law of Country X imposes a 25 percent tax described in § 1.903-1(b) on the gross amount of interest from sources in Country X that is received by a nonresident of Country X. Country X imposes the tax on the nonresident recipient and requires any resident of Country X that pays such interest to a nonresident to withhold and pay over to Country X 25 percent of such interest, which is applied to offset the recipient's liability for the 25 percent tax. A tax treaty between the United States and Country X modifies domestic law of Country X and provides that Country X may not tax interest received by a resident of the United States from a resident of Country X at a rate in excess of 10 percent of the gross amount of such interest. A resident of the United States may claim the benefit of the treaty only by applying for a refund of the excess withheld amount (15 percent of the gross amount of interest income) after the end of the taxable year. A, a resident of the United States, receives a gross amount of 100u (units of Country X currency) of interest income from a resident of Country X from sources in Country X in Year 1, from which 25u of Country X tax is withheld. A files a timely claim for refund of the 15u excess withheld amount. 15u of the amount withheld (25u − 10u) is reasonably certain to be refunded; therefore, under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section 15u is not considered an amount of foreign income tax paid to Country X.
(B)
Example 2.
A's initial foreign income tax liability under Country X tax law is 100u (units of Country X currency). However, under Country X tax law A's initial income tax liability is reduced in order to compute A's final tax liability by an investment credit of 15u and a credit for charitable contributions of 5u. Under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the amount of foreign income tax paid by A is 80u.
(C)
Example 3.
A computes foreign income tax liability in Country X for Year 1 of 100u (units of Country X currency), files a tax return on that basis, and remits 100u of tax. The day after A files that return, A files a claim for refund of 90u. The difference between the 100u of liability reflected in A's original return and the 10u of liability reflected in A's refund claim depends on whether a particular expenditure made by A is nondeductible or deductible, respectively. Based on an analysis of the Country X tax law, A's Country X tax
advisors have advised A that it is not clear whether or not that expenditure is deductible. In view of the uncertainty as to the proper treatment of the item in question under Country X tax law, no portion of the 100u paid by A is reasonably certain to be refunded. If A receives a refund, A must treat the refund as required by section 905(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.
(D)
Example 4.
A levy of Country X, which qualifies as a foreign income tax within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, provides that each person who makes payment to Country X pursuant to the levy will receive a bond to be issued by Country X with an amount payable at maturity equal to 10 percent of the amount paid pursuant to the levy. A remits 38,000u (units of Country X currency) to Country X and is entitled to receive a bond with an amount payable at maturity of 3,800u. It is reasonably certain that a refund in the form of property (the bond) will be made. The amount of that refund is equal to the fair market value of the bond. Therefore, only the portion of the 38,000u payment in excess of the fair market value of the bond is an amount of foreign income tax paid.
(3)
Subsidies
—(i)
General rule.
An amount of foreign income tax is not an amount of foreign income tax paid by a taxpayer to a foreign country to the extent that—
(A) The amount is used, directly or indirectly, by the foreign country imposing the tax to provide a subsidy by any means (including, but not limited to, a rebate, a refund, a credit, a deduction, a payment, a discharge of an obligation, or any other method) to the taxpayer, to a related person (within the meaning of section 482), to any party to the transaction, or to any party to a related transaction; and
(B) The subsidy is determined, directly or indirectly, by reference to the amount of the tax or by reference to the base used to compute the amount of the tax.
(ii)
Subsidy.
The term “subsidy” includes any benefit conferred, directly or indirectly, by a foreign country to one of the parties enumerated in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) of this section. Substance and not form shall govern in determining whether a subsidy exists. The fact that the U.S. taxpayer may derive no demonstrable benefit from the subsidy is irrelevant in determining whether a subsidy exists.
(iii)
Official exchange rate.
A subsidy described in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(B) of this section does not include the actual use of an official foreign government exchange rate converting foreign currency into dollars where a free exchange rate also exists if—
(A) The economic benefit represented by the use of the official exchange rate is not targeted to or tied to transactions that give rise to a claim for a foreign tax credit;
(B) The economic benefit of the official exchange rate applies to a broad range of international transactions, in all cases based on the total payment to be made without regard to whether the payment is a return of principal, gross income, or net income, and without regard to whether it is subject to tax; and
(C) Any reduction in the overall cost of the transaction is merely coincidental to the broad structure and operation of the official exchange rate.
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(A)
Example 1
—(
1
)
Facts.
Country X imposes a 30 percent tax on nonresident lenders with respect to interest which the nonresident lenders receive from borrowers who are residents of Country X, and it is established that this tax is a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of § 1.903-1(b). Country X provides the nonresident lenders with receipts upon their payment of the 30 percent tax. Country X remits to resident borrowers an incentive payment for engaging in foreign loans, which payment is an amount equal to 20 percent of the interest paid to nonresident lenders.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Because the incentive payment is based on the interest paid, it is determined by reference to the base used to compute the tax that is imposed on the nonresident lender. The incentive payment is a subsidy under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section since it is provided to a party (the borrower) to the transaction and is based on the amount of tax that is imposed on the lender with respect to the transaction.
Therefore, two-thirds (20 percent/30 percent) of the amount withheld by the resident borrower from interest payments to the nonresident lender is not an amount of foreign income tax paid.
(B)
Example 2
—(
1
)
Facts.
A U.S. bank lends money to a development bank in Country X. The development bank relends the money to companies resident in Country X. A withholding tax is imposed by Country X on the U.S. bank with respect to the interest that the development bank pays to the U.S. bank, and appropriate receipts are provided. On the date that the tax is withheld, fifty percent of the tax is credited by Country X to an account of the development bank. Country X requires the development bank to transfer the amount credited to the borrowing companies.
(
2
)
Analysis.
The amount successively credited to the account of the development bank and then to the account of the borrowing companies is determined by reference to the amount of the tax and the tax base. Since the amount credited to the borrowing companies is a subsidy provided to a party (the borrowing companies) to a related transaction and is based on the amount of tax and the tax base, under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section it is not an amount of foreign income tax paid.
(C)
Example 3
—(
1
)
Facts.
A U.S. bank lends dollars to a Country X borrower. Country X imposes a withholding tax on the lender with respect to the interest. The tax is to be paid in Country X currency, although the interest is payable in dollars. Country X has a dual exchange rate system, comprised of a controlled official exchange rate and a free exchange rate. Priority transactions such as exports of merchandise, imports of merchandise, and payments of principal and interest on foreign currency loans payable abroad to foreign lenders are governed by the official exchange rate which yields more dollars per unit of Country X currency than the free exchange rate. The Country X borrower remits the net amount of dollar interest due to the U.S. bank (interest due less withholding tax), pays the tax withheld in Country X currency to the Country X government, and provides to the U.S. bank a receipt for payment of the Country X taxes.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, the use of the official exchange rate by the U.S. bank to determine foreign taxes with respect to interest is not a subsidy described in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(B) of this section. The official exchange rate is not targeted to or tied to transactions that give rise to a claim for a foreign tax credit. The use of the official exchange rate applies to the interest paid and to the principal paid. Any benefit derived by the U.S. bank through the use of the official exchange rate is merely coincidental to the broad structure and operation of the official exchange rate.
(D)
Example 4
—(
1
)
Facts.
B, a U.S. corporation, is engaged in the production of oil and gas in Country X pursuant to a production sharing agreement among B, Country X, and the state petroleum authority of Country X. The agreement is approved and enacted into law by the Legislature of Country X. Both B and the petroleum authority are subject to the Country X income tax. Each entity files an annual income tax return and pays, to the tax authority of Country X, the amount of income tax due on its annual income. B is a dual capacity taxpayer as defined in § 1.901-2(a)(2)(ii)(A). Country X has agreed to return to the petroleum authority one-half of the income taxes paid by B by allowing it a credit in calculating its own tax liability to Country X.
(
2
)
Analysis.
The petroleum authority is a party to a transaction with B and the amount returned by Country X to the petroleum authority is determined by reference to the amount of the tax imposed on B. Therefore, under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section the amount returned is a subsidy, and one-half of the tax imposed on B is not an amount of foreign income tax paid.
(E)
Example 5
—(
1
)
Facts.
The facts are the same as those in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D)(
1
) of this section (the facts in
Example 4
), except that the state petroleum authority of Country X does not receive amounts from Country X related to tax paid by B. Instead, the authority of Country X receives a general appropriation from Country X which is not calculated with reference to the amount of tax paid by B.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Because the general appropriation is not calculated with reference to the amount of tax paid by B, it is not a subsidy described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section.
(4)
Multiple levies
—(i)
In general.
If, under foreign law, a taxpayer's tentative liability for one levy (the “reduced levy”) is or can be reduced by the amount of the taxpayer's liability for a different levy (the “applied levy”), then the amount considered paid by the taxpayer to the foreign country pursuant to the applied levy is an amount equal to its entire liability for that applied levy (which is not considered to be reduced by the amount applied against the reduced levy), and the remainder of the total amount paid, if any, is considered paid pursuant to the reduced levy. See also paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) and (iii) and (e)(4)(i) of this section.
(A)
Example 1: Tax reduced by credits
—(
1
)
Facts.
A's tentative liability for foreign income tax imposed by Country X is 100u (units of Country X currency). However, under Country X tax law, in determining A's final foreign income tax liability, its tentative liability is reduced by a 15u credit for a separate Country X levy that does not qualify as a foreign income tax and that A accrued and paid on its gross services income and is also reduced by a 5u credit for charitable contributions. Under Country X tax law, the amount of the charitable contributions credit is refundable in cash to the extent the credit exceeds the taxpayer's Country X income tax liability after applying the credit for the tax on gross services income. A timely remits the 80u due to Country X.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Under paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) and (e)(4) of this section, the amount of Country X income tax paid by A is 80u (100u tentative liability − 20u tax credits), and the amount of Country X tax on gross services income paid by A is 15u.
(B)
Example 2: Tax paid by credit for overpayment
—(
1
)
Facts.
The facts are the same as those in paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that A's final Country X income tax liability of 80u is satisfied by applying a credit for an otherwise refundable 60u overpayment from the previous taxable year of A's liability for a separate levy imposed by Country X that is also a foreign income tax and remitting the balance due of 20u.
(
2
)
Analysis.
The result is the same as in paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section (the analysis in
Example 1
). Under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, the portion of A's Country X income tax liability that was satisfied by applying the 60u overpayment of A's different foreign income tax liability for the previous taxable year qualifies as an amount of Country X income tax paid, because that refundable overpayment exceeded (and so is not treated as a payment of) A's different foreign income tax liability for the previous taxable year.
(5)
Noncompulsory amounts
—(i)
In general.
An amount remitted to a foreign country (a “foreign payment”) is not a compulsory payment, and thus is not an amount of foreign income tax paid, to the extent that the foreign payment exceeds the amount of liability for foreign income tax under the foreign tax law (as defined in paragraph (g) of this section). A foreign payment does not exceed the amount of such liability if the foreign payment is determined by the taxpayer in a manner that is consistent with a reasonable interpretation and application of the substantive and procedural provisions of foreign tax law (including applicable tax treaties) in such a way as to reduce, over time, the taxpayer's reasonably expected liability under foreign tax law for foreign income tax, and if the taxpayer exhausts all effective and practical remedies, including invocation of competent authority procedures available under applicable tax treaties, to reduce, over time, the taxpayer's liability for foreign income tax (including liability pursuant to a foreign tax audit adjustment). See paragraphs (e)(5)(ii) through (v) of this section. Whether a taxpayer has satisfied its obligation to minimize the aggregate amount of its liability for foreign income taxes over time is determined without regard to the present value of a deferred tax liability or other time
value of money considerations. However, a taxpayer is not required to reduce its foreign income tax liability to the extent the reasonably expected, arm's length costs of reducing the liability would exceed the amount by which the liability could be reduced. For this purpose, such costs may include an additional liability for a different foreign tax (but not U.S. taxes) that is not a foreign income tax only to the extent the amount of the additional liability is determined in a manner consistent with the rules of this paragraph (e)(5). A taxpayer is not required to alter its form of doing business, its business conduct, or the form of any business transaction in order to reduce its liability under foreign law for foreign income tax.
(ii)
Reasonable application of foreign tax law.
An interpretation or application of foreign tax law is not reasonable if there is actual notice or constructive notice (for example, a published court decision) to the taxpayer that the interpretation or application is likely to be erroneous. In interpreting foreign tax law, a taxpayer may generally rely on advice obtained in good faith from competent foreign tax advisors to whom the taxpayer has disclosed the relevant facts. Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(5)(i) and (e)(5)(iv) of this section, voluntarily forgoing a tax benefit to which a taxpayer is entitled under the foreign tax law results in a foreign payment in excess of the taxpayer's liability for foreign income tax.
(iii)
Effect of foreign tax law elections
—(A)
In general.
Where foreign tax law includes options or elections whereby a taxpayer's foreign income tax liability may be shifted, in whole or part, to a different year or years, the taxpayer's use or failure to use such options or elections does not result in a foreign payment in excess of the taxpayer's liability for foreign income tax. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(5)(iii)(B) of this section, where foreign tax law provides a taxpayer with options or elections in computing its liability for foreign income tax whereby a taxpayer's foreign income tax liability may be permanently decreased in the aggregate over time, the taxpayer's failure to use such options or elections results in a foreign payment in excess of the taxpayer's liability for foreign income tax.
(B)
Exception for certain options or elections
—(
1
)
Entity classification elections.
If foreign tax law provides an option or election to treat an entity as fiscally transparent or non-fiscally transparent, a taxpayer's decision to use or not use such option or election is not considered to increase the taxpayer's liability for foreign income tax over time for purposes of this paragraph (e)(5).
(
2
)
Foreign consolidation, group relief, or other loss sharing regime.
If foreign tax law provides an option or election for one foreign entity to join in the filing of a consolidated return with another foreign entity, or to surrender its loss in order to offset the income of another foreign entity pursuant to a foreign group relief or other loss-sharing regime, a taxpayer's decision whether to file a consolidated return, whether to surrender a loss, or whether to use a surrendered loss, is not considered to increase the taxpayer's liability for foreign income tax over time for purposes of this paragraph (e)(5).
(C)
Alternative creditable levies.
If under foreign tax law a taxpayer has the option to determine its foreign income tax liability under only one of multiple separate levies, each of which qualifies as a foreign income tax, then the amount of foreign income tax paid equals the smallest liability of the amounts that would be due under each of the alternative levies, regardless of which levy the taxpayer uses to determine its foreign income tax liability.
(iv)
Exception for increase in liability in connection with anti-hybrid rules
—(A)
In general.
If a taxpayer (the “first taxpayer”) that makes a payment to another taxpayer (the “second taxpayer”) is permitted to increase the first taxpayer's liability for foreign income tax (for example, by waiving an otherwise allowable deduction), and doing so results in a greater decrease in the amount of liability for foreign income tax of the second taxpayer by reason of the deactivation of a hybrid mismatch rule that would otherwise apply to the second taxpayer, then the increase in the first taxpayer's liability is not considered to result in a foreign payment
in excess of the first taxpayer's liability for foreign income tax for purposes of this paragraph (e)(5).
(B)
Definition of hybrid mismatch rule.
The term
hybrid mismatch rule
means foreign tax law rules substantially similar to sections 245A(e) and 267A and includes rules the purpose of which is to eliminate the deduction/no-inclusion outcome of hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements. Examples of such rules include rules based on, or substantially similar to, the recommendations contained in OECD/G-20,
Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements, Action 2: 2015 Final Report
(October 2015), and OECD/G-20,
Neutralising the Effects of Branch Mismatch Arrangements, Action 2: Inclusive Framework on BEPS
(July 2017).
(v)
Exhaustion of remedies.
In determining whether a taxpayer has exhausted all effective and practical remedies, a remedy is effective and practical only if the cost of pursuing it (including the reasonably expected risk of incurring an offsetting or additional foreign income tax or other tax liability) is reasonable considering the amount at issue and the likelihood of success. An available remedy is considered effective and practical if an economically rational taxpayer would pursue it whether or not a compulsory payment of the amount at issue would be eligible for a U.S. foreign tax credit. A settlement by a taxpayer of two or more issues will be evaluated on an overall basis, not on an issue-by-issue basis, in determining whether an amount is a compulsory payment.
(vi)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (e)(5) of this section.
(A)
Example 1.
A, a corporation organized and doing business solely in the United States, owns all of the stock of B, a corporation organized in Country X. In Year 1, A buys merchandise from unrelated persons for $1,000,000, and shortly thereafter resells that merchandise to B for $600,000. Later in Year 1, B resells the merchandise to unrelated persons for $1,200,000. Under the Country X income tax, which is a net income tax within the meaning of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, all corporations organized in Country X are subject to a tax equal to 3 percent of their net income. In computing its Year 1 Country X income tax liability, B reports $600,000 ($1,200,000 − $600,000) of profit from the purchase and resale of merchandise. The Country X tax law requires that transactions between related persons be reported at arm's length prices, and a reasonable interpretation of this requirement, as it has been applied in Country X, would consider B's arm's length purchase price of the merchandise purchased from A to be $1,050,000. When it computes its Country X tax liability B is aware that $600,000 is not an arm's length price (by Country X standards). B's knowing use of a non-arm's length price (by Country X standards) of $600,000, instead of a price of $1,050,000 (an arm's length price under Country X's law), is not consistent with a reasonable interpretation and application of Country X tax law, determined in such a way as to reduce over time B's reasonably expected liability for Country X income tax. Accordingly, $13,500 (3 percent of $450,000 ($1,050,000 − $600,000)), the amount of Country X income tax remitted by B to Country X that is attributable to the purchase of the merchandise from B's parent at less than an arm's length price, is in excess of the amount of B's liability for Country X income tax, and thus is not an amount of foreign income tax paid.
(B)
Example 2.
A, a corporation organized and doing business solely in the United States, owns all of the stock of B, a corporation organized in Country X. Country X has in force an income tax treaty with the United States. The tax treaty provides that the profits of related persons shall be determined as if the persons were not related. A and B deal extensively with each other. A and B, with respect to a series of transactions involving both of them, treat A as having $300,000 of income and B as having $700,000 of income for purposes of A's United States income tax and B's Country X income tax, respectively. B has no actual or constructive notice that its treatment of these transactions under Country X tax law is likely to be erroneous. Subsequently, the Internal Revenue Service reallocates $200,000 of this income from B to A under the authority of section 482 and the tax treaty. This reallocation
constitutes actual notice to A and constructive notice to B that B's interpretation and application of Country X's tax law and the tax treaty is likely to be erroneous. B does not exhaust all effective and practical remedies to obtain a refund of the amount remitted by B to Country X that is attributable to the reallocated $200,000 of income. Under paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section, this amount is in excess of the amount of B's liability for Country X income tax and thus is not an amount of foreign income tax paid.
(C)
Example 3.
The facts are the same as those in paragraph (e)(5)(vi)(B) of this section (the facts in
Example 2
), except that B files a claim for refund (an administrative proceeding) of Country X tax and A or B invokes the competent authority procedures of the tax treaty, the cost of which is reasonable in view of the amount at issue and the likelihood of success. Nevertheless, B does not obtain any refund of Country X income tax. The cost of pursuing any judicial remedy in Country X would be unreasonable in light of the amount at issue and the likelihood of B's success, and B does not pursue any such remedy. Under paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section, the entire amount paid by B to Country X is a compulsory payment and thus is an amount of foreign income tax paid by B.
(D)
Example 4.
The facts are the same as those in paragraph (e)(5)(vi)(B) of this section (the facts in
Example 2
), except that, when the Internal Revenue Service makes the reallocation, the Country X statute of limitations on refunds has expired, and neither the internal law of Country X nor the tax treaty authorizes the Country X tax authorities to pay a refund that is barred by the statute of limitations. B does not file a claim for refund, and neither A nor B invokes the competent authority procedures of the tax treaty. Because the Country X tax authorities would be barred by the statute of limitations from paying a refund, B has no effective and practical remedies. Under paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section, the entire amount paid by B to Country X is a compulsory payment and thus is an amount of foreign income tax paid by B.
(E)
Example 5.
A is a U.S. person doing business in Country X. In computing its income tax liability to Country X, A is permitted, at its election, to recover the cost of machinery used in its business either by deducting that cost in the year of acquisition or by depreciating that cost on the straight-line method over a period of 2, 4, 6 or 10 years. A elects to depreciate machinery over 10 years. This election merely shifts A's tax liability to different years (compared to the timing of A's tax liability under a different depreciation period); it does not result in a payment in excess of the amount of A's liability for Country X income tax in any year since the amount of Country X income tax paid by A is consistent with a reasonable interpretation of Country X tax law in such a way as to reduce over time A's reasonably expected liability for Country X income tax. Because the standard of paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section refers to A's reasonably expected liability, not its actual liability, events actually occurring in subsequent years (for example, whether A has sufficient profit in such years so that such depreciation deductions actually reduce A's Country X tax liability or whether the Country X tax rates change) are immaterial.
(F)
Example 6.
The domestic law of Country X imposes a 25 percent tax described in § 1.903-1(b) on the gross amount of interest from sources in Country X that is received by a nonresident of Country X. Country X tax law imposes the tax on the nonresident recipient and requires any resident of Country X that pays such interest to a nonresident to withhold and pay over to Country X 25 percent of such interest, which is applied to offset the recipient's liability for the 25 percent tax. A tax treaty between the United States and Country X overrides domestic law of Country X and provides that Country X may not tax interest received by a resident of the United States from a resident of Country X at a rate in excess of 10 percent of the gross amount of such interest. A resident of the United States may claim the benefit of the tax treaty only by applying for a refund of the excess withheld amount (15 percent of the gross amount of interest income) after
the end of the taxable year. A, a resident of the United States, receives a gross amount of 100u (units of Country X currency) of interest income from a resident of Country X from sources in Country X in Year 1, from which 25u of Country X tax is withheld. A does not file a timely claim for refund. Under paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section, 15u of the amount withheld (25u − 10u) is not a compulsory payment and thus is not an amount of foreign income tax paid.
(G)
Example 7: Reasonable steps to minimize creditable tax—larger noncreditable tax cost
—(
1
)
Facts.
Corporations resident in Country X are subject to a 20% generally applicable net income tax, which qualifies as a foreign income tax under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section (“Income Tax”), and a separate levy equal to 25% of certain deductible payments above a specified threshold made to related parties that are not residents of Country X, which does not qualify as a foreign income tax under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section (“Base Erosion Tax”). CFC, a Country X corporation, makes payments to nonresident related parties that exceed the specified threshold of the Base Erosion Tax by 100u (units of Country X currency), which if claimed as deductions would result in a Base Erosion Tax of 25u (.25 × 100u), and would also result in 300u of taxable income for purposes of the Income Tax, thus resulting in Income Tax of 60u (.20 × 300u). If in computing its liability for Income Tax CFC does not claim deductions for the 100u of excess related party payments, its liability for the Base Erosion Tax would be zero, and its liability for Income Tax would be 80u (.20 × 400u).
(
2
)
Analysis.
If CFC chooses not to deduct the 100u of excess related party payments that would subject it to the Base Erosion Tax and pays 80u of Income Tax, the amount of foreign income tax paid under paragraph (e)(5) of this section is 80u. Under paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section, although CFC could reduce its liability for Income Tax from 80u to 60u by claiming the deductions, no portion of the Income Tax remitted is a noncompulsory payment because reducing the Income Tax by 20u would incur a Base Erosion Tax of 25u, which exceeds the amount of the potential reduction.
(H)
Example 8: Reasonable steps to minimize creditable tax—smaller noncreditable tax cost
—(

)
Facts.
The facts are the same as those in paragraph (e)(5)(vi)(G)(
1
) of this section (the facts in
Example 7
) except that the rate of the Base Erosion Tax is 20% and the rate of the Income Tax is 25%. Accordingly, if CFC claims the 100u of excess deductions its liability for Base Erosion Tax would be 20u (.20 × 100u), and its liability for Income Tax would be 75u (.25 × 300u). If CFC chooses not to claim the 100u of excess deductions its liability for Base Erosion Tax would be zero, and its liability for Income Tax would be 100u (.25 × 400u).
(
2
)
Analysis.
If CFC chooses not to claim the 100u of excess deductions in computing its liability for Income Tax and pays 100u of Income Tax, the amount of foreign income tax paid under paragraph (e)(5) of this section is 75u. CFC's additional payment of 25u is not an amount of Income Tax paid, because CFC could have reduced its Income Tax liability by 25u by claiming the excess deductions and paying 20u of Base Erosion Tax.

Example 9: Alternative creditable taxes
—(

)
Facts.
The facts are the same as those in paragraph (e)(5)(vi)(G)(
1
) of this section (the facts in
Example 7
), except that Country X does not have a Base Erosion Tax, and it allows resident corporations to elect to pay either the Income Tax or a separate levy using an alternative cost allowance (the “Alternative Tax”), which qualifies as a tax in lieu of an income tax under § 1.903-1(b)(2). CFC's liability under the Income Tax is 80u, and its liability under the Alternative Tax is 100u. CFC chooses to pay the 100u of Alternative Tax rather than the 80u of Income Tax.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (e)(5)(iii)(C) of this section, the amount of foreign income tax paid by CFC is 80u, the smaller of the amounts due under the two alternative foreign income taxes.
(vii)
Structured passive investment arrangements
—(A)
In general.
Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section, an amount paid to a foreign country (a “foreign payment”) is not a compulsory payment, and thus is not an amount of foreign income tax paid, if the foreign payment is attributable (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(B)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section) to a structured passive investment arrangement (as described in paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(B) of this section).
(B)
Conditions.
An arrangement is a structured passive investment arrangement if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
(

)
Special purpose vehicle (SPV).
An entity that is part of the arrangement meets the following requirements:
(
i
) Substantially all of the gross income (for U.S. tax purposes) of the entity, if any, is passive investment income, and substantially all of the assets of the entity are assets held to produce such passive investment income.
(
ii
) There is a foreign payment attributable to income of the entity (as determined under the laws of the foreign country to which such foreign payment is made), including the entity's share of income of a lower-tier entity that is a branch or pass-through entity under the laws of such foreign country, that, if the foreign payment were an amount of foreign income tax paid, would be paid in a U.S. taxable year in which the entity meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(B)(
1
)(
i
) of this section. A foreign payment attributable to income of an entity includes a foreign payment attributable to income that is required to be taken into account by an owner of the entity, if the entity is a branch or pass-through entity under the laws of such foreign country. A foreign payment attributable to income of the entity also includes a withholding tax (within the meaning of section 901(k)(1)(B)) imposed on a dividend or other distribution (including distributions made by a pass-through entity or an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. tax purposes) with respect to the equity of the entity.

U.S. party.
A person would be eligible to claim a credit under section 901(a) (including a credit for foreign taxes deemed paid under section 960) for all or a portion of the foreign payment described in paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(B)(

1
)(
ii
) of this section is (or is expected to be) substantially greater than the amount of credits, if any, that the U.S. party reasonably would expect to be eligible to claim under section 901(a) for foreign income taxes attributable to income generated by the U.S. party's proportionate share of the assets owned by the SPV if the U.S. party directly owned such assets. For this purpose, direct ownership shall not include ownership through a branch, a permanent establishment or any other arrangement (such as an agency arrangement or dual resident status) that would result in the income generated by the U.S. party's proportionate share of the assets being subject to tax on a net basis in the foreign country to which the payment is made. A U.S. party's proportionate share of the assets of the SPV shall be determined by reference to such U.S. party's proportionate share of the total value of all of the outstanding interests in the SPV that are held by its equity owners and creditors. A U.S. party's proportionate share of the assets of the SPV, however, shall not include any assets that produce income subject to gross basis withholding tax.

Foreign tax benefit.
The arrangement is reasonably expected to result in a credit, deduction, loss, exemption, exclusion or other tax benefit under the laws of a foreign country that is available to a counterparty or to a person that is related to the counterparty (determined under the principles of paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(C)(
7
) of this section by applying the tax laws of a foreign country in which the counterparty is subject to tax on a net basis). However, a foreign tax benefit in the form of a credit is described in this paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(B)(
4
) only if the amount of any such credit corresponds to 10 percent or more of the amount of
the U.S. party's share (for U.S. tax purposes) of the foreign payment referred to in paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(B)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section. In addition, a foreign tax benefit in the form of a deduction, loss, exemption, exclusion or other tax benefit is described in this paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(B)(
4
) only if such amount corresponds to 10 percent or more of the foreign base with respect to which the U.S. party's share (for U.S. tax purposes) of the foreign payment is imposed. For purposes of the preceding two sentences, if an arrangement involves more than one U.S. party or more than one counterparty or both, the aggregate amount of foreign tax benefits available to all of the counterparties and persons related to such counterparties is compared to the aggregate amount of all of the U.S. parties' shares of the foreign payment or foreign base, as the case may be. Where a U.S. party indirectly owns interests in an SPV that are treated as equity interests for both U.S. and foreign tax purposes, a foreign tax benefit available to a foreign entity in the chain of ownership that begins with the SPV and ends with the first-tier entity in the chain does not correspond to the U.S. party's share of the foreign payment attributable to income of the SPV to the extent that such benefit relates to earnings of the SPV that are distributed with respect to equity interests in the SPV that are owned directly or indirectly by the U.S. party for purposes of both U.S. and foreign tax law.
(
5
)
Counterparty.
The arrangement involves a counterparty. A counterparty is a person that, under the tax laws of a foreign country in which the person is subject to tax on the basis of place of management, place of incorporation or similar criterion or otherwise subject to a net basis tax, directly or indirectly owns or acquires equity interests in, or assets of, the SPV. However, a counterparty does not include the SPV or a person with respect to which for U.S. tax purposes the same domestic corporation, U.S. citizen or resident alien individual directly or indirectly owns more than 80 percent of the total value of the stock (or equity interests) of each of the U.S. party and such person. A counterparty also does not include a person with respect to which for U.S. tax purposes the U.S. party directly or indirectly owns more than 80 percent of the total value of the stock (or equity interests), but only if the U.S. party is a domestic corporation, a U.S. citizen or a resident alien individual. In addition, a counterparty does not include an individual who is a U.S. citizen or resident alien.

Inconsistent treatment.
The United States and an applicable foreign country treat one or more of the aspects of the arrangement listed in paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(B)(

)(
i
) through (
iv
) of this section differently under their respective tax systems, and for one or more tax years when the arrangement is in effect one or both of the following two conditions applies; either the amount of income attributable to the SPV that is recognized for U.S. tax purposes by the SPV, the U.S. party or parties, and persons related to a U.S. party or parties is materially less than the amount of income that would be recognized if the foreign tax treatment controlled for U.S. tax purposes; or the amount of credits claimed by the U.S. party or parties (if the foreign payment described in paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(B)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section were an amount of foreign income tax paid) is materially greater than it would be if the foreign tax treatment controlled for U.S. tax purposes:
(
i
) The classification of the SPV (or an entity that has a direct or indirect ownership interest in the SPV) as a corporation or other entity subject to an entity-level tax, a partnership or other flow-through entity or an entity that is disregarded for tax purposes.
(
ii
) The characterization as debt, equity or an instrument that is disregarded for tax purposes of an instrument issued by the SPV (or an entity that has a direct or indirect ownership interest in the SPV) to a U.S. party, a counterparty or a person related to a U.S. party or a counterparty.
(
iii
) The proportion of the equity of the SPV (or an entity that directly or indirectly owns the SPV) that is considered to be owned directly or indirectly by a U.S. party and a counterparty.
(

) The amount of taxable income that is attributable to the SPV for one
or more tax years during which the arrangement is in effect.

4
) of this section, shall not be treated as qualified banking or financing income or as qualified insurance income, and shall not be taken into account in applying sections 954(h) and 954(i) for purposes of determining whether other income of the entity is excluded from section 954(c)(1) under section 954(h) or 954(i), but only if any such person (or a person that is related to such person within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(B)(

(
ii
)
Income attributable to lower-tier entities; holding company exception.
Income of an upper-tier entity that is attributable to an equity interest in a lower-tier entity, including dividends, an allocable share of partnership income, and income attributable to the ownership of an interest in an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner is passive investment income unless substantially all of the upper-tier entity's assets consist of qualified equity interests in one or more lower-tier entities, each of which is engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business and derives more than 50 percent of its gross income from such trade or business, and substantially all of the upper-tier entity's opportunity for gain and risk of loss with respect to each such interest in a lower-tier entity is shared by the U.S. party (or persons that are related to a U.S. party) and, assuming the entity is an SPV, a counterparty (or persons that are related to a counterparty) (“holding company exception”). If an arrangement involves more than one U.S. party or more than one counterparty or both, then substantially all of the upper-tier entity's opportunity for gain and risk of loss with respect to its interest in any lower-tier entity must be shared (directly or indirectly) by one or more U.S. parties (or persons related to such U.S. parties) and, assuming the upper-tier entity is an SPV, one or more counterparties (or
persons related to such counterparties). Substantially all of the upper-tier entity's opportunity for gain and risk of loss with respect to its interest in any lower-tier entity is not shared if the opportunity for gain and risk of loss is borne (directly or indirectly) by one or more U.S. parties (or persons related to such U.S. party or parties) or, assuming the upper-tier entity is an SPV, by one or more counterparties (or persons related to such counterparty or counterparties). Whether and the extent to which a person is considered to share in an upper-tier entity's opportunity for gain and risk of loss is determined based on all the facts and circumstances, provided, however, that a person does not share in an upper-tier entity's opportunity for gain and risk of loss if its equity interest in the upper-tier entity was acquired in a sale-repurchase transaction or if its interest is treated as debt for U.S. tax purposes. If a U.S. party owns an interest in an entity indirectly through a chain of entities, the application of the holding company exception begins with the lowest-tier entity in the chain that may satisfy the holding company exception and proceeds upward; provided, however, that the opportunity for gain and risk of loss borne by any upper-tier entity in the chain that is a counterparty shall be disregarded to the extent borne indirectly by a U.S. party. An upper-tier entity that satisfies the holding company exception is itself considered to be engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business and to derive more than 50 percent of its gross income from such trade or business for purposes of applying the holding company exception to the owners of such entity. A lower-tier entity that is engaged in a banking, financing, or similar business shall not be considered to be engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business unless the income derived by such entity would be excluded from section 954(c)(1) under section 954(h) or 954(i) as modified by paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(C)(
5
)(
i
) of this section.

Qualified equity interest.
With respect to an interest in a corporation, the term
qualified equity interest
means stock representing 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and 10 percent or more of the total value of the stock of the corporation or disregarded entity, but does not include any preferred stock (as defined in section 351(g)(3)). Similar rules shall apply to determine whether an interest in an entity other than a corporation is a qualified equity interest.

Related person.
Two persons are related if—
(
i
) One person directly or indirectly owns stock (or an equity interest) possessing more than 50 percent of the total value of the other person; or

Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (e)(5)(vii) of this section. No inference is intended as to whether a taxpayer would be eligible to claim a credit under section 901(a) if a foreign payment were an amount of foreign income tax paid. The examples set forth below do not limit the application of other principles of existing law to determine the proper tax consequences of the structures or transactions addressed in the regulations.

Example 1: U.S. borrower transaction
—(

Facts.
A domestic corporation (USP) forms a Country M corporation (Newco), contributing $1.5 billion in exchange for 100% of the stock of Newco. Newco, in turn, loans the $1.5 billion to a second Country M corporation (FSub) wholly owned by USP. USP then sells its entire interest in Newco to a Country M corporation (FP) for the original purchase price of $1.5 billion, subject to an obligation to repurchase the interest in five years for $1.5 billion. The sale has the effect of transferring ownership of the Newco stock to FP for Country M tax purposes. Assume the sale-repurchase transaction is structured in a way that qualifies as a collateralized loan for U.S. tax purposes. Therefore, USP remains the
owner of the Newco stock for U.S. tax purposes. All of FSub's income is subpart F income. In Year 1, FSub pays Newco $120 million of interest. Newco pays $36 million to Country M with respect to such interest income and distributes the remaining $84 million to FP. Under Country M law, the $84 million distribution is excluded from FP's income. None of FP's stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by USP or any shareholders of USP that are domestic corporations, U.S. citizens, or resident alien individuals. Under an income tax treaty between Country M and the United States, Country M does not impose Country M tax on interest received by U.S. residents from sources in Country M.
(
ii
)
Result.
The $36 million payment by Newco to Country M is not a compulsory payment, and thus is not an amount of foreign income tax paid because the foreign payment is attributable to a structured passive investment arrangement. First, Newco is an SPV because all of Newco's income is passive investment income described in paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(C)(5) of this section; Newco's only asset, a note, is held to produce such income; the payment to Country M is attributable to such income; and if the payment were an amount of foreign income tax paid it would be paid in a U.S. taxable year in which Newco meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(B)(
1
)(
i
) of this section. Second, if the foreign payment were treated as an amount of foreign income tax paid, USP would be deemed to pay the foreign payment under section 960(a) and, therefore, would be eligible to claim a credit for such payment under section 901(a). Third, USP would not pay any Country M tax if it directly owned Newco's loan receivable. Fourth, the distribution from Newco to FP is exempt from tax under Country M law, and the exempt amount corresponds to more than 10% of the foreign base with respect to which USP's share (which is 100% under U.S. tax law) of the foreign payment was imposed. Fifth, FP is a counterparty because FP owns stock of Newco under Country M law and none of FP's stock is owned by USP or shareholders of USP that are domestic corporations, U.S. citizens, or resident alien individuals. Sixth, FP is the owner of 100% of Newco's stock for Country M tax purposes, while USP is the owner of 100% of Newco's stock for U.S. tax purposes, and the amount of credits claimed by USP if the payment to Country M were an amount of foreign income tax paid is materially greater than it would be if Country M tax treatment controlled for U.S. tax purposes such that FP, rather than USP, owned 100% of Newco's stock. Because the payment to Country M is not an amount of foreign income tax paid, USP is not deemed to pay any Country M tax under section 960(a). USP includes $84 million in income under subpart F with respect to Newco and also has interest expense of $84 million. FSub's income and earnings and profits are reduced by $120 million of interest expense.

Facts.
The facts are the same as those in paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(D)(
1
)(
i
) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that FSub is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Newco. In addition, assume FSub is engaged in the active conduct of manufacturing and selling widgets and derives more than 50% of its gross income from such business.
(
ii
)
Result.
The result is the same as in paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(D)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section (the result in
Example 1
), except that Newco's income is tested income rather than subpart F income, and if the $36 million foreign payment were an amount of foreign income tax paid USP would be deemed to pay a portion of the foreign payment under section 960(d), rather than 960(a). Although Newco wholly owns FSub, which is engaged in the active conduct of manufacturing and selling widgets and derives more than 50% of its income from such business, Newco's income that is attributable to Newco's equity interest in FSub is passive investment income because the sale-repurchase transaction limits FP's interest in Newco and its assets to that of a creditor, so that substantially all of Newco's opportunity for gain and risk of loss with respect to its stock in FSub is borne by USP. See paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(C)(
5
)(
ii
) of this section. Accordingly, Newco's stock in FSub is held to produce passive investment income. Thus, Newco
is an SPV because all of Newco's income is passive investment income described in paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(C)(
5
) of this section, Newco's assets are held to produce such income, the payment to Country M is attributable to such income, and if the payment were an amount of foreign income tax paid it would be paid in a U.S. taxable year in which Newco meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(B)(

Example 3: U.S. borrower transaction
—(
i
)
Facts.
A domestic corporation (USP) loans $750 million to its wholly-owned domestic subsidiary (Sub). USP and Sub form a Country M partnership (Partnership) to which each contributes $750 million. Partnership loans all of its $1.5 billion of capital to Issuer, a wholly-owned Country M affiliate of USP, in exchange for a note and coupons providing for the payment of interest at a fixed rate over a five-year term. Partnership sells all of the coupons to Coupon Purchaser, a Country N partnership owned by a Country M corporation (Foreign Bank) and a wholly-owned Country M subsidiary of Foreign Bank, for $300 million. At the time of the coupon sale, the fair market value of the coupons sold is $290 million and, pursuant to section 1286(b)(3), Partnership's basis allocated to the coupons sold is $290 million. Several months later and prior to any interest payments on the note, Foreign Bank and its subsidiary sell all of their interests in Coupon Purchaser to an unrelated Country O corporation for $280 million. None of Foreign Bank's stock or its subsidiary's stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by USP or Sub or by any shareholders of USP or Sub that are domestic corporations, U.S. citizens, or resident alien individuals. Assume that both the United States and Country M respect the sale of the coupons for tax law purposes. In the year of the coupon sale, for Country M tax purposes USP's and Sub's shares of Partnership's profits total $300 million, a payment of $60 million to Country M is made with respect to those profits, and Foreign Bank and its subsidiary, as partners of Coupon Purchaser, are entitled to deduct the $300 million purchase price of the coupons from their taxable income. For U.S. tax purposes, USP and Sub recognize their distributive shares of the $10 million premium income and claim a direct foreign tax credit for their shares of the $60 million payment to Country M. Country M imposes no additional tax when Foreign Bank and its subsidiary sell their interests in Coupon Purchaser. Country M also does not impose Country M tax on interest received by U.S. residents from sources in Country M.
(
ii
)
Result.
The payment to Country M is not a compulsory payment, and thus is not an amount of foreign income tax paid, because the foreign payment is attributable to a structured passive investment arrangement. First, Partnership is an SPV because all of Partnership's income is passive investment income described in paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(C)(
5
) of this section; Partnership's only asset, Issuer's note, is held to produce such income; the payment to Country M is attributable to such income; and if the payment were an amount of foreign income tax paid, it would be paid in a U.S. taxable year in which Partnership meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(B)(
1
)(
i
) of this section. Second, if the foreign payment were an amount of tax paid, USP and Sub would be eligible to claim a credit for such payment under section 901(a). Third, USP and Sub would not pay any Country M tax if they directly owned Issuer's note. Fourth, for Country M tax purposes, Foreign Bank and its subsidiary deduct the $300 million purchase price of the coupons and are exempt from Country M tax on the $280 million received upon the sale of Coupon Purchaser, and the deduction and exemption correspond to more than 10% of the $300 million base with respect to which USP's and Sub's 100% share of the foreign payments was imposed. Fifth, Foreign Bank and its subsidiary are counterparties because they indirectly acquired assets of Partnership, the interest coupons on Issuer's note, and are not directly or indirectly owned by USP or Sub or shareholders of USP or Sub that are domestic corporations, U.S. citizens, or resident alien individuals. Sixth, the amount of taxable income of Partnership for one or more years is different for U.S. and Country M tax purposes, and the
amount of income attributable to USP and Sub for U.S. tax purposes is materially less than the amount of income they would recognize if the Country M tax treatment of the coupon sale controlled for U.S. tax purposes. Because the payment to Country M is not an amount of foreign income tax paid, USP and Sub are not considered to pay tax under section 901. USP and Sub have income of $10 million in the year of the coupon sale.

)
Facts.
A, a domestic corporation, wholly owns B, a Country X corporation engaged in the manufacture and sale of widgets. On January 1, Year 1, C, also a Country X corporation, loans $400 million to B in exchange for an instrument that is debt for U.S. tax purposes and equity in B for Country X tax purposes. As a result, C is considered to own stock of B for Country X tax purposes. B loans $55 million to D, a Country Y corporation wholly owned by A. In year 1, B has $166 million of net income attributable to its sales of widgets and $3.3 million of interest income attributable to the loan to D. Substantially all of B's assets are used in its widget business. Country Y does not impose tax on interest paid to nonresidents. B makes a payment of $50.8 million to Country X with respect to B's net income. Country X does not impose tax on dividend payments between Country X corporations. None of C's stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by A or by any shareholders of A that are domestic corporations, U.S. citizens, or resident alien individuals.
(
ii
)
Result.
B is not an SPV within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(B)(
1
) of this section because the amount of interest income received from D does not constitute substantially all of B's income and the $55 million note from D does not constitute substantially all of B's assets. Accordingly, the $50.8 million payment to Country X is not attributable to a structured passive investment arrangement.

Facts.
A Country X corporation (Foreign Bank) contributes $2 billion to a newly-formed Country X company (Newco) in exchange for 90% of the common stock of Newco and securities that are treated as debt of Newco for U.S. tax purposes and preferred stock of Newco for Country X tax purposes. A domestic corporation (USP) contributes $1 billion to Newco in exchange for 10% of Newco's common stock and securities that are treated as preferred stock of Newco for U.S. tax purposes and debt of Newco for Country X tax purposes. Newco loans the $3 billion to a wholly-owned, Country X subsidiary of Foreign Bank (FSub) in return for a $3 billion, seven-year note paying interest currently. The Newco securities held by USP represent more than 50% of the voting power in Newco and more than 50% of the value of the securities in Newco that are treated as equity for U.S. tax purposes. The Newco securities held by USP entitle the holder to fixed distributions of $4 million per year, and the Newco securities held by Foreign Bank entitle the holder to receive $82 million per year, payable only on maturity of the $3 billion FSub note in Year 7. At the end of Year 5, pursuant to a prearranged plan, Foreign Bank acquires USP's Newco stock and securities for a prearranged price of $1 billion. Country X does not impose tax on dividends received by one Country X corporation from a second Country X corporation. Under an income tax treaty between Country X and the United States, Country X does not impose Country X tax on interest received by U.S. residents from sources in Country X. None of Foreign Bank's stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by USP or any shareholders of USP that are domestic corporations, U.S. citizens, or resident alien individuals. In each of Years 1 through 7, FSub pays Newco $124 million of interest on the $3 billion note. Newco distributes $4 million to USP in each of Years 1 through 5. The distributions are deductible for Country X tax purposes, and Newco pays Country X $36 million with respect to $120 million of taxable income from the FSub note in each year. For U.S. tax purposes, in each year Newco's subpart F income and earnings and profits are increased by $124 million of interest income and reduced by accrued interest expense with respect to the Newco securities held by Foreign Bank.
(
ii
)
Result.
The $36 million payment to Country X is not a compulsory payment, and thus is not an amount of foreign income tax paid, because the foreign payment is attributable to a structured passive investment arrangement. First, Newco is an SPV because all of Newco's income is passive investment income described in paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(C)(
5
) of this section; Newco's only asset, a note of FSub, is held to produce such income; the payment to Country X is attributable to such income; and if the payment were an amount of foreign income tax paid it would be paid in a U.S. taxable year in which Newco meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(B)(
1
)(
i
) of this section. Second, if the foreign payment were an amount of foreign income tax paid, USP would be deemed to pay its pro rata share of the foreign payment under section 960(a) in each of Years 1 through 5 and, therefore, would be eligible to claim a credit under section 901(a). Third, USP would not pay any Country X tax if it directly owned its proportionate share of Newco's assets, a note of FSub. Fourth, for Country X tax purposes, Foreign Bank is eligible to receive a tax-free distribution of $82 million attributable to each of Years 1 through 5, and that amount corresponds to more than 10% of the foreign base with respect to which USP's share of the foreign payment was imposed. Fifth, Foreign Bank is a counterparty because it owns stock of Newco for Country X tax purposes and none of Foreign Bank's stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by USP or shareholders of USP that are domestic corporations, U.S. citizens, or resident alien individuals. Sixth, the United States and Country X treat various aspects of the arrangement differently, including whether the Newco securities held by Foreign Bank and USP are debt or equity. The amount of credits claimed by USP if the payment to Country X were an amount of foreign income tax paid is materially greater than it would be if the Country X tax treatment controlled for U.S. tax purposes such that the securities held by USP were treated as debt or the securities held by Foreign Bank were treated as equity, and the amount of income recognized by Newco for U.S. tax purposes is materially less than the amount of income recognized for Country X tax purposes. Because the payment to Country X is not an amount of foreign income tax paid, USP is not deemed to pay any Country X tax under section 960(a). USP has a subpart F inclusion of $4 million in each of Years 1 through 5.

Facts.
A, a Country X corporation, and B, a domestic corporation, each contribute $1 billion to a newly-formed Country X entity (C) in exchange for 50% of the common stock of C. C is treated as a corporation for Country X purposes and a partnership for U.S. tax purposes. C contributes $1.95 billion to a newly-formed Country X corporation (D) in exchange for 100% of D's common stock. C loans its remaining $50 million to D. Accordingly, C's sole assets are stock and debt of D. D uses the entire $2 billion to engage in the business of manufacturing and selling widgets. In Year 1, D derives $300 million of income from its widget business and derives $2 million of interest income. Also in Year 1, C has dividend income of $200 million and interest income of $3.2 million with respect to its investment in D. Country X does not impose tax on dividends received by one Country X corporation from a second Country X corporation. C makes a payment of $960,000 to Country X with respect to C's net income.

As a result, C's dividend income from D is not passive investment income and C's stock in D is not held to produce such income.

Example 9: Asset holding transaction
—(
i
)
Facts.
A domestic corporation (USP) contributes $6 billion of Country Z debt obligations to a Country Z entity (DE) in exchange for all of the class A and class B stock of DE. DE is a disregarded entity for U.S. tax purposes and a corporation for Country Z tax purposes. A corporation unrelated to USP and organized in Country Z (FC) contributes $1.5 billion to DE in exchange for all of the class C stock of DE. DE uses the $1.5 billion contributed by FC to redeem USP's class B stock. The terms of the class C stock entitle its holder to all income from DE, but FC is obligated immediately to contribute back to DE all distributions on the class C stock. USP and FC enter into a contract under which USP agrees to buy after five years the class C stock for $1.5 billion and an agreement under which USP agrees to pay FC periodic payments on $1.5 billion. The transaction is structured in such a way that, for U.S. tax purposes, there is a loan of $1.5 billion from FC to USP, and USP is the owner of the class C stock and the class A stock. In Year 1, DE earns $400 million of interest income on the Country Z debt obligations. DE makes a payment to Country Z of $100 million with respect to such income and distributes the remaining
$300 million to FC. FC contributes the $300 million back to DE. None of FC's stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by USP or shareholders of USP that are domestic corporations, U.S. citizens, or resident alien individuals. Assume that Country Z imposes a withholding tax on interest income derived by U.S. residents. Country Z treats FC as the owner of the class C stock. Pursuant to Country Z tax law, FC is required to report the $400 million of income with respect to the $300 million distribution from DE, but is allowed to claim credits for DE's $100 million payment to Country Z. For Country Z tax purposes, FC is entitled to current deductions equal to the $300 million contributed back to DE.
(
ii
)
Result.
The payment to Country Z is not a compulsory payment, and thus is not an amount of foreign income tax paid, because the payment is attributable to a structured passive investment arrangement. First, DE is an SPV because all of DE's income is passive investment income described in paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(C)(
5
) of this section; all of DE's assets are held to produce such income; the payment to Country Z is attributable to such income; and if the payment were an amount of tax paid it would be paid in a U.S. taxable year in which DE meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(B)(
1
)(
i
) of this section. Second, if the payment were an amount of foreign income tax paid, USP would be eligible to claim a credit for such amount under section 901(a). Third, USP's proportionate share of DE's foreign payment of $100 million is substantially greater than the amount of credits USP would be eligible to claim if it directly held its proportionate share of DE's assets, excluding any assets that would produce income subject to gross basis withholding tax if directly held by USP. Fourth, FC is entitled to claim a credit under Country Z tax law for the payment and recognizes a deduction for the $300 million contributed to DE under Country Z law. The credit claimed by FC corresponds to more than 10% of USP's share (for U.S. tax purposes) of the foreign payment and the deductions claimed by FC correspond to more than 10% of the base with respect to which USP's share of the foreign payment was imposed. Fifth, FC is a counterparty because FC is considered to own equity of DE under Country Z law and none of FC's stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by USP or shareholders of USP that are domestic corporations, U.S. citizens, or resident alien individuals. Sixth, the United States and Country Z treat certain aspects of the transaction differently, including the proportion of equity owned in DE by USP and FC, and the amount of credits claimed by USP if the Country Z payment were an amount of tax paid is materially greater than it would be if the Country Z tax treatment controlled for U.S. tax purposes such that FC, rather than USP, owned the class C stock. Because the payment to Country Z is not an amount of foreign income tax paid, USP is not considered to pay tax under section 901. USP has $400 million of interest income.

The results are the same as in paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(D)(

Example 11: Joint venture; no foreign tax benefit
—(
i
)
Facts.
FC, a Country X corporation, and USC, a domestic corporation, each contribute $1 billion to a newly-formed Country X entity (C) in exchange for stock of C. FC and USC are entitled to equal 50% shares of all of C's income, gain, expense and loss. C is treated as a corporation for Country X purposes and a partnership for U.S. tax purposes. In Year 1, C earns $200 million of net passive investment income, makes a payment to Country X of $60 million with respect to that income, and distributes $70 million to each of FC and USC. Country X does
not impose tax on dividends received by one Country X corporation from a second Country X corporation.
(
ii
)
Result.
FC's tax-exempt receipt of $70 million, or its 50% share of C's profits, is not a foreign tax benefit within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(B)(
4
) of this section because it does not correspond to any part of the foreign base with respect to which USC's share of the foreign payment was imposed. Accordingly, the $60 million payment to Country X is not attributable to a structured passive investment arrangement.

) of this section (the facts in

D is treated as a corporation for Country X purposes and disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. tax purposes. C has no other assets and earns no other income. In Year 1, D earns $200 million of passive investment income, makes a payment to Country X of $60 million with respect to that income, and distributes $140 million to C.
(
ii
)
Result.
C's tax-exempt receipt of $140 million is not a foreign tax benefit within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(B)(
4
) of this section because it does not correspond to any part of the foreign base with respect to which USC's share of the foreign payment was imposed. Fifty percent of C's foreign tax exemption is not a foreign tax benefit within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(B)(
4
) of this section because it relates to earnings of D that are distributed with respect to an equity interest in D that is owned indirectly by USC under both U.S. and foreign tax law. The remaining 50% of C's foreign tax exemption, as well as FC's tax-exempt receipt of $70 million from C, is also not a foreign tax benefit because it does not correspond to any part of the foreign base with respect to which USC's share of the foreign payment was imposed. Accordingly, the $60 million payment to Country X is not attributable to a structured passive investment arrangement.

Soak-up taxes
—(i)
In general.
An amount remitted to a foreign country is not an amount of foreign income tax paid to the extent that liability for the foreign income tax is dependent (by its terms or otherwise) on the availability of a credit for the tax against income tax liability to another country. Liability for foreign income tax is dependent on the availability of a credit for the foreign income tax against income tax liability to another country only if and to the extent that the foreign income tax would not be imposed but for the availability of such a credit.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section.
(A)
Example 1: Tax rates dependent on availability of credit
—(
1
)
Facts.
Country X imposes a tax on the receipt of royalties from sources in Country X by nonresidents of Country X. The tax is 15% of the gross amount of such royalties unless the recipient is a resident of the United States or of country A, B, C, or D, in which case the tax is 20% of the gross amount of such royalties. Like the United States, each of countries A, B, C, and D allows its residents a credit against the income tax otherwise payable to it for income taxes paid to other countries.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Because the 20% rate applies only to residents of countries that allow a credit for taxes paid to other countries and the 15% rate applies to residents of countries that do not allow such a credit, one-fourth of the Country X tax would not be imposed on residents of the United States but for the availability of such a credit. One-fourth of the Country X tax imposed on residents of the United States who receive royalties from sources in Country X is dependent on the availability of a credit for the Country X tax against income tax liability to another country and, accordingly, under paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section that amount is not an amount of foreign income tax paid.
(B)
Example 2: Tax not dependent on availability of credit
—(
1
)
Facts.
Country X imposes a net income tax on the realized net income of nonresidents of Country X from carrying on a trade or
business in Country X. Although Country X tax law does not prohibit other nonresidents from carrying on business in Country X, United States persons are the only nonresidents of Country X that carry on business in Country X. The Country X tax would be imposed in its entirety on a nonresident of Country X irrespective of the availability of a credit for the Country X tax against income tax liability to another country.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Because no portion of the Country X tax liability is dependent on the availability of a credit for such tax in another country, under paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section no portion of the Country X tax is a soak-up tax.
(C)
Example 3: Tax holiday denied to corporations with shareholders eligible for credit
—(
1
)
Facts.
Country X imposes a net income tax on the realized net income of all corporations incorporated in Country X. Country X allows a tax holiday to qualifying corporations incorporated in Country X that are owned by nonresidents of Country X, pursuant to which no Country X tax is imposed on the net income of a qualifying corporation for the first 10 years of its operations in Country X. A corporation qualifies for the tax holiday if it meets certain minimum investment criteria and if the development office of Country X certifies that in its opinion the operations of the corporation will be consistent with specified development goals of Country X. The development office will not issue this certification to any corporation owned by persons resident in countries that allow a credit to shareholders (such as a deemed paid credit under section 960) for Country X tax paid by a corporation incorporated in Country X. In practice, tax holidays are granted to a large number of corporations, but the Country X net income tax is imposed on a significant number of other corporations incorporated in Country X (for example, those owned by Country X persons and those which have had operations for more than 10 years) in addition to corporations denied a tax holiday because their shareholders qualify for a credit for the Country X tax against income tax liability to another country.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section, no portion of the Country X tax paid by Country X corporations denied a tax holiday because they have U.S. shareholders is dependent on the availability of a credit for the Country X tax against income tax liability to another country, because a significant number of other Country X corporations pay the Country X tax irrespective of the availability of a credit to their shareholders.
(D)
Example 4: Tax deferral allowed for corporations with shareholders eligible for credit
—(
1
)
Facts.
The facts are the same as those in paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section (the facts of
Example 3
), except that Country X corporations owned by persons resident in countries that allow a credit for Country X tax when dividends are distributed by the corporations are granted a provisional tax holiday. Under the provisional tax holiday, instead of relieving such a corporation from Country X tax for 10 years, liability for such tax is deferred until the Country X corporation distributes dividends.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Because a significant number of other Country X corporations pay the Country X tax irrespective of the availability of a credit to their shareholders, the result is the same as in paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section.
(E)
Example 5: Tax based on greater of tax in lieu of income tax or amount eligible for credit
—(
1
)
Facts.
Pursuant to a contract with Country X, A
,
a domestic corporation engaged in manufacturing activities in Country X, must pay tax to Country X equal to the greater of 5u (units of Country X currency) per item produced, or the maximum amount creditable by A against its U.S. income tax liability for that year with respect to income from its Country X operations. Also pursuant to the contract, A is exempted from Country X's otherwise generally-imposed net income tax. The contractual tax is a tax in lieu of income tax as defined in § 1.903-1(b). In Year 1, A produces 16 items, which would result in Country X tax of 16 × 5u = 80u, and taking into account the section 904 limitation, the maximum amount of Country X tax that A can claim as a credit against its U.S. income tax liability is 125u. Accordingly,
A's contractual liability for Country X tax in lieu of income tax is 125u, the greater of the two amounts.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section, the amount of tax paid by A that is dependent on the availability of a credit against income tax of another country is 125u−80u = 45u, the amount that would not be imposed but for the availability of a credit.
(f)
Taxpayer
—(1)
In general.
The person by whom tax is considered paid for purposes of sections 901 and 903 is the person on whom foreign law imposes legal liability for such tax, even if another person (e.g., a withholding agent) remits such tax. For purposes of this section, § 1.901-2A and § 1.903-1, the person on whom foreign law imposes such liability is referred to as the “taxpayer.” A foreign tax of a type described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(C) of this section is considered to be imposed on the recipients of wages if such tax is deducted from such wages under provisions that are comparable to section 3102 (a) and (b) of the Internal Revenue Code.
(2)
Party undertaking tax obligation as part of transaction
—(i)
In general.
Tax is considered paid by the taxpayer even if another party to a direct or indirect transaction with the taxpayer agrees, as a part of the transaction, to assume the taxpayer's foreign tax liability. The rules of the foregoing sentence apply notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. See § 1.901-2A for additional rules regarding dual capacity taxpayers.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraphs (f)(1) and (2)(i) of this section.
(A)
Example 1.
Under a loan agreement between A, a resident of Country X, and B, a United States person, A agrees to pay B a certain amount of interest net of any tax that Country X may impose on B with respect to its interest income. Country X imposes a 10 percent tax on the gross amount of interest income received by nonresidents of Country X from sources in Country X, and it is established that this tax is a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of § 1.903-1(b). Under the law of Country X this tax is imposed on the nonresident recipient, and any resident of Country X that pays such interest to a nonresident is required to withhold and pay over to Country X 10 percent of the amount of such interest, which is applied to offset the recipient's liability for the tax. Because legal liability for the tax is imposed on the recipient of such interest income, B is the taxpayer with respect to the Country X tax imposed on B's interest income from B's loan to A. Accordingly, B's interest income for Federal income tax purposes includes the amount of Country X tax that is imposed on B with respect to such interest income and that is paid on B's behalf by A pursuant to the loan agreement, and, under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, such tax is considered for purposes of section 903 to be paid by B.
(B)
Example 2.
The facts are the same as those in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that in collecting and receiving the interest B is acting as a nominee for, or agent of, C, who is a United States person. Because C (not B) is the beneficial owner of the interest, legal liability for the tax is imposed on C, not B (C's nominee or agent). Thus, C is the taxpayer with respect to the Country X tax imposed on C's interest income from C's loan to A. Accordingly, C's interest income for Federal income tax purposes includes the amount of Country X tax that is imposed on C with respect to such interest income and that is paid on C's behalf by A pursuant to the loan agreement. Under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, such tax is considered for purposes of section 903 to be paid by C. No such tax is considered paid by B.
(C)
Example 3.
Country X imposes a tax called the “Country X income tax.” A, a United States person engaged in construction activities in Country X, is subject to that tax. Country X has contracted with A for A to construct a naval base. A is a dual capacity taxpayer (as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section) and, in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) and (c)(1) of § 1.901-2A, A has established that the Country X income tax as applied to dual capacity persons and the Country X income tax as applied to persons other than dual capacity persons together constitute a single levy. A has also established that that levy is
a net income tax within the meaning of paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Pursuant to the terms of the contract, Country X has agreed to assume any Country X tax liability that A may incur with respect to A's income from the contract. For Federal income tax purposes, A's income from the contract includes the amount of tax liability that is imposed by Country X on A with respect to its income from the contract and that is assumed by Country X; and for purposes of section 901 the amount of such tax liability assumed by Country X is considered to be paid by A. By reason of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, Country X is not considered to provide a subsidy, within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3) of this section, to A.
(3)
Taxes imposed on combined income of two or more persons
—(i)
In general.
If foreign tax is imposed on the combined income of two or more persons (for example, a husband and wife or a corporation and one or more of its subsidiaries), foreign law is considered to impose legal liability on each such person for the amount of the tax that is attributable to such person's portion of the base of the tax. Therefore, if foreign tax is imposed on the combined income of two or more persons, such tax is allocated among, and considered paid by, such persons on a pro rata basis in proportion to each person's portion of the combined income, as determined under foreign law and paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section. Combined income with respect to each foreign tax that is imposed on a combined basis is computed separately, and the tax on that combined income is allocated separately under this paragraph (f)(3)(i). If foreign law exempts from tax, or provides for specific rates of tax with respect to, certain types of income, or if certain expenses, deductions or credits are taken into account only with respect to a particular type of income, combined income with respect to such portions of the combined income is also computed separately, and the tax on that combined income is allocated separately under this paragraph (f)(3)(i). The rules of this paragraph (f)(3) apply regardless of which person is obligated to remit the tax, which person actually remits the tax, or which person the foreign country could proceed against to collect the tax in the event all or a portion of the tax is not paid. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(3), the term
person
means an individual or an entity (including a disregarded entity described in § 301.7701-2(c)(2)(i) of this chapter) that is subject to tax in a foreign country as a corporation (or otherwise at the entity level). In determining the amount of tax paid by an owner of a partnership or a disregarded entity, this paragraph (f)(3) first applies to determine the amount of tax paid by the partnership or disregarded entity, and then paragraph (f)(4) of this section applies to allocate the amount of such tax to the owner.
(ii)
Combined income.
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(3), foreign tax is imposed on the combined income of two or more persons if such persons compute their taxable income on a combined basis under foreign law and foreign tax would otherwise be imposed on each such person on its separate taxable income. For example, income is computed on a combined basis if two or more persons add their items of income, gain, deduction, and loss to compute a single consolidated taxable income amount for foreign tax purposes. Foreign tax is considered to be imposed on the combined income of two or more persons even if the combined income is computed under foreign law by attributing to one such person (for example, the foreign parent of a foreign consolidated group) the income of other such persons or by treating persons that would otherwise be subject to tax as separate entities as unincorporated branches of a single corporation for purposes of computing the foreign tax on the combined income of the group. However, foreign tax is not considered to be imposed on the combined income of two or more persons if, because one or more persons is a fiscally transparent entity (under the principles of § 1.894-1(d)(3)) under foreign law, only one of such persons is subject to tax under foreign law (even if two or more of such persons are corporations for U.S. Federal income tax purposes). Therefore, foreign tax is not considered to be imposed on the combined income of two or more persons solely because foreign law:
(A) Permits one person to surrender a loss to another person pursuant to a group relief or other loss-sharing regime described in § 1.909-2(b)(2)(vi);
(B) Requires a shareholder of a corporation to include in income amounts attributable to taxes imposed on the corporation with respect to distributed earnings, pursuant to an integrated tax system that allows the shareholder a credit for such taxes;
(C) Requires a shareholder to include, pursuant to an anti-deferral regime (similar to subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code (sections 951 through 965)), income attributable to the shareholder's interest in the corporation;
(D) Reallocates income from one person to a related person under foreign transfer pricing rules;
(E) Requires a person to take into account a distributive share of income of an entity that is a partnership or other fiscally transparent entity for foreign tax law purposes; or
(F) Requires a person to take all or part of the income of an entity that is a corporation for U.S. Federal income tax purposes into account because foreign law treats the entity as a branch or fiscally transparent entity (a reverse hybrid). A reverse hybrid does not include an entity that is treated under foreign law as a branch or fiscally transparent entity solely for purposes of calculating combined income of a foreign consolidated group.
(iii)
Portion of combined income
—(A)
In general.
Each person's portion of the combined income is determined by reference to any return, schedule or other document that must be filed or maintained with respect to a person showing such person's income for foreign tax purposes, as properly amended or adjusted for foreign tax purposes. If no such return, schedule or other document must be filed or maintained with respect to a person for foreign tax purposes, then, for purposes of this paragraph (f)(3), such person's income is determined from the books of account regularly maintained by or on behalf of the person for purposes of computing its income for foreign tax purposes. Each person's portion of the combined income is determined by adjusting such person's income determined under this paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(A) as provided in paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(B) and (f)(3)(iii)(C) of this section.
(B)
Effect of certain payments.
(
1
) Each person's portion of the combined income is determined by giving effect to payments and accrued amounts of interest, rents, royalties, and other amounts between persons whose income is included in the combined base to the extent such amounts would be taken into account in computing the separate taxable incomes of such persons under foreign law if they did not compute their income on a combined basis. Each person's portion of the combined income is determined without taking into account any payments from other persons whose income is included in the combined base that are treated as dividends or other non-deductible distributions with respect to equity under foreign law, and without taking into account deemed dividends or any similar attribution of income made for purposes of computing the combined income under foreign law, regardless of whether any such deemed dividend or attribution of income results in a deduction or inclusion under foreign law.
(
2
) For purposes of determining each person's portion of the combined income, the treatment of a payment is determined under foreign law. Thus, for example, interest accrued by one group member with respect to an instrument held by another member that is treated as debt for foreign tax purposes but as equity for U.S. Federal income tax purposes would be considered income of the holder and would reduce the income of the issuer. See also § 1.909-2(b)(3)(i) for rules requiring suspension of foreign income taxes paid by the owner of a U.S. equity hybrid instrument.
(C)
Net losses.
If tax is considered to be imposed on the combined income of three or more persons and one or more of such persons has a net loss for the taxable year for foreign tax purposes, the following rules apply. If foreign law provides mandatory rules for allocating the net loss among the other persons, then the rules that apply for foreign tax purposes apply for purposes of this paragraph (f)(3). If foreign law does not provide mandatory rules for allocating the net loss, the net loss is
allocated among all other such persons on a pro rata basis in proportion to the amount of each person's income, as determined under paragraphs (f)(3)(iii)(A) and (f)(3)(iii)(B) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(C), foreign law is not considered to provide mandatory rules for allocating a net loss solely because such loss is attributed from one person to a second person for purposes of computing combined income, as described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section.
(iv)
Collateral consequences.
U.S. tax principles apply to determine the tax consequences if one person remits a tax that is the legal liability of, and thus is considered paid by, another person.

If foreign law imposes tax at the entity level on the income of a partnership, the partnership is considered to be legally liable for such tax under foreign law and therefore is considered to pay the tax for Federal income tax purposes. The rules of this paragraph (f)(4)(i) apply regardless of which person is obligated to remit the tax, which person actually remits the tax, or which person the foreign country could proceed against to collect the tax in the event all or a portion of the tax is not paid. See §§ 1.702-1(a)(6) and 1.704-1(b)(4)(viii) for rules relating to the determination of a partner's distributive share of such tax.
(ii)
Disregarded entities.
If foreign law imposes tax at the entity level on the income of an entity described in § 301.7701-2(c)(2)(i) of this chapter (a
disregarded entity
), the person (as defined in section 7701(a)(1)) who is treated as owning the assets of the disregarded entity for Federal income tax purposes is considered to be legally liable for such tax under foreign law. Such person is considered to pay the tax for Federal income tax purposes. The rules of this paragraph (f)(4)(ii) apply regardless of which person is obligated to remit the tax, which person actually remits the tax, or which person the foreign country could proceed against to collect the tax in the event all or a portion of the tax is not paid.
(5)
Allocation of taxes in the case of certain ownership or classification changes
—(i)
In general.
If a partnership, disregarded entity, or corporation undergoes one or more covered events during its foreign taxable year that do not result in a closing of the foreign taxable year, then a portion of the foreign income tax (other than a withholding tax described in section 901(k)(1)(B)) paid by a person under paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section with respect to the continuing foreign taxable year in which such covered event or events occur is allocated to and among all persons that were predecessor entities or prior owners during such foreign taxable year. The allocation is made based on the respective portions of the taxable income (as determined under foreign law) for the continuing foreign taxable year that are attributable under the principles of § 1.1502-76(b) to the period of existence or ownership of each predecessor entity or prior owner during the continuing foreign taxable year. Foreign income tax allocated to a person that is a predecessor entity is treated (other than for purposes of section 986) as paid by the person as of the close of the last day of its last U.S. taxable year. Foreign income tax allocated to a person that is a prior owner, for example a transferor of a disregarded entity, is treated (other than for purposes of section 986) as paid by the person as of the close of the last day of its U.S. taxable year in which the covered event occurred.
(ii)
Covered event.
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(5), a covered event is a partnership termination under section 708(b)(1), a transfer of a disregarded entity, or a change in the entity classification of a disregarded entity or a corporation.
(iii)
Predecessor entity and prior owner.
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(5), a predecessor entity is a partnership or a corporation that undergoes a covered event as described in paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section. A prior owner is a person that either transfers a disregarded entity or owns a disregarded entity immediately before a change in the entity classification of the disregarded entity as described in paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section.
(iv)
Partnership variances.
In the case of a change in any partner's interest in the partnership (a variance), except as otherwise provided in section 706(d)(2)
(relating to certain cash basis items) or 706(d)(3) (relating to tiered partnerships), foreign tax paid by the partnership during its U.S. taxable year in which the variance occurs is allocated between the portion of the U.S. taxable year ending on, and the portion of the U.S. taxable year beginning on the day after, the day of the variance. The allocation is made under the principles of this paragraph (f)(5) as if the variance were a covered event.
(6)
Allocation of foreign taxes in connection with elections under section 336(e) or 338 or § 1.245A-5(e).
For rules relating to the allocation of foreign taxes in connection with elections made pursuant to section 336(e), see § 1.336-2(g)(3)(ii). For rules relating to the allocation of foreign taxes in connection with elections made pursuant to section 338, see § 1.338-9(d). For rules relating to the allocation of foreign taxes in connection with elections made pursuant to § 1.245A-5(e)(3)(i), see § 1.245A-5(e)(3)(i)(B).
(7)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraphs (f)(3) through (6) of this section.
(i)
Example 1
—(A)
Facts.
A, a United States person, owns 100 percent of B, an entity organized in Country X. B owns 100 percent of C, also an entity organized in Country X. B and C are corporations for U.S. and foreign tax purposes that use the “u” as their functional currency. Pursuant to a consolidation regime, Country X imposes a net income tax described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section on the combined income of B and C within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section. In year 1, C pays 25u of interest to B. If B and C did not report their income on a combined basis for Country X tax purposes, the interest paid from C to B would result in 25u of interest income to B and 25u of deductible interest expense to C. For purposes of reporting the combined income of B and C, Country X first requires B and C to determine their own income (or loss) on a separate schedule. For this purpose, however, neither B nor C takes into account the 25u of interest paid from C to B because the income of B and C is included in the same combined base. The separate income of B and C reported on their Country X schedules for year 1, which do not reflect the 25u intercompany payment, is 100u and 200u, respectively. The combined income reported for Country X purposes is 300u (the sum of the 100u separate income of B and 200u separate income of C).
(B)
Result.
On the separate schedules described in paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, B's separate income is 100u and C's separate income is 200u. Under paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section, the 25u interest payment from C to B is taken into account for purposes of determining B's and C's portions of the combined income under paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section, because B and C would have taken the items into account if they did not compute their income on a combined basis. Thus, B's portion of the combined income is 125u (100u plus 25u) and C's portion of the combined income is 175u (200u less 25u). The result is the same regardless of whether the 25u interest payment from C to B is deductible for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. See paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(B)(
2
) of this section.
(ii)
Example 2
—(A)
Facts.
A, a United States person, owns 100 percent of B, an entity organized in Country X. B is a corporation for Country X tax purposes, and a disregarded entity for U.S. income tax purposes. B owns 100 percent of C and D, entities organized in country X that are corporations for both U.S. and Country X tax purposes. B, C, and D use the “u” as their functional currency and file on a combined basis for Country X income tax purposes. Country X imposes a net income tax described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section at the rate of 30 percent on the taxable income of corporations organized in Country X. Under the Country X combined reporting regime, income (or loss) of C and D is attributed to, and treated as income (or loss) of, B. B has the sole obligation to pay Country X income tax imposed with respect to income of B and income of C and D that is attributed to, and treated as income of, B. Under Country X tax law, Country X may proceed against B, but not C or D, if B fails to pay over to Country X all or any portion of the Country X income tax imposed with respect to such income. In year 1, B has income of 100u, C has income of 200u,
and D has a net loss of (60u). Under Country X tax law, B is considered to have 240u of taxable income with respect to which 72u of Country X income tax is imposed. Country X does not provide mandatory rules for allocating D's loss.
(B)
Result.
Under paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section, the 72u of Country X tax is considered to be imposed on the combined income of B, C, and D. Because Country X tax law does not provide mandatory rules for allocating D's loss between B and C, under paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(C) of this section D's (60u) loss is allocated pro rata: 20u to B ((100u/300u) × 60u) and 40u to C ((200u/300u) × 60u). Under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, the 72u of Country X tax must be allocated pro rata among B, C, and D. Because D has no income for Country X tax purposes, no Country X tax is allocated to D. Accordingly, 24u (72u × (80u/240u)) of the Country X tax is allocated to B, and 48u (72u × (160u/240u)) of such tax is allocated to C. Under paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section, A is considered to have legal liability for the 24u of Country X tax allocated to B under paragraph (f)(3) of this section.

§ 1.901-2A
Dual capacity taxpayers.
(a)
Application of separate levy rules as applied to dual capacity taxpayers
—(1)
In general.
If the application of a foreign levy (as defined in § 1.901-2(g)(3)) is different, either by the terms of the levy or in practice, for dual capacity taxpayers (as defined in § 1.901-2(a)(2)(ii)(A)) from its application to other persons, then, unless the only such difference is that a lower rate (but the same base) applies to dual capacity taxpayers, such difference is considered to be related to the fact that dual capacity taxpayers receive, directly or indirectly, a specific economic benefit (as defined in § 1.901-2(a)(2)(ii)(B)) from the foreign country and thus to be a difference in kind, and not merely of degree. In such a case, notwithstanding any contrary provision of § 1.901-2(d), the levy as applicable to such dual capacity taxpayers is a separate levy (within the meaning of § 1.901-2(d)) from the levy as applicable to such other persons, regardless of whether such difference is in the base of the levy, in the rate of the levy, or both. In such a case, each of the levy as applied to dual capacity taxpayers and the levy as applied to other persons must be analyzed separately to determine whether it is an income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(1) and whether it is a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of § 1.903-1(a). However, if the application of the levy is neither different by its terms nor different in practice for dual capacity taxpayers from its application to other persons, or if the only difference is that a lower rate (but the same base) applies to dual capacity taxpayers, then, in accordance with § 1.901-2(d), such foreign levy as applicable to dual capacity taxpayers and such levy as applicable to other persons together constitute a single levy. In such a case, no amount paid (as defined in § 1.901-2(g)(1)) pursuant to such levy by any such dual capacity taxpayer is considered to be paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit, and such levy, as applicable in the aggregate to such dual capacity taxpayers and to such other persons, is analyzed to determine whether it is an income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(1) or a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of § 1.903-1(a). Application of a foreign levy to dual capacity taxpayers will be considered to be different in practice from application of that levy to other persons, even if no such difference is apparent from the terms of the levy, unless it is established that application of that levy to dual capacity taxpayers does not differ in practice from its application to other persons.
(2)
Examples.
The provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Under a levy of country X called the country X income tax, every corporation that does business in country X is required to pay to country X 40 percent of its income from its business in country X. Income for purposes of the country X income tax is computed by subtracting specified deductions from the corporation's gross income derived from its business in country X. The specified deductions include the corporation's expenses attributable to such gross income and allowances for recovery of the cost of capital expenditures attributable to such gross income, except that under the terms of the country X income tax a corporation engaged in the exploitation of minerals K, L or M in country X is not permitted to recover, currently or in the future, expenditures it incurs in exploring for those minerals. In practice, the only corporations that engage in exploitation of the specified minerals in country X are dual capacity taxpayers. Thus, the application of the country X income tax to dual capacity taxpayers is different from its application to other corporations. The country X income tax as applied to corporations that engage in the exploitation of minerals K, L or M (dual capacity taxpayers) is, therefore, a separate levy from the country X income tax as applied to other corporations. Accordingly, each of (i) the country X income tax as applied to such dual capacity taxpayers and (ii) the country X income tax as applied to such other persons, must be analyzed separately to determine whether it is an income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(1) and whether it is a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of § 1.903-1(a).

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example 1, except that it is demonstrated that corporations that engage in exploitation of the specified minerals in country X and that are subject to the levy include both dual capacity taxpayers and other persons. The country X income tax as applied to all corporations is, therefore, a single levy. Accordingly, no amount paid pursuant to the country X income tax by a dual capacity taxpayer is considered to be paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit; and, if the country X income tax is an income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(1) or a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of § 1.903-1(a), it will be so considered in its entirety for all corporations subject to it.

# Example 3.
Under a levy of country Y called the country Y income tax, each corporation incorporated in country Y is required to pay to country Y a percentage of its worldwide income. The applicable percentage is greater for such corporations that earn more than a specified amount of income than for such corporations that earn less than that amount. Income for purposes of the levy is computed by deducting from gross income specified types of expenses and specified allowances for capital expenditures. The expenses for which deductions are permitted differ depending on the type of business in which the corporation subject to the levy is engaged,
e.g.,
a deduction for interest paid to a related party is not allowed for corporations engaged in enumerated types of activities. In addition, carryover of losses from one taxable period to another is permitted for corporations engaged in specified types of activities, but not for corporations engaged in other activities. By its terms, the foreign levy makes no distinction between dual capacity taxpayers and other persons. It is established that in practice the higher rate of the country Y income tax applies to both dual capacity taxpayers and other persons and that in practice the differences in the base of the country Y income tax (
e.g.,
the lack of a deduction for interest paid to related parties for some corporations subject to the levy and the lack of a carryover provision for some corporations subject to the levy) apply to both dual capacity taxpayers and other persons. The country Y income tax as applied to all corporations incorporated in country Y is therefore a single levy. Accordingly, no amount paid pursuant to the country Y income tax by a dual capacity taxpayer is considered to be paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit; and if the country Y income tax is an income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(1) or a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of § 1.903-1(a), it will be so considered in its entirety for all persons subject to it.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in example 3, except that it is not established that in practice the higher rate does not apply only to dual capacity taxpayers. By reason of such higher rate, application of the country Y income tax to dual capacity taxpayers is different in practice from application of the country Y income tax to other persons subject to it. The country Y income tax as applied to dual capacity taxpayers is therefore a separate levy from the country Y income tax as applied to other corporations incorporated in country Y. Accordingly, each of (i) the country Y income tax as applied to dual capacity taxpayers and (ii) the country Y income tax as applied to other corporations incorporated in country Y, must be analyzed separately to determine whether it is an income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(1) and whether it is a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of § 1.903-1(a).

# Example 5.
Under a levy of country X called the country X tax, all persons who do not engage in business in country X and who receive interest income from residents of country X are required to pay to country X 25 percent of the gross amount of such interest income. It is established that the country X tax applies by its terms and in practice to
certain banks that are dual capacity taxpayers and to persons who are not dual capacity taxpayers and that application to such dual capacity taxpayers does not differ by its terms or in practice from application to such other persons. The country X tax as applied to all such persons (both the dual capacity taxpayers and the other persons) is, therefore, a single levy. Accordingly, no amount paid pursuant to the country X tax by such a dual capacity taxpayer is considered to be paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit; and, if the country X tax is a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of § 1.903-1(a), it will be so considered in its entirety for all persons subject to it.

# Example 6.
Under a levy of country X called the country X tax, every corporation incorporated outside of country X (“foreign corporation”) that maintains a branch in country X is required annually to pay to country X 52 percent of its net income attributable to that branch. It is established that the application of the country X tax is neither different by its terms nor different in practice for certain banks that are dual capacity taxpayers from its application to persons (which may, but do not necessarily, include other banks) that are not dual capacity taxpayers. The country X tax as applied to all foreign corporations with branches in country X (
i.e.,
both those banks that are dual capacity taxpayers and the foreign corporations that are not dual capacity taxpayers) is, therefore, a single levy. Accordingly, no amount paid pursuant to the country X tax by a bank that is a dual capacity taxpayer is considered to be paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit; and, if the country X tax is an income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(1) or a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of § 1.903-1(a), it will be so considered in its entirety for all persons subject to it.

# Example 7.
Under a levy of country H called the country H tax, all corporations that are organized outside country H and that do not engage in business in country H are required to pay to country H a percentage of the gross amount of interest income derived from residents of country H. The percentage is 30 percent, except that it is 15 percent for a specified category of corporations. All corporations in that category are dual capacity taxpayers. It is established that the country H tax applies by its terms and in practice to dual capacity taxpayers and to persons that are not dual capacity taxpayers and that the only difference in application between such dual capacity taxpayers and such other persons is that a lower rate (but the same base) applies to such dual capacity taxpayers. The country H tax as applied to all such persons (both the dual capacity taxpayers and the other persons) is, therefore, a single levy. Accordingly, no amount paid pursuant to the country H tax by such a dual capacity taxpayer is considered to be paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit, and if the country H tax is a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of § 1.903-1(a), it will be so considered in its entirety for all persons subject to it.
(b)
Burden of proof for dual capacity taxpayers
—(1)
In general.
For credit to be allowable under section 901 or 903, the person claiming credit must establish that the foreign levy with respect to which credit is claimed is an income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(1) or a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of § 1.903-1(a), respectively. Thus, such person must establish, among other things, that such levy is a tax. See § 1.901-2(a)(2)(i) and § 1.903-1(a). Where a person claims credit under section 901 or 903 for an amount paid by a dual capacity taxpayer pursuant to a foreign levy, § 1.901-2(a)(2)(i) and § 1.903-1(a), respectively, require such person to establish the amount, if any, that is paid pursuant to the distinct element of the levy that is a tax. If, pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section and § 1.901-2(d), such levy as applicable to dual capacity taxpayers and such levy as applicable to other persons together constitute a single levy, then no amount paid pursuant to that levy by any such dual capacity taxpayer is considered to be paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit. Accordingly, such levy has only one distinct element, and the levy either is or is not, in its entirety, a tax. If, however, such levy as applicable to dual capacity taxpayers is a separate levy from such levy as applicable to other persons, then a person claiming credit under section 901 or 903 for an amount paid by a dual capacity taxpayer pursuant to such separate levy may establish the amount, if any, that is paid pursuant to the distinct element of the levy that is a tax only by the facts and circumstances method or the safe harbor method described in paragraph (c) of this section. If such person fails to so establish such amount, no portion of the amount that is paid pursuant to the separate levy by the dual capacity taxpayer to such foreign country shall be treated as an amount of tax. Any amount that, either by reason of application of the
methods of paragraph (c) of this section or by reason of the immediately preceding sentence, is not treated as an amount of tax shall (i) be considered to have been paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit; (ii) be characterized (
e.g.,
as royalty, purchase price, cost of sales, reduction of the proceeds of a sale, or reduction of interest income) according to the nature of the transaction and of the specific economic benefit received; and (iii) be treated according to such characterization for all purposes of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that any determination that an amount is not tax for purposes of section 901 or 903 by reason of application of the safe harbor method shall not be taken into account in determining whether or not such an amount is to be characterized and treated as tax for purposes of computing an allowance for percentage depletion under sections 611 and 613.
(2)
Effect of certain treaties.
If, irrespective of whether such credit would be allowable under section 901 or 903 in the absence of a treaty, the United States has in force a treaty with a foreign country that treats a foreign levy as an income tax for purposes of allowing credit for United States tax and if the person claiming credit is entitled to the benefit of such treaty, then, unless such person claims credit not under the treaty but under section 901 or 903, and except to the extent the treaty provides otherwise and subject to all terms, conditions and limitations provided in the treaty, no portion of an amount paid with respect to such levy by a dual capacity taxpayer shall be considered to be paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit. If, however, such person claims credit not under such treaty but rather under section 901 or 903 (
e.g.,
so as not to be subject to a limitation contained in such treaty), the provisions of this section apply to such levy.
(c)
Satisfaction of burden of proof
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (c) sets out the methods by which a person who claims credit under section 901 or 903 for an amount paid by a dual capacity taxpayer pursuant to a foreign levy that satisfies all of the criteria of section 901 or 903 other than the determination of the distinct element of the levy that is a tax and of the amount that is paid pursuant to that distinct element (a “qualifying levy”) may establish such distinct element and amount. Such person must establish the amount paid pursuant to a qualifying levy that is paid pursuant to the distinct element of the levy that is a tax (which amount therefore is an amount of income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(1) or an amount of tax in lieu of income tax within the meaning of § 1.903-1(a) (a “qualifying amount”)) only by the facts and circumstances method set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section or the safe harbor method set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. A levy is not a qualifying levy, and neither the facts and circumstances method nor the safe harbor method applies to an amount paid by a dual capacity taxpayer pursuant to a foreign levy, if it has been established pursuant to § 1.901-2(d) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section that that levy as applied to that dual capacity taxpayer and that levy as applied to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers together constitute a single levy, or if it has been established in accordance with the first sentence of paragraph (b)(2) of this section that credit is allowable by reason of a treaty for an amount paid with respect to such levy.
(2)
Facts and circumstances method
—(i)
In general.
If the person claiming credit establishes, based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances, the amount, if any, paid by the dual capacity taxpayer pursuant to the qualifying levy that is not paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit, such amount is the qualifying amount with respect to such qualifying levy. In determining the qualifying amount with respect to a qualifying levy under the facts and circumstances method, neither the methodology nor the results that would have obtained if a person had elected to apply the safe harbor method to such qualifying levy is a relevant fact or circumstance. Accordingly, neither such methodology nor such results shall be taken into account in applying the facts and circumstances method.
(ii)
Examples.
The application of the facts and circumstances method is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Country A, which does not have a generally imposed income tax, imposes a levy, called the country A income tax, on corporations that carry on the banking business through a branch in country A. All such corporations lend money to the government of country A, and the consideration (interest) paid by the government of country A for the loans is not made available by the government on substantially the same terms to the population of country A in general. Thus, the country A income tax is imposed only on dual capacity taxpayers.
L,
a corporation that carries on the banking business through a branch in country A and that is a dual capacity taxpayer, establishes that all of the criteria of section 901 are satisfied by the country A income tax, except for the determination of the distinct element of the levy that is a tax and of
L
's qualifying amount with respect thereto. The country A income tax is, therefore, a qualifying levy.
L
establishes that, although all persons subject to the country A income tax are dual capacity taxpayers, the country A income tax applies in the same manner to income from such persons' transactions with the government of country A as it does to income from their transactions with private persons; that there are significant transactions (either in volume or in amount) with private persons; and that the portion of such persons' income that is derived from transactions with the government of country A on the one hand or private persons on the other varies greatly among persons subject to the country A income tax. By making this showing,
L
has demonstrated that no portion of the amount paid by it to country A pursuant to the levy is paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit (the interest income). Accordingly,
L
has demonstrated under the facts and circumstances method that the entire amount it has paid pursuant to the country A income tax is a qualifying amount.

# Example 2. A,
a domestic corporation that is a dual capacity taxpayer subject to a qualifying levy of country X, pays 1000u (units of country X currency) to country X in 1986 pursuant to the qualifying levy.
A
does not elect to apply the safe harbor method to country X, but if it had so elected, 800u would have been
A's
qualifying amount with respect to the levy. Based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances (which do not include either the methodology of the safe harbor method or the qualifying amount that would have obtained under that method),
A
establishes that 628u of such 1000u is not paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit.
A
has demonstrated under the facts and circumstances method that 628u is a qualifying amount. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 372u (1000u-628u) is considered to have been paid by
A
in exchange for a specific economic benefit. That amount is characterized and treated as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example 2 except that under the safe harbor method 580u would have been
A
's qualifying amount with respect to the levy. That amount is not a relevant fact or circumstance and the result is the same as in example 2.
(3)
Safe harbor method.
Under the safe harbor method, the person claiming credit makes an election as provided in paragraph (d) of this section and, pursuant to such election, applies the safe harbor formula described in paragraph (e) of this section to the qualifying levy or levies to which the election applies.
(d)
Election to use the safe harbor method
—(1)
Scope of election.
An election to use the safe harbor method is made with respect to one or more foreign states and possessions of the United States with respect to a taxable year of the person making the election (the “electing person”). Such election applies to such taxable year and to all subsequent taxable years of the electing person (“election years”), unless the election is revoked in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of this section. If an election applies to a foreign state or possession of the United States (“elected country”), it applies to all qualifying levies of the elected country and to all qualifying levies of all political subdivisions of the elected country with respect to which the electing person claims credit for amounts paid (or deemed to be paid) by any dual capacity taxpayer. A member of an affiliated group that files a consolidated United States income tax return may use the safe harbor method for a foreign state or U.S. possession only if an election to use the safe harbor method for that state or possession has been made by the common parent of such affiliated group on behalf of all members of the group. Similarly, a member of an affiliated group that does not file a consolidated United States income tax return may elect to use the safe harbor method for a foreign state or U.S. possession only if an election to use the safe harbor method for that state or possession is made by each member of the affiliated group which claims credit for taxes paid to such state or possession or to any political subdivision thereof.
An election to use the safe harbor method for an elected country does not apply to foreign taxes carried back or forward to any election year from any taxable year to which the election does not apply. Such election does apply to foreign taxes carried back or forward from any election year to any taxable year. A person who elects to use the safe harbor method for one or more foreign countries may, in a later taxable year, also elect to use that method for other foreign countries.
(2)
Effect of election.
An election to use the safe harbor method described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section requires the electing person to apply the safe harbor formula of paragraph (e) of this section to all qualifying levies of all elected countries and their political subdivisions, and constitutes a specific waiver by such person of the right to use the facts and circumstances method described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section with respect to any levy of any elected country or any political subdivision thereof.
(3)
Time and manner of making election
—(i)
In general.
To elect to use the safe harbor method, an electing person must attach a statement to its United States income tax return for the taxable year for which the election is made and must file such return by the due date (including extensions) for the filing thereof. Such statement shall state—
(A) That the electing person elects to use the safe harbor method for the foreign states and the possessions of the United States designated in the statement and their political subdivisions, and
(B) That the electing person waives the right, for any election year, to use the facts and circumstances method for any levy of the designated states, possessions and political subdivisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person may, with the consent of the Commissioner, elect to use the safe harbor method for a taxable year for one or more foreign states or possessions of the United States, at a date later than that specified in the first sentence of this paragraph (d)(3)(i),
e.g.,
upon audit of such person's United States income tax return for such taxable year. The Commissioner will normally consent to such a later election if such person demonstrates that it failed to make a timely election for such a foreign state or possession for such taxable year because such person reasonably believed either that it was not a dual capacity taxpayer with respect to such state or possession or that no levy that it paid to such state or possession or any political subdivision thereof was a qualifying levy (for example, because it reasonably, but incorrectly, believed that the levy it paid was not a separate levy from that applicable to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers). The Commissioner will not, however, consent to such a later election with respect to any state or possession for a taxable year if such person (or any other member of an affiliated group of which such person is a member) applied the facts and circumstances method to any levy of such state or possession or any political subdivision thereof for such taxable year.
(ii) Certain retroactive elections. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section relating to the time and manner of making an election, an election may be made for a taxable year beginning on or before November 14, 1983, provided the electing person elects in accordance with § 1.901-2(h) to apply all of the provisions of this section, § 1.901-2 and § 1.903-1 to such taxable year and provided all of the requirements set forth in this paragraph (d)(3)(ii) are satisfied. Such an election shall be made by timely (including extensions) filing a federal income tax return or an amended federal income tax return for such taxable year; by attaching to such return a statement containing the statements and information set forth in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section; and by filing amended income tax returns for all subsequent election years for which income tax returns have previously been filed in which credit is claimed under section 901 or 903 and applying the safe harbor method in such amended returns. All amended returns referred to in the immediately preceding sentence must be filed on or before October 12, 1984, (unless the Commissioner consents to a later filing in circumstances similar to those provided in paragraph (d)(3)(i)) and at a
time when neither assessment of a deficiency for any of such election years nor the filing of a claim for any refund claimed in any such amended return is barred.
(iii)
Election to credit taxes made in amended return.
If a person has filed a United States income tax return for a taxable year to which this § 1.901-2A applies (including application by reason of the election provided in § 1.901-2(h)(2)) in which such person has deducted (instead of credited) qualifying foreign taxes and such person validly makes an election to credit (instead of deduct) such taxes in a timely filed amended return for such taxable year, an election to use the safe harbor method may be made in such amended return provided all of the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section are satisfied other than the requirement that such amended return and the other amended returns referred to in that paragraph be filed on or before October 12, 1984.
(4)
Revocation of election.
An election to use the safe harbor method described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section may not be revoked without the consent of the Commissioner. An application for consent to revoke such election with respect to one or more elected countries shall be made to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC 20224. Such application shall be made not later than the 30th day before the due date (including extensions) for the filing of the income tax return for the first taxable year for which the revocation is sought to be effective, except in the case of an event described in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) below, in which case an application for revocation with retroactive effect may be made within a reasonable time after such event. The Commissioner may make his consent to any revocation conditioned upon adjustments being made in one or more taxable years so as to prevent the revocation from resulting in a distortion of the amount of any item relating to tax liability in any taxable year. The Commissioner will normally consent to a revocation (including, in the case of (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) below, one with retroactive effect), if—
(i) An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code or the regulations thereunder is made which applies to the taxable year for which the revocation is to be effective and the amendment substantially affects the taxation of income from sources outside the United States under subchapter N of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code; or
(ii) After a safe harbor election is made with respect to a foreign state, a tax treaty between the United States and that state enters into force; that treaty covers a foreign tax to which the safe harbor election applies; and that treaty applies to the taxable year for which the revocation is to be effective; or
(iii) After a safe harbor election is made with respect to a foreign state or possession of the United States, a material change is made in the tax law of that state or possession or of a political subdivision of that state or possession; and the changed law applies to the taxable year for which the revocation is to be effective and has a material effect on the taxpayer; or
(iv) With respect to a foreign country to which a safe harbor election applies, the Internal Revenue Service issues a letter ruling to the electing person and that letter ruling (
A
) relates to the availability or application of the safe harbor method to one or more levies of such foreign country; (
B
) does not relate to the facts and circumstances method described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and (
C
) fails to include a ruling requested by the electing person or includes a ruling contrary to one requested by such person (in either case, other than one relating to the facts and circumstances method) and such failure or inclusion has a material adverse effect on the amount of such electing person's credit for taxes paid to such foreign country for the taxable year for which the revocation is to be effective; or
(v) A corporation (“new member”) becomes a member of an affiliated group; the new member and one or more pre-existing members of such group are dual capacity taxpayers with respect to the same foreign country; and, with respect to such country, either the new member or the pre-existing members (but not both) have made
a safe harbor election; and the Commissioner in his discretion determines that obtaining the benefit of the right to revoke the safe harbor election with respect to such foreign country was not the principal purpose of the affiliation between such new member and such group; or
(vi) The election has been in effect with respect to at least three taxable years prior to the taxable year for which the revocation is to be effective.
The Commissioner may, in his discretion, consent to a revocation even if none of the foregoing subdivisions (i) through (vi) is applicable. If an election has been revoked with respect to an elected country, a subsequent election to apply the safe harbor method with respect to such elected country may be made only with the consent of the Commissioner and upon such terms and conditions as the Commissioner in his discretion may require.
(e)
Safe harbor formula
—(1)
In general.
The safe harbor formula applies to determine the distinct element of a qualifying levy that is a tax and the amount paid by a dual capacity taxpayer pursuant to such qualifying levy that is the qualifying amount with respect to such levy. Under the safe harbor formula the amount paid in a taxable year pursuant to a qualifying levy that is the qualifying amount with respect to such levy is an amount equal to:
(A − B − C) × D / (1 − D)
where (except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section):
A = the amount of gross receipts as determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section
B = the amount of costs and expenses as determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section
C = the total amount paid in the taxable year by the dual capacity taxpayer pursuant to the qualifying levy (the “actual payment amount”)
D = the tax rate as determined under paragraph (e)(3) of this section
In no case, however, shall the qualifying amount exceed the actual payment amount; and the qualifying amount is zero if the safe harbor formula yields a qualifying amount less than zero. The safe harbor formula is intended to yield a qualifying amount that is approximately equal to the amount of generally imposed income tax within the meaning of paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) of § 1.903-1 (“general tax”) of the foreign country that would have been required to be paid in the taxable year by the dual capacity taxpayer if it had not been a dual capacity taxpayer and if the base of the general tax had allowed a deduction in such year for the amount (“specific economic benefit amount”) by which the actual payment amount exceeds the qualifying amount. See, however, paragraph (e)(5) of this section if an elected country has no general tax. The specific economic benefit amount is considered to be the portion of the actual payment amount that is paid pursuant to the distinct portion of the qualifying levy that imposes an obligation in exchange for a specific economic benefit. The specific economic benefit amount is therefore considered to be an amount paid by the dual capacity taxpayer in exchange for such specific economic benefit, which amount must be treated for purposes of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(2)
Determination of gross receipts and costs and expenses.
For purposes of the safe harbor formula, gross receipts and costs and expenses are, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e), the gross receipts and the deductions for costs and expenses, respectively, as determined under the foreign law applicable in computing the actual payment amount of the qualifying levy to which the safe harbor formula applies. However, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e), if provisions of the qualifying levy increase or decrease the liability imposed on dual capacity taxpayers compared to the general tax liability of persons other than dual capacity taxpayers by reason of the determination or treatment of gross receipts or of costs or expenses, the provisions generally applicable in computing such other persons' tax base under the general tax shall apply to determine gross receipts and costs and expenses for purposes of computing the qualifying amount. If provisions of the qualifying levy relating to gross receipts meet the requirements of § 1.901-2(b)(3)(i), such provisions shall apply to
determine gross receipts for purposes of computing the qualifying amount. If neither the general tax nor the qualifying levy permits recovery of one or more costs or expenses, and by reason of the failure to permit such recovery the qualifying levy does not satisfy the net income requirement of § 1.901-2(b)(4) (even though the general tax does satisfy that requirement), then such cost or expense shall be considered a cost or expense for purposes of computing the qualifying amount. If the qualifying levy does not permit recovery of one or more significant costs or expenses, but provides allowances that effectively compensate for nonrecovery of such significant costs or expenses, then, for purposes of computing the qualifying amount, costs and expenses shall not include the costs and expenses under the general tax whose nonrecovery under the qualifying levy is compensated for by such allowances but shall instead include such allowances. In determining costs and expenses for purposes of computing the qualifying amount with respect to a qualifying levy, the actual payment amount with respect to such levy shall not be considered a cost or expense. For purposes of this paragraph, the following differences in gross receipts and costs and expenses between the qualifying levy and the general tax shall not be considered to increase the liability imposed on dual capacity taxpayers compared to the general tax liability of persons other than dual capacity taxpayers, but only if the general tax would be an income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(1) if such different treatment under the qualifying levy had also applied under the general tax:
(i) Differences in the time of realization or recognition of one or more items of income or in the time when recovery of one or more costs and expenses is allowed (unless the period of recovery of such costs and expenses pursuant to the qualifying levy is such that it effectively is a denial of recovery of such costs and expenses, as described in § 1.901-2(b)(4)(i)); and
(ii) Differences in consolidation or carryover provisions of the types described in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii) and (b)(4)(iii) of § 1.901-2.
(3)
Determination of tax rate.
The tax rate for purposes of the safe harbor formula is the tax rate (expressed as a decimal) that is applicable in computing tax liability under the general tax. If the rate of the general tax varies according to the amount of the base of that tax, the rate to be applied in computing the qualifying amount is the rate that applies under the general tax to a person whose base is, using the terminology of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, “A” minus “B” minus the specific economic benefit amount paid by the dual capacity taxpayer pursuant to the qualifying levy, provided such rate applies in practice to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers, or, if such rate does not so apply in practice, the next lowest rate of the general tax that does so apply in practice.
(4)
Determination of applicable provisions of general tax
—(i)
In general.
If the general tax is a series of income taxes (
e.g.,
on different types of income), or if the application of the general tax differs by its terms for different classes of persons subject to the general tax (
e.g.,
for persons in different industries), then, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e), the qualifying amount small be computed by reference to the income tax contained in such series of income taxes, or in the case of such different applications the application of the general tax, that by its terms and in practice imposes the highest tax burden on persons other than dual capacity taxpayers. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the general tax amount shall be computed by reference to the application of the general tax to entities of the same type (as determined under the general tax) as the dual capacity taxpayer and to persons of the same resident or nonresident status (as determined under the general tax) as the dual capacity taxpayer; and, if the general tax treats business income differently from non-business (
e.g.,
investment) income (as determined under the general tax), the dual capacity taxpayer's business and non-business income shall be treated as the general tax treats such income. If, for example, the dual capacity taxpayer would, under the general tax, be treated as a resident (
e.g.,
because the
general tax treats an entity that is organized in the foreign country or managed or controlled there as a resident) and as a corporation (
i.e.,
because the rules of the general tax treat an entity like the dual capacity taxpayer as a corporation), and if some of the dual capacity taxpayer's income would, under the general tax, be treated as business income and some as non-business income, the dual capacity taxpayer and its income shall be so treated in computing the qualifying amount.
(ii)
Establishing that provisions apply in practice.
For purposes of the safe harbor formula a provision (including tax rate) shall be considered a provision of the general tax only if it is reasonably likely that that provision applies by its terms and in practice to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers. In general, it will be assumed that a provision (including tax rate) that by its terms applies to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers is reasonably likely to apply in practice to such other persons, unless the person claiming credit knows or has reason to know otherwise. However, in cases of doubt, the person claiming credit may be required to demonstrate that such provision is reasonably likely so to apply in practice.
(5)
No general tax.
If a foreign country does not impose a general tax (and thus a levy, in order to be a qualifying levy must satisfy all of the criteria of section 901 (because section 903 cannot apply), other than the determination of the distinct element of the levy that is a tax and of the amount that is paid pursuant to that distinct element), paragraphs (e)(2), (3) and (4) of this section do not apply to a qualifying levy of such country, and the terms of the safe harbor formula set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section are defined with respect to such levy as follows:
A = the amount of gross receipts as determined under the qualifying levy;
B = the amount of deductions for costs and expenses as determined under the qualifying levy;
C = the actual payment amount; and
D = the lower of the rate of the qualifying levy, or the rate of tax specified in section 11(b)(5) (or predecessor or successor section, as the case may be) of the Internal Revenue Code as applicable to the taxable year in which the actual payment amount is paid.
(6)
Certain taxes in lieu of an income tax.
To the extent a tax in lieu of an income tax (within the meaning of § 1.903-1(a)) that applies in practice to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers would actually have been required to be paid in the taxable year by a dual capacity taxpayer if it had not been a dual capacity taxpayer (
e.g.,
in substitution for the general tax with respect to a type of income, such as interest income, dividend income, royalty income, insurance income), such tax in lieu of an income tax shall be treated as if it were an application of the general tax for purposes of applying the safe harbor formula of this paragraph (e) to such dual capacity taxpayer, and such formula shall be applied to yield a qualifying amount that is approximately equal to the general tax (so defined) that would have been required to be paid in the taxable year by such dual capacity taxpayer if the base of such general tax had allowed a deduction in such year for the specific economic benefit amount.
(7)
Multiple levies.
If, in any election year of an electing person, with respect to any elected country and all of its political subdivisions,
(i) Amounts are paid by a dual capacity taxpayer pursuant to more than one qualifying levy or pursuant to one or more levies that are qualifying levies and one or more levies that are not qualifying levies by reason of the last sentence of paragraph (c)(1) of this section but with respect to which credit is allowable, or
(ii) More than one general tax (including a tax treated as if it were an application of the general tax under paragraph (e)(6)) would have been required to be paid by a dual capacity taxpayer (or taxpayers) if it (or they) had not been a dual capacity taxpayer (or taxpayers), or
(iii) Credit is claimed with respect to amounts paid by more than one dual capacity taxpayer, the provisions of this paragraph (e) shall be applied such that the aggregate qualifying amount with respect to such qualifying levy or levies plus the aggregate amount paid with respect to levies referred to in (e)(7)(i) that are not qualifying levies
shall be the aggregate amount that would have been required to be paid in the taxable year by such dual capacity taxpayer (or taxpayers) pursuant to such general tax or taxes if it (or they) had not been a dual capacity taxpayer (or taxpayers) and if the base of such general tax or taxes had allowed a deduction in such year for the aggregate specific economic benefit amount (except that, if paragraph (e)(5) applies to any levy of such elected country or any political subdivision thereof, the aggregate qualifying amount for qualifying levies of such elected country and all of its political subdivisions plus the aggregate amount paid with respect to levies referred to in paragraph (e)(7)(i) that are not qualifying levies shall not exceed the greater of the aggregate amount paid with respect to levies referred to in paragraph (e)(7)(i) that are not qualifying levies and the amount determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(5) where “D” is the rate of tax specified in section 11(b)(5) (or predecessor or successor section, as the case may be) of the Internal Revenue Code as applicable to the taxable year in which the actual payment amount is paid). However, in no event shall such aggregate amount exceed the aggregate actual payment amount plus the aggregate amount paid with respect to levies referred to in (e)(7)(i) that are not qualifying levies, nor be less than the aggregate amount paid with respect to levies referred to in (e)(7)(i) that are not qualifying levies. In applying (e)(7)(ii) a person who is not subject to a levy but who is considered to receive a specific economic benefit by reason of § 1.901-2(a)(2)(ii)(E) shall be treated as a dual capacity taxpayer. See example 12 in paragraph (e)(8) of this section.
(8)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (e) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Under a levy of country X called the country X income tax, every corporation that does business in country X is required to pay to country X 40% of its income from its business in country X. Income for purposes of the country X income tax is computed by subtracting specified deductions from the corporation's gross income derived from its business in country X. The specified deductions include the corporation's expenses attributable to such gross income and allowances for recovery of the cost of capital expenditures attributable to such gross income, except that under the terms of the country X income tax a corporation engaged in the exploitation of minerals K, L or M in country X is not permitted to recover, currently or in the future, expenditures it incurs in exploring for those minerals. Under the terms of the country X income tax interest is not deductible to the extent it exceeds an arm's length amount (
e.g.,
if the loan to which the interest relates is not in accordance with normal commercial practice or to the extent the interest rate exceeds an arm's length rate). In practice, the only corporations that engage in exploitation of the specified minerals in country X are dual capacity taxpayers. Because no other persons subject to the levy engage in exploitation of minerals K, L or M in country X, the application of the country X income tax to dual capacity taxpayers is different from its application to other corporations. The country X income tax as applied to corporations that engage in the exploitation of minerals K, L or M (dual capacity taxpayers) is, therefore, a separate levy from the country X income tax as applied to other corporations.
A
is a U.S. corporation that is engaged in country X in exploitation of mineral K. Natural deposits of mineral K in country X are owned by country X, and
A
has been allowed to extract mineral K in consideration of payment of a bonus and of royalties to an instrumentality of country X. Therefore,
A
is a dual capacity taxpayer. In 1984,
A
does business in country X within the meaning of the levy.
A
has validly elected the safe harbor method for country X for 1984. In 1984, as determined in accordance with the country X income tax as applied to
A, A
has gross receipts of 120u (units of country X currency), deducts 20u of costs and expenses, and pays 40u (40% of (120u-20u)) to country X pursuant to the levy.
A
also incurs in 1984 10u of nondeductible expenditures for exploration for mineral K and 2u of nondeductible interest costs attributable to an advance of funds from a related party to finance an undertaking relating to the exploration for mineral K for which normal commercial financing was unavailable because of the substantial risk inherent in the undertaking.
A
establishes that the country X income tax as applied to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers is an income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(1), that it is the generally imposed income tax of country X and hence the general tax, and that all of the criteria of section 903 are satisfied with respect to the country X income tax as applied to dual capacity taxpayers, except for the determination of the distinct element of the levy that is a tax and of
A
's qualifying amount with respect thereto. (No conclusion is reached whether the country X income tax as applied to dual capacity taxpayers is an
income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(1). Such a determination would require, among other things, that the country X income tax as so applied, judged on the basis of its predominant character, meets the net income requirement of § 1.901-2(b)(4) notwithstanding its failure to permit recovery of exploration expenses.)
A
has therefore demonstrated that the country X income tax as applied to dual capacity taxpayers is a qualifying levy.
In applying the safe harbor formula, in accordance with paragraph (e)(2), the amount of
A
's costs and expenses includes the 10u of nondeductible exploration expenses. The failure to permit recovery of interest in excess of arm's length amounts, a provision of both the general tax and the qualifying levy, does not cause the qualifying levy to fail to satisfy the net income requirement of § 1.901-2(b)(4); therefore, the amount of
A
's costs and expenses does not include the 2u of nondeductible interest costs. Thus, under the safe harbor method,
A
's qualifying amount with respect to the levy is 33.33u ((120u−30u−40u) × .40/(1−.40)).
A
's specific economic benefit amount is 6.67u (
A
's actual payment amount (40u) less
A
's qualifying amount (33.33u)). Under paragraph (a) of this section, this 6.67u is considered to be consideration paid by
A
for the right to extract mineral K. Pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, this amount is characterized according to the nature of
A
's transactions with country X and its instrumentality and of the specific economic benefit received (the right to extract mineral K), as an additional royalty or other business expense paid or accrued by
A
and is so treated for all purposes of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that if an allowance for percentage depletion is allowable to
A
under sections 611 and 613 with respect to
A
's interest in mineral K, the determination whether this 6.67u is tax or royalty for purposes of computing the amount of such allowance shall be made under sections 611 and 613 without regard to the determination that under the safe harbor formula such 6.67u is not tax for purposes of section 901 or 903.

# Example 2.
Under a levy of country Y called the country Y income tax, each corporation incorporated in country Y is required to pay to country Y a percentage of its worldwide income. The applicable percentage is 40 percent of the first 1,000u (units of country Y currency) of income and 50 percent of income in excess of 1,000u. Income for purposes of the levy is computed by deducting from gross income specified types of expenses and specified allowances for capital expenditures. The expenses for which deductions are permitted differ depending on the type of business in which the corporation subject to the levy is engaged,
e.g.
, a deduction for interest paid to a related party is not allowed for corporations engaged in enumerated types of activities. In addition, carryover of losses from one taxable period to another is permitted for corporations engaged in specified types of activities, but not for corporations engaged in other activities. By its terms, the foreign levy makes no distinction between dual capacity taxpayers and other persons. In practice the differences in the base of the country Y income tax (
e.g.
, the lack of a deduction for interest paid to related parties for some corporations subject to the levy and the lack of a carryover provision for some corporations subject to the levy) apply to both dual capacity taxpayers and other persons, but the 50 percent rate applies only to dual capacity taxpayers. By reason of such higher rate, application of the country Y income tax to dual capacity taxpayers is different in practice from application of the country Y income tax to other persons subject to it. The country Y income tax as applied to dual capacity taxpayers is therefore a separate levy from the country Y income tax as applied to other corporations incorporated in country Y.
B
is a corporation incorporated in country Y that is engaged in construction activities in country Y.
B
has a contract with the government of country Y to build a hospital in country Y for a fee that is not made available on substantially the same terms to substantially all persons who are subject to the general tax of country X. Accordingly,
B
is a dual capacity taxpayer.
B
has validly elected the safe harbor method for country Y for 1985. In 1985, as determined in accordance with the country Y income tax as applied to
B, B
has gross receipts of 10,000u, deducts 6,000u of costs and expenses, and pays 1900u ((1,000u × 40%) + (3,000u × 50%)) to country Y pursuant to the levy.
It is assumed that
B
has established that the country Y income tax as applied to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers is an income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(1) and is the general tax. It is further assumed that
B
has demonstrated that all of the criteria of section 901 are satisfied with respect to the country Y income tax as applied to dual capacity taxpayers, except for the determination of the distinct element of such levy that is a tax and of
B
's qualifying amount with respect to that levy, and therefore that the country Y income tax as applied to dual capacity taxpayers is a qualifying levy.
In applying the safe harbor formula, in accordance with paragraph (e)(3), the 50 percent rate is not used because it does not apply in practice to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers. The next lowest rate of the general tax that does apply in practice to such persons, 40 percent, is used. Accordingly, under the safe harbor formula,
B
's qualifying amount with respect to the levy is 1400u ((10,000u−6000u−1900u) × .40/(1−.40)).
B
's specific economic benefit amount is 500u
(B's actual payment amount (1900u) less
B
's qualifying amount (1400u)). Pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section,
B
's specific economic benefit amount is characterized according to the nature of
B
's transactions with country Y and of the specific economic benefit received, as a reduction of
B
's proceeds of its contract with country Y; and this amount is so treated for all purposes of chapter 1 of the Code, including the computation of
B
's accumulated profits for purposes of section 902.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example 2, with the following additional facts: The contract between
B
and country Y is a cost plus contract. One of the costs of the contract which country Y is required to pay or for which it is required to reimburse
B
is any tax of country Y on
B
's income or receipts from the contract. Instead of reimbursing
B
therefor, country Y agrees with
B
to assume any such tax liability. Under country Y tax law,
B
is not considered to have additional income or receipts by reason of country Y's assumption of
B
's country Y tax liability. In 1985,
B
's gross receipts of 10,000u include 3000u from the contract, and its costs and expenses of 6000u include 2000u attributable to the contract.
B
's other gross receipts and expenses do not relate to any transaction in which B receives a specific economic benefit. In accordance with the contract, country Y, and not
B,
is required to bear the amount of
B
's country Y income tax liability on
B
's 1000u (3000u-2000u) income from the contract. In accordance with the contract
B
computes its country Y income tax without taking this 1000u into account and therefore pays 1400u ((1000u × 40%) + (2000u × 50%)) to country Y pursuant to the levy.
In accordance with § 1.901-2(f)(2)(i), the country Y income tax which country Y is, under the contract, required to bear is considered to be paid by country Y on behalf of
B. B
's proceeds of its contract, for all purposes of chapter 1 of the Code (including the computation of
B
's accumulated profits for purposes of section 902), therefore, are increased by the additional 500u (1900u computed as in example 2 less 1400u as computed above) of
B's
liability under the country Y income tax that is assumed by country Y and such 500u is considered to be paid pursuant to the levy by country Y on behalf of
B.
In applying the safe harbor formula, therefore, the computation is exactly as in example 2 and the results are the same as in example 2.

# Example 4.
Country L issues a decree (the “April 11 decree”), in which it states it is exercising its tax authority to impose a tax on all corporations on their “net income” from country L. “Net income” is defined as actual gross receipts less all expenses attributable thereto, except that in the case of income from extraction of petroleum, gross receipts are defined as 105 percent of actual gross receipts, and no deduction is allowed for interest incurred on loans whose proceeds are used for exploration for petroleum. Under the April 11 decree, wages paid by corporations subject to the decree are deductible in the year of payment, except that corporations engaged in the extraction of petroleum may deduct such wages only by amortization over a 5-year period and, to the extent such wages are paid to officers, they may be deducted only by amortization over a period of 50 years. The April 11 decree permits related corporations subject to the decree to file consolidated returns in which net income and net losses of related corporations offset each other in computing net income for purposes of the April 11 decree, except that corporations engaged in petroleum exploration or extraction activities are not eligible for inclusion in such a consolidated return. The law of country L does not require separate entities to carry on separate activities in connection with exploring for or extracting petroleum. Net losses of a taxable year may be carried over for 10 years to offset income, except that no more than 25% of net income (before deducting the loss carryover) in any such future year may be offset by a carryover of net loss, and, in the case of any corporation engaged in exploration or extraction of petroleum, losses incurred prior to such a corporation's having net income from production may be carried forward for only 8 years and no more than 15% of net income in any such future year may be offset by such a net loss. The rate to be paid under the April 11 decree is 50% of net income (as defined in the levy), except that if net income exceeds 10,000u (units of country L currency), the rate is 75% of the corporation's net income (including the first 10,000u thereof). In practice, no corporations other than corporations engaged in extraction of petroleum have net income in excess of 10,000u. All petroleum resources of country L are owned by the government of country L, whose petroleum ministry licenses corporations to explore for and extract petroleum in consideration for payment of royalties as petroleum is produced.
J
is a U.S. corporation that is engaged in country L in the exploration and extraction of petroleum and therefore is a dual capacity taxpayer.
J
has validly elected the safe harbor method for country L for the year 1983, the year that
J
commenced activities in country L, and has not revoked such election. For the years 1983 through 1986,
J
's gross receipts, deductions and net income before application of the carryover provisions, determined in accordance with the April 11 decree, are as follows:
Year
Gross receipts (105 percent of actual gross receipts)
Deductions other than wages

Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the April 11 decree as applied to corporations engaged in the exploration or extraction of petroleum in country L is a separate levy from the April 11 decree as applied to all other corporations.
J
establishes that the April 11 decree, as applied to such other corporations, is an income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(1) and that the decree as so applied is the general tax.
The April 11 decree as applied to corporations engaged in the exploration or extraction of petroleum in country L does not meet the gross receipts requirement of § 1.901-2(b)(3); therefore, irrespective of whether it meets the other requirements of § 1.901-2(b)(1), it is not an income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(1). However, the April 11 decree as applied to such corporations is a qualifying levy because
J
has demonstrated that all of the criteria of section 903 are satisfied with respect to the April 11 decree as applied to such corporations, except for the determination of the distinct element of such levy that imposes a tax and of
J
's qualifying amount with respect thereto.
In applying the safe harbor formula, in accordance with paragraph (e)(2), gross receipts are computed by reference to the general levy, and thus are 100%, not 105%, of actual gross receipts. Similarly, costs and expenses include exploration interest expense. In accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section the difference between the general tax and the qualifying levy in the timing of the deduction for wages, other than wages of officers, is not considered to increase the liability of dual capacity taxpayers because the general tax would not have failed to be an income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(1) if it had provided for 5-year amortization of such wages instead of for current deduction.
See
§ 1.901-2(b)(4)(i). However, amortization of wages paid to officers over a 50-year period is such a deferred recovery of such wages that it effectively is a denial of the deduction of the excess of such wages paid in any year over the amortization of such cumulative wages permitted in such year. See § 1.901-2(b)(4)(i). The different treatment of wages paid to officers under the general tax and the qualifying levy is thus not merely a difference in timing within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section. Accordingly, the difference between the amount of wages paid by
J
to officers in any year and
J
's deduction (in computing the actual payment amount) for amortization of such cumulative wages allowed in such year is, pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, treated as a cost and expense in computing
J
's qualifying amount for such year with respect to the April 11 decree. The differences in the consolidation and carryover provisions between the general tax and the qualifying levy are of the types described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section and, pursuant to paragraphs (b)(4)(ii) and (b)(4)(iii) of § 1.901-2, the general tax would not fail to be an income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(i) even if it contained the consolidation and carryover provisions of the qualifying levy. Thus, such differences are not considered to increase the liability of dual capacity taxpayers pursuant to the qualifying levy as compared to the general tax liability of persons other than dual capacity taxpayers.
Accordingly, in applying the safe harbor formula to the qualifying levy for 1985 and 1986, gross receipts and costs and expenses are computed as follows:

# Gross receipts
1985: 42,000u × (100/105) − 40,000u
1986: 105,000u × (100/105) − 100,000u

5. Costs and expenses before carryover of net loss (sum of lines 1 through 4)

6. Recalculation of loss carryover by recalculating 1983 and 1984 net income (loss) to reflect current deduction of wages to officers and exploration interest expense: 1983 adjusted net loss carryover: (13,021u) + (49u) + (1000u) = (14,070u); 1984 adjusted net loss carryover: (17,042u) + (48u) + (2800u) = (19,890u)
7. Recalculation of limitation on use of net loss carryover deduction:

(22,930)

3,314u
11,561u
8. Costs and expenses including net loss carryover deduction (line 5 plus line 7)
21,224u
34,491u
In years after 1986, costs and expenses for purposes of determining the qualifying amount would reflect net loss carryforward deductions based on the recomputed losses carried forward from 1983 and 1984 (14,070u and 19,890u, respectively) less the amounts thereof that were utilized in determining costs and expenses for 1985 and 1986 (3,314u and 11,561u, respectively). The 1983 and 1984 loss carryforwards would be considered utilized in accordance with the order of priority in which such losses are utilized under the terms of the qualifying levy.
In applying the safe harbor formula, the tax rate to be used, in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section, is .50.
Accordingly, under the safe harbor method,
J
's qualifying amounts with respect to the April 11 decree for 1985 and 1986 are computed as follows:
1985: (40,000u − 21,224u − 17,172u) × .50 / (1 − .50) = 1604u
1986: (100,000u − 34,491u − 54,134u) × .50 / (1 − .50) = 11,375u
Under the safe harbor method
J
's qualifying amounts with respect to the April 11 decree for 1985 and 1986 are thus 1604u and 11,375u, respectively; and its specific economic benefit amounts are 15,568u (17,172u-1604u) and 42,759u, (54,134u-11,375u), respectively. Pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section,
J
's specific economic benefit amounts are characterized according to the nature of
J
's transactions with country L and of the specific economic benefit received by
J
as additional royalties paid to country L with respect to the petroleum extracted by
J
in country L in 1985 and 1986, and these amounts are so treated for all purposes of chapter 1 of the Code.

# Example 5.
Country E, which has no generally imposed income tax, imposes a levy called the country E income tax only on corporations carrying on the banking business through a branch in country E and on corporations engaged in the extraction of petroleum in country E. All of the petroleum resources of country E are owned by the government of country E, whose petroleum ministry licenses corporations to explore for and extract petroleum in consideration of payment of royalties as petroleum is extracted. The base of the country E income tax is a corporation's actual gross receipts from sources in country E less all expenses attributable, on reasonable principles, to such gross receipts; the rate of tax is 29 percent.
A
is a U.S corporation that carries on the banking business through a branch in country E.
B
is a U.S. corporation (unrelated to
A
) that is engaged in the extraction of petroleum in country E. In 1984
A
receives interest on loans it has made to 160 borrowers in country E, seven of which are agencies and instrumentalities of the government of country E. The economic benefits received by
A
and
B
(
i.
e.
, the interest received by
A
from the government and B's license to extract petroleum owned by the government) are not made available on substantially the same terms to the population of country E in general.
A
and
B
are dual capacity taxpayers. Each of them has validly elected the safe harbor method for country E for 1984.
A
demonstrates that the country E income tax as applied to it (a dual capacity taxpayer) is not different by its terms or in practice from the country E income tax as applied to persons (in this case other banks) that are not dual capacity taxpayers.
A
has therefore established pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section and § 1.901-2(d) that the country E income tax as applied to it and the country E income tax as applied to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers are together a single levy.
A
establishes that such levy is an income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(1). In accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, no portion of the amount paid by
A
pursuant to such levy is considered to
be paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit. Thus, the entire amount paid by
A
pursuant to this levy is an amount of income tax paid.
B
does not demonstrate that the country E income tax as applied to corporations engaged in the extraction of petroleum in country E (dual capacity taxpayers) is not different by its terms or in practice from the country E income tax as applied to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers (
i.e.,
banks that are not dual capacity taxpayers). Accordingly, pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section and § 1.901-2(d), the country E income tax as applied to corporations engaged in the extraction of petroleum in country E is a separate levy from the country E income tax as applied to other persons.
B
demonstrates that all of the criteria of section 901 are satisfied with respect to the country E income tax as applied to corporations engaged in the exploration of petroleum in country E, except for the determination of the distinct element of such levy that imposes a tax and of
B
's qualifying amount with respect to the levy. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(5) of this section, in applying the safe harbor formula to
B,
“A” is the amount of
B
's gross receipts as determined under the country E income tax as applied to
B
; “B” is the amount of
B
's costs and expenses as determined thereunder; “C” is
B
's actual payment amount; and “D” is .29, the lower of the rate (29 percent) of the qualifying levy (the country E income tax as applied to corporations engaged in the extraction of petroleum in country E) or the rate (46 percent) of tax specified for 1984 in section 11(b)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code. Thus,
B
's qualifying amount is equal to its actual payment amount.

# Example 6.
The facts are the same as in example 5, except that the rate of the country E income tax is 55 percent. For the reasons stated in example 5, the results with respect to
A
are the same as in example 5. In applying the safe harbor formula to
B,
“A,” “B,” and “C” are the same as in example 5, but “D” is .46, as that rate is less than .55. Thus,
B
's qualifying amount is less than
B
's actual payment amount, and the difference is
B
's specific economic benefit amount.

# Example 7.
Country E imposes a tax (called the country E income tax) on the realized net income derived by corporations from sources in country E, except that, with respect to interest income received from sources in country E and certain insurance income, nonresident corporations are instead subject to other levies. With respect to such interest income a levy (called the country E interest tax) requires nonresident corporations to pay to country E 20 percent of such gross interest income unless the nonresident corporation falls within a specified category of corporations (“special corporations”), all of which are dual capacity taxpayers, in which case the rate is instead 25 percent. With respect to such insurance income nonresident corporations are subject to a levy (called the country E insurance tax), which is not an income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(1).
The country E interest tax applies at the 20 percent rate by its terms and in practice to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers. The country E interest tax as applied at the 25 percent rate to special corporations applies only to dual capacity taxpayers; therefore, the country E interest tax as applied to special corporations is a separate levy from the country E interest tax as applied at the 20 percent rate.
A
is a U.S. corporation which is a special corporation subject to the 25 percent rate of the country E interest tax.
A
does not have any insurance income that is subject to the country E insurance tax.
A,
a dual capacity taxpayer, has validly elected the safe harbor formula for 1984. In 1984
A
receives 100u (units of country E currency) of gross interest income subject to the country E interest tax and pays 25u to country E.
A
establishes that the country E income tax is the generally imposed income tax of country E; that all of the criteria of section 903 are satisfied with respect to the country E interest tax as applied to special corporations except for the determination of the distinct element of the levy that is a tax and of
A
's qualifying amount with respect thereto.
A
has therefore demonstrated that the country E interest tax as applied to special corporations is a qualifying levy.
A
establishes that the country E interest tax at the 20 percent rate is a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of § 1.903-1(a). Pursuant to paragraph (e)(6) of this section the country E interest tax at the 20 percent rate is treated as if it were an application of the general tax for purposes of the safe harbor formula of this paragraph (e), since that tax would actually have been required to have been paid by
A
with respect to its interest income had
A
not been a dual capacity taxpayer (special corporation) instead subject to the qualifying levy (the country E interest tax at the 25 percent rate).
Even if the country E insurance tax is a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of § 1.903-1(a), that tax is not treated as if it were an application of the general tax for purposes of applying the safe harbor formula to
A
since
A
had no insurance income in 1984 and hence such tax would not actually have been required to be paid by
A
had
A
not been a dual capacity taxpayer.

# Example 8.
Under a levy of country S called the country S income tax, each corporation operating in country S is required to pay country S 50 percent of its income from operations in country S. Income for purposes of the country S income tax is computed by
subtracting all attributable costs and expenses from a corporation's gross receipts derived from its business in country S. Among corporations on which the country S income tax is imposed are corporations engaged in the exploitation of mineral K in country S. Natural deposits of mineral K in country S are owned by country S, and all corporations engaged in the exploitation thereof do so under concession agreement with an instrumentality of country S. Such corporations, in addition to the 50 percent country S income tax, are also subject to a levy called a surtax, which is equal to 60 percent of posted price net income less the amount of the country S income tax. The surtax is not deductible in computing the country S income tax of corporations engaged in the exploitation of mineral K in country S.
A
is a U.S. corporation engaged in country S in the exploitation of mineral K, and
A
has been allowed to extract mineral K under a concession agreement with an instrumentality of country S. Therefore,
A
is a dual capacity taxpayer. In accordance with a term of the concession agreement, certain of
A
's income (net of expenses attributable thereto) is exempted from the income tax and surtax.
The results for
A
in 1984 are as follows:
Income Tax

Because of the difference (nondeductibility of the surtax) in the country S income tax as applied to dual capacity taxpayers from its application to other persons, the country S income tax as applied to dual capacity taxpayers and the country S income tax as applied to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers are separate levies. Moreover, because
A
's concession agreement provides for a modification (exemption of certain income) of the country S income tax and surtax as they otherwise apply to other persons engaged in the exploitation of mineral K in country S, those levies (contractual levies) as applied to
A
are separate levies from those levies as applied to other persons engaged in the exploitation of mineral K in country S.
A
establishes that the country S income tax as applied to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers is an income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(1) and is the general tax.
A
demonstrates that all the criteria of section 903 are satisfied with respect to the country S income tax as applied to
A
and with respect to the surtax as applied to
A,
except for the determination of the distinct elements of such levies that are taxes and of
A
's qualifying amounts with respect to such levies. Therefore, both the country S income tax as applied to
A
and the surtax as applied to
A
are qualifying levies.
In applying the safe harbor formula, in accordance with paragraph (e)(2), the amount of
A
's gross receipts includes the exempt realized income, and the amount of
A
's costs and expenses includes the costs attributable to such exempt income. In accordance with paragraph (e)(7)(i), the amount of the qualifying levy for purposes of the formula is the sum of
A
's liability for the country S income tax and
A
's liability for the surtax. Accordingly, under the safe harbor formula,
A
's qualifying amount with respect to the country S income tax and the surtax is 35u ((135u−25u−75u) × .50/(1−.50)).
A
's specific economic benefit amount is 40u (
A
's actual payment amount (75u) less
A
's qualifying amount (35u)).

# Example 9.
Country T imposes a levy on corporations, called the country T income tax. The country T income tax is imposed at a rate of 50 percent on gross receipts less all costs and expenses, and affiliated corporations are allowed to consolidate their results in applying the country T income tax. Corporations engaged in the exploitation of mineral L in country T are subject to a levy that is identical to the country T income tax except that no consolidation among affiliated corporations is allowed. The levy allows unlimited loss carryforwards.
C
and
D
are affiliated U.S. corporations engaged in country T in the exploitation of mineral L. Natural deposits of mineral L in country T are owned by country T, and
C
and
D
have been allowed to extract mineral L in consideration of certain payments to an instrumentality of country T. Therefore,
C
and
D
are dual capacity taxpayers.

C
and

establish that the country T income tax as applied to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers is an income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(1) and is the general tax.
C
and
D
demonstrate that all of the criteria of section 901 are satisfied with respect to the country T income tax as applied to dual capacity taxpayers, except for the determination of the distinct element
of such levy that is a tax and of
C
and
D
's qualifying amounts with respect to that levy. Therefore, the country T income tax as applied to dual capacity taxpayers is a qualifying levy.
In applying the safe harbor formula, in accordance with paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) and (e)(7)(iii), the gross receipts, costs and expenses, and actual payment amounts of
C
and
D
are aggregated, except that in
D
's loss year (1984) its gross receipts and costs and expenses are disregarded. The results of any loss year are disregarded since the country T income tax as applied to dual capacity taxpayers does not allow consolidation, and, pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(ii), differences in consolidation provisions between such levy and the country T income tax as applied to persons that are not dual capacity taxpayers are not considered. Accordingly, in 1984 the qualifying amount with respect to the country T income tax is 50u ((120u−20u−50u) × .50/(1−.50)), all of which is considered paid by
C.
In 1985 the qualifying amount is 75u ((120u + 120u−20u−20u−50u (loss carry forward)—50u—25u) × .50/(1−.50)), of which 50u is considered to be paid by
C
and 25u by

Country W imposes a levy called the country W income tax on corporations doing business in country W. The country W income tax is imposed at a 50 percent rate on gross receipts less all costs and expenses. Corporations engaged in the exploitation of mineral M in country W are subject to a levy that is identical in all respects to the country W income tax except that it is imposed at a rate of 80 percent (the “80 percent levy”).
A
is a U.S. corporation engaged in country W in exploitation of mineral M and is subject to the 80 percent levy. Natural deposits of mineral M in country W are owned by country W, and
A
has been allowed to extract mineral M in consideration of certain payments to an instrumentality of country W. Therefore,
A
is a dual capacity taxpayer.
B,
a U.S. corporation affiliated with
A,
also is engaged in business in country W, but has no transactions with country W.
B
is subject to the country W income tax.
B
is a dual capacity taxpayer within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(2)(ii)(A) by virtue of its affiliation with
A.
The results for
A
and
B
in 1984 are as follows:
A
B
Gross Receipts
120u
100u
Costs
20u
40u
Net Income
100u
60u
Tax Rate
.80
.50
Tax
80u
30u
A
and
B
establish that the country W income tax as applied to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers is an income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(1) and is the general tax. It is assumed that
B
has demonstrated that the country W income tax as applied to
B
does not differ by its terms or in practice from the country W income tax as applied to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers and hence that the country W income tax as applied to
B,
a dual capacity taxpayer, and the country W income tax as applied to such other persons is a single levy. Thus, with respect to
B,
the country W income tax is not a qualifying levy by reason of the last sentence of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
A
demonstrates that all the criteria of section 901 are satisfied with respect to the 80 percent levy, except for the determination of the distinct element of such levy that is a tax and of
A
's qualifying amount with respect thereto. Accordingly, the 80 percent levy as applied to
A
is a qualifying levy.
In applying the safe harbor formula in accordance with paragraphs (e)(7)(i) and (e)(7)(iii) in the instant case, it is not necessary to incorporate
B
's results in the safe harbor formula because
B
's taxation in country W is identical to the taxation of persons other than dual capacity taxpayers and because neither
A
's and
B
's results nor their taxation in country W interact in any way to change
A
's taxation. All of the amount paid by
B,
30u, is an amount of income tax paid by
B
within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(1). Accordingly, under the safe harbor formula, the qualifying amount for
A
with respect to the 80 percent levy is 20u ((120u−20u−80u) × .50/(1−.50)). The remaining 60u paid by
A
(80u − 20u) is
A
's specific economic benefit amount.

# Example 11.
The facts are the same as in example 10, except that it is assumed that
B
has not demonstrated that the country W income tax as applied to
B
does not differ by its terms or in practice from the country W income tax as applied to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers. In addition,
A
and
B
demonstrate that all the criteria of section 901 are satisfied with respect to each of the country W income tax and the 80 percent levy as applied to dual capacity taxpayers, except for the determination of the distinct elements of such levies that are taxes of
A
and
B
's qualifying amounts with respect to such levies. Therefore, the country W income tax and 80 percent levy as applied to dual capacity taxpayers are qualifying levies.
In applying the safe harbor formula in accordance with paragraphs (e)(7)(i) and (e)(7)(iii), the results of
A
and
B
are aggregated. Accordingly, under the safe harbor formula, the aggregate qualifying amount for
A
and
B
with respect to the country W income tax and 80 percent levy is 50u ([(120u + 100u)−(20u + 40u)−(80u + 30u)] × .50/(1−.50)).

# Example 12.
Country Y imposes a levy on corporations operating in country Y, called the country Y income tax. Income for purposes of the country Y income tax is computed by subtracting all costs and expenses
from a corporation's gross receipts derived from its business in country Y. The rate of the country Y income tax is 50 percent. Country Y also imposes a 20 percent tax (the “withholding tax”) on the gross amount of certain income, including dividends, received by persons who are not residents of country Y from persons who are residents of country Y and from corporations that operate there. Corporations engaged in the exploitation of mineral K in country Y are subject to a levy (the “75 percent levy”) that is identical in all respects to the country Y income tax except that it is imposed at a rate of 75 percent. Dividends received from such corporations are not subject to the withholding tax.
C,
a wholly-owned country Y subsidiary of
D,
a U.S. corporation, is engaged in country Y in the exploitation of mineral K. Natural deposits of mineral K in country Y are owned by country Y, and
C
has been allowed to extract mineral K in consideration of certain payments to an instrumentality of country Y. Therefore,
C
is a dual capacity taxpayer.
D
has elected the safe harbor method for country Y for 1984. In 1984,
C
's gross receipts are 120u (units of country Y currency), its costs and expenses are 20u, and its liability under the 75 percent levy is 75u.
C
distributes the amount that remains, 25u, as a dividend to
D.
D
establishes that the country Y income tax as applied to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers is an income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(1) and the general tax, and that all the criteria of section 901 are satisfied with respect to the 75 percent levy, except for the determination of the distinct element of such levy that is tax and of
C
's qualifying amount with respect thereto. Accordingly, the 75 percent levy is a qualifying levy.
Pursuant to paragraph (e)(7),
D
(which is not subject to a levy of country Y but is considered to receive a specific economic benefit by reason of § 1.901-2(a)(2)(ii)(E)) is treated as a dual capacity taxpayer in applying paragraph (e)(7)(ii).
D
demonstrates that the withholding tax is a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of § 1.903-1, which tax applies in practice to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers, and that such tax actually would have applied to
D
had
D
not been a dual capacity taxpayer (
i.e.,
had
C
not been a dual capacity taxpayer, in which case
D
also would not have been one). Accordingly, the withholding tax is treated for purposes of the safe harbor formula as if it were an application of the general tax.
In applying the safe harbor formula to this situation in accordance with paragraph (e)(7)(ii), the rates of the country Y income tax and the withholding tax are aggregated into a single effective general tax rate. In this case, the rate is .60 (.50 + [(1−.50) × .20]). Accordingly, under the safe harbor formula,
C
's qualifying amount with respect to the 75 percent levy is 37.5u [(120u−20u−75u) × .60/(1−.60)], the aggregate amount that
C
and
D
would have paid if
C
had been subject to the country Y income tax and had distributed to
D
as a dividend subject to the withholding tax the entire amount that remained for the year after payment of the country Y income tax. Because
C
is in fact the only taxpayer, the entire qualifying amount is paid by
C.

# Example 13.
The facts are the same as in example 12, except that dividends received from corporations engaged in the exploitation of mineral K in country Y are subject to the withholding tax. Thus,
C
's liability under the 75 percent levy is 75u, and
D
's liability under the withholding tax on the 25u distribution is 5u.
D,
which is a dual capacity taxpayer, demonstrates that the withholding tax as applied to
D
does not differ by its terms or in practice from the withholding tax as applied to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers and hence that the withholding tax as applied to
D
and that levy as applied to such other persons is a single levy.
D
demonstrates that all of the criteria of section 903 are satisfied with respect to the withholding tax. The withholding tax is not a qualifying levy by reason of the last sentence of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
Paragraphs (e)(7)(i), (e)(7)(ii) and (e)(7)(iii) all apply in this situation. As in example 10, it is not necessary to incorporate the withholding tax into the safe harbor formula. All of the amount paid by
D,
5u, is an amount of tax paid by
D
in lieu of an income tax. In applying the safe harbor formula to
C,
therefore, with respect to the 75 percent levy, “A” is 120, “B” is “20”, “C” is 75 and “D” is .50. Accordingly,
C
's qualifying amount with respect to the 75 percent levy is 25u; the remaining 50u that it paid is its specific economic benefit amount.

# Example 14.
The facts are the same as in example 12, except that dividends received from corporations engaged in the exploitation of mineral K in country Y are subject to a 10 percent withholding tax (the “10 percent withholding tax”). Thus,
C
's liability under the 75 percent levy is 75u, and
D
's liability under the 10 percent withholding tax on the 25u distribution is 2.5u.
The only difference between the withholding tax and the 10 percent withholding tax applicable only to dual capacity taxpayers (including
D
) is that a lower rate (but the same base) applies to dual capacity taxpayers. Although the withholding tax and the 10 percent withholding tax are together a single levy, this difference makes it necessary, when dealing with multiple levies, to incorporate the withholding tax and
D
's payment pursuant to the 10 percent withholding tax in the safe harbor formula. Accordingly, as in example 12, the safe harbor formula is applied by aggregation.
The aggregate effective rate of the general taxes for purposes of the safe harbor formula is .60 (.50 + [(1−.50) × .20]). Pursuant to paragraph (e)(7), the aggregate actual payment amount of the qualifying levies for purposes of the formula is the sum of
C
and
D
's liability for the 75 percent levy and the 10 percent withholding tax. Accordingly, under the safe harbor formula, the aggregate qualifying amount with respect to the 75 percent levy on
C
and the 10 percent withholding tax on
D
is 33.75u ((120u−20u−[75u + 2.5u]) × .60/(1−.60)), which is the aggregate amount of tax that
C
and
D
would have paid if
C
had been subject to the country Y income tax and had paid out its entire amount remaining after payment of that tax to
D
as a dividend subject to the withholding tax.

# Example 15.
The facts are the same as in example 5, except that the rate of the country E income tax is 45 percent and a political subdivision of country E also imposes a levy, called the “local tax,” on all corporations subject to the country E income tax. The base of the local tax is the same as the base of the country E income tax; the rate is 10 percent.
The reasoning of example 5 with regard to the country E income tax as applied to
A
and
B,
respectively, applies equally with regard to the local tax as applied to
A
and
B,
respectively. Accordingly, the entire amount paid by
A
pursuant to each of the country E income tax and the local tax is an amount of income tax paid, and both the country E income tax as applied to
B
and the local tax as applied to
B
are qualifying levies.
Pursuant to paragraph (e)(7), in applying the safe harbor formula to
B,
“A” is the amount of
B
's gross receipts as determined under the (identical) country E income tax and local tax as applied to
B
; “B” is the amount of
B
's costs and expenses thereunder; and “C” is the sum of
B
's actual payment amounts with respect to the two levies. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(7), in applying the safe harbor formula to
B, B
's aggregate qualifying amount with respect to the two levies is limited to the amount determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(5) where “D” is the rate of tax specified in section 11(b)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, “D” is .46, which is the lower of the aggregate rate (55 percent) of the qualifying levies or the section 11(b)(5) rate (46 percent).
B
's aggregate qualifying amount is, therefore, identical to
B
's qualifying amount in example 6, which is less than its aggregate actual payment amount, and the difference is
B
's specific economic benefit amount.

Effective date.
The effective date of this section is as provided in § 1.901-2(h).

§ 1.901-3
Reduction in amount of foreign taxes on foreign mineral income allowed as a credit.
(a)
Determination of amount of reduction
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of determining the amount of taxes which are allowed as a credit under section 901(a) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, the amount of any income, war profits, and excess profits taxes paid or accrued, or deemed to be paid under section 902, during the taxable year to any foreign country or possession of the United States with respect to foreign mineral income (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) from sources within such country or possession shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which—
(i) The smaller of—
(
a
) The amount of such foreign income, war profits, and excess profits taxes, or
(
b
) The amount of the tax which would be computed under chapter 1 of the Code for such year with respect to such foreign mineral income if the deduction for depletion were determined under section 611 without regard to the deduction for percentage depletion under section 613, exceeds
(ii) The amount of the tax computed under chapter 1 of the Code for such year with respect to such foreign mineral income.
The reduction required by this subparagraph must be made on a country-by-country basis whether the taxpayer uses for the taxable year the per-country limitation under section 904(a)(1), or the overall limitation under section 904(a)(2), on the amount of taxes allowed as credit under section 901(a).
(2)
Determination of amount of tax on foreign mineral income
—(i)
Foreign tax.
For purposes of subparagraph (1)(i)(
a
) of this paragraph, the amount of the income, war profits, and excess profits
taxes paid or accrued during the taxable year to a foreign country or possession of the United States with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within such country or possession is an amount which is the greater of—
(
a
) The amount by which the total amount of the income, war profits, and excess profits taxes paid or accrued during the taxable year to such country or possession exceeds the amount of such taxes that would be paid or accrued for such year to such country or possession without taking into account such foreign mineral income, or
(
b
) The amount of the income, war profits, and excess profits taxes that would be paid or accrued to such country or possession if such foreign mineral income were the taxpayer's only income for the taxable year, except that in no case shall the amount so determined exceed the total of all income, war profits, and excess profits taxes paid or accrued during the taxable year to such country or possession. For such purposes taxes which are paid or accrued also include taxes which are deemed paid under section 902. In the case of a dividend described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) (
a
) of this section which is from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States and is attributable in whole or in part to foreign mineral income, the amount of the income, war profits, and excess profits taxes deemed paid under section 902 during the taxable year to such country or possession with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within such country or possession is an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of the income, war profits, and excess profits taxes deemed paid under section 902 during such year to such country or possession with respect to such dividend as the portion of the dividend which is attributable to foreign mineral income bears to the total dividend. For purposes of (
a
) and (
b
) of this subdivision, foreign mineral income is to be reduced by any credits, expenses, losses, and other deductions which are properly allocable to such income under the law of the foreign country or possession of the United States from which such income is derived.
(ii)
U.S. tax.
For purposes of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, the amount of the tax computed under chapter 1 of the Code for the taxable year with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States is the greater of—
(
a
) The amount by which the tax under chapter 1 of the Code on the taxpayer's taxable income for the taxable year exceeds a tax determined under such chapter on the taxable income for such year determined without regard to such foreign mineral income, or
(
b
) The amount of tax that would be determined under chapter 1 of the Code if such foreign mineral income were the taxpayer's only income for the taxable year.
For purposes of this subdivision the tax is to be determined without regard to any credits against the tax and without taking into account any tax against which a credit is not allowed under section 901(a). For purposes of (
b
) of this subdivision, the foreign mineral income is to be reduced only by expenses, losses, and other deductions properly allocable under chapter 1 of the Code to such income and is to be computed without any deduction for personal exemptions under section 151 or 642(b).
(iii)
U.S. income tax computed without deduction allowed by section 613.
For purposes of subparagraph (1)(i)(
b
) of this paragraph, the amount of the tax which would be computed under chapter 1 of the Code (without regard to section 613) for the taxable year with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States is the amount of the tax on such income that would be computed under such chapter by using as the allowance for depletion cost depletion computed upon the adjusted depletion basis of the property. For purposes of this subdivision the tax is to be determined without regard to any credits against the tax and without taking into account any tax against which credit is not allowed under section 901(a). If the greater tax with respect to the foreign mineral income under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph is the tax determined under
(
a
) of such subdivision, the tax determined for purposes of subparagraph (1)(i)(
b
) of this paragraph is to be determined by applying the principles of (
a
) (rather than of (
b
)) of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. On the other hand, if the greater tax with respect to the foreign mineral income under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph is the tax determined under (
b
) of such subdivision, the tax determined for purposes of subparagraph (1)(i)(
b
) of this paragraph is to be determined by applying the principles of (
b
) (rather than of (
a
)) of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.
(3)
Special rules.
(i) The reduction required by this paragraph in the amount of taxes paid, accrued, or deemed to be paid to a foreign country or possession of the United States applies only where the taxpayer is allowed a deduction for percentage depletion under section 613 with respect to any part of his foreign mineral income for the taxable year from sources within such country or possession, whether or not such deduction is allowed with respect to the entire foreign mineral income from sources within such country or possession for such year.
(ii) For purposes of this section, the term “foreign country” or “possession of the United States” includes the adjacent continental shelf areas to the extent, and in the manner, provided by section 638(2) and the regulations thereunder.
(iii) The provisions of this section are to be applied before making any reduction required by section 1503(b) in the amount of income, war profits, and excess profits taxes paid or accrued to foreign countries or possessions of the United States by a Western Hemisphere trade corporation.
(iv) If a taxpayer chooses with respect to any taxable year to claim a credit under section 901 and has any foreign mineral income from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States with respect to which the deduction under section 613 is allowed, he must attach to his return a schedule showing the computations required by subdivisions (i), (ii), and (iii) of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
(v) A taxpayer who has elected to use the overall limitation under section 904(a)(2) on the amount of the foreign tax credit for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970, may, for his first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, revoke his election without first securing the consent of the Commissioner. See paragraph (d) of § 1.904-1.
(b)
Foreign mineral income defined
—(1)
In general.
The term “foreign mineral income” means income (determined under chapter 1 of the Code) from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States derived from—
(i) The extraction of minerals from mines, wells, or other natural deposits,
(ii) The processing of minerals into their primary products, or
(iii) The transportation, distribution, or sale of minerals or of the primary products derived from minerals.
Any income of the taxpayer derived from an activity described in either subdivision (i), (ii), or (iii) of this subparagraph is foreign mineral income, since it is not necessary that the taxpayer extract, process, and transport, distribute, or sell minerals or their primary products for the income derived from any such activity to be foreign mineral income. Thus, for example, an integrated oil company must treat as foreign mineral income from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States all income from such sources derived from the production of oil, the refining of crude oil into gasoline, the distribution of gasoline to marketing outlets, and the retail sale of gasoline. Similarly, income from such sources from the refining, distribution, or marketing of fuel oil by the taxpayer is foreign mineral income, whether or not the crude oil was extracted by the taxpayer. In further illustration, income from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States derived from the processing of minerals into their primary products by the taxpayer is foreign mineral income, whether or not the minerals were extracted, or the primary products were sold, by the taxpayer. Section 901(e) and this section apply whether or not the extraction, processing, transportation, distribution, or selling of the minerals or primary products is done by the taxpayer.
Thus, for example, an individual who derives royalty income from the extraction of oil from an oil well in a foreign country has foreign mineral income for purposes of this paragraph. Income from the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of petrochemicals is not foreign mineral income. Foreign mineral income is not limited to gross income from the property within the meaning of section 613(c) and § 1.613-3.
(2)
Income included in foreign mineral income
—(i)
In general.
Foreign mineral income from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States includes, but is not limited to—
(
a
) Dividends from such sources, as determined under § 1.902-1(h)(1), received from a foreign corporation in respect of which taxes are deemed paid by the taxpayer under section 902, to the extent such dividends are attributable to foreign mineral income described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. The portion of such a dividend which is attributable to such income is that amount which bears the same ratio to the total dividend received as the earnings and profits out of which such dividend is paid that are attributable to foreign mineral income bear to the total earnings and profits out of which such dividend is paid. For such purposes, the foreign mineral income of a foreign corporation is its foreign mineral income described in this paragraph (including any dividends described in this (
a
) which are received from another foreign corporation), whether or not such income is derived from sources within the foreign country or possession of the United States in which, or under the laws of which, the former corporation is created or organized. A foreign corporation is considered to have no foreign mineral income for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970.
(
b
) Any section 78 dividend to which a dividend described in (
a
) of this subdivision gives rise, but only to the extent such section 78 dividend is deemed paid under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within such country or possession and to the extent it is treated under of § 1.902-1(h)(1) as income from sources within such country or possession.
(
c
) Any amounts includible in income of the taxpayer under section 702(a) as his distributive share of the income of a partnership consisting of income described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.
(
d
) Any amounts includible in income of the taxpayer by virtue of section 652(a), 662(a), 671, 682(a), or 691(a), to the extent such amounts consist of income described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.
(ii)
Illustration.
The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(a) Throughout 1974, M, a domestic corporation, owns all the one class of stock of N, a foreign corporation which is not a less developed country corporation within the meaning of section 902(d). Both corporations use the calendar year as the taxable year. N is incorporated in foreign country Y. During 1974, N has income from sources within foreign country X, all of which is foreign mineral income. During 1974, N also has income from sources within country Y, none of which is foreign mineral income. N is taxed in each foreign country only on income derived from sources within that country. Neither country X nor country Y allows a credit against its tax for foreign income taxes. N pays a dividend of $40,000 to M for 1974. For purposes of section 902, the dividend is paid from earnings and profits for 1974.
(b) N's earnings and profits and taxes for 1974 are determined as follows:
Foreign mineral income from country X
$100,000
Less:
Intangible drilling and development costs
$21,000
Cost depletion
3,000
24,000
Taxable income from country X
76,000
Income tax rate of country X
× 50%
Tax paid to country X
38,000
Income from country Y
100,000
Less deductions
25,000
Taxable income from country Y
75,000
Income tax rate of country Y
× 60%
Tax paid to country Y
45,000
Total taxable income
151,000
Less total foreign income taxes
83,000
Total earnings and profits
68,000
Taxable income from foreign mineral income
76,000
Less: Tax paid on foreign mineral income
38,000
Earnings and profits from foreign mineral income
38,000
(c) For 1974, M has foreign mineral income from country Y of $49,636.68, determined in the following manner and by applying this section, § 1.78-1, and § 1.902-1(h)(1):
Portion of dividend from country Y attributable to foreign mineral income (subdivision (i)(
a
) of this subparagraph) ($40,000 × $38,000/$68,000)
$22,352.94
Foreign income tax deemed paid by M to country Y under section 902(a)(1) ($83,000 × $40,000/$68,000)
48,823.53
Foreign income tax deemed paid by M to country Y with respect to foreign mineral income from country Y (paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section) ($48,823.53 × $22,352.94/$40,000)
27,283.74
Foreign mineral income from country Y:
Dividend attributable to foreign mineral income from country Y
22,352.94
Sec. 78 dividend deemed paid with respect to foreign mineral income (subdivision (i)(
b
) of this subparagraph)
27,283.74
Total foreign mineral income
49,636.68
(c)
Limitations on foreign tax credit
—(1)
In general.
The reduction under section 901(e) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section in the amount of foreign taxes allowed as a credit under section 901(a) is to be made whether the per-country limitation under section 904(a)(1) or the overall limitation under section 904(a)(2) is used for the taxable year, but the reduction in the amount of foreign taxes allowed as a credit under section 901(a) must be made on a country-by-country basis before applying the limitation under section 904(a) to the reduced amount of taxes. If for the taxable year the separate limitation under section 904(f) applies to any foreign mineral income, that limitation must also be applied after making the reduction under section 901(e) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(2)
Carrybacks and carryovers of excess tax paid
—(i)
In general.
Any amount by which (
a
) any income, war profits, and excess profits taxes paid or accrued, or deemed to be paid under section 902, during the taxable year to any foreign country or possession of the United States with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within such country or possession exceed (b) the reduced amount of such taxes as determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may not be deemed paid or accrued under section 904(d) in any other taxable year. See § 1.904-2(b)(2)(iii). However, to the extent such reduced amount of taxes exceeds the applicable limitation under section 904(a) for the taxable year it shall be deemed paid or accrued under section 904(d) in another taxable year as a carryback or carryover of an unused foreign tax. The amount so deemed paid or accrued in another taxable year is not, however, deemed paid or accrued with respect to foreign mineral income in such other taxable year. See § 1.904-2(c)(3).
(ii)
Carryovers to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969.
Where, under the provisions of section 904(d), taxes paid or accrued, or deemed to be paid under section 902, to any foreign country or possession of the United States in any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970, are deemed paid or accrued in one or more taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, the amount of such taxes so deemed paid or accrued shall not be deemed paid or accrued with respect to foreign mineral income and shall not be reduced under section 901(e) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(iii)
Carrybacks to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970.
Where income, war profits, and excess profits taxes are paid or accrued, or deemed to be paid under section 902, to any foreign country or possession of the United States in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within such country or possession, they must first be reduced under section 901(e) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section before they may be deemed paid or accrued under section 904(d) in one or more taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970.
(d)
Illustrations.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples, in which the surtax exemption provided by section 11(d) and the tax surcharge provided by section 51(a) are disregarded for purposes of simplification:

# Example 1.
(a) M, a domestic corporation using the calendar year as the taxable year, is an operator drilling for oil in foreign country W. For 1971, M's gross income under chapter 1 of the Code is $100,000, all of which is foreign mineral income from a property in country W and is subject to the allowance for depletion. During 1971, M incurs intangible drilling and development costs of $15,000, which are currently deductible for purposes of the tax of both countries. Cost depletion amounts to $2,000 for purposes of
the tax of both countries, and only cost depletion is allowed as a deduction under the law of country W. It is assumed that no other deductions are allowable under the law of either country. Based upon the facts assumed, the income tax paid to country W on such foreign mineral income is $41,500, and the U.S. tax on such income before allowance of the foreign tax credit is $30,240, determined as follows:
U.S. tax

(b) Without taking this section into account, M would be allowed a foreign tax credit for 1971 of $30,240 ($30,240 × $63,000/$63,000), and foreign income tax in the amount of $11,260 ($41,500 less $30,240) would first be carried back to 1969 under section 904(d).
(c) Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, however, the foreign income tax allowable as a credit against the U.S. tax is reduced to $31,900, determined as follows:
Foreign income tax paid on foreign mineral income
$41,500
Less reduction under sec. 901(e):
Smaller of $41,500 (tax paid to country W on foreign mineral income) or $39,840 (U.S. tax on foreign mineral income of $83,000 ($83,000 × 48%), determined by deducting cost depletion of $2,000 in lieu of percentage depletion of $22,000)

(d) After taking this section into account, M is allowed a foreign tax credit for 1971 of $30,240 ($30,240 × $63,000/$63,000). The amount of foreign income tax which may be first carried back to 1969 under section 904(d) is reduced from $11,260 to $1,660 ($31,900 less $30,240).

# Example 2.
(a) M, a domestic corporation using the calendar year as the taxable year, is an operator drilling for oil in foreign country X. For 1972, M has gross income under chapter 1 of the Code of $100,000, all of which is foreign mineral income from a property in country X and is subject to the allowance for depletion. During 1972, M incurs intangible drilling and development costs of $50,000 which are currently deductible for purposes of the U.S. tax but which must be amortized for purposes of the tax of country X. Percentage depletion of $22,000 is allowed as a deduction by both countries. For purposes of the U.S. tax, cost depletion for 1972 amounts to $15,000. It is assumed that no other deductions are allowable under the law of either country. Based upon these facts, the income tax paid to country X on such foreign mineral income is $27,200, and the U.S. tax on such income before allowance of the foreign tax credit is $13,440, determined as follows:

(b) Without taking this section into account, M would be allowed a foreign tax credit for 1972 of $13,440 ($13,440 × $28,000/$28,000), and foreign income tax in the amount of $13,760 ($27,200 less $13,440) would first be carried back to 1970 under section 904(d).
(c) Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, however, the foreign income tax allowable as a credit against the U.S. tax is reduced to $23,840, determined as follows:
Foreign income tax paid on foreign mineral income
$27,200
Less reduction under sec. 901(e):
Smaller of $27,200 (tax paid to country X on foreign mineral income) or $16,800 (U.S. tax on foreign mineral income of $35,000 ($35,000 × 48%), determined by deducting cost depletion of $15,000 in lieu of percentage depletion of $22,000)

(d) After taking this section into account, M is allowed a foreign tax credit of $13,440 ($13,440 × $28,000/$28,000). The amount of foreign income tax which may be first carried back to 1970 under section 904(d) is reduced from $13,760 to $10,400 ($23,840 less $13,440).

# Example 3.
(a) N, a domestic corporation using the calendar year as the taxable year, is an operator drilling for oil in foreign country Y. For 1972, N's gross income under chapter 1 of the Code is $100,000, all of which is foreign mineral income from a property in country Y and is subject to the allowance for depletion. During 1972, N incurs intangible drilling and development costs of $15,000, which are currently deductible for purposes of the U.S. tax but are not deductible under the law of country Y. Depreciation of $40,000 is allowed as a deduction for purposes of the U.S. tax; and of $20,000, for purposes of the Y tax. Cost depletion amounts to $10,000 for purposes of the tax of both countries, and only cost depletion is allowed as a deduction
under the law of country Y. It is assumed that no other deductions are allowable under the law of either country. Based upon the facts assumed, the income tax paid to country Y on such foreign mineral income is $14,000, and the U.S. tax on such income before allowance of the foreign tax credit is $11,040, determined as follows:

(b) Without taking this section into account, N would be allowed a foreign tax credit for 1972 of $11,040 ($11,040 × $23,000/$23,000), and foreign income tax in the amount of $2,960 ($14,000 less $11,040) would first be carried back to 1970 under section 904(d).
(c) Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, however, the foreign income tax allowable as a credit against the U.S. tax is reduced to $11,040, determined as follows:
Foreign income tax paid on foreign mineral income
$14,000
Less reduction under sec. 901(e):
Smaller of $14,000 (tax paid to country Y on foreign mineral income) or $16,800 (U.S. tax on foreign mineral income of $35,000 ($35,000 × 48%), determined by deducting cost depletion of $10,000 in lieu of percentage depletion of $22,000)

(d) After taking this section into account, N is allowed a foreign tax credit for 1972 of $11,040 ($11,040 × $23,000/$23,000), but no foreign income tax is carried back to 1970 under section 904(d) since the allowable credit of $11,040 does not exceed the limitation of $11,040.

# Example 4.
(a) D, a domestic corporation using the calendar year as the taxable year, is an operator drilling for oil in foreign country Z. For 1971, D's gross income under chapter 1 of the Code is $100,000, all of which is foreign mineral income from a property in country Z and is subject to the allowance for depletion. During 1971, D incurs intangible drilling and development costs of $85,000, which are currently deductible for purposes of the U.S. Tax but are not deductible under the law of country Z. Cost depletion in the amount of $10,000 is allowed as a deduction for purposes of both the U.S. tax and the tax of country Z. Percentage depletion is not allowed as a deduction under the law of country Z and is not taken as a deduction for purposes of the U.S. tax. It is assumed that no other deductions are allowable under the law of either country. Based upon the facts assumed, the income tax paid to country Z on such foreign mineral income is $27,000, and the U.S. tax on such income before allowance of the foreign tax credit is $2,400, determined as follows:
U.S. tax

(b) Section 901(e) and this section do not apply to reduce the amount of the foreign income tax paid to country Z with respect to the foreign mineral income since for 1971 D is not allowed the deduction for percentage depletion with respect to any foreign mineral income from sources within country Z. Accordingly, D is allowed a foreign tax credit of $2,400 ($2,400 × $5,000/$5,000), and foreign income tax in the amount of $24,600 ($27,000 less $2,400) is first carried back to 1969 under section 904(d).

# Example 5.
(a) R, a domestic corporation using the calendar year as the taxable year, is an operator drilling for oil in the United States and in foreign country Z. For 1971, R's gross income under chapter 1 of the Code is $250,000, of which $100,000 is foreign mineral income from a property in foreign country Z and $150,000 is from a property in the United States, all being subject to the allowance for depletion. During 1971, R incurs intangible drilling and development costs of $125,000 in the United States and of $25,000 in country Z, all of which are currently deductible for purposes of the U.S. tax. Of these costs of $25,000 incurred in country Z, only $2,500 is currently deductible under the law of country Z. Cost depletion in the case of the U.S. property amounts to $60,000; and in the case of the property in country Z, to $5,000, which is allowed as a deduction under the laws of such country. Percentage depletion is not allowed as a deduction under the law of country Z. In computing the U.S. tax for 1971, R is required to use cost depletion with respect to the mineral income from the U.S. property and percentage depletion with respect to the foreign mineral income from the property in country Z. It is assumed that no other deductions are allowed under the law of either country. Based upon the facts assumed, the income tax paid to country Z on the foreign mineral income from sources therein is $37,000, and the U.S. tax on the entire mineral income before allowance of the
foreign tax credit is $8,640, determined as follows:

(b) Without taking this section into account, R would be allowed a foreign tax credit for 1971 of $8,640 ($8,640 × $18,000/$18,000), and foreign income tax in the amount of $28,360 ($37,000 less $8,640) would first be carried back to 1969 under section 904(d).
(c) Under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the amount of the U.S. tax for 1971 with respect to foreign mineral income from country Z is $25,440, which is the greater of the amounts of tax determined under subparagraphs (1) and (2):
(1) U.S. tax on total taxable income in excess of U.S. tax on taxable income excluding foreign mineral income from country Z (determined under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(

(f) After taking this section into account, R is allowed a foreign tax credit for 1971 of $8,640 ($8,640 × $18,000/$18,000). The amount of foreign income tax which may be first carried back to 1969 under section 904(d) is reduced from $28,360 to $20,200 ($28,840 less $8,640).

# Example 6.
(a) B, a single individual using the calendar year as the taxable year, is an operator drilling for oil in foreign countries X and Y. For 1972, B's gross income under chapter 1 of the Code is $250,000, of which $150,000 is foreign mineral income from a property in country X and $100,000 is foreign mineral income from a property in country Y, all being subject to the allowance for depletion. The assumption is made that B's earned taxable income for 1972 is insufficient to cause section 1348 to apply. During 1972, B incurs intangible drilling and development costs of $16,000 in country X and of $9,000 in country Y, which are currently deductible for purposes of both the U.S. tax and the tax of countries X and Y, respectively. For purposes of both the U.S. tax and the tax of countries X and Y, respectively, cost depletion in the case of the X property amounts to $8,000, and in the case of Y property, to $7,000; and only cost depletion is allowed as a deduction under the law of countries X and Y. For 1972, B uses the overall limitation under section 904(a)(2) on the foreign tax credit. Percentage depletion is not allowed as a deduction under the law of countries X and Y. It is assumed that the only other allowable deductions amount to $2,250. None of these deductions is attributable to the income from the properties in countries X and Y, and none is deductible under the laws of country X or country Y. Based upon the facts assumed, the income tax paid to countries X and Y on the foreign mineral income from each such country is $71,820 and $25,200, respectively, and the U.S. tax on B's total taxable income before allowance of the foreign tax credit is $99,990, determined as follows:

There would be no foreign income tax carried back to 1970 under section 904(d) since the allowable credit of $97,020 does not exceed the limitation of $99,990.
(c) Under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the amount of the U.S. tax for 1972 with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within country X is $69,760, which is the greater of the amounts of tax determined under subparagraphs (1) and (2):
(1) U.S. tax on total taxable income in excess of U.S. tax on taxable income excluding foreign mineral income from country X (determined under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(

(e) Under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the amount of income tax paid to country X for 1972 with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within such country is $71,820. This is the amount determined under both (
a
) and (
b
) of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, since, in this case, there is no income from sources within country X other than foreign mineral income, and there are no deductions allowed under the law of country X which are not allocable to such foreign mineral income.
(f) Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the foreign income tax with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within country X which is allowable as a credit against the U.S. tax for 1972 is reduced to $69,760, determined as follows:
Foreign income tax paid to country X on foreign mineral income
$71,820

) of this section, the amount of the U.S. tax which would be computed for 1972 (without regard to section 613) with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within country Y is $58,800, which is the excess of the U.S. tax ($127,990) determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this example over the U.S. tax ($69,190) on total taxable income other than foreign mineral income from country Y, determined without regard to section 613, as follows:
Foreign mineral income from country X
$150,000
Intangible drilling and development costs
16,000
Cost depletion
8,000
Adjusted gross income
126,000
Other deductions

Personal exemption
750
Taxable income
123,000
U.S. tax ($53,090 plus 70% of $23,000)
69,190
(i) Under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the amount of income tax paid to country Y for 1972 with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within such country is $25,200. This is the amount determined under both (
a
) and (
b
) of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, since, in this case, there is no income from sources within country Y other than foreign mineral income, and there are no deductions allowed under the law of country Y which are not allocable to such foreign mineral income.
(j) Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the foreign income tax with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within country Y which is allowable as a credit against the U.S. tax for 1972 is not reduced from $25,200, as follows:
Foreign income tax paid to country Y on foreign mineral income
$25,200
Less reduction under sec. 901(e):
Smaller of $25,200 (tax paid to country Y on foreign mineral income) or $58,800 (U.S. tax on foreign mineral income from sources within country Y, as determined under paragraph (h) of this example)
$25,200
Less: U.S. tax on foreign mineral income from sources within country Y, as determined under paragraph (g) of this example
48,280
Foreign income tax of country Y allowable as a credit
25,200
(k) After taking this section into account, B is allowed a foreign tax credit for 1972 of $94,960 ($69,760 + $25,200), but not to exceed the overall limitation under section 904 (a)(2) of $99,990 ($99,990 × $167,750/$167,750). There would be no foreign income tax carried back to 1970 under section 904(d) since the allowable credit of $94,960 does not exceed the limitation of $99,990.

# Example 7.
(a) P, a domestic corporation using the calendar year as the taxable year, is an operator mining for iron ore in foreign country X. For 1971, P's gross income under chapter 1 of the Code is $100,000, all of which is foreign mineral income from a property in country X and is subject to the allowance for depletion. For 1971, cost depletion amounts to $5,000 for purposes of the tax of both countries, and only cost depletion is allowed as a deduction under the law of country X. It is assumed that deductions (other than for depletion) attributable to the mineral property in country X amount to $8,000, and these deductions are allowable under the law of both countries. Based upon the facts assumed, the income tax paid to country X on such foreign mineral income is $39,150, and the U.S. tax on such income before allowance of the foreign tax credit is $37,440 determined as follows:
U.S. tax
X tax
Foreign mineral income
$100,000
$100,000
Less:
Percentage depletion (14% of $100,000, but not to exceed 50% of $92,000)

(b) Without taking this section into account, P would be allowed a foreign tax credit for 1971 of $37,440 ($37,440 × $78,000/ $78,000), and foreign income tax in the amount of $1,710 ($39,150 less $37,440) would first be carried back to 1969 under section 904(d).
(c) Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, however, the foreign income tax allowable as a credit against the U.S. tax is reduced to $37,440, determined as follows:
Foreign income tax paid on foreign mineral income
$39,150
Less reduction under sec. 901(e):
Smaller of $39,150 (tax paid to country X on foreign mineral income) or $41,760 (U.S. tax on foreign mineral income of $87,000 ($87,000 × 48%), determined by deducting cost depletion of $5,000 in lieu of percentage depletion of $14,000)
$39,150
Less: U.S. tax on foreign mineral income (before credit)
37,440
1,710
Foreign income tax allowable as a credit
37,440
(d) After taking this section into account, P is allowed a foreign tax credit for 1971 of $37,440 ($37,440 × $78,000/$78,000), but no foreign income tax is carried back to 1969 under section 904(d) since the allowable credit of $37,440 does not exceed the limitation of $37,440.

# Example 8.
(a) The facts are the same as in example 7, except that P is assumed to have received dividends for 1971 of $25,000 from R, a foreign corporation incorporated in country X which is not a less developed country corporation within the meaning of section 902(d). Income tax of $2,500 ($25,000 × 10%) on such dividends is withheld at the source in country X. It is assumed that P is deemed under section 902(a)(1) and § 1.902-1(h) to have paid income tax of $22,500 to country X in respect of such dividends and that under paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(i) of this section such dividends are deemed to be attributable to foreign mineral income from sources in country X and that such tax is deemed to be paid with respect to such foreign mineral income. Based upon the facts assumed, the U.S. tax on the foreign mineral income from sources in country X is $60,240 before allowance of the foreign tax credit, determined as follows:
Foreign mineral income from country X:
Income from mining property
$100,000
Dividends from R
25,000
Sec. 78 dividend
22,500
$147,500

Other deductions
8,000
Taxable income
125,500
Income tax rate

(b) Without taking this section into account, P would be allowed a foreign tax credit for 1971 of $60,240 ($60,240 × $125,500/$125,500), and foreign income tax in the amount of $3,910 ([$39,150 + $22,500 + $2,500] less $60,240) would first be carried back to 1969 under section 904(d).
(c) Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, however, the foreign income tax allowable as a credit against the U.S. tax is reduced from $64,150 to $60,240, determined as follows:
Foreign income tax paid, and deemed to be paid, to country X on foreign mineral income ($39,150 + $22,500 + $2,500)
$64,150
Less reduction under sec. 901(e):
Smaller of $64,150 (tax paid and deemed paid to country X on foreign mineral income) or $64,560 (U.S. tax on foreign mineral income of $134,500 ($134,500 × 48%), determined by deducting cost depletion of $5,000 in lieu of percentage depletion of $14,000)
$64,150
Less: U.S. tax on foreign mineral income (before credit)
$60,240
$3,910
Foreign income tax allowable as a credit
60,240
(d) After taking this section into account, P is allowed a foreign tax credit for 1971 of $60,240 ($60,240 × $125,500/$125,500), but no foreign income tax is carried back to 1969 under section 904(d) since the allowable credit of $60,240 does not exceed the limitation of $60,240.

Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, an RFA means, with respect to a foreign income tax and a CAA, any asset (including goodwill, going concern value, or other intangible) subject to the CAA that is relevant in determining foreign income for purposes of the foreign income tax.
(2)
RFA status with respect to a foreign income tax.
An asset is relevant in determining foreign income if income, deduction, gain, or loss attributable to the asset is taken into account in determining foreign income immediately after the CAA, or would be taken into account in determining foreign income immediately after the CAA if the asset were to give rise to income, deduction, gain, or loss at such time.
(3)
Subsequent RFA status with respect to another foreign income tax.
After a CAA, an asset will become an RFA with respect to another foreign income tax if, pursuant to a plan or series of related transactions that have a principal purpose of avoiding the application of section 901(m), an asset that was not relevant in determining foreign income for purposes of that foreign income tax immediately after the CAA becomes relevant in determining such foreign income. A principal purpose of avoiding section 901(m) will be deemed to exist if income, deduction, gain, or loss attributable to the asset is taken into account in determining such foreign income within the one-year period following the CAA, or would be taken into account in determining such foreign income during such time if the asset were to give rise to income, deduction, gain, or loss within the one-year period.
(d)
Identifying covered asset acquisitions and relevant foreign assets to which paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section do not apply.
For transactions occurring on or after January 1, 2011, and before July 21, 2014, other than transactions occurring before July 21, 2014, resulting from an entity classification election made under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter that is filed on or after July 29, 2014, and that is effective on or before July 21, 2014, the transactions set forth under section 901(m)(2) are CAAs and the assets that are relevant foreign assets with respect to the CAA under section 901(m)(4) are RFAs.
(e)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:
(1)
Example 1: CAA involving an acquisition of a partnership interest for foreign income tax purposes
—(i)
Facts.
(A) FPS is an entity organized in Country F that is treated as a partnership for both U.S. and Country F income tax purposes. FPS is owned equally by FC1 and FC2, each of which is a corporation organized in Country F and treated as a corporation for both U.S. and Country F income tax purposes. FPS has a single asset, Asset A. USP, a domestic corporation, owns all the interests in DE, a disregarded entity.
(B) Pursuant to the same transaction, USP acquires FC1's interest in FPS, and DE acquires FC2's interest in FPS. For U.S. income tax purposes, with respect to USP, the acquisition of the interests in FPS is treated as the acquisition of Asset A by USP. See Rev. Rul. 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432. For Country F tax purposes, the acquisitions of the interests of FPS by USP and DE are treated as acquisitions of partnership interests.
(ii)
Result.
The transaction is a CAA under paragraph (b)(4) of this section
because it is treated as the acquisition of Asset A for U.S. income tax purposes and the acquisition of interests in a fiscally transparent entity for Country F tax purposes.
(2)
Example 2: CAA involving an asset acquisition for purposes of both U.S. income tax and a foreign income tax
—(i)
Facts.
(A) USP, a domestic corporation, wholly owns CFC1, a foreign corporation, and CFC1 wholly owns CFC2, also a foreign corporation. CFC1 and CFC2 are organized in Country F. CFC1 owns Asset A.
(B) In an exchange described in section 351, CFC1 transfers Asset A to CFC2 in exchange for CFC2 common stock and cash. CFC1 recognizes gain on the exchange under section 351(b). Under section 362(a), CFC2's U.S. basis in Asset A is increased by the gain recognized by CFC1. For Country F tax purposes, gain or loss is not recognized on the transfer of Asset A to CFC2, and therefore there is no increase in the foreign basis in Asset A.
(ii)
Result.
The transaction is a CAA under paragraph (b)(6) of this section because it is treated as an acquisition of Asset A by CFC2 for both U.S. and Country F income tax purposes, and it results in an increase in the U.S. basis of Asset A without a corresponding increase in the foreign basis of Asset A.
(3)
Example 3: RFA status determined immediately after CAA; application of principal purpose rule
—(i)
Facts.
(A) USP1 and USP2 are unrelated domestic corporations. USP1 wholly owns USSub, also a domestic corporation. On January 1 of Year 1, USP2 acquires all of the stock of USSub from USP1 in a qualified stock purchase (as defined in section 338(d)(3)) to which section 338(a) applies. Immediately after the acquisition, none of the income, deduction, gain, or loss attributable to any of the assets of USSub is taken into account in determining foreign income for purposes of a foreign income tax nor would such items be taken into account in determining foreign income for purposes of a foreign income tax immediately after the acquisition if such assets were to give rise to income, deduction, gain, or loss immediately after the acquisition.
(B) On December 1 of Year 1, USSub contributes all its assets to FSub, its wholly owned subsidiary, which is a corporation for both U.S. and Country X income tax purposes, in a transfer described in section 351 (subsequent transfer). USSub recognizes no gain or loss for U.S. or Country X income tax purposes as a result of the subsequent transfer. As a result of the subsequent transfer, income, deduction, gain, or loss attributable to the assets of USSub that were transferred to FSub is taken into account in determining foreign income of FSub for Country X tax purposes.
(ii)
Result.
(A) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the acquisition by USP2 of the stock of USSub is a section 338 CAA. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, none of the assets of USSub are RFAs immediately after the CAA, because none of the income, deduction, gain, or loss attributable to such assets is taken into account for purposes of determining foreign income with respect to any foreign income tax immediately after the CAA (nor would such items be taken into account for purposes of determining foreign income immediately after the CAA if such assets were to give rise to income, deduction, gain, or loss at such time).
(B) Although the subsequent transfer is not a CAA under paragraph (b) of this section, the subsequent transfer causes the assets of USSub to become relevant in the hands of FSub in determining foreign income for Country X tax purposes. Because the subsequent transfer occurred within the one-year period following the CAA, it is presumed to have a principal purpose of avoiding section 901(m) under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Accordingly, the assets of USSub with respect to the CAA occurring on January 1 of Year 1 become RFAs with respect to Country X tax as a result of the subsequent transfer. Thus, a basis difference with respect to Country X tax must be computed for the RFAs and taken into account under section 901(m).
(f)
Applicability dates.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, this section applies to CAAs occurring on or after March 23, 2020.
(2) Paragraphs (a), (b)(1) through (3), and (c)(1) of this section apply to transactions occurring on or after July 21,
2014, and to transactions occurring before that date resulting from an entity classification election made under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter that is filed on or after July 29, 2014, and that is effective on or before July 21, 2014. Paragraph (d) of this section applies to transactions occurring on or after January 1, 2011, and before July 21, 2014, other than transactions occurring before July 21, 2014, resulting from an entity classification election made under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter that is filed on or after July 29, 2014, and that is effective on or before July 21, 2014.
(3) Taxpayers may, however, choose to apply provisions in this section before the date such provisions are applicable pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) or (2) of this section, provided that they (along with any persons that are related (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)) to the taxpayer)—
(i) Consistently apply this section (excluding paragraph (d) of this section) to all CAAs occurring on or after December 7, 2016 and consistently apply § 1.704-1(b)(4)(viii)(

v
) through (
vii
), § 1.901(m)-1, and §§ 1.901(m)-3 through 1.901(m)-8 (excluding § 1.901(m)-4(e)) to all CAAs occurring on or after January 1, 2011, on any original or amended tax return for each taxable year for which the application of the provisions listed in this paragraph (f)(3)(i) affects the tax liability and for which the statute of limitations does not preclude assessment or the filing of a claim for refund, as applicable;
(ii) File all tax returns described in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section for any taxable year ending on or before March 23, 2020, no later than March 23, 2021; and
(iii) Make appropriate adjustments to take into account deficiencies that would have resulted from the consistent application under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section for taxable years that are not open for assessment.
[T.D. 9895, 85 FR 16251, Mar. 23, 2020]
§ 1.901(m)-3
Disqualified tax amount and aggregate basis difference carryover.
(a)
In general.
If a section 901(m) payor has an aggregate basis difference, with respect to a foreign income tax and a foreign payor, for a U.S. taxable year, the section 901(m) payor must determine the portion of a foreign income tax amount that is disqualified under section 901(m) (
disqualified tax amount
). Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules for determining the disqualified tax amount. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for determining what portion, if any, of aggregate basis difference will be carried forward to the next U.S. taxable year (
aggregate basis difference carryover
). Paragraph (d) of this section provides applicability dates.
(b)
Disqualified tax amount
—(1)
In general.
A section 901(m) payor's disqualified tax amount is not taken into account in determining the credit allowed under section 901(a). If the section 901(m) payor is an applicable foreign corporation, the disqualified tax amount is not taken into account for purposes of section 902 (for tax years of foreign corporations beginning before January 1, 2018) or 960. Sections 78 and 275 do not apply to the disqualified tax amount. The disqualified tax amount is allowed as a deduction to the extent otherwise deductible. See sections 164, 212, and 964 and the regulations under those sections.
(2)
Determination of disqualified tax amount
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, the disqualified tax amount is equal to the lesser of the foreign income tax amount that is paid or accrued by, or considered paid or accrued by, the section 901(m) payor for the U.S. taxable year or the tentative disqualified tax amount. All calculations are determined with respect to each separate category.
(ii)
Tentative disqualified tax amount.
The tentative disqualified tax amount is equal to the amount determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section reduced (but not below zero) by the amount described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.
(A) The product of—
(
1
) The sum of the foreign income tax amount and the FCCTs that are paid or accrued by, or considered paid or accrued by, the section 901(m) payor, and
(
2
) A fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate basis difference,
but not in excess of the allocable foreign income, and the denominator of which is the allocable foreign income.
(B) The amount of the FCCT that is a disqualified tax amount of the section 901(m) payor with respect to another foreign income tax.
(iii)
Allocable foreign income
—(A)
No allocation required.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(D) of this section, if the entire foreign income tax amount is paid or accrued by, or considered paid or accrued by, a single section 901(m) payor, then the allocable foreign income is equal to the entire foreign income, determined with respect to each separate category.
(B)
Allocation required.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(D) of this section, if the foreign income tax amount is allocated to, and considered paid or accrued by, more than one person, a section 901(m) payor's allocable foreign income is equal to the portion of the foreign income that relates to the foreign income tax amount allocated to that section 901(m) payor, determined with respect to each separate category.
(C)
Rules for allocations.
This paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(C) provides allocation rules that apply to determine allocable foreign income in certain cases.
(
1
) If the foreign payor is involved in a mid-year transaction and the foreign income tax amount is allocated under § 1.336-2(g)(3)(ii), § 1.338-9(d), or § 1.901-2(f)(4), then, to the extent any portion of the foreign income tax amount is allocated to, and considered paid or accrued by, a section 901(m) payor, the allocable foreign income of the section 901(m) payor is determined in accordance with the principles of § 1.1502-76(b). To the extent the foreign income tax amount is allocated to an entity that is a partnership for U.S. income tax purposes, a portion of the foreign income is first allocated to the partnership in accordance with the principles of § 1.1502-76(b), which is then allocated under the rules of paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(C)(
2
) of this section to determine the allocable foreign income of a section 901(m) payor that owns an interest in the partnership directly or indirectly through one or more other partnerships for U.S. income tax purposes.
(
2
) If the foreign income tax amount is considered paid or accrued by a section 901(m) payor for a U.S. taxable year under § 1.702-1(a)(6), the determination of the allocable foreign income must be consistent with the allocation of the foreign income tax amount that relates to the foreign income. See § 1.704-1(b)(4)(viii).
(
3
) If the foreign income tax amount that is allocated to, and considered paid or accrued by, a section 901(m) payor for a U.S. taxable year is determined under § 1.901-2(f)(3)(i), the allocable foreign income is determined in accordance with § 1.901-2(f)(3)(iii).
(D)
Failure to substantiate allocable foreign income.
If, pursuant to section 901(m)(3)(A), a section 901(m) payor fails to substantiate its allocable foreign income to the satisfaction of the Secretary, then allocable foreign income will equal the amount determined by dividing the sum of the foreign income tax amount and the FCCTs that are paid or accrued by, or considered paid or accrued by, the section 901(m) payor, by the highest marginal tax rate applicable to income of the foreign payor under foreign tax law.
(iv)
Special rule.
A section 901(m) payor's disqualified tax amount is zero for a U.S. taxable year if:
(A) The section 901(m) payor's aggregate basis difference for the U.S. taxable year is a negative amount;
(B) Foreign income is less than or equal to zero for the foreign taxable year of the foreign payor; or
(C) The foreign income tax amount that is paid or accrued by, or considered paid or accrued by, the section 901(m) payor for the U.S. taxable year is zero.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. For purposes of all the examples, unless otherwise specified: USP is a domestic corporation. CFC1, CFC2, DE1, and DE2 are organized in Country F and are treated as corporations for Country F tax purposes. CFC1 and CFC2 are applicable foreign corporations. DE1 and DE2 are disregarded entities. USP, CFC1, and CFC2 each have a calendar year for both U.S. and Country F income tax purposes, and DE1 and DE2 each have a calendar year for Country F tax purposes. Country F
and Country G each impose a single tax that is a foreign income tax. CFC1, CFC2, DE1, and DE2 each have a functional currency of the u with respect to all activities. At all relevant times, 1u equals $1. All amounts are stated in millions. The examples assume that the applicable cost recovery method for property results in basis being recovered ratably over the life of the property beginning on the first day of the U.S. taxable year in which the property is acquired or placed into service; there is a single separate category with respect to a foreign income and foreign income tax amount; and a section 901(m) payor properly substantiates its allocable foreign income to the satisfaction of the Secretary.
(i)
Example 1: Determining aggregate basis difference; multiple foreign payors
—(A)
Facts.
CFC1 wholly owns CFC2 and DE1. DE1 wholly owns DE2. Assume that the tax laws of Country F do not allow combined income reporting or the filing of consolidated income tax returns. Accordingly, CFC1, CFC2, DE1, and DE2 file separate tax returns for Country F tax purposes. USP acquires all of the stock of CFC1 in a qualified stock purchase (as defined in section 338(d)(3)) to which section 338(a) applies for both CFC1 and CFC2.
(B)
Result.
(
1
) The acquisition of CFC1 gives rise to four separate CAAs under § 1.901(m)-2(b). The acquisition of the stock of CFC1 and the deemed purchase of the stock of CFC2 under section 338(h)(3)(B) are each a section 338 CAA under § 1.901(m)-2(b)(1). Furthermore, because the deemed purchase of the assets of DE1 and DE2 for U.S. income tax purposes is disregarded for Country F tax purposes, each acquisition is a CAA under § 1.901(m)-2(b)(2). Because these four CAAs occur pursuant to a plan, under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(3) they are part of an aggregated CAA transaction. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(37), CFC1 is the RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to its assets and those of DE1 and DE2. CFC2 is the RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to its assets. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(28), CFC1, CFC2, DE1, and DE2 are each a foreign payor for Country F tax purposes. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(41), CFC1 is the section 901(m) payor with respect to foreign income tax amounts for which CFC1, DE1, and DE2 are the foreign payors (see § 1.901-2(f)(1) and (f)(4)(ii)). CFC2 is the section 901(m) payor with respect to foreign income tax amounts for which CFC2 is the foreign payor (see § 1.901-2(f)(1)).
(
2
) In determining aggregate basis difference under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(1) for a U.S. taxable year of CFC1, CFC1 has three computations with respect to Country F tax, because there are three foreign payors for Country F tax purposes whose foreign income tax amount, if any, is considered paid or accrued by CFC1 as the section 901(m) payor. Furthermore, for each U.S. taxable year, CFC1 will compute a separate disqualified tax amount and aggregate basis difference carryover (if any) under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, with respect to each foreign payor.
(
3
) In determining aggregate basis difference for a U.S. taxable year of CFC2 under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(1), CFC2 has a single computation with respect to Country F tax, because there is a single foreign payor (CFC2) for Country F tax purposes whose foreign income tax amount, if any, is considered paid or accrued by CFC2 as the section 901(m) payor. Furthermore, for each U.S. taxable year, CFC2 will compute a disqualified tax amount and aggregate basis difference carryover (if any) under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(C)
Alternative facts.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section (paragraph (A) of this
Example 1
), except that foreign income for Country F tax purposes is based on combined income (within the meaning of § 1.901-2(f)(3)(ii)) of CFC1, CFC2, DE1, and DE2. For purposes of determining an aggregate basis difference for a U.S. taxable year of CFC1 under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(1), CFC1, DE1, and DE2 are treated as a single foreign payor because all of the items of income, deduction, gain, or loss with respect to CFC1, DE1, and DE2 are included in the earnings and profits of CFC1 for U.S. income tax purposes. For each U.S. taxable year, CFC1 will therefore compute a single aggregate basis difference, disqualified tax amount, and aggregate basis difference carryover. The result for CFC2 under the alternative facts is the same as in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B)(
3
) (paragraph (B)(
3
) of this
Example 1
).
(ii) Example 2: Computation of disqualified tax amount
—(A)
Facts.
On December 31 of Year 0, USP acquires all of the stock of CFC1 in a qualified stock purchase (as defined in section 338(d)(3)) to which section 338(a) applies (Acquisition). CFC1 owns four assets (Asset A, Asset B, Asset C, and Asset D, and collectively, Assets) and conducts activities in Country F and in a Country G branch. The activities conducted by CFC1 in Country G are not subject to tax in Country F. The tax rate is 25% in Country F and 30% in Country G. For Country F tax purposes, CFC1's foreign income and foreign income tax amount for each foreign taxable year 1 through 15 is 100u and $25 (25u translated at the exchange rate of $1 = 1u), respectively. For Country G tax purposes, CFC1's foreign income and foreign income tax amount for each foreign taxable year 1 through 5 is 400u and $120 (120u translated at the exchange rate of $1 = 1u), respectively. No dispositions occur for any of the Assets during the applicable cost recovery period. Additional facts relevant to each of the Assets are summarized below.

(B)
Result.
(
1
) Under § 1.901(m)-2(b)(1), the acquisition of the stock of CFC1 is a section 338 CAA. Under § 1.901(m)-2(c)(1), Assets A and B are RFAs with respect to Country F tax, because they are relevant in determining foreign income of CFC1 for Country F tax purposes and were owned by CFC1 when the Acquisition occurred. Assets C and D are RFAs with respect to Country G tax, because they are relevant in determining foreign income of CFC1 for Country G tax purposes and were owned by CFC1 when the Acquisition occurred. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(37), CFC1 is the RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to all of the RFAs. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(41) and (28), CFC1 is the section 901(m) payor and the foreign payor for Country F and Country G tax purposes.
(
2
) In determining aggregate basis difference for a U.S. taxable year of CFC1, CFC1 has two computations, one with respect to Country F tax and one with respect to Country G tax. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(1), the aggregate basis difference for a U.S. taxable year with respect to Country F tax is equal to the sum of the allocated basis differences and allocated basis difference adjustments with respect to Assets A and B for the U.S. taxable year. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(5), allocated basis differences are the sum of cost recovery amounts and disposition amounts. Because there are no dispositions, the only allocated basis differences taken into account in determining an aggregate basis difference are cost recovery amounts. Under § 1.901(m)-5(b), any cost recovery amounts are attributed to CFC1, because CFC1 is the section 901(m) payor and RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to all of the Assets. For each U.S. taxable year, CFC1 will compute a separate disqualified tax amount and aggregate basis difference carryover (if any) with respect to Country F tax and Country G tax under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. For purposes of both disqualified tax amount computations, because CFC1 is the section 901(m) payor and foreign payor, the foreign income tax amount paid or accrued by CFC1 with respect to Country F tax and Country G tax, respectively, will be the entire foreign income tax amount and CFC1's allocable foreign income will be the entire foreign income.
(
3
) With respect to Country F tax, in U.S. taxable years 1 through 5, CFC1 has an aggregate basis difference of 20u each year (10u cost recovery amount with respect to Asset A plus 10u cost recovery amount with respect to Asset B). For U.S. taxable years 1 through 5,
under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the disqualified tax amount each year is $5, the lesser of two amounts: the tentative disqualified tax amount, in this case, $5 ($25 foreign income tax amount × (20u aggregate basis difference/100u allocable foreign income)), or the foreign income tax amount paid or accrued by CFC1, in this case, $25. After U.S. taxable year 5, Asset B has no unallocated basis difference with respect to Country F tax. Accordingly, in U.S. taxable years 6 through 15, CFC1 has an aggregate basis difference of 10u each year. Accordingly, for U.S. taxable years 6 through 15, the disqualified tax amount each year is $2.50, the lesser of two amounts: the tentative disqualified tax amount, in this case, $2.50 ($25 foreign income tax amount × (10u aggregate basis difference/100u allocable foreign income)), or the foreign income tax amount paid or accrued by CFC1, in this case, $25. After U.S. taxable year 15, Asset A has no unallocated basis difference with respect to Country F tax and, therefore, CFC1 has no disqualified tax amount with respect to Country F Tax.
(
4
) With respect to Country G tax, in U.S. taxable years 1 through 5, CFC1 has an aggregate basis difference of 40u each year (60u cost recovery amount with respect to Asset C + (20u) cost recovery amount with respect to Asset D). For U.S. taxable years 1 through 5, under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the disqualified tax amount each year is $12, the lesser of two amounts: the tentative disqualified tax amount, in this case, $12 ($120 foreign income tax amount × (40u aggregate basis difference/400u allocable foreign income)), or the foreign income tax amount paid or accrued by CFC1, in this case, $120. After U.S. taxable year 5, Asset C and Asset D have no unallocated basis difference with respect to Country G tax. Accordingly, in U.S. taxable years 6 through 15, CFC1 has no disqualified tax amount with respect to Country G Tax.
(iii)
Example 3: FCCT
—(A)
Facts.
In U.S. taxable year 1, USP acquires all of the interests in DE1 in a transaction (Transaction) that is treated as a stock acquisition for Country F tax purposes. Immediately after the Transaction, DE1 owns assets (Pre-Transaction Assets), all of which are used in a Country G branch and give rise to income that is taken into account for Country F tax and Country G tax purposes. After the Transaction, DE1 acquires additional assets (Post-Transaction Assets), which are not used by the Country G branch. Both Country F and Country G have a tax rate of 30%. Country F imposes worldwide tax on its residents and provides a foreign tax credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions. In foreign taxable year 3, 100u of income is attributable to DE1's Post-Transaction Assets and 100u of income is attributable to DE1's Pre-Transaction Assets. For Country G tax purposes, the foreign income is 100u and foreign income tax amount is 30u (30% × 100u). For Country F tax purposes, the foreign income is 200u and the pre-foreign tax credit tax is 60u (30% × 200u). The 60u of Country F pre-foreign tax credit tax is reduced by the 30u foreign income tax amount imposed for Country G tax purposes. Thus, the foreign income tax amount for Country F tax purposes is $30 (30u translated into dollars at the exchange rate of $1 = 1u). Assume that for U.S. taxable year 3 USP has 100u aggregate basis difference with respect to Country F tax and 100u aggregate basis difference with respect to Country G tax. USP does not dispose of DE1 or any assets of DE1 in U.S. taxable year 3.
(B)
Result.
(
1
) Under § 1.901(m)-2(b)(2), the Transaction is a CAA. Under § 1.901(m)-2(c)(1), the Pre-Transaction Assets are RFAs with respect to both Country F tax and Country G tax, because they are relevant in determining the foreign income of DE1 for Country F tax and Country G tax purposes and were owned by DE1 when the Transaction occurred. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(37), USP is the RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to the RFAs. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(28), DE1 is a foreign payor for Country F tax and Country G tax purposes. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(41), USP is the section 901(m) payor with respect to foreign income tax amounts for which DE1 is the foreign payor (see § 1.901-2(f)(4)(ii)). Because the Country G foreign income tax amount is
claimed as a credit for purposes of determining the Country F foreign income tax amount, the Country G foreign income tax amount is an FCCT under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(22).

) Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(1), for each U.S. taxable year, USP will separately compute the aggregate basis difference with respect to Country F tax and with respect to Country G tax and will use those amounts to separately compute a disqualified tax amount and aggregate basis difference carryover (if any) with respect to each foreign income tax. Because DE1 is a disregarded entity owned by USP during the entire U.S. taxable year 3, the foreign income tax amount paid or accrued by DE1 is not subject to allocation. Accordingly, for purposes of each of the disqualified tax amount computations, the foreign income tax amount paid or accrued by USP with respect to Country F tax and Country G tax, respectively, is the entire foreign income tax amount paid or accrued by DE1, and, under paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, USP's allocable foreign income will be equal to DE1's entire foreign income.
(

) As stated in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section (paragraph (A) of this
Example 3
), for U.S. taxable year 3 USP has 100u aggregate basis difference with respect to Country F tax and 100u aggregate basis difference with respect to Country G tax. With respect to Country G tax, in U.S. taxable year 3, under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the disqualified tax amount is $30, the lesser of the two amounts: the tentative disqualified tax amount, in this case, $30 ($30 foreign income tax amount × (100u aggregate basis difference/100u allocable foreign income)), or the foreign income tax amount considered paid or accrued by USP, in this case, $30.
(

) With respect to Country F tax, in U.S. taxable year 3, under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the disqualified tax amount is $0, the lesser of two amounts: the tentative disqualified tax amount, in this case $0 (($30 foreign income tax amount + $30 Country G FCCT) × (100u aggregate basis difference/200u foreign income) = $30 reduced by $30 Country G FCCT that is a disqualified tax amount of USP), or the foreign income tax amount considered paid or accrued by USP, in this case, $30.
(c)
Aggregate basis difference carryover
—(1)
In general.
If a section 901(m) payor has an aggregate basis difference carryover for a U.S. taxable year, as determined under this paragraph (c), the aggregate basis difference carryover is taken into account in computing the section 901(m) payor's aggregate basis difference for the next U.S. taxable year. For successor rules that apply to an aggregate basis difference carryover, see § 1.901(m)-6(c).
(2)
Amount of aggregate basis difference carryover.
(i) If a section 901(m) payor's disqualified tax amount is zero, all of the section 901(m) payor's aggregate basis difference (positive or negative) for the U.S. taxable year gives rise to an aggregate basis difference carryover to the next U.S. taxable year.
(ii) If a section 901(m) payor's disqualified tax amount is not zero, then aggregate basis difference carryover can arise in either or both of the following two situations:
(A) If a section 901(m) payor's aggregate basis difference for the U.S. taxable year exceeds its allocable foreign income, the excess gives rise to an aggregate basis difference carryover.
(B) If the tentative disqualified tax amount exceeds the disqualified tax amount, the excess tentative disqualified tax amount is converted into aggregate basis difference carryover by multiplying such excess by a fraction, the numerator of which is the allocable foreign income, and the denominator of which is the sum of the foreign income tax amount and the FCCTs that are paid or accrued by, or considered paid or accrued by, the section 901(m) payor.
(3)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of paragraph (c) of this section.
(i)
Facts.
(A) On July 1 of Year 1, CFC1 acquires all of the interests of DE1 in a transaction (Transaction) that is treated as a stock acquisition for Country F tax purposes. CFC1 and DE1 are organized in Country F and are treated as corporations for Country F tax purposes. CFC1 is an applicable foreign corporation, and DE1 is a disregarded entity. CFC1 has a calendar year for U.S. income tax purposes, and DE1 has a June 30 year-end for Country
F tax purposes. Country F imposes a single tax that is a foreign income tax. CFC1 and DE1 each have a functional currency of the u with respect to all activities. Immediately after the Transaction, DE1 owns one asset, Asset A, that gives rise to income that is taken into account for Country F tax purposes. For the first U.S. taxable year (U.S. taxable year 1) there is a cost recovery amount with respect to Asset A of 9u, and for each subsequent U.S. taxable year until the U.S. basis is fully recovered, there is a cost recovery amount with respect to Asset A of 18u. There is no disposition of Asset A.
(ii)
Result.
(A) Under § 1.901(m)-2(b)(2), the Transaction is a CAA. Under § 1.901(m)-2(c)(1), Asset A is an RFA with respect to Country F tax because it is relevant in determining the foreign income of DE1 for Country F tax purposes and was owned by DE1 when the Transaction occurred. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(37), CFC1 is the RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to Asset A. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(28), DE1 is a foreign payor for Country F tax purposes. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(41), CFC1 is the section 901(m) payor with respect to foreign income tax amounts for which DE1 is the foreign payor (see § 1.901-2(f)(4)(ii)).
(B) Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(1), in determining the aggregate basis difference for U.S. taxable year 1, CFC1 has one computation with respect to Country F tax. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(1), aggregate basis difference with respect to Country F tax is equal to the sum of allocated basis differences and allocated basis difference adjustments with respect to all RFAs, which, in this case, is only Asset A. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(5), allocated basis differences are the sum of cost recovery amounts and disposition amounts. Because there is no disposition of Asset A, the only allocated basis difference taken into account in determining an aggregate basis difference are cost recovery amounts with respect to Asset A. Under § 1.901(m)-5(b), any cost recovery amounts are assigned to a U.S taxable year of CFC1, because CFC1 is the section 901(m) payor and RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to Asset A. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, for each U.S. taxable year, CFC1 will compute a disqualified tax amount and aggregate basis difference carryover with respect to the aggregate basis difference. Because DE1 is a disregarded entity owned by CFC1, the foreign income tax amount paid or accrued by DE1 is not subject to allocation. Accordingly, for purposes of the disqualified tax amount computation, the foreign income tax amount paid or accrued by CFC1 with respect to Country F tax is the entire foreign income tax amount paid or accrued by DE1, and under paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, CFC1's allocable foreign income will be equal to DE1's entire foreign income.
(C) In U.S. taxable year 1, CFC1 has an aggregate basis difference of 9u (the 9u cost recovery amount with respect to Asset A for U.S. taxable year 1). However, because the foreign taxable year of DE1, the foreign payor, will not end between July 1 and December 31, there will not be a foreign income tax amount for U.S. taxable year 1. Because the foreign income tax amount considered paid or accrued by CFC1 for U.S. taxable year 1 is zero, under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, the disqualified tax amount for U.S. taxable year 1 of CFC1 is also zero. Furthermore, because the disqualified tax amount is zero, under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, CFC1 has an aggregate basis difference carryover equal to 9u, the entire amount of the aggregate basis difference for U.S. taxable year 1. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the 9u aggregate basis difference carryover is taken into account in computing CFC1's aggregate basis difference for U.S. taxable year 2. Accordingly, in U.S. taxable year 2, CFC1 has an aggregate basis difference of 27u (18u cost recovery amount for U.S. taxable year 2, plus 9u aggregate basis difference carryover from U.S. taxable year 1).

§ 1.901(m)-4
Determination of basis difference.
(a)
In general.
This section provides rules for determining for each RFA the basis difference that arises as a result of a CAA. A basis difference is computed separately with respect to each foreign income tax for which an asset subject to a CAA is an RFA. Paragraph (b) of this section provides the general rule for determining basis difference that references only U.S. basis in the RFA. Paragraph (c) of this section provides for an election to determine basis difference by reference to foreign basis and sets forth the procedures for making the election. Paragraph (d) of this section provides special rules for determining basis difference in the case of a section 743(b) CAA. Paragraph (e) of this section provides a special rule for determining basis difference in an RFA with respect to a CAA to which paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section do not apply. Paragraph (f) of this section provides examples illustrating the rules of this section, and paragraph (g) of this section provides applicability dates.
(b)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, basis difference is the U.S. basis in the RFA immediately after the CAA, less the U.S. basis in the RFA immediately before the CAA. Basis difference is an attribute that attaches to an RFA.
(c)
Foreign basis election.
(1) An election (
foreign basis election
) may be made to apply section 901(m)(3)(C)(i)(II) by reference to the foreign basis immediately after the CAA instead of the U.S. basis immediately before the CAA. Accordingly, if a foreign basis election is made, basis difference is the U.S. basis in the RFA immediately after the CAA, less the foreign basis in the RFA immediately after the CAA. For this purpose, the foreign basis immediately after the CAA takes into account any adjustment to that foreign basis resulting from the CAA for purposes of the foreign income tax.
(2) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), a foreign basis election is made by the RFA owner (U.S.). If, however, the RFA owner (U.S.) is a partnership, each partner in the partnership (and not the partnership) may independently make a foreign basis election. In the case of one or more tiered partnerships, the foreign basis election is made at the level at which a partner is not also a partnership.
(3) The foreign basis election may be made separately for each CAA, and with respect to each foreign income tax and each foreign payor. For purposes of making the foreign basis election, all CAAs that are part of an aggregated CAA transaction are treated as a single CAA. Furthermore, for purposes of making the foreign basis election, if foreign law imposes tax on the combined income (within the meaning of § 1.901-2(f)(3)(ii)) of two or more foreign payors, all foreign payors whose items of income, deduction, gain, or loss for U.S. income tax purposes are included in the U.S. taxable income or earnings and profits of a single section 901(m) payor are treated as a single foreign payor.
(4) A foreign basis election is made by using foreign basis to determine basis difference for purposes of computing a disqualified tax amount and an aggregate basis difference carryover for the U.S. taxable year, as provided under § 1.901(m)-3. A separate statement or form evidencing the foreign
basis election need not be filed. Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(5) and (6) of this section, in order for a foreign basis election to be effective, the election must be reflected on a timely filed original federal income tax return (taking into account extensions) for the first U.S. taxable year that the foreign basis election is relevant to the computation of any amounts reported on such return, including on any required schedules.
(5) If the RFA owner (U.S.) is a partnership, a foreign basis election reflected on a partner's timely filed amended federal income tax return is also effective if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
(i) The partner's timely filed original federal income tax return (taking into account extensions) for the first U.S. taxable year of the partner in which a foreign basis election is relevant to the computation of any amounts reported on such return, including on any required schedules, does not reflect the application of section 901(m);
(ii) The information provided by the partnership to the partner for purposes of applying section 901(m) and any information required to be reported by the partnership is based solely on computations that use foreign basis to determine basis difference; and
(iii) Before the due date of the original federal income tax return described in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, the partner delegated the authority to the partnership to choose whether to provide the partner with information to apply section 901(m) using foreign basis, either pursuant to a written partnership agreement (within the meaning of § 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(
h
)) or written notice provided by the partner to the partnership.
(6) If, pursuant to paragraph (g)(3) of this section, a taxpayer chooses to have this section apply to CAAs occurring on or after January 1, 2011, a foreign basis election will be effective if the election is reflected on a timely filed amended federal income tax return (or tax returns, as applicable) filed no later than March 23, 2021.
(7) The foreign basis election is irrevocable. Relief under § 301.9100-1 is not available for the foreign basis election.
(d)
Determination of basis difference in a section 743(b) CAA
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (e) of this section, if there is a section 743(b) CAA, basis difference is the resulting basis adjustment under section 743(b) that is allocated to the RFA under section 755.
(2)
Foreign basis election.
If a foreign basis election is made with respect to a section 743(b) CAA, then, for purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the section 743(b) adjustment is determined by reference to the foreign basis of the RFA, determined immediately after the CAA.
(e)
Determination of basis difference in an RFA with respect to a CAA with respect to which paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section do not apply.
For CAAs occurring on or after January 1, 2011, and before July 21, 2014, other than CAAs occurring before July 21, 2014, resulting from an entity classification election made under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter that is filed on or after July 29, 2014, and that is effective on or before July 21, 2014, basis difference in an RFA with respect to the CAA is the amount of any basis difference (within the meaning of section 901(m)(3)(C)(i)) that had not been taken into account under section 901(m)(3)(B) either as of July 21, 2014, or, in the case of an entity classification election made under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter that is filed on or after July 29, 2014, and that is effective on or before July 21, 2014, before the transactions that are deemed to occur under § 301.7701-3(g) as a result of the change in classification.
(f)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:
(1)
Example 1: Scope of basis choice; identifying separate CAAs, RFA owners (U.S.), and foreign payors in an aggregated CAA transaction
—(i)
Facts.
CFC1 wholly owns CFC2, both of which are applicable foreign corporations, organized in Country F, and treated as corporations for Country F tax purposes. CFC1 also wholly owns DE1, and DE1 wholly owns DE2. DE1 and DE2 are entities organized in Country F treated as corporations for Country F tax purposes and as disregarded entities for U.S. income tax purposes. Country F imposes a single tax that is a foreign income tax. All of the stock of CFC1 is
acquired in a qualified stock purchase (within the meaning of section 338(d)(3)) to which section 338(a) applies for both CFC1 and CFC2. For Country F tax purposes, the transaction is treated as an acquisition of the stock of CFC1.
(ii)
Result.
(A) The acquisition of CFC1 gives rise to four separate CAAs described in § 1.901(m)-2. Under § 1.901(m)-2(b)(1), the acquisition of the stock of CFC1 and the deemed acquisition of the stock of CFC2 under section 338(h)(3)(B) are each a section 338 CAA. Furthermore, because the deemed acquisition of the assets of each of DE1 and DE2 for U.S. income tax purposes is disregarded for Country F tax purposes, the deemed acquisitions are CAAs under § 1.901(m)-2(b)(2). Because the four CAAs occurred pursuant to a plan, under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(3), all of the CAAs are part of an aggregated CAA transaction. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(37), CFC1 is the RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to its assets and the assets of DE1 and DE2 that are RFAs. CFC2 is the RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to its assets that are RFAs. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(28), CFC1, CFC2, DE1, and DE2 are each a foreign payor for Country F tax purposes.
(B) Under paragraph (c) of this section, a foreign basis election may be made by the RFA owner (U.S.). The election is made separately with respect to each CAA (for this purpose, treating all CAAs that are part of an aggregated CAA transaction as a single CAA) and with respect to each foreign income tax and foreign payor. Thus, in this case, CFC1 can make a separate foreign basis election for one or more of the following three groups of RFAs: RFAs that are relevant in determining foreign income of CFC1; RFAs that are relevant in determining foreign income of DE1; and RFAs that are relevant in determining foreign income of DE2. Furthermore, CFC2 can make a foreign basis election for all of its RFAs that are relevant in determining its foreign income.
(2)
Example 2: Scope of basis choice; RFA owner (U.S.) is a partnership
—(i)
Facts.
USPS is a domestic partnership for which a section 754 election is in effect. USPS owns two assets, the stock of DE1 and DE2. DE1 is an entity organized in Country X and treated as a corporation for Country X tax purposes. DE2 is an entity organized in Country Y and treated as a corporation for Country Y tax purposes. DE1 and DE2 are disregarded entities. Country X and Country Y each impose a single tax that is a foreign income tax. US1 and US2, unrelated domestic corporations, and FP, a foreign person unrelated to US1 and US2, acquire partnership interests in USPS from existing partners of USPS pursuant to the same plan.
(ii)
Result.
Under § 1.901(m)-2(b)(3), the acquisitions of the partnership interests in USPS by US1, US2, and FP each give rise to separate section 743(b) CAAs, but under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(3), they are treated as an aggregated CAA transaction because they occur as part of a plan. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(37), USPS is the RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to the assets of DE1 and DE2 that are RFAs. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(28), DE1 is a foreign payor for Country X tax purposes, and DE2 is a foreign payor for Country Y tax purposes. Because the RFA owner (U.S.) is a partnership, paragraph (c)(2) of this section provides that US1, US2, and FP (the relevant partners in USPS) separately choose whether to make a foreign basis election for purposes of determining basis difference. Furthermore, under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the choice to make the election is made separately by each partner with respect to each foreign payor. Thus, in this case, each partner may make separate elections for the RFAs that are relevant in determining foreign income of DE1 for Country X tax purposes and the RFAs that are relevant in determining foreign income of DE2 for Country Y tax purposes.
(g)
Applicability dates.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, this section applies to CAAs occurring on or after March 23, 2020.
(2) Paragraphs (a), (b), and (d)(1) of this section apply to CAAs occurring on or after July 21, 2014, and to CAAs occurring before that date resulting from an entity classification election made under § 301.7701-3 that is filed on or after July 29, 2014, and that is effective on or before July 21, 2014. Paragraph (e) of this section applies to CAAs occurring on or after January 1,
2011, and before July 21, 2014, other than CAAs occurring before July 21, 2014, resulting from an entity classification election made under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter that is filed on or after July 29, 2014, and that is effective on or before July 21, 2014. Taxpayers may, however, consistently apply paragraph (d)(1) of this section to all section 743(b) CAAs occurring on or after January 1, 2011. For this purpose, persons that are related (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)) will be treated as a single taxpayer.
(3) Taxpayers may, however, choose to apply provisions in this section before the date such provisions are applicable pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) or (2) of this section, provided that they (along with any persons that are related (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)) to the taxpayer)—

(ii) File all tax returns described in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section for any taxable year ending on or before March 23, 2020, no later than March 23, 2021; and
(iii) Make appropriate adjustments to take into account deficiencies that would have resulted from the consistent application under paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section for taxable years that are not open for assessment.
[T.D. 9895, 85 FR 16256, Mar. 23, 2020]
§ 1.901(m)-5
Basis difference taken into account.
(a)
In general.
This section provides rules for determining the amount of basis difference with respect to an RFA that is taken into account in a U.S. taxable year for purposes of determining the disqualified portion of a foreign income tax amount. Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules for determining a cost recovery amount and assigning that amount to a U.S. taxable year of a single section 901(m) payor when the RFA owner (U.S.) is the section 901(m) payor. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for determining a disposition amount and assigning that amount to a U.S. taxable year of a single section 901(m) payor when the RFA owner (U.S.) is the section 901(m) payor. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules for allocating cost recovery amounts and disposition amounts when the RFA owner (U.S.) is a fiscally transparent entity for U.S. income tax purposes. Paragraph (e) of this section provides special rules for allocating cost recovery amounts and disposition amounts with respect to certain section 743(b) CAAs. Paragraph (f) of this section provides special rules for allocating certain disposition amounts when a foreign payor is transferred in a mid-year transaction. Paragraph (g) of this section provides special rules for allocating both cost recovery amounts and disposition amounts in certain cases in which the RFA owner (U.S.) either is a reverse hybrid or a fiscally transparent entity for both U.S. and foreign income tax purposes that is directly or indirectly owned by a reverse hybrid. Paragraph (h) of this section provides examples illustrating the application of this section. Paragraph (i) of this section provides the applicability dates.
(b)
Basis difference taken into account under applicable cost recovery method
—(1)
In general.
When the RFA owner (U.S.) is a section 901(m) payor, all of a cost recovery amount is attributed to the section 901(m) payor and assigned to the U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor in which the corresponding U.S. basis deduction is taken into account under the applicable cost recovery method. This is the case regardless of whether the deduction is deferred or disallowed for U.S. income tax purposes. If instead the RFA owner (U.S.) is a fiscally transparent entity for U.S. income tax purposes, a cost recovery amount is allocated to one or more section 901(m)
payors under paragraph (d) of this section, except as provided in paragraphs (e) and (g) of this section. If a cost recovery amount arises from an RFA with respect to a section 743(b) CAA, in certain cases the cost recovery amount is allocated to a section 901(m) payor under paragraph (e) of this section. In certain cases in which the RFA owner (U.S.) either is a reverse hybrid or a fiscally transparent entity for both U.S. and foreign income tax purposes that is directly or indirectly owned by a reverse hybrid, a cost recovery amount is allocated to one or more section 901(m) payors under paragraph (g) of this section.
(2)
Determining a cost recovery amount
—(i)
General rule.
A cost recovery amount for an RFA is determined by applying the applicable cost recovery method to the basis difference rather than to the U.S. basis.
(ii)
U.S. basis subject to multiple cost recovery methods.
If the entire U.S. basis is not subject to the same cost recovery method, the applicable cost recovery method for determining the cost recovery amount is the cost recovery method that applies to the portion of the U.S. basis that corresponds to the basis difference.
(3)
Applicable cost recovery method.
For purposes of section 901(m), an applicable cost recovery method includes any method for recovering the cost of property over time for U.S. income tax purposes (each application of a method giving rise to a
U.S. basis deduction
). Such methods include depreciation, amortization, or depletion, as well as a method that allows the cost (or a portion of the cost) of property to be expensed in the year of acquisition or in the placed-in-service year, such as under section 179. Applicable cost recovery methods do not include any provision allowing the U.S. basis to be recovered upon a disposition of an RFA.
(c)
Basis difference taken into account as a result of a disposition
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, when the RFA owner (U.S.) is a section 901(m) payor, all of a disposition amount is attributed to the section 901(m) payor and assigned to the U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor in which the disposition occurs. If instead the RFA owner (U.S.) is a fiscally transparent entity for U.S. income tax purposes, except as provided in paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section, a disposition amount is allocated to one or more section 901(m) payors under paragraph (d) of this section. If a disposition amount arises from an RFA with respect to a section 743(b) CAA, in certain cases the disposition amount is allocated to a section 901(m) payor under paragraph (e) of this section. If there is a disposition of an RFA in a foreign taxable year of a foreign payor during which there is a mid-year transaction, in certain cases a disposition amount is allocated under paragraph (f) of this section. In certain cases in which the RFA owner (U.S.) either is a reverse hybrid or a fiscally transparent entity for both U.S. and foreign income tax purposes that is directly or indirectly owned by a reverse hybrid, a disposition amount is allocated to one or more section 901(m) payors under paragraph (g) of this section.
(2)
Determining a disposition amount
—(i)
Disposition is fully taxable for purposes of both U.S. income tax and the foreign income tax.
If a disposition of an RFA is fully taxable (that is, results in all gain or loss, if any, being recognized with respect to the RFA) for purposes of both U.S. income tax and the foreign income tax, the disposition amount is equal to the unallocated basis difference with respect to the RFA.
(ii)
Disposition is not fully taxable for purposes of U.S. income tax or the foreign income tax (or both).
If the disposition of an RFA is not fully taxable for purposes of both U.S. income tax and the foreign income tax, the disposition amount is determined under this paragraph (c)(2)(ii). See § 1.901(m)-6 for rules regarding the continued application of section 901(m) if the RFA has any unallocated basis difference after determining the disposition amount under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, as applicable.
(A)
Positive basis difference.
If the disposition of an RFA is not fully taxable for purposes of both U.S. income tax and the foreign income tax, and the RFA has a positive basis difference, the disposition amount equals the lesser of:
(
1
) Any foreign disposition gain plus any U.S. disposition loss (for this purpose, expressed as a positive amount), or
(
2
) Unallocated basis difference with respect to the RFA.
(B)
Negative basis difference.
If the disposition of an RFA is not fully taxable for purposes of both U.S. income tax and the foreign income tax, and the RFA has a negative basis difference, the disposition amount equals the greater of:
(
1
) Any U.S. disposition gain (for this purpose, expressed as a negative amount) plus any foreign disposition loss, or
(
2
) Unallocated basis difference with respect to the RFA.
(iii)
Disposition of an RFA after a section 743(b) CAA.
If an RFA was subject to a section 743(b) CAA and subsequently there is a disposition of the RFA, then, for purposes of determining the disposition amount, foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss are specially defined to mean the amount of gain or loss recognized for purposes of the foreign income tax on the disposition of the RFA that is allocable to the partnership interest that was transferred in the section 743(b) CAA. In addition, U.S. disposition gain or U.S. disposition loss are specially defined to mean the amount of gain or loss recognized for U.S. income tax purposes on the disposition of the RFA that is allocable to the partnership interest that was transferred in the section 743(b) CAA, taking into account the basis adjustment under section 743(b) that was allocated to the RFA under section 755.
(d)
General rules for allocating and assigning a cost recovery amount or a disposition amount when the RFA owner (U.S.) is a fiscally transparent entity
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section, this paragraph (d) provides rules for allocating a cost recovery amount or a disposition amount when the RFA owner (U.S.) is a fiscally transparent entity for U.S. income tax purposes in which a section 901(m) payor directly or indirectly owns an interest, as well as for assigning the allocated amount to a U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor. For purposes of this paragraph (d), unless otherwise indicated, a reference to direct or indirect ownership in an entity means for U.S. income tax purposes. For purposes of this paragraph (d), a person indirectly owns an interest in an entity for U.S. income tax purposes if the person owns the interest through one or more fiscally transparent entities for U.S. income tax purposes, and at least one of the fiscally transparent entities is not a disregarded entity. For purposes of this paragraph (d), a person indirectly owns an interest in an entity for foreign income tax purposes if the person owns the interest through one or more fiscally transparent entities for foreign income tax purposes. If the RFA owner (U.S.) is a lower-tier fiscally transparent entity for U.S. income tax purposes in which the section 901(m) payor indirectly owns an interest, the rules of this section apply in a manner consistent with the application of these rules when the section 901(m) payor directly owns an interest in the RFA owner (U.S.).
(2)
Allocation of a cost recovery amount.
A cost recovery amount is allocated to a section 901(m) payor that directly or indirectly owns an interest in the RFA owner (U.S.) to the extent the U.S. basis deduction that corresponds to the cost recovery amount is (or will be) included in the section 901(m) payor's distributive share of the income of the RFA owner (U.S.) for U.S. income tax purposes.
(3)
Allocation of a disposition amount attributable to foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, a disposition amount attributable to foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss (as determined under paragraph (d)(5) of this section) is allocated under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) or (d)(3)(iii) of this section to a section 901(m) payor that directly or indirectly owns an interest in the RFA owner (U.S.).
(ii)
First allocation rule.
This paragraph (d)(3)(ii) applies when a section 901(m) payor, or a disregarded entity directly owned by a section 901(m) payor, is the foreign payor whose foreign income includes a distributive share of the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign) and, therefore, all of
the foreign income tax amount of the foreign payor is paid or accrued by, or considered paid by, the section 901(m) payor. Thus, this paragraph (d)(3)(ii) applies when the RFA owner (U.S.) is a fiscally transparent entity for both U.S. and foreign income tax purposes and a section 901(m) payor either directly owns an interest in the RFA owner (U.S.) or directly owns an interest in another fiscally transparent entity for U.S. and foreign income tax purposes, which, in turn, directly or indirectly owns an interest in the RFA owner (U.S.) for both U.S. and foreign income tax purposes. In these cases, the section 901(m) payor is allocated the portion of a disposition amount that is equal to the product of the disposition amount attributable to foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss, as applicable, and a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of the foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss recognized by the RFA owner (foreign) for foreign income tax purposes that is (or will be) included in the foreign payor's distributive share of the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign), and the denominator of which is the foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss.
(iii)
Second allocation rule.
This paragraph (d)(3)(iii) applies when neither a section 901(m) payor nor a disregarded entity directly owned by a section 901(m) payor is the foreign payor with respect to the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign). Instead, a section 901(m) payor directly or indirectly owns an interest in the foreign payor, which is a fiscally transparent entity for U.S. income tax purposes (other than a disregarded entity directly owned by the section 901(m) payor), and, therefore, the section 901(m) payor is considered to pay or accrue only its allocated portion of the foreign income tax amount of the foreign payor. This will be the case when the foreign payor is either the RFA owner (U.S.), another fiscally transparent entity for U.S. income tax purposes (other than a disregarded entity directly owned by a section 901(m) payor) that directly or indirectly owns an interest in the RFA owner (U.S.) for both U.S. and foreign income tax purposes, or a disregarded entity directly owned by the RFA owner (U.S.). In these cases, the section 901(m) payor is allocated the portion of a disposition amount that is equal to the product of the disposition amount attributable to foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss, as applicable, and a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of the foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss that is included in the allocable foreign income of the section 901(m) payor, and the denominator of which is the foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss. If allocable foreign income is not otherwise required to be determined because there is no foreign income tax amount, the numerator is the portion of the foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss that would be included in the allocable foreign income of the section 901(m) payor if there were a foreign income tax amount.
(4)
Allocation of a disposition amount attributable to U.S. disposition gain or U.S. disposition loss.
A section 901(m) payor that directly or indirectly owns an interest in the RFA owner (U.S.) is allocated the portion of a disposition amount that is equal to the product of the disposition amount attributable to U.S. disposition gain or U.S. disposition loss (as determined under paragraph (d)(5) of this section), as applicable, and a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of the U.S. disposition gain or U.S. disposition loss that is (or will be) included in the section 901(m) payor's distributive share of income of the RFA owner (U.S.) for U.S. income tax purposes, and the denominator of which is the U.S. disposition gain or U.S. disposition loss.
(5)
Determining the extent to which a disposition amount is attributable to foreign or U.S. disposition gain or loss
—(i)
RFA with a positive basis difference.
When there is a disposition of an RFA with a positive basis difference and the disposition results in either a foreign disposition gain or a U.S. disposition loss, but not both, the entire disposition amount is attributable to foreign disposition gain or U.S. disposition loss, as applicable, even if the disposition amount exceeds the foreign disposition gain or the absolute value of
the U.S. disposition loss. If the disposition results in both a foreign disposition gain and a U.S. disposition loss, the disposition amount is attributable first to foreign disposition gain to the extent thereof, and the excess disposition amount, if any, is attributable to the U.S. disposition loss, even if the excess disposition amount exceeds the absolute value of the U.S. disposition loss.
(ii)
RFA with a negative basis difference.
When there is a disposition of an RFA with a negative basis difference and the disposition results in either a foreign disposition loss or a U.S. disposition gain, but not both, the entire disposition amount is attributable to foreign disposition loss or U.S. disposition gain, as applicable, even if the absolute value of the disposition amount exceeds the absolute value of the foreign disposition loss or the U.S. disposition gain. If the disposition results in both a foreign disposition loss and a U.S. disposition gain, the disposition amount is attributable first to foreign disposition loss to the extent thereof, and the excess disposition amount, if any, is attributable to the U.S. disposition gain, even if the absolute value of the excess disposition amount exceeds the U.S. disposition gain.
(6)
U.S. taxable year of a section 901(m) payor to which an allocated cost recovery amount or disposition amount is assigned.
A cost recovery amount or a disposition amount allocated to a section 901(m) payor under paragraph (d) of this section is assigned to the U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor that includes the last day of the U.S. taxable year of the RFA owner (U.S.) in which, in the case of a cost recovery amount, the RFA owner (U.S.) takes into account the corresponding U.S. basis deduction (without regard to whether the deduction is deferred or disallowed for U.S. income tax purposes), or in the case of a disposition amount, the disposition occurs.
(e)
Special rules for certain section 743(b) CAAs.
If a section 901(m) payor acquires a partnership interest in a section 743(b) CAA, including a section 743(b) CAA with respect to a lower-tier partnership that results from a direct acquisition by the section 901(m) payor of an interest in an upper-tier partnership, and subsequently there is a cost recovery amount or a disposition amount that arises from an RFA with respect to that section 743(b) CAA, all of the cost recovery amount or the disposition amount is allocated to that section 901(m) payor. The U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor to which the cost recovery amount or the disposition amount is assigned is the U.S. taxable year in which, in the case of a cost recovery amount, the section 901(m) payor takes into account the corresponding U.S. basis deduction (without regard to whether the deduction is deferred or disallowed for U.S. income tax purposes), or in the case of a disposition amount, the disposition occurs.
(f)
Mid-year transactions
—(1)
In general.
When a disposition of an RFA occurs in the same foreign taxable year that a foreign payor is involved in a mid-year transaction, the portion of the disposition amount that is attributable to foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss (as determined under paragraph (d)(5) of this section) is allocated to a section 901(m) payor and assigned to a U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor under this paragraph (f). To the extent the disposition amount is attributable to U.S. disposition gain or U.S. disposition loss (as determined under paragraph (d)(5) of this section), see paragraph (c)(1) or (d) of this section, as applicable.
(2)
Allocation rule.
To the extent a disposition amount is attributable to foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss, a section 901(m) payor is allocated the portion of the disposition amount equal to the product of the disposition amount attributable to foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss, as applicable, and a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of the foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss that is included in the allocable foreign income of the section 901(m) payor, and the denominator of which is the foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss. If allocable foreign income is not otherwise required to be determined because there is no foreign income tax amount, the numerator is the portion of the foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition
loss that would be included in the allocable foreign income of the section 901(m) payor if there were a foreign income tax amount.
(3)
Assignment to a U.S. taxable year of a section 901(m) payor.
A disposition amount allocated to a section 901(m) payor under paragraph (f)(2) of this section is assigned to the U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor in which the foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss (or portion thereof) is included in allocable foreign income of the section 901(m) payor or, if allocable foreign income is not otherwise required to be determined because there is no foreign income tax amount, the U.S. taxable year in which the foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss would be included in allocable foreign income if there were a foreign income tax amount.
(g)
Reverse hybrids
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (g) provides rules for allocating a cost recovery amount or a disposition amount when the RFA owner (U.S.) is either a reverse hybrid or a fiscally transparent entity for U.S. and foreign income tax purposes that is directly or indirectly owned by a reverse hybrid for U.S. and foreign income tax purposes, and in each case, the foreign payor whose foreign income includes a distributive share of the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign) directly or indirectly owns an interest in the reverse hybrid for foreign income tax purposes. Application of the allocation rules under paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section depend upon whether a section 901(m) payor or a disregarded entity directly owned by a section 901(m) payor is the foreign payor, or, instead, a section 901(m) payor directly or indirectly owns an interest in the foreign payor. For purposes of this paragraph (g), unless otherwise indicated, a reference to direct or indirect ownership in an entity means for U.S. income tax purposes. For purposes of this paragraph (g), a person indirectly owns an interest in an entity for U.S. income tax purposes if the person owns the interest through one or more fiscally transparent entities for U.S. income tax purposes, and at least one of the fiscally transparent entities is not a disregarded entity. For purposes of this paragraph (g), a person indirectly owns an interest in an entity for foreign income tax purposes if the person owns the interest through one or more fiscally transparent entities for foreign income tax purposes. If the RFA owner (U.S.) is a lower-tier fiscally transparent entity for U.S. income tax purposes in which the reverse hybrid indirectly owns an interest, the rules of this section apply in a manner consistent with the application of these rules when the reverse hybrid directly owns an interest in the RFA owner (U.S.).
(2)
First allocation rule
—(i)
Allocation to a section 901(m) payor.
This paragraph (g)(2)(i) applies when a section 901(m) payor, or a disregarded entity directly owned by a section 901(m) payor, is the foreign payor whose foreign income includes a distributive share of the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign), and, therefore, all of the foreign income tax amount of the foreign payor is paid or accrued by, or considered paid or accrued by, the section 901(m) payor. Thus, this paragraph (g)(2)(i) applies when a section 901(m) payor either directly owns an interest in the reverse hybrid or directly owns an interest in a fiscally transparent entity for U.S. and foreign income tax purposes, which, in turn, directly or indirectly owns an interest in the reverse hybrid for both U.S. and foreign income tax purposes. In these cases, the section 901(m) payor is allocated the portions of cost recovery amounts or disposition amounts (or both) with respect to RFAs that are equal to the product of the sum of the cost recovery amounts and the disposition amounts and a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign) that is included in the foreign income of the foreign payor, and the denominator of which is the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign).
(ii)
Assignment to a U.S. taxable year of a section 901(m) payor.
This paragraph (g)(2)(ii) applies when a cost recovery amount or a disposition amount, or portion thereof, is allocated to a section 901(m) payor under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section. If the reverse hybrid is the RFA owner (U.S.), a cost recovery amount or disposition amount, or portion thereof, is assigned
to the U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor that includes the last day of the U.S. taxable year of the reverse hybrid in which, in the case of a cost recovery amount, the reverse hybrid takes into account the corresponding U.S. basis deduction (without regard to whether the deduction is deferred or disallowed for U.S. income tax purposes), or, in the case of a disposition amount, the disposition occurs. If the reverse hybrid is not the RFA owner (U.S.) but instead the reverse hybrid directly or indirectly owns an interest in the RFA owner (U.S.) for both U.S. and foreign income tax purposes, a cost recovery amount or disposition amount, or portion thereof, is assigned to the U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor that includes the last day of the U.S. taxable year of the reverse hybrid, which, in turn, includes the last day of the U.S. taxable year of the RFA owner (U.S.) in which, in the case of a cost recovery amount, the RFA owner (U.S.) takes into account the corresponding U.S. basis deduction (without regard to whether the deduction is deferred or disallowed for U.S. income tax purposes), or, in the case of a disposition amount, the disposition occurs.
(3)
Second allocation rule
—(i)
Allocation to a section 901(m) payor.
This paragraph (g)(3)(i) applies when neither a section 901(m) payor nor a disregarded entity directly owned by a section 901(m) payor is the foreign payor with respect to the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign). Instead, a section 901(m) payor directly or indirectly owns an interest in the foreign payor, which is a fiscally transparent entity for U.S. income tax purposes (other than a disregarded entity directly owned by the section 901(m) payor), and, therefore, the section 901(m) payor is considered to pay or accrue only its allocated portion of the foreign income tax amount of the foreign payor. In these cases, the section 901(m) payor is allocated the portions of cost recovery amounts or disposition amounts (or both) with respect to RFAs that are equal to the product of the sum of the cost recovery amounts and the disposition amounts and a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign) that is included in the foreign income of the foreign payor and included in the allocable foreign income of the section 901(m) payor, and the denominator of which is the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign). If allocable foreign income is not otherwise required to be determined for a section 901(m) payor because there is no foreign income tax amount, the numerator is the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign) that is included in the foreign income of the foreign payor and that would be included in allocable foreign income of the section 901(m) payor if there were a foreign income tax amount.
(ii)
Assignment to a U.S. taxable year of a section 901(m) payor.
A cost recovery amount or a disposition amount, or portion thereof, that is allocated to a section 901(m) payor under paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section is assigned to the U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor in which the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign) described in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section is included in the allocable foreign income of the section 901(m) payor, or, if there is no foreign income tax amount, the U.S. taxable year of the section 901(m) payor in which the foreign income of the RFA owner (foreign) described in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section would be included in allocable foreign income if there were a foreign income tax amount.
(h)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section. In addition to any facts described in a particular example, the following facts apply to all the examples unless otherwise specified: CFC1, CFC2, and DE are organized in Country F and treated as corporations for Country F tax purposes. CFC1 and CFC2 are each an applicable foreign corporation that is wholly owned by the same U.S. corporation, and DE is a disregarded entity. CFC1 and CFC2 each have a U.S. taxable year that is a calendar year, and CFC1, CFC2, and DE each have a foreign taxable year that is a calendar year. Country F imposes a single tax that is a foreign income tax. CFC1, CFC2, and DE each have a functional currency of the u with respect to all activities. At all relevant times, 1u equals $1. All amounts are stated in
millions. The examples assume that the applicable cost recovery method for property results in basis being recovered ratably over the life of the property beginning on the first day of the U.S. taxable year in which the property is acquired or placed into service.
(1)
Example 1: CAA followed by disposition: Fully taxable for both U.S. income tax and foreign income tax purposes
—(i)
Facts.
(A) On January 1, Year 1, USP acquires all of the stock of CFC1 in a qualified stock purchase (as defined in section 338(d)(3)) to which section 338(a) applies (Section 338 Acquisition). At the time of the Section 338 Acquisition, CFC1 owns a single asset (Asset A) that is located in Country F. Asset A gives rise to income that is taken into account for Country F tax purposes. Asset A is tangible personal property that, under the applicable cost recovery method in the hands of CFC1, is depreciable over 5 years. There are no cost recovery deductions available for Country F tax purposes with respect to Asset A. Immediately before the Section 338 Acquisition, Asset A has a U.S. basis of 10u and a foreign basis of 40u. Immediately after the Section 338 Acquisition, Asset A has a U.S. basis of 100u and foreign basis of 40u.
(B) On July 1, Year 2, Asset A is transferred to an unrelated thirdparty in exchange for 120u in a transaction in which all realized gainis recognized for both U.S. income tax and Country F tax purposes(subsequent transaction). For U.S. income tax purposes, CFC1recognizes U.S. disposition gain of 50u (amount realized of 120u, lessU.S. basis of 70u (100u cost basis, less 30u of accumulateddepreciation)) with respect to Asset A. The 30u of accumulateddepreciation is the sum of 20u of depreciation in Year 1 (100u costbasis/5 years) and 10u of depreciation in Year 2 ((100u cost basis/5years) × 6/12). For Country F tax purposes, CFC1 recognizes foreigndisposition gain of 80u (amount realized of 120u, less foreign basisof 40u) with respect to Asset A. Immediately after the subsequenttransaction, Asset A has a U.S. basis and a foreign basis of 120u.
(ii)
Result.
(A) Under § 1.901(m)-2(b)(1), USP's acquisition of the stock of CFC1 in the Section 338 Acquisition is a section 338 CAA. Under § 1.901(m)-2(c)(i), Asset A is an RFA with respect to Country F tax because it is relevant in determining the foreign income of CFC1 for Country F tax purposes. Under § 1.901(m)-4(b), the basis difference with respect to Asset A is 90u (100u−10u). Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(37), CFC1 is the RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to Asset A. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(28), CFC1 is a foreign payor for Country F tax purposes. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(41), CFC1 is the section 901(m) payor with respect to a foreign income tax amount for which CFC1 is the foreign payor (see § 1.901-2(f)(1)).
(B) Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(5), allocated basis differences are the sum of cost recovery amounts and disposition amounts. In Year 1, Asset A has an allocated basis difference that includes only a cost recovery amount. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the cost recovery amount for Year 1 is determined by applying the applicable cost recovery method of Asset A in the hands of CFC1 to the basis difference with respect to Asset A. Accordingly, the cost recovery amount is 18u (90u basis difference/5 years). Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, all of the 18u cost recovery amount is attributed to CFC1 and assigned to Year 1, because CFC1 is a section 901(m) payor and RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to Asset A and Year 1 is the U.S. taxable year of CFC1 in which it takes into account the corresponding 20u of depreciation. Immediately after Year 1, under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(47), unallocated basis difference is 72u with respect to Asset A (90u−18u).
(C) In Year 2, Asset A has an allocated basis difference that includes both a cost recovery amount and a disposition amount. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the cost recovery amount for Year 2, as of the date of the subsequent transaction, is 9u ((90u basis difference/5 years) × 6/12). Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(15), the subsequent transaction is a disposition of Asset A, because the subsequent transaction is an event that results in an amount of gain being recognized for U.S. income tax and Country F tax purposes. Because all realized gain in Asset A is recognized for U.S. income tax and Country F tax purposes, the rule in
paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section applies to determine the disposition amount. Under that rule, the disposition amount for Year 2 is the unallocated basis difference of 63u (90u basis difference, less total 27u taken into account as cost recovery amounts in Year 1 and Year 2). Accordingly, the allocated basis difference for Year 2 is 72u (9u of cost recovery amount, plus 63u of disposition amount). Under paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1) of this section, all of the 72u of allocated basis difference is attributed to CFC1 and assigned to Year 2, because CFC1 is a section 901(m) payor and the RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to Asset A and Year 2 is the U.S. taxable year of CFC1 in which it takes into account the corresponding 10u of depreciation and in which the disposition occurred.
(D) Unallocated basis difference with respect to Asset A, as determined immediately after the subsequent transaction, is 0u (90u basis difference less 90u basis difference taken into account as 27u total cost recovery amount in Year 1 and Year 2 and as a 63u disposition amount in Year 2). Accordingly, because there is no unallocated basis difference with respect to Asset A attributable to the Section 338 Acquisition, the subsequent transaction is not a successor transaction as defined in § 1.901(m)-6(b)(2). Furthermore, the subsequent transaction is not a CAA under § 1.901(m)-2(b). For these reasons, section 901(m) no longer applies to Asset A.
(2)
Example 2: CAA followed by disposition: nontaxable for U.S. income tax purposes and taxable for foreign income tax purposes
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(1)(i)(A) of this section (paragraph (i)(A) of
Example 1
) but the facts in paragraph (h)(1)(i)(B) of this section (paragraph (i)(B) of
Example 1
) are instead that on July 1, Year 2, Asset A is transferred to CFC2, in exchange for 100u of stock of CFC2 (subsequent transaction). For U.S. income tax purposes, CFC1 does not recognize any U.S. disposition gain or U.S. disposition loss with respect to Asset A. For Country F tax purposes, CFC1 recognizes foreign disposition gain of 60u (amount realized of 100u, less foreign basis of 40u) with respect to Asset A. Immediately after the subsequent transaction, Asset A has a U.S. basis of 70u (100u cost basis less 30u accumulated depreciation) and a foreign basis of 100u. The 30u of accumulated depreciation is the sum of 20u of depreciation in Year 1 (100u cost basis/5 years) and 10u in Year 2 ((100u cost basis/5 years) × 6/12).
(ii)
Result.
(A) The results described in paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(A) of this section (paragraph (ii)(A) of
Example 1)
also apply to this paragraph (h)(2)(ii) (the results of this
Example 2
).
(B) The result for Year 1 is the same as in paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(B) of this section (paragraph (ii)(B) of
Example 1
).
(C) In Year 2, Asset A has an allocated basis difference that includes both a cost recovery amount and a disposition amount. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the cost recovery amount for Year 2, as of the date of the subsequent transaction, is 9u ((90u basis difference/5 years) × 6/12). Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(15), the subsequent transaction is a disposition of Asset A, because the subsequent transaction is an event that results in an amount of gain being recognized for Country F tax purposes. Because the disposition is not also fully taxable for U.S. income tax purposes, the rule in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section applies to determine the disposition amount. Under that rule, the disposition amount is 60u, the lesser of (i) 60u (60u foreign disposition gain plus absolute value of 0u U.S. disposition loss), and (ii) 63u unallocated basis difference (90 basis difference less total 27u taken into account as cost recovery amounts, 18u in Year 1 and 9u in Year 2). Accordingly, the allocated basis difference for the first half of Year 2 is 69u (9u of cost recovery amount, plus 60u of disposition amount). Under paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1) of this section, all of the 69u of allocated basis difference is attributed to CFC1 and assigned to Year 2, because CFC1 is a section 901(m) payor and the RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to Asset A and Year 2 is the U.S. taxable year of CFC1 in which it takes into account the corresponding 10u of depreciation and in which the disposition occurred.
(D) Unallocated basis difference with respect to Asset A immediately after the subsequent transaction is 3u (90u
basis difference less 87u basis difference taken into account as a 27u total cost recovery amount in Year 1 and Year 2 and as a 60u disposition amount in Year 2). Accordingly, because there is unallocated basis difference of 3u with respect to Asset A attributable to the Section 338 Acquisition, as determined immediately after the subsequent transaction, the subsequent transaction is a successor transaction as defined in § 1.901(m)-6(b)(2). Following the subsequent transaction, the unallocated basis difference of 3u must be taken into account as cost recovery amounts or disposition amounts (or both) by CFC2, the new section 901(m) payor and RFA owner (U.S.) of Asset A. See § 1.901(m)-6(b)(3)(ii). Because the subsequent transaction is not a CAA under § 1.901(m)-2(b), there is no additional basis difference with respect to Asset A as a result of the subsequent transaction.
(3) Example 3: CAA followed by disposition: nontaxable for both U.S. income tax and foreign income tax purposes
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(1)(i)(A) of this section (paragraph (i)(A) of
Example 1
) but the facts in paragraph (h)(1)(i)(B) of this section (paragraph (i)(B) of
Example 1
) are instead that on July 1, Year 2, CFC1 transfers Asset A to CFC2, in exchange for 110u of stock of CFC2 (subsequent transaction). For U.S. income tax purposes, CFC1 does not recognize any U.S. disposition gain or U.S. disposition loss with respect to Asset A as a result of the subsequent transaction. Furthermore, for Country F tax purposes, CFC1 recognizes no foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss with respect to Asset A as a result of the subsequent transaction. Immediately after the subsequent transaction, Asset A has a U.S. basis of 70u (100u cost basis less 30u accumulated depreciation) and a foreign basis of 40u. The 30u of accumulated depreciation is the sum of 20u of depreciation in Year 1 (100u cost basis/5 years) and 10u in Year 2 ((100u cost basis/5 years) × 6/12).
(ii)
Result.
(A) The result for Year 1 is the same as in paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(A) of this section (paragraph (ii)(A) of
Example 1
).
(B) The result for Year 1 is the same as in paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(B) of this section (paragraph (ii)(B) of
Example 1
).
(C) In Year 2, Asset A has an allocated basis difference that includes only a cost recovery amount. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the cost recovery amount for Year 2, as of the date of the subsequent transaction, is 9u ((90u basis difference/5 years) x 6/12). Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(15), the subsequent transaction does not constitute a disposition of Asset A, because the subsequent transaction is not an event that results in an amount of gain or loss being recognized for U.S. income tax or for Country F tax purposes. Therefore, no disposition amount is taken into account for Asset A in Year 2. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, all of the 9u of allocated basis difference is attributed to CFC1 and assigned to Year 2, because CFC1 is a section 901(m) payor and RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to Asset A and Year 2 is the U.S. taxable year of CFC1 in which it takes into account the corresponding 10u of depreciation.
(D) Unallocated basis difference with respect to Asset A immediately after the subsequent transaction is 63u (90u basis difference, less 27u total cost recovery amounts, 18u in Year 1 and 9u in Year 2). Accordingly, because there is unallocated basis difference of 63u with respect to Asset A attributable to the CAA, as determined immediately after the subsequent transaction, the subsequent transaction is a successor transaction as defined in § 1.901(m)-6(b)(2). Following the subsequent transaction, the unallocated basis difference of 63u must be taken into account as cost recovery amounts or disposition amounts (or both) by CFC2, the new section 901(m) payor and RFA owner (U.S.) of Asset A. See § 1.901(m)-6(b)(3)(ii). Because the subsequent transaction is not a CAA under § 1.901(m)-2(b), there is no additional basis difference with respect to Asset A as a result of the subsequent transaction.

Applicability dates.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, this section applies to CAAs occurring on or after March 23, 2020.

§ 1.901(m)-6
Successor rules.
(a)
In general.
This section provides successor rules applicable to section 901(m). Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules for the continued application of section 901(m) after an RFA that has unallocated basis difference has been transferred, including special rules applicable to successor transactions that are also CAAs or that involve partnerships. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for determining when an aggregate basis difference carryover of a section 901(m) payor either becomes an aggregate basis difference carryover of the section 901(m) payor with respect to another foreign payor or is transferred to another section 901(m) payor, and paragraph (d) of this section provides applicability dates.
(b)
Successor rules for unallocated basis difference
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, section 901(m) continues to apply after a successor transaction to any unallocated basis difference attached to a transferred RFA until the entire basis difference has been taken into account as a cost recovery amount or a disposition amount (or both) under § 1.901(m)-5.
(2)
Definition of a successor transaction.
A successor transaction occurs with respect to an RFA if, after a CAA (
prior CAA
), there is a transfer of the RFA for U.S. income tax purposes and the RFA has unallocated basis difference with respect to the prior CAA, determined immediately after the transfer. A successor transaction may occur regardless of whether the transfer of the RFA is a disposition, a CAA, or a non-taxable transaction for purposes of U.S. income tax. If the RFA was subject to multiple prior CAAs, a separate determination must be made with respect to each prior CAA as to whether the transfer is a successor transaction.
(3)
Special considerations.
(i) If an asset is an RFA with respect to more than one foreign income tax, this paragraph (b) applies separately with respect to each foreign income tax.
(ii) Any subsequent cost recovery amount for an RFA transferred in a successor transaction is determined based on the post-transaction applicable cost recovery method, as described in § 1.901(m)-5(b)(3), that applies to the
U.S. basis (or portion thereof) that corresponds to the unallocated basis difference.
(4)
Successor transaction is a CAA
—(i)
In general.
An asset may be an RFA with respect to multiple CAAs if a successor transaction is also a CAA (
subsequent CAA
). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(4), if there is a subsequent CAA, unallocated basis difference with respect to any prior CAAs will continue to be taken into account under section 901(m) after the subsequent CAA. Furthermore, the subsequent CAA may give rise to additional basis difference subject to section 901(m).
(ii)
Foreign basis election.
If a foreign basis election is made under § 1.901(m)-4(c) with respect to a foreign income tax in a subsequent CAA, any unallocated basis difference with respect to one or more prior CAAs will not be taken into account under section 901(m). The only basis difference that will be taken into account after the subsequent CAA with respect to that foreign income tax is the basis difference with respect to the subsequent CAA.
(iii)
Multiple section 743(b) CAAs.
If an RFA is subject to two section 743(b) CAAs (
prior section 743(b) CAA
and
subsequent section 743(b) CAA
) and the same partnership interest is acquired in both the CAAs, the RFA will be treated as having no unallocated basis difference with respect to the prior section 743(b) CAA if the basis difference for the section 743(b) CAA is determined independently from the prior section 743(b) CAA. In this regard, see generally § 1.743-1(f). If the subsequent section 743(b) CAA results from the acquisition of only a portion of the partnership interest acquired in the prior section 743(b) CAA, then the transferor will be required to equitably apportion the unallocated basis difference attributable to the prior section 743(b) CAA between the portion retained by the transferor and the portion transferred. In this case, with respect to the portion transferred, the RFAs will be treated as having no unallocated basis difference with respect to the prior section 743(b) CAA if basis difference for the subsequent section 743(b) CAA is determined independently from the prior section 743(b) CAA.
(5)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of paragraph (b) of this section.
(i)
Facts.
USP, a domestic corporation, wholly owns CFC, a foreign corporation organized in Country A and treated as a corporation for both U.S. and Country A tax purposes. FT is an unrelated foreign corporation organized in Country A and treated as a corporation for both U.S. and Country A tax purposes. FT owns one asset, a parcel of land (Asset). Country A imposes a single tax that is a foreign income tax. On January 1, Year 1, CFC acquires all of the stock of FT in exchange for 300u in a qualified stock purchase (as defined in section 338(d)(3)) to which section 338(a) applies (Acquisition). Immediately before the Acquisition, Asset had a U.S. basis of 100u, and immediately after the Acquisition, Asset had a U.S. basis of 300u. Effective on February 1, Year 1, FT elects to be a disregarded entity pursuant to § 301.7701-3. As a result of the election, FT is deemed, for U.S. income tax purposes, to distribute Asset to CFC in liquidation (Deemed Liquidation) immediately before the closing of the day before the election is effective pursuant to § 301.7701-3(g)(1)(iii) and (3)(ii). The Deemed Liquidation is disregarded for Country A tax purposes. No gain or loss is recognized on the Deemed Liquidation for either U.S. or Country A tax purposes.
(ii)
Result.
Under § 1.901(m)-2(b)(1), the acquisition by CFC of the stock of FT is a section 338 CAA. Under § 1.901(m)-2(c)(1), Asset is an RFA with respect to Country A tax and the Acquisition, because immediately after the Acquisition, Asset is relevant in determining foreign income of FT for Country A tax purposes, and FT owned Asset when the Acquisition occurred. Under § 1.901(m)-4(b), the basis difference with respect to Asset is 200u (300u—100u). Under § 1.901(m)-2(b)(2), the Deemed Liquidation is a CAA (subsequent CAA) because the Deemed Liquidation is treated as an acquisition of assets for U.S. income tax purposes and is disregarded for Country A tax purposes. Because the U.S. basis in Asset is 300u immediately before and after
the Deemed Liquidation, the subsequent CAA does not give rise to any additional basis difference. The Deemed Liquidation is not a disposition under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(15) because it did not result in gain or loss being recognized with respect to Asset for U.S. or Country A tax purposes. Accordingly, no basis difference with respect to Asset is taken into account under § 1.901(m)-5 as a result of the Deemed Liquidation, and the unallocated basis difference with respect to Asset immediately after the Deemed Liquidation is 200u (200u—0u). Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Deemed Liquidation is a successor transaction because there is a transfer of Asset for U.S. income tax purposes from FT to CFC and Asset has unallocated basis difference with respect to the Acquisition immediately after the Deemed Liquidation. Accordingly, under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, section 901(m) will continue to apply to the unallocated basis difference with respect to Asset until the entire 200u basis difference has been taken into account under § 1.901(m)-5.
(c)
Successor rules for aggregate basis difference carryover
—(1)
Transfers of a section 901(m) payor's aggregate basis difference carryover to another person.
If a corporation acquires the assets of a section 901(m) payor in a transaction to which section 381 applies, that corporation succeeds to any aggregate basis difference carryovers of the section 901(m) payor.
(2)
Transfers of a section 901(m) payor's aggregate basis difference carryover with respect to a foreign payor to another foreign payor.
If a section 901(m) payor has an aggregate basis difference carryover, with respect to a foreign income tax and a foreign payor, and substantially all of the assets of the foreign payor are transferred to another foreign payor in which the section 901(m) payor owns an interest, the section 901(m) payor's aggregate basis difference carryover with respect to the first foreign payor is transferred to the section 901(m) payor's aggregate basis difference carryover with respect to the other foreign payor. In such a case, the section 901(m) payor's aggregate basis difference carryover with respect to the first foreign payor is reduced to zero.
(3)
Anti-abuse rule.
If a section 901(m) payor has an aggregate basis difference carryover with respect to a foreign income tax and a foreign payor and, with a principal purpose of avoiding the application of section 901(m), assets of the foreign payor are transferred to another foreign payor in a transaction not described in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section, then a portion of the aggregate basis difference carryover of the section 901(m) payor is transferred either to the aggregate basis difference carryover of the section 901(m) payor with respect to the other foreign payor or to another section 901(m) payor, as appropriate. The portion of the aggregate basis difference carryover transferred is determined based on the ratio of fair market value of the assets transferred to the fair market value of all of the assets of the foreign payor that transferred the assets. Similar principles apply when, with a principal purpose of avoiding the application of section 901(m), there is a change in the allocation of foreign income for foreign income tax purposes or the allocation of foreign income tax amounts for U.S. income tax purposes that would otherwise separate foreign income tax amounts from the related aggregate basis difference carryover.
(4)
Ownership.
For purposes of this paragraph (c), a section 901(m) payor owns an interest in a foreign payor if the section 901(m) payor owns the interest directly or indirectly through one or more fiscally transparent entities for U.S. income tax purposes.
(d)
Applicability dates.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, this section applies to CAAs occurring on or after March 23, 2020.
(2) Paragraphs (a), (b)(1) and (2), (b)(4)(i) and (iii), and (b)(5) of this section apply to CAAs occurring on or after July 21, 2014, and to CAAs occurring before that date resulting from an entity classification election made under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter that is filed on or after July 29, 2014, and that is effective on or before July 21, 2014. Paragraphs (a), (b)(1) and (2), (b)(4)(i) and (iii), and (b)(5) of this section also apply to CAAs occurring on or after January 1, 2011, and before July 21, 2014, other than CAAs occurring before July 21, 2014, resulting from an entity
classification election made under § 301.7701-3 that is filed on or after July 29, 2014, and that is effective on or before July 21, 2014, but only with respect to basis difference determined under § 1.901(m)-4T(e) with respect to the CAA.
(3) Taxpayers may, however, choose to apply provisions in this section before the date such provisions are applicable pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, provided that they (along with any persons that are related (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)) to the taxpayer)—
(i) Consistently apply this section, § 1.704-1(b)(4)(viii)(

), § 1.901(m)-1, §§ 1.901(m)-3 through 1.901(m)-5 (excluding § 1.901(m)-4(e)), § 1.901(m)-7, and § 1.901(m)-8 to all CAAs occurring on or after January 1, 2011, and consistently apply § 1.901(m)-2 (excluding § 1.901(m)-2(d)) to all CAAs occurring on or after December 7, 2016, on any original or amended tax return for each taxable year for which the application of the provisions listed in this paragraph (d)(3)(i) affects the tax liability and for which the statute of limitations does not preclude assessment or the filing of a claim for refund, as applicable;
(ii) File all tax returns described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section for any taxable year ending on or before March 23, 2020, no later than March 23, 2021; and
(iii) Make appropriate adjustments to take into account deficiencies that would have resulted from the consistent application under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section for taxable years that are not open for assessment.

§ 1.901(m)-7
De minimis rules.
(a)
In general.
This section provides rules describing basis difference that is not taken into account under section 901(m) because a CAA results in a de minimis amount of basis difference. Paragraph (b) of this section sets forth the general rule for determining whether the de minimis threshold is met. Paragraph (c) of this section modifies the general rule in the case of CAAs that are part of an aggregated CAA transaction. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules for applying this section, and paragraph (e) of this section provides an anti-abuse rule applicable to related persons. Paragraph (f) of this section provides examples that illustrate the application of this section. Paragraph (g) of this section provides applicability dates.
(b)
General rule
—(1)
In general.
A basis difference with respect to an RFA and a foreign income tax is not taken into account under section 901(m) if the requirements under the cumulative basis difference exemption, the RFA class exemption, or the RFA exemption are satisfied.
(2)
Cumulative basis difference exemption.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a basis difference, with respect to an RFA and a foreign income tax, is not taken into account under section 901(m) (
cumulative basis difference exemption
) if the sum of that basis difference and all other basis differences (including negative basis differences), with respect to a single CAA and a single RFA owner (U.S.), is less than the greater of:
(i) $10 million, or
(ii) 10 percent of the total U.S. basis of all the RFAs immediately after the CAA.
(3)
RFA class exemption
—(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a basis difference, with respect to an RFA and a foreign income tax, is not taken into account under section 901(m) (
RFA class exemption
) if the RFA is part of a class of RFAs and the absolute value of the sum of the basis differences (including negative basis differences), with respect to a single CAA and a single RFA owner, for all the RFAs in that class is less than the greater of:
(A) $2 million, or
(B) 10 percent of the total U.S. basis of all the RFAs in that class of RFAs immediately after the CAA.
(ii) For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), the classes of RFAs are the seven asset classes defined in § 1.338-6(b), regardless of whether the CAA is a section 338 CAA.
(4)
RFA exemption.
A basis difference, with respect to an RFA and a foreign income tax, is not taken into account under section 901(m) (
RFA exemption
) if
the absolute value of the basis difference with respect to the RFA is less than $20,000.
(c)
Special rule if a CAA is part of an aggregated CAA transaction.
If a CAA is part of an aggregated CAA transaction and a single RFA owner (U.S.) does not own all the RFAs attributable to the CAAs that are part of the aggregated CAA transaction, the cumulative basis difference exemption and the RFA class exemption apply to such CAA only if, in addition to satisfying the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, respectively, determined without regard to this paragraph (c), the cumulative basis difference exemption or the RFA class exemption, as modified by this paragraph (c), is satisfied. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (c), the cumulative basis difference exemption and the RFA class exemption are applied taking into account all the basis differences with respect to all the RFAs owned by all the RFA owners (U.S.) that are attributable to the CAAs that are part of the aggregated CAA transaction.
(d)
Rules of application.
The following rules apply for purposes of this section.
(1) Whether a basis difference qualifies for the cumulative basis difference exemption, the RFA class exemption, or the RFA exemption is determined when an asset first becomes an RFA with respect to a CAA. In the case of a subsequent CAA described in § 1.901(m)-6(b)(4), the application of the cumulative basis difference exemption, the RFA class exemption, and the RFA exemption is based on basis difference, if any, that results from the subsequent CAA.
(2) If there is an aggregated CAA transaction, the cumulative basis difference exemption and each RFA class exemption are applied by treating all CAAs that are part of the aggregated CAA transaction as a single CAA.
(3) Basis difference is computed in accordance with § 1.901(m)-4 except that a foreign basis election need not be evidenced if the cumulative basis difference exemption, an RFA class exemption, or the RFA exemption apply to all RFAs with respect to the CAA.
(4) Basis difference is translated into U.S. dollars (if necessary) using the spot rate determined under the principles of § 1.988-1(d) on the date of the CAA.
(e)
Anti-abuse rule.
The cumulative basis difference exemption, an RFA class exemption, and the RFA exemption are not available if the transferor and transferee in the CAA are related persons (as described in section 267(b) or 707(b)) and the CAA was entered into, or structured, with a principal purpose of avoiding the application of section 901(m). See also § 1.901(m)-8(c), which provides that certain built-in loss assets are not taken into account for purposes of applying this section.
(f)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:
(1)
Example 1: De minimis; cumulative basis difference exemption
—(i)
Facts.
USP, a domestic corporation, as part of a plan, purchases all of the stock of CFC1 and CFC2 from a single seller. CFC1 and CFC2 are applicable foreign corporations, organized in Country F, and treated as corporations for Country F tax purposes. Country F imposes a single tax that is a foreign income tax. Each acquisition is a qualified stock purchase (as defined in section 338(d)(3)) to which section 338(a) applies. A foreign basis election is not made under § 1.901(m)-4(c). Immediately after the acquisition of the stock of CFC1 and CFC2, the assets of CFC1 and CFC2 give rise to income that is taken into account for Country F tax purposes, and those assets are in a single class, as defined in § 1.338-6(b). Assume that the absolute value of the basis difference with respect to any single RFA is greater than $20,000. At all relevant times, 1u equals $1. All amounts are stated in millions. The additional facts are summarized below.

(ii)
Result.
(A) Under § 1.901(m)-2(b)(1), USP's acquisitions of the stock of CFC1 and CFC2 are each a section 338 CAA. Under 1.901(m)-1(a)(3), the two section 338 CAAs constitute an aggregated CAA transaction because the acquisitions occur as part of a plan. Under § 1.901(m)-2(c)(1), the assets of CFC1 and CFC2 are RFAs for Country F tax purposes because they are relevant in determining foreign income of CFC1 and CFC 2, respectively, for Country F tax purposes. Under § 1.901(m)-1(a)(37), CFC1 is the RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to its assets, and CFC2 is the RFA owner (U.S.) with respect to its assets.
(B) Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the application of the cumulative basis difference exemption is based on a single CAA and a single RFA owner (U.S.), subject to the requirements under paragraph (c) of this section that apply when there is an aggregated CAA transaction. In the case of the section 338 CAA with respect to CFC1, without regard to paragraph (c) of this section, the requirements of the cumulative basis difference exemption are satisfied if the sum of the basis differences is less than the threshold of $10 million, the greater of $10 million or $6 million (10% of the total U.S. basis of $60 million (60 million u translated into dollars at the exchange rate of $1 = 1u)). In this case, the sum of the basis differences is $12 million (12 million u translated into dollars at the exchange rate of $1 = 1 u). Because the sum of the basis differences of $12 million is not less than the threshold of $10 million, the requirements of the cumulative basis difference exemption are not satisfied. Because the requirements of the cumulative basis difference exemption are not satisfied, without regard to paragraph (c) of this section, paragraph (c) of this section is not applicable. The RFA class exemption is not relevant because all of the RFAs of CFC1 are in a single class. Finally, because the absolute value with respect to each RFA is greater than $20,000, the RFA exemption does not apply. Accordingly, the basis differences with respect to all of the RFAs of CFC1 must be taken into account under section 901(m).
(C) In the case of the section 338 CAA with respect to CFC2, without regard to paragraph (c) of this section, the requirements of the cumulative basis difference exemption are satisfied if the sum of the basis differences is less than the threshold of $10 million, the greater of $10 million or $ 9.6 million (10% of the total U.S. basis of $96 million (96 million u translated into dollars at the exchange rate of $1 = 1u)) In this case, the sum of the basis differences is ($4) million ((4) million u translated into dollars at the exchange rate of $1 = 1 u). Because the sum of the basis differences of ($4) million is less than the threshold of $10 million, the requirements of the cumulative basis difference exemption are satisfied. However, because the section 338 CAA with respect to CFC2 is part of an aggregated CAA transaction that includes the section 338 CAA with respect to CFC1, paragraph (c) of this section is applicable. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the requirements of the cumulative basis difference exemption must also be satisfied taking into account all of the RFAs of both CFC2 and CFC1. In this case, the requirements of the cumulative basis difference exemption for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section are satisfied if the sum of the basis differences with respect to all of the RFAs of CFC2 and CFC1 is less than the threshold of $15.6 million, the greater of $10 million or $15.6 million (10% of the total U.S. basis of $156 million (156 million u translated into dollars at the exchange rate of $1 = 1u)). In this case, the sum of the basis differences is $8 million (8 million u translated into dollars at the exchange rate of $1 = 1 u). Because the sum of the basis differences of $8 million is less than the threshold of $15.6 million, the requirements of the cumulative basis difference exemption are satisfied in
the case of the section 338 CAA with respect to CFC2. Accordingly, none of the basis differences with respect to the RFAs of CFC2 are taken into account under section 901(m).

Example 2: De minimis; RFA Class Exemption
—(i)
Facts.
USP, a domestic corporation, acquires all the stock of CFC, an applicable foreign corporation organized in Country F and treated as a corporation for Country F tax purposes, in a qualified stock purchase (as defined in section 338(d)(3)) to which section 338(a) applies. Country F imposes a single tax that is a foreign income tax. A foreign basis election is not made under § 1.901(m)-4(c). Immediately after the acquisition of CFC, the assets of CFC give rise to income that is taken into account for Country F tax purposes. Assume that the absolute value of the basis difference with respect to any single RFA is greater than $20,000. At all relevant times, 1u equals $1. All amounts are stated in millions. The additional facts are summarized below.

(ii)
Result.
(A) Under § 1.901(m)-2(b)(1), USP's acquisition of the stock of CFC is a section 338 CAA. Under § 1.901(m)-2(c)(1), the assets of CFC are RFAs for Country F tax purposes because they are relevant in determining foreign income of CFC for Country F tax purposes.
(B) Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the requirements of the cumulative basis difference exemption are satisfied if the sum of the basis differences is less than the threshold of $10 million, the greater of $10 million or $5.5 million (10% of the total U.S. basis of $55 million (55 million u translated into dollars at the exchange rate of $1 = 1u)). In this case, the sum of the basis differences is $12 million (12 million u translated into dollars at the exchange rate of $1 = 1 u). Because the sum of the basis differences of $12 million is not less than the threshold of $10 million, the requirements of the cumulative basis difference exemption are not satisfied.
(C) Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, each of CFC's assets is allocated to its class under § 1.338-6(b) for purposes of the RFA class exemption. The requirements of the RFA class exemption with respect to the Class IV RFAs (in this case, inventory) are satisfied if the absolute value of the sum of the basis differences with respect to the Class IV RFAs is less than the threshold of $2 million, the greater of $2 million or $1.5 million (10% of the total U.S. basis of Class IV RFAs of $15 million (15 million u translated into dollars at the exchange rate of $1 = 1u)). In this case, the absolute value of the sum of the basis differences is $1 million (1 million u translated into dollars at the exchange rate of $1 = 1 u). Because the sum of the basis differences of $1 million is less than the threshold of $2 million, the requirements of the RFA class exemption are satisfied. Accordingly, the basis differences with respect to the Class IV RFAs are not taken into account under section 901(m).
(D) The requirements of the RFA class exemption with respect to the Class V RFAs (in this case, buildings) is satisfied if the absolute value of the sum of the basis differences with respect to the Class V RFAs is less than the threshold of $3 million, the greater of $2 million or $3 million (10% of the total U.S. basis of Class V RFAs of $30 million (30 million u translated into dollars at the exchange rate of $1 = 1u)). In this case, the absolute value of the sum of the basis differences is $11 million (11 million u translated into dollars at the exchange rate of $1 = 1 u). Because the sum of the basis differences of $11 million is not less than
the threshold of $3 million, the requirements of the RFA class exemption are not satisfied. Finally, because the absolute value with respect to each RFA is greater than $20,000, the RFA exemption does not apply. Accordingly, the basis differences with respect to the Class V RFAs are taken into account under section 901(m).
(E) The Class I RFAs (in this case, cash) are irrelevant because there are no basis differences with respect to those RFAs.

§ 1.901(m)-8
Miscellaneous.
(a)
In general.
This section provides guidance on other matters under section 901(m). Paragraph (b) of this section provides guidance on the application of section 901(m) to pre-1987 foreign income taxes. Paragraph (c) of this section provides anti-abuse rules relating to built-in loss assets. Paragraph (d) of this section provides guidance on the interaction of section 901(m) and section 909. Paragraph (e) of this section provides applicability dates.
(b)
Application of section 901(m) to pre-1987 foreign income taxes.
Section 901(m) and §§ 1.901(m)-1 through 1.901-8 apply to pre-1987 foreign income taxes (as defined in § 1.902-1(a)(10)(iii)) of an applicable foreign corporation.
(c)
Anti-abuse rule for built-in loss RFAs.
A basis difference with respect to an RFA described in section 901(m)(3)(C)(ii) (
built-in loss RFA
) will not be taken into account for purposes of computing an allocated basis difference for a U.S. taxable year of a section 901(m) payor if any RFA, including an RFA other than built-in loss RFAs, is acquired with a principal purpose of using one or more built-in loss RFAs to avoid the application of section 901(m). Furthermore, a basis difference with respect to a built-in loss RFA will not be taken into account for purposes of the cumulative basis difference exemption or the RFA class exemption under § 1.901(m)-7 if any RFAs, including RFAs other than built-in loss RFAs, are acquired with a principal purpose of avoiding the application of section 901(m).
(d)
Interaction with section 909.
The amount of a foreign income tax that is disqualified under section 901(m) is determined before applying section 909. However, section 909 may apply to suspend a deduction for the amount of a foreign income tax that is disqualified under section 901(m).
(e)
Applicability dates.
This section applies to CAAs occurring on or after March 23, 2020. Taxpayers may, however, choose to apply this section before the date this section is applicable provided that they (along with any persons that are related (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)) to the taxpayer)—

§ 1.902-1
Credit for domestic corporate shareholder of a foreign corporation for foreign income taxes paid by the foreign corporation.
(a)
Definitions and special effective date.
For purposes of section 902, this section, and § 1.902-2, the definitions provided in paragraphs (a)(1) through (12) of this section and the special effective date of paragraph (a)(13) of this section apply.
(1)
Domestic shareholder.
In the case of dividends received by a domestic corporation from a foreign corporation after December 31, 1986, the term domestic shareholder means a domestic corporation, other than an S corporation as defined in section 1361(a), that owns at least 10 percent of the voting stock of the foreign corporation at the time the domestic corporation receives a dividend from that foreign corporation.
(2)
First-tier corporation.
In the case of dividends received by a domestic shareholder from a foreign corporation in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, the term first-tier corporation means a foreign corporation, at least 10 percent of the voting stock of which is owned by a domestic shareholder at the time the domestic shareholder receives a dividend from that foreign corporation. The term first-tier corporation also includes a DISC or former DISC, but only with respect to dividends from the DISC or former DISC that are treated under sections 861(a)(2)(D) and 862(a)(2) as income from sources without the United States.
(3)
Second-tier corporation.
In the case of dividends paid to a first-tier corporation by a foreign corporation in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, the foreign corporation is a
second-tier corporation if, at the time a first-tier corporation receives a dividend from that foreign corporation, the first-tier corporation owns at least 10 percent of the foreign corporation's voting stock and the product of the following equals at least 5 percent—
(i) The percentage of voting stock owned by the domestic shareholder in the first-tier corporation; multiplied by
(ii) The percentage of voting stock owned by the first-tier corporation in the second-tier corporation.
(4)
Third- or lower-tier corporation.
— (i)
Third-tier corporation.
In the case of dividends paid to a second-tier corporation by a foreign corporation in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, a foreign corporation is a third-tier corporation if, at the time a second-tier corporation receives a dividend from that foreign corporation, the second-tier corporation owns at least 10 percent of the foreign corporation's voting stock and the product of the following equals at least 5 percent—
(A) The percentage of voting stock owned by the domestic shareholder in the first-tier corporation; multiplied by
(B) The percentage of voting stock owned by the first-tier corporation in the second-tier corporation; multiplied by
(C) The percentage of voting stock owned by the second-tier corporation in the third-tier corporation.
(ii)
Fourth-, fifth-, or sixth-tier corporation.
In the case of dividends paid to a third-, fourth-, or fifth-tier corporation by a foreign corporation in a taxable year beginning after August 5, 1997, the foreign corporation is a fourth-, fifth-, or sixth-tier corporation, respectively, if at the time the dividend is paid, the corporation receiving the dividend owns at least 10 percent of the foreign corporation's voting stock, the chain of foreign corporations that includes the foreign corporation is connected through stock ownership of at least 10 percent of their voting stock, the domestic shareholder in the first-tier corporation in such chain indirectly owns at least 5 percent of the voting stock of the foreign corporation through such chain, such corporation is a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957) and the domestic shareholder is a United States shareholder (as defined in section 951(b)) in the foreign corporation. Taxes paid by a fourth-, fifth-, or sixth-tier corporation shall be taken into account in determining post-1986 foreign income taxes only if such taxes are paid with respect to taxable years beginning after August 5, 1997, in which the corporation was a controlled foreign corporation.
(5)
Example.
The following example illustrates the ownership requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section:

# Example.
(i) Domestic corporation M owns 30 percent of the voting stock of foreign corporation A on January 1, 1991, and for all periods thereafter. Corporation A owns 40 percent of the voting stock of foreign corporation B on January 1, 1991, and continues to own that stock until June 1, 1991, when Corporation A sells its stock in Corporation B. Both Corporation A and Corporation B use the calendar year as the taxable year. Corporation B pays a dividend out of its post-1986 undistributed earnings to Corporation A, which Corporation A receives on February 16, 1991. Corporation A pays a dividend out of its post-1986 undistributed earnings to Corporation M, which Corporation M receives on January 20, 1992. Corporation M uses a fiscal year ending on June 30 as the taxable year.
(ii) On February 16, 1991, when Corporation B pays a dividend to Corporation A, Corporation M satisfies the 10 percent stock ownership requirement of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section with respect to Corporation A. Therefore, Corporation A is a first-tier corporation within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of this section and Corporation M is a domestic shareholder of Corporation A within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Also on February 16, 1991, Corporation B is a second-tier corporation within the meaning of paragraph (a)(3) of this section because Corporation A owns at least 10 percent of its voting stock, and the percentage of voting stock owned by Corporation M in Corporation A on February 16, 1991 (30 percent) multiplied by the percentage of voting stock owned by Corporation A in Corporation B on February 16, 1991 (40 percent) equals 12 percent. Corporation A shall be deemed to have paid foreign income taxes of Corporation B with respect to the dividend received from Corporation B on February 16, 1991.
(iii) On January 20, 1992, Corporation M satisfies the 10-percent stock ownership requirement of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section with respect to Corporation A. Therefore, Corporation A is a first-tier corporation within the meaning of paragraph
(a)(2) of this section and Corporation M is a domestic shareholder within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Accordingly, for its taxable year ending on June 30, 1992, Corporation M is deemed to have paid a portion of the post-1986 foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed to be paid, by Corporation A. Those taxes will include taxes paid by Corporation B that were deemed paid by Corporation A with respect to the dividend paid by Corporation B to Corporation A on February 16, 1991, even though Corporation B is no longer a second-tier corporation with respect to Corporations A and M on January 20, 1992, and has not been a second-tier corporation with respect to Corporations A and M at any time during the taxable years of Corporations A and M that include January 20, 1992.
(6)
Upper- and lower-tier corporations.
In the case of a sixth-tier corporation, the term
upper-tier corporation
means a first-, second-, third-, fourth-, or fifth-tier corporation. In the case of a fifth-tier corporation, the term upper-tier corporation means a first-, second-, third-, or fourth-tier corporation. In the case of a fourth-tier corporation, the term upper-tier corporation means a first-, second-, or third-tier corporation. In the case of a third-tier corporation, the term upper-tier corporation means a first- or second-tier corporation. In the case of a second-tier corporation, the term upper-tier corporation means a first-tier corporation. In the case of a first-tier corporation, the term
lower-tier corporation
means a second-, third-, fourth-, fifth-, or sixth-tier corporation. In the case of a second-tier corporation, the term lower-tier corporation means a third-, fourth-, fifth-, or sixth-tier corporation. In the case of a third-tier corporation, the term lower-tier corporation means a fourth-, fifth-, or sixth-tier corporation. In the case of a fourth-tier corporation, the term lower-tier corporation means a fifth- or sixth-tier corporation. In the case of a fifth-tier corporation, the term lower-tier corporation means a sixth-tier corporation.
(7)
Foreign income taxes.
The term
foreign income taxes
means income, war profits, and excess profits taxes as defined in § 1.901-2(a), and taxes included in the term income, war profits, and excess profits taxes by reason of section 903, that are imposed by a foreign country or a possession of the United States, including any such taxes deemed paid by a foreign corporation under this section. Foreign income, war profits, and excess profits taxes shall not include amounts excluded from the definition of those taxes pursuant to section 901 and the regulations under that section.
See
section 901(f) and (i) and paragraph (c)(5) of this section. Foreign income, war profits, and excess profits taxes also shall not include taxes for which a credit is disallowed under section 901 and the regulations under section 901.
See
section 901(j), (k), and (l), and paragraphs (c)(4) and (8) of this section.
(8)
Post-1986 foreign income taxes
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(10) and (13) of this section, the term
post-1986 foreign income taxes
of a foreign corporation means the sum of the foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed paid in the taxable year of the foreign corporation in which it distributes a dividend plus the foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed paid in the foreign corporation's prior taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, to the extent the foreign taxes were not attributable to dividends distributed to, or earnings otherwise included (for example, under section 304, 367(b), 551, 951(a), 1248, or 1293) in the income of, a foreign or domestic shareholder in prior taxable years. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, foreign taxes paid or deemed paid by the foreign corporation on or with respect to earnings that were distributed or otherwise removed from post-1986 undistributed earnings in prior post-1986 taxable years shall be removed from post-1986 foreign income taxes regardless of whether the shareholder is eligible to compute an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid under section 902, and regardless of whether the shareholder in fact chose to credit foreign income taxes under section 901 for the year of the distribution or inclusion. Thus, if an amount is distributed or deemed distributed by a foreign corporation to a United States person that is not a domestic shareholder within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section (for example, an individual or a corporation that owns less than 10% of the foreign corporation's voting stock), or to a foreign
person that does not meet the definition of an upper-tier corporation under paragraph (a)(6) of this section, then although no foreign income taxes shall be deemed paid under section 902, foreign income taxes attributable to the distribution or deemed distribution that would have been deemed paid had the shareholder met the ownership requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section shall be removed from post-1986 foreign income taxes. Further, if a domestic shareholder chooses to deduct foreign taxes paid or accrued for the taxable year of the distribution or inclusion, it shall nonetheless be deemed to have paid a proportionate share of the foreign corporation's post-1986 foreign income taxes under section 902(a), and the foreign income taxes deemed paid must be removed from post-1986 foreign income taxes. In the case of a foreign corporation the foreign income taxes of which are determined based on an accounting period of less than one year, the term
year
means that accounting period.
See
sections 441(b)(3) and 443.
(ii)
Distributions out of earnings and profits accumulated by a lower-tier corporation in its taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987, and included in the gross income of an upper-tier corporation in its taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986.
Post-1986 foreign income taxes shall include foreign income taxes that are deemed paid by an upper-tier corporation with respect to distributions from a lower-tier corporation out of nonpreviously taxed pre-1987 accumulated profits, as defined in paragraph (a)(10) of this section, that are received by an upper-tier corporation in any taxable year of the upper-tier corporation beginning after December 31, 1986, provided the upper-tier corporation's earnings and profits in that year are included in its post-1986 undistributed earnings under paragraph (a)(9) of this section. Foreign income taxes deemed paid with respect to a distribution of pre-1987 accumulated profits shall be translated from the functional currency of the lower-tier corporation into dollars at the spot exchange rate in effect on the date of the distribution. To determine the character of the earnings and profits and associated taxes for foreign tax credit limitation purposes, see section 904 and § 1.904-7(a).
(iii)
Foreign income taxes paid or accrued with respect to high withholding tax interest.
Post-1986 foreign income taxes shall not include foreign income taxes paid or accrued by a noncontrolled section 902 corporation (as defined in section 904(d)(2)(E)(i)) in a taxable year beginning on or before December 31, 2002 with respect to high withholding tax interest (as defined in section 904(d)(2)(B)) to the extent the foreign tax rate imposed on such interest exceeds 5 percent. See section 904(d)(2)(E)(ii) and § 1.904-4(g)(2)(iii) (26 CFR revised as of April 1, 2006). The reduction in foreign income taxes paid or accrued by the amount of tax in excess of 5 percent imposed on high withholding tax interest income must be computed in functional currency before foreign income taxes are translated into U.S. dollars and included in post-1986 foreign income taxes.
(9)
Post-1986 undistributed earnings
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(10) and (13) of this section, the term post-1986 undistributed earnings means the amount of the earnings and profits of a foreign corporation (computed in accordance with sections 964(a) and 986) accumulated in taxable years of the foreign corporation beginning after December 31, 1986, determined as of the close of the taxable year of the foreign corporation in which it distributes a dividend. Post-1986 undistributed earnings shall not be reduced by reason of any earnings distributed or otherwise included in income, for example under section 304, 367(b), 551, 951(a), 1248 or 1293, during the taxable year. Post-1986 undistributed earnings shall be reduced to account for distributions or deemed distributions that reduced earnings and profits and inclusions that resulted in previously-taxed amounts described in section 959(c) (1) and (2) or section 1293(c) in prior taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986. Thus, post-1986 undistributed earnings shall not be reduced to the extent of the ratable share of a controlled foreign corporation's subpart F income, as defined in section 952, attributable to a shareholder that is not a United States shareholder within the meaning of section 951(b) or
section 953(c)(1)(A), because that amount has not been included in a shareholder's gross income. Post-1986 undistributed earnings shall be reduced as provided herein regardless of whether any shareholder is deemed to have paid any foreign taxes, and regardless of whether any domestic shareholder chose to claim a foreign tax credit under section 901(a) for the year of the distribution. For rules on carrybacks and carryforwards of deficits and their effect on post-1986 undistributed earnings, see § 1.902-2. In the case of a foreign corporation the foreign income taxes of which are computed based on an accounting period of less than one year, the term year means that accounting period. See sections 441(b)(3) and 443.
(ii)
Distributions out of earnings and profits accumulated by a lower-tier corporation in its taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987, and included in the gross income of an upper-tier corporation in its taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986.
Distributions by a lower-tier corporation out of non-previously taxed pre-1987 accumulated profits, as defined in paragraph (a)(10) of this section, that are received by an upper-tier corporation in any taxable year of the upper-tier corporation beginning after December 31, 1986, shall be treated as post-1986 undistributed earnings of the upper-tier corporation, provided the upper-tier corporation's earnings and profits for that year are included in its post-1986 undistributed earnings under paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section. To determine the character of the earnings and profits and associated taxes for foreign tax credit limitation purposes, see section 904 and § 1.904-7(a).
(iii)
Reduction for foreign income taxes paid or accrued.
In computing post-1986 undistributed earnings, earnings and profits shall be reduced by foreign income taxes paid or accrued regardless of whether the taxes are creditable. Thus, earnings and profits shall be reduced by foreign income taxes paid with respect to high withholding tax interest even though a portion of the taxes is not creditable pursuant to section 904(d)(2)(E)(ii) and is not included in post-1986 foreign income taxes under paragraph (a)(8)(iii) of this section. Earnings and profits of an upper-tier corporation, however, shall not be reduced by foreign income taxes paid by a lower-tier corporation and deemed to have been paid by the upper-tier corporation.
(iv)
Special allocations.
The term post-1986 undistributed earnings means the total amount of the earnings of the corporation determined at the corporate level. Special allocations of earnings and taxes to particular shareholders, whether required or permitted by foreign law or a shareholder agreement, shall be disregarded. If, however, the Commissioner establishes that there is an agreement to pay dividends only out of earnings in the separate categories for passive or high withholding tax interest income, then only taxes imposed on passive or high withholding tax interest earnings shall be treated as related to the dividend. See § 1.904-6(a)(2).
(10)
Pre-1987 accumulated profits
—(i)
Definition.
The term pre-1987 accumulated profits means the amount of the earnings and profits of a foreign corporation computed in accordance with section 902 and attributable to its taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987. If the special effective date of paragraph (a)(13) of this section applies, pre-1987 accumulated profits also includes any earnings and profits (computed in accordance with sections 964(a) and 986) attributable to the foreign corporation's taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, but before the first day of the first taxable year of the foreign corporation in which the ownership requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B) and paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section are met with respect to that corporation.
(ii)
Computation of pre-1987 accumulated profits.
Pre-1987 accumulated profits must be computed under United States principles governing the computation of earnings and profits. Pre-1987 accumulated profits are determined at the corporate level. Special allocations of accumulated profits and taxes to particular shareholders with respect to distributions of pre-1987 accumulated profits in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, whether required or permitted by foreign law or a shareholder agreement, shall be
disregarded. Pre-1987 accumulated profits of a particular year shall be reduced by amounts distributed from those accumulated profits or otherwise included in income from those accumulated profits, for example under sections 304, 367(b), 551, 951(a), 1248 or 1293. If a deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings is carried back to offset pre-1987 accumulated profits, pre-1987 accumulated profits of a particular taxable year shall be reduced by the amount of the deficit carried back to that year. See § 1.902-2. The amount of a distribution out of pre-1987 accumulated profits, and the amount of foreign income taxes deemed paid under section 902, shall be determined and translated into United States dollars by applying the law as in effect prior to the effective date of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. See §§ 1.902-3, 1.902-4 and 1.964-1.
(iii)
Foreign income taxes attributable to pre-1987 accumulated profits.
The term pre-1987 foreign income taxes means any foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed paid by a foreign corporation on or with respect to its pre-1987 accumulated profits. Pre-1987 foreign income taxes of a particular year shall be reduced by the amount of taxes paid or deemed paid by the foreign corporation on or with respect to amounts distributed or otherwise included in income from pre-1987 accumulated profits of that year. Thus, pre-1987 foreign income taxes shall be reduced by the amount of taxes deemed paid by a domestic shareholder (regardless of whether the shareholder chose to credit foreign income taxes under section 901 for the year of the distribution or inclusion) or a first-tier or second-tier corporation, and by the amount of taxes that would have been deemed paid had any other shareholder been eligible to compute an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid under section 902. Foreign income taxes deemed paid with respect to a distribution of pre-1987 accumulated profits shall be translated from the functional currency of the distributing corporation into United States dollars at the spot exchange rate in effect on the date of the distribution.
(11)
Dividend.
For purposes of section 902, the definition of the term dividend in section 316 and the regulations under that section applies. Thus, for example, distributions and deemed distributions under sections 302, 304, 305(b) and 367(b) that are treated as dividends within the meaning of section 301(c)(1) also are dividends for purposes of section 902. In addition, the term dividend includes deemed dividends under sections 551 and 1248, but not deemed inclusions under sections 951(a) and 1293. For rules concerning excess distributions from section 1291 funds that are treated as dividends solely for foreign tax credit purposes, (see Regulation Project INTL-656-87 published in 1992-1 C.B. 1124; see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter).
(12)
Dividend received.
A dividend shall be considered received for purposes of section 902 when the cash or other property is unqualifiedly made subject to the demands of the distributee. See § 1.301-1(c). A dividend also is considered received for purposes of section 902 when it is deemed received under section 304, 367(b), 551, or 1248.
(13)
Special effective date
—(i)
Rule.
If the first day on which the ownership requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B) and paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section are met with respect to a foreign corporation, without regard to whether a dividend is distributed, is in a taxable year of the foreign corporation beginning after December 31, 1986, then—
(A) The post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes of the foreign corporation shall be determined by taking into account only taxable years beginning on and after the first day of the first taxable year of the foreign corporation in which the ownership requirements are met, including subsequent taxable years in which the ownership requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B) and paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section are not met; and
(B) Earnings and profits accumulated prior to the first day of the first taxable year of the foreign corporation in which the ownership requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B) and paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section are met shall be considered pre-1987 accumulated profits.
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the special effective date rules of this paragraph (a)(13):

# Example.
As of December 31, 1991, and since its incorporation, foreign corporation A has owned 100 percent of the stock of foreign corporation B. Corporation B is not a controlled foreign corporation. Corporation B uses the calendar year as its taxable year, and its functional currency is the u. Assume 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. On April 1, 1992, Corporation B pays a 200u dividend to Corporation A and the ownership requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B) and paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section are not met at that time. On July 1, 1992, domestic corporation M purchases 10 percent of the Corporation B stock from Corporation A and, for the first time, Corporation B meets the ownership requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Corporation M uses the calendar year as its taxable year. Corporation B does not distribute any dividends to Corporation M during 1992. For its taxable year ending December 31, 1992, Corporation B has 500u of earnings and profits (after foreign taxes but before taking into account the 200u distribution to Corporation A) and pays 100u of foreign income taxes that is equal to $100. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(13)(i) of this section, Corporation B's post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes will include earnings and profits and foreign income taxes attributable to Corporation B's entire 1992 taxable year and all taxable years thereafter. Thus, the April 1, 1992, dividend to Corporation A will reduce post-1986 undistributed earnings to 300u (500u-200u) under paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section. The foreign income taxes attributable to the amount distributed as a dividend to Corporation A will not be creditable because Corporation A is not a domestic shareholder. Post-1986 foreign income taxes, however, will be reduced by the amount of foreign taxes attributable to the dividend. Thus, as of the beginning of 1993, Corporation B has $60 ($100-[$100 × 40% (200u/500u)]) of post-1986 foreign income taxes. See paragraphs (a)(8)(i) and (b)(1) of this section.
(b)
Computation of foreign income taxes deemed paid by a domestic shareholder, first-tier corporation, or lower-tier corporation
—(1)
General rule.
If a foreign corporation pays a dividend in any taxable year out of post-1986 undistributed earnings to a shareholder that is a domestic shareholder or an upper-tier corporation at the time it receives the dividend, the recipient shall be deemed to have paid the same proportion of any post-1986 foreign income taxes paid, accrued or deemed paid by the distributing corporation on or with respect to post-1986 undistributed earnings which the amount of the dividend out of post-1986 undistributed earnings (determined without regard to the gross-up under section 78) bears to the amount of the distributing corporation's post-1986 undistributed earnings. An upper-tier corporation shall not be entitled to compute an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid on a dividend from a lower-tier corporation, however, unless the ownership requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section are met at each tier at the time the upper-tier corporation receives the dividend. Foreign income taxes deemed paid by a domestic shareholder or an upper-tier corporation must be computed under the following formula:
EC07OC91.030
(2)
Allocation rule for dividends attributable to post-1986 undistributed earnings and pre-1987 accumulated profits
—(i)
Portion of dividend out of post-1986 undistributed earnings.
Dividends will be deemed to be paid first out of post-1986 undistributed earnings to the extent thereof. If dividends exceed post-1986 undistributed earnings and dividends are paid to more than one shareholder, then the
dividend to each shareholder shall be deemed to be paid pro rata out of post-1986 undistributed earnings, computed as follows:
EC07OC91.031
(ii)
Portion of dividend out of pre-1987 accumulated profits.
After the portion of the dividend attributable to post-1986 undistributed earnings is determined under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the remainder of the dividend received by a shareholder is attributable to pre-1987 accumulated profits to the extent thereof. That part of the dividend attributable to pre-1987 accumulated profits will be treated as paid first from the most recently accumulated earnings and profits. See § 1.902-3. If dividends paid out of pre-1987 accumulated profits are attributable to more than one pre-1987 taxable year and are paid to more than one shareholder, then the dividend to each shareholder attributable to earnings and profits accumulated in a particular pre-1987 taxable year shall be deemed to be paid pro rata out of accumulated profits of that taxable year, computed as follows:
EC07OC91.032
(3)
Dividends paid out of pre-1987 accumulated profits.
If dividends are paid by a first-tier corporation or a lower-tier corporation out of pre-1987 accumulated profits, the domestic shareholder or upper-tier corporation that receives the dividends shall be deemed to have paid foreign income taxes to the extent provided under section 902 and the regulations thereunder as in effect prior to the effective date of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. See paragraphs (a) (10) and (13) of this section and §§ 1.902-3 and 1.902-4.
(4)
Deficits in accumulated earnings and profits.
No foreign income taxes shall be deemed paid with respect to a distribution from a foreign corporation out of current earnings and profits that is treated as a dividend under section 316(a)(2), and post-1986 foreign income taxes shall not be reduced, if as of the end of the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or accrued, the corporation has zero or a deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings and the sum of current plus accumulated earnings and profits is zero or less than zero. The dividend shall reduce post- 1986 undistributed earnings and accumulated earnings and profits.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (b):

# Example 1.
Domestic corporation M owns 100 percent of foreign corporation A. Both Corporation M and Corporation A use the calendar year as the taxable year, and Corporation A uses the u as its functional currency. Assume that 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. All of Corporation A's pre-1987 accumulated profits and post-1986 undistributed earnings are non-subpart F general limitation earnings and profits under section 904(d)(1)(I). As of December 31, 1992, Corporation A has 100u of post-1986 undistributed earnings and $40 of post-1986 foreign income taxes. For its 1986 taxable year, Corporation A has accumulated profits of 200u (net of foreign taxes) and paid 60u of foreign income taxes on those earnings. In 1992, Corporation
A distributes 150u to Corporation M. Corporation A has 100u of post-1986 undistributed earnings and the dividend, therefore, is treated as paid out of post-1986 undistributed earnings to the extent of 100u. The first 100u distribution is from post-1986 undistributed earnings, and, because the distribution exhausts those earnings, Corporation M is deemed to have paid the entire amount of post-1986 foreign income taxes of Corporation A ($40). The remaining 50u dividend is treated as a dividend out of 1986 accumulated profits under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Corporation M is deemed to have paid $15 (60u × 50u/200u, translated at the appropriate exchange rates) of Corporation A's foreign income taxes for 1986. As of January 1, 1993, Corporation A's post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes are 0. Corporation A has 150u of accumulated profits and 45u of foreign income taxes remaining in 1986.

# Example 2.
Domestic corporation M (incorporated on January 1, 1987) owns 100 percent of foreign corporation A (incorporated on January 1, 1987). Both Corporation M and Corporation A use the calendar year as the taxable year, and Corporation A uses the u as its functional currency. Assume that 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. Corporation A has no pre-1987 accumulated profits. All of Corporation A's post-1986 undistributed earnings are non-subpart F general limitation earnings and profits under section 904(d)(1)(I). On January 1, 1992, Corporation A has a deficit in accumulated earnings and profits and a deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings of (200u). No foreign taxes have been paid with respect to post-1986 undistributed earnings. During 1992, Corporation A earns 100u (net of foreign taxes), pays $40 of foreign taxes on those earnings and distributes 50u to Corporation M. As of the end of 1992, Corporation A has a deficit of (100u) ((200u) post1986 undistributed earnings + 100u current earnings and profits) in post-1986 undistributed earnings. Corporation A, however, has current earnings and profits of 100u. Therefore, the 50u distribution is treated as a dividend in its entirety under section 316(a)(2). Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, Corporation M is not deemed to have paid any of the foreign taxes paid by Corporation A because post-1986 undistributed earnings and the sum of current plus accumulated earnings and profits are (100u). The dividend reduces both post-1986 undistributed earnings and accumulated earnings and profits. Therefore, as of January 1, 1993, Corporation A's post-1986 undistributed earnings are (150u) and its accumulated earnings and profits are (150u). Corporation A's post-1986 foreign income taxes at the start of 1993 are $40.
(c)
Special rules
—(1)
Separate computations required for dividends from each first-tier and lower-tier corporation
—(i)
Rule.
If in a taxable year dividends are received by a domestic shareholder or an upper-tier corporation from two or more first-tier corporations or two or more lower-tier corporations, the foreign income taxes deemed paid by the domestic shareholder or the upper-tier corporation under sections 902 (a) and (b) and paragraph (b) of this section shall be computed separately with respect to the dividends received from each first-tier corporation or lower-tier corporation. If a domestic shareholder receives dividend distributions from one or more first-tier corporations and in the same taxable year the first-tier corporation receives dividends from one or more lower-tier corporations, then the amount of foreign income taxes deemed paid shall be computed by starting with the lowest-tier corporation and working upward.
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (c)(1):

# Example.
P, a domestic corporation, owns 40 percent of the voting stock of foreign corporation S. S owns 30 percent of the voting stock of foreign corporation T, and 30 percent of the voting stock of foreign corporation U. Neither S, T, nor U is a controlled foreign corporation. P, S, T and U all use the calendar year as their taxable year. In 1993, T and U both pay dividends to S and S pays a dividend to P. To compute foreign taxes deemed paid, paragraph (c)(1) of this section requires P to start with the lowest tier corporations and to compute foreign taxes deemed paid separately for dividends from each first-tier and lower-tier corporation. Thus, S first will compute foreign taxes deemed paid separately on its dividends from T and U. The deemed paid taxes will be added to S's post-1986 foreign income taxes, and the dividends will be added to S's post-1986 undistributed earnings. Next, P will compute foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to the dividend from S. This computation will take into account the taxes paid by T and U and deemed paid by S.
(2)
Section 78 gross-up
—(i)
Foreign income taxes deemed paid by a domestic shareholder.
Except as provided in section 960(b) and the regulations under that section (relating to amounts excluded from gross income under section 959(b)), any foreign income taxes deemed paid by a domestic shareholder in any taxable year under section 902(a) and paragraph (b) of this section shall be included in the gross income of the
domestic shareholder for the year as a dividend under section 78. Amounts included in gross income under section 78 shall, for purposes of section 904, be deemed to be derived from sources within the United States to the extent the earnings and profits on which the taxes were paid are treated under section 904(g) as United States source earnings and profits. Section 1.904-5(m)(6). Amounts included in gross income under section 78 shall be treated for purposes of section 904 as income in a separate category to the extent that the foreign income taxes were allocated and apportioned to income in that separate category. See section 904(d)(3)(G) and § 1.904-6(b)(3).
(ii)
Foreign income taxes deemed paid by an upper-tier corporation.
Foreign income taxes deemed paid by an upper-tier corporation on a distribution from a lower-tier corporation are not included in the earnings and profits of the upper-tier corporation. For purposes of section 904, foreign income taxes shall be allocated and apportioned to income in a separate category to the extent those taxes were allocated to the earnings and profits of the lower-tier corporation in that separate category. See section 904(d)(3)(G) and § 1.904-6(b)(3). To the extent that section 904(g) treats the earnings of the lower-tier corporation on which those foreign income taxes were paid as United States source earnings and profits, the foreign income taxes deemed paid by the upper-tier corporation on the distribution from the lower-tier corporation shall be treated as attributable to United States source earnings and profits. See section 904(g) and § 1.904-5(m)(6).
(iii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (c)(2):

# Example.
P, a domestic corporation, owns 100 percent of the voting stock of controlled foreign corporation S. Corporations P and S use the calendar year as their taxable year, and S uses the u as its functional currency. Assume that 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. As of January 1, 1992, S has -0- post-1986 undistributed earnings and -0- post-1986 foreign income taxes. In 1992, S earns 150u of non-subpart F general limitation income net of foreign taxes and pays 60u of foreign income taxes. As of the end of 1992, but before dividend payments, S has 150u of post-1986 undistributed earnings and $60 of post-1986 foreign income taxes. Assume that 50u of S's earnings for 1992 are from United States sources. S pays P a dividend of 75u which P receives in 1992. Under § 1.904-5(m)(4), one-third of the dividend, or 25u (75u × 50u/150u), is United States source income to P. P computes foreign taxes deemed paid on the dividend under paragraph (b)(1) of this section of $30 ($60 × 50%[75u/150u]) and includes that amount in gross income under section 78 as a dividend. Because 25u of the 75u dividend is United States source income to P, $10 ($30 × 33.33%[25u/75u]) of the section 78 dividend will be treated as United States source income to P under this paragraph (c)(2).
(3)
Creditable foreign income taxes.
The amount of creditable foreign income taxes under section 901 shall include, subject to the limitations and conditions of sections 902 and 904, foreign income taxes actually paid and deemed paid by a domestic shareholder that receives a dividend from a first-tier corporation. Foreign income taxes deemed paid by a domestic shareholder under paragraph (b) of this section shall be deemed paid by the domestic shareholder only for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowed under section 901.
(4)
Foreign mineral income.
Certain foreign income, war profits and excess profits taxes paid or accrued with respect to foreign mineral income will not be considered foreign income taxes for purposes of section 902. See section 901(e) and § 1.901-3.
(5)
Foreign taxes paid or accrued in connection with the purchase or sale of certain oil and gas.
Certain income, war profits, or excess profits taxes paid or accrued to a foreign country in connection with the purchase and sale of oil or gas extracted in that country will not be considered foreign income taxes for purposes of section 902. See section 901(f).
(6)
Foreign oil and gas extraction income.
For rules relating to reduction of the amount of foreign income taxes deemed paid with respect to foreign oil and gas extraction income, see section 907(a) and the regulations under that section.
(7)
United States shareholders of controlled foreign corporations.
See paragraph (d) of this section and sections 960 and 962 and the regulations under those sections for special rules relating to the application of section 902 in
computing foreign income taxes deemed paid by United States shareholders of controlled foreign corporations.
(8)
Effect of certain liquidations, reorganizations, or similar transactions on certain foreign taxes paid or accrued in taxable years beginning on or before August 5, 1997
—(i)
General rule.
Notwithstanding the effect of any liquidation, reorganization, or similar transaction, foreign taxes paid or accrued by a member of a qualified group (as defined in section 902(b)(2)) shall not be eligible to be deemed paid if they were paid or accrued in a taxable year beginning on or before August 5, 1997, by a corporation that was a fourth-, fifth- or sixth-tier corporation with respect to the taxpayer on the first day of the corporation's first taxable year beginning after August 5, 1997.
(ii)
Example.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(8):

# Example.
P, a domestic corporation, has owned 100 percent of the voting stock of foreign corporation S at all times since January 1, 1987. Until June 30, 2002, S owned 100 percent of the voting stock of foreign corporation T, T owned 100 percent of the voting stock of foreign corporation U, and U owned 100 percent of the voting stock of foreign corporation V. P, S, T, U, and V each use the calendar year as their U.S. taxable year. Thus, beginning in 1998 V was a fourth-tier controlled foreign corporation, and its foreign taxes paid or accrued in 1998 and later taxable years were eligible to be deemed paid. On June 30, 2002, T was liquidated, causing S to acquire 100 percent of the stock of U. As a result, V became a third-tier controlled foreign corporation. In 2003, V paid a dividend to U. Under paragraph (c)(8) of this section, foreign taxes paid by V in taxable years beginning before 1998 are not taken into account in computing the foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to the dividend paid by V to U.
(d)
Dividends from controlled foreign corporations and noncontrolled section 902 corporations
—(1)
General rule.
If a dividend is described in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section, the following rules apply. If a dividend is paid out of post-1986 undistributed earnings or pre-1987 accumulated profits of a foreign corporation attributable to more than one separate category, the amount of foreign income taxes deemed paid by the domestic shareholder or the upper-tier corporation under section 902 and paragraph (b) of this section shall be computed separately with respect to the post-1986 undistributed earnings or pre-1987 accumulated profits in each separate category out of which the dividend is paid.
See
§ 1.904-5(c)(4) and (i), and paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The separately computed deemed-paid taxes shall be added to other taxes paid by the domestic shareholder or upper-tier corporation with respect to income in the appropriate separate category. The rules of this paragraph (d)(1) apply to dividends received by —
(i) A domestic shareholder that is a United States shareholder (as defined in section 951(b) or section 953(c)) from a first-tier corporation that is a controlled foreign corporation;
(ii) A domestic shareholder from a first-tier corporation that is a noncontrolled section 902 corporation;
(iii) An upper-tier controlled foreign corporation from a lower-tier controlled foreign corporation if the corporations are related look-through entities within the meaning of § 1.904-5(i) (
see
§ 1.904-5(i)(3)); or
(iv) A foreign corporation that is eligible to compute an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid under section 902(b)(1), from a controlled foreign corporation or a noncontrolled section 902 corporation (that is, both the payor and payee corporations are members of the same qualified group as defined in section 902(b)(2) (
see
§ 1.904-5 (i)(4)).
(2)
Look-through
—(i)
Dividends.
Any dividend distribution by a controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled section 902 corporation to a domestic shareholder or a foreign corporation that is eligible to compute an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid under section 902(b)(1) shall be deemed paid pro rata out of each separate category of income. Any dividend distribution by a controlled foreign corporation to a controlled foreign corporation that is a related look-through entity within the meaning of § 1.904-5(i)(3) shall also be deemed to be paid pro rata out of each separate category of income.
See
§§ 1.904-5(c)(4) and (i), and 1.904-7. The portion of the foreign income taxes attributable to a particular separate category that shall be deemed paid by the
domestic shareholder or upper-tier corporation must be computed under the following formula:

(ii)
Coordination with section 960.
For rules coordinating the computation of foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to amounts included in gross income under section 951(a) and dividends distributed by a controlled foreign corporation, see section 960 and the regulations under that section.
(e)
Information to be furnished.
If the credit for foreign income taxes claimed under section 901 includes foreign income taxes deemed paid under section 902 and paragraph (b) of this section, the domestic shareholder must furnish the same information with respect to the foreign income taxes deemed paid as it is required to furnish with respect to the foreign income taxes it directly paid or accrued and for which the credit is claimed. See § 1.905-2. For other information required to be furnished by the domestic shareholder for the annual accounting period of certain foreign corporations ending with or within the shareholder's taxable year, and for reduction in the amount of foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed paid for failure to furnish the required information, see section 6038 and the regulations under that section.
(f)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section:

# Example 1.
Since 1987, domestic corporation M has owned 10 percent of the one class of stock of foreign corporation A. The remaining 90 percent of Corporation A's stock is owned by Z, a foreign corporation. Corporation A is not a controlled foreign corporation. Corporation A uses the u as its functional currency, and 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. Both Corporation A and Corporation M use the calendar year as the taxable year. In 1992, Corporation A pays a 30u dividend out of post-1986 undistributed earnings, 3u to Corporation M and 27u to Corporation Z. Corporation M is deemed, under paragraph (b) of this section, to have paid a portion of the post-1986 foreign income taxes paid by Corporation A and includes the amount of foreign taxes deemed paid in gross income under section 78 as a dividend. Both the foreign taxes deemed paid and the dividend would be subject to a separate limitation for dividends from Corporation A, a noncontrolled section 902 corporation. Under paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section, Corporation A must reduce its post-1986 undistributed earnings as of January 1, 1993, by the total amount of dividends paid to Corporation M and Corporation Z in 1992. Under paragraph (a)(8)(i) of this section, Corporation A must reduce its post-1986 foreign income taxes as of January 1, 1993, by the amount of foreign income taxes that were deemed paid by Corporation M and by the amount of foreign income taxes that would have been deemed paid by Corporation Z had Corporation Z been eligible to compute an amount of foreign income taxes deemed paid with respect to the dividend received from Corporation A. Foreign income taxes deemed paid by Corporation M and Corporation A's opening balances in post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes for 1993 are computed as follows:
1. Assumed post-1986 undistributed earnings of Corporation A at start of 1992

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that Corporation M has also owned 10 percent of the one class of stock of foreign corporation B since 1987. Corporation B uses the calendar year as the taxable year. The remaining 90 percent of Corporation B's stock is owned by Corporation Z. Corporation B is not a controlled foreign corporation. Corporation B uses the u as its functional currency, and 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. In 1992, Corporation B has earnings and profits and pays foreign income taxes, a portion of which are attributable to high withholding tax interest, as defined in section 904(d)(2)(B)(i). Corporation B must reduce its pool of post-1986 foreign income taxes by the amount of tax imposed on high withholding tax interest in excess of 5 percent because that amount is not treated as a tax for purposes of section 902. See section 904(d)(2)(E)(ii) and paragraph (a)(8)(iii) of this section. Corporation B pays 50u in dividends in 1992, 5u to Corporation M and 45u to Corporation Z. Corporation M must compute its section 902(a) deemed paid taxes separately for the dividends it receives in 1992 from Corporation A (as computed in
Example 1
) and from Corporation B. Foreign income taxes of Corporation B deemed paid by Corporation M, and Corporation B's opening balances in post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes for 1993 are computed as follows:
1. Assumed post-1986 undistributed earnings of Corporation B at start of 1992

(ii) For 1992, as computed in
Example 1,
Corporation M is deemed to have paid $2 of the post-1986 foreign income taxes paid by Corporation A and includes $2 in gross income as a dividend under section 78. Both the income inclusion and the credit are subject to a separate limitation for dividends from Corporation A, a noncontrolled section 902 corporation. Corporation M also is deemed to have paid $5 of the post-1986 foreign income taxes paid by Corporation B and includes $5 in gross income as a deemed dividend under section 78. Both the income inclusion and the foreign taxes deemed paid are subject to a separate limitation for dividends from Corporation B, a noncontrolled section 902 corporation.

# Example 3.
(i) Since 1987, domestic corporation M has owned 50 percent of the one class of stock of foreign corporation A. The remaining 50 percent of Corporation A is owned by foreign corporation Z. For the same time period, Corporation A has owned 40 percent of the one class of stock of foreign corporation B, and Corporation B has owned 30 percent of the one class of stock of foreign corporation C. The remaining 60 percent of Corporation B is owned by foreign corporation Y, and the remaining 70 percent of Corporation C is owned by foreign corporation X. Corporations A, B, and C are not controlled foreign corporations. Corporations A, B, and C use the u as their functional currency, and 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. Corporation B uses a fiscal year ending June 30 as its taxable year; all other corporations use the calendar year as the taxable year. On February 1, 1992, Corporation C pays a 500u
dividend out of post-1986 undistributed earnings, 150u to Corporation B and 350u to Corporation X. On February 15, 1992, Corporation B pays a 300u dividend out of post-1986 undistributed earnings computed as of the close of Corporation B's fiscal year ended June 30, 1992, 120u to Corporation A and 180u to Corporation Y. On August 15, 1992, Corporation A pays a 200u dividend out of post-1986 undistributed earnings, 100u to Corporation M and 100u to Corporation Z. In computing foreign taxes deemed paid by Corporations B and A, section 78 does not apply and Corporations B and A thus do not have to include the foreign taxes deemed paid in earnings and profits. See paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Foreign income taxes deemed paid by Corporations B, A and M, and the foreign corporations' opening balances in post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes for Corporation B's fiscal year beginning July 1, 1992, and Corporation C's and Corporation A's 1993 calendar years are computed as follows:

(ii) Corporation M is deemed, under section 902(a) and paragraph (b) of this section, to have paid $60.50 of post-1986 foreign income taxes paid, or deemed paid, by Corporation A on or with respect to its post-1986 undistributed earnings (Part C, Line 10) and Corporation M includes that amount in gross income as a dividend under section 78. Both the income inclusion and the credit are subject to a separate limitation for dividends from Corporation A, a noncontrolled section 902 corporation.

# Example 4.
(i) Since 1987, domestic corporation M has owned 100 percent of the voting stock of controlled foreign corporation A, and Corporation A has owned 100 percent of the voting stock of controlled foreign corporation B. Corporations M, A and B use the calendar year as the taxable year. Corporations A and B are organized in the same foreign country and use the u as their functional currency. 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. Assume that all of the earnings of Corporations A and B are general limitation earnings and profits within the meaning of section 904(d)(2)(I), and that neither Corporation A nor Corporation B has any previously taxed income accounts. In 1992, Corporation B pays a dividend of 150u to Corporation A out of post-1986 undistributed earnings, and Corporation A computes an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid under section 902(b)(1). The dividend is not subpart F income to Corporation A because section 954(c)(3)(B)(i) (the same country dividend exception) applies. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, Corporation A is not required to include the deemed paid taxes in earnings and profits. Corporation A has no pre-1987 accumulated profits and a deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings for 1992. In 1992, Corporation A pays a dividend of 100u to Corporation M out of its earnings and profits for 1992 (current earnings and profits). Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, Corporation M is not deemed to have paid any of the foreign income taxes paid or deemed paid by Corporation A because Corporation A has a deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings as of December 31, 1992, and the sum of its current plus accumulated profits is less than zero. Note that if instead of paying a dividend to Corporation A in 1992, Corporation B had made an additional investment of $150 in United States property under section 956, that amount would have been included in gross income by Corporation M under section 951(a)(1)(B) and Corporation M would have been deemed to have paid $50 of foreign income taxes paid by Corporation B. See sections 951(a)(1)(B) and 960. Foreign income taxes of Corporation B deemed paid by Corporation A and the opening balances in post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes for Corporation A and Corporation B for 1993 are computed as follows:
A. Corporation B (second-tier corporation):

(ii) For 1993, Corporation A has 500u of earnings and profits on which it pays 160u of foreign income taxes. Corporation A receives no dividends from Corporation B, and pays a 100u dividend to Corporation M. The 100u dividend to Corporation M carries with it some of the foreign income taxes paid and deemed paid by Corporation A in 1992, which were not deemed paid by Corporation M in 1992 because Corporation A had no post-1986 undistributed earnings. Thus, for 1993, Corporation M is deemed to have paid $125 of post-1986 foreign income taxes paid and deemed paid by Corporation A and includes that amount in gross income as a dividend under section 78, determined as follows:
1. Post-1986 undistributed earnings in Corporation A at start of 1993

# Example 5.
(i) Since 1987, domestic corporation M has owned 100 percent of the voting stock of controlled foreign corporation A. Corporation M also conducts operations through a foreign branch. Both Corporation A and Corporation M use the calendar year as the taxable year. Corporation A uses the u as its functional currency and 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. Corporation A has no subpart F income, as defined in section 952, and no increase in earnings invested in United States property under section 956 for 1992. Corporation A also has no previously taxed income accounts. Corporation A has general limitation income and high withholding tax interest income that, by operation of section 954(b)(4), does not constitute foreign base company income under section 954(a). Because Corporation A is a controlled foreign corporation, it is not required to reduce post-1986 foreign income taxes by foreign taxes paid or accrued with respect to high withholding tax interest in excess of 5 percent. See § 1.902-1(a)(8)(iii). Corporation A pays a 60u dividend to Corporation M in 1992. For 1992, Corporation M is deemed, under paragraph (b) of this section, to have paid $24 of the post-1986 foreign income taxes paid by Corporation A and includes that amount in gross income under section 78 as a dividend, determined as follows:

§ 1.902-2
Treatment of deficits in post-1986 undistributed earnings and pre-1987 accumulated profits of a first- or lower-tier corporation for purposes of computing an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid under § 1.902-1.
(a)
Carryback of deficits in post-1986 undistributed earnings of a first- or lower-tier corporation to pre-effective date taxable years
—(1)
Rule.
For purposes of computing foreign income taxes deemed paid under § 1.902-1(b) with respect to dividends paid by a first- or lower-tier corporation, when there is a deficit in the post-1986 undistributed earnings of that corporation and the corporation makes a distribution to shareholders that is a dividend or
would be a dividend if there were current or accumulated earnings and profits, then the post-1986 deficit shall be carried back to the most recent pre-effective date taxable year of the first- or lower-tier corporation with positive accumulated profits computed under section 902. See § 1.902-3(e). For purposes of this § 1.902-2, a pre-effective date taxable year is a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987, or a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, if the special effective date of § 1.902-1(a)(13) applies. The deficit shall reduce the section 902 accumulated profits in the most recent pre-effective date year to the extent thereof, and any remaining deficit shall be carried back to the next preceding year or years until the deficit is completely allocated. The amount carried back shall reduce the deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings. Any foreign income taxes paid in a post-effective date year will not be carried back to pre-effective date taxable years or removed from post-1986 foreign income taxes. See section 960 and the regulations under that section for rules governing the carryback of deficits and the computation of foreign income taxes deemed paid with respect to deemed income inclusions from controlled foreign corporations.

Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (a):

# Example 1.
(i) From 1985 through 1990, domestic corporation M owns 10 percent of the one class of stock of foreign corporation A. The remaining 90 percent of Corporation A's stock is owned by Z, a foreign corporation. Corporation A is not a controlled foreign corporation and uses the u as its functional currency. 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. Both Corporation A and Corporation M use the calendar year as the taxable year. Corporation A has pre-1987 accumulated profits and post-1986 undistributed earnings or deficits in post-1986 undistributed earnings, pays pre-1987 and post-1986 foreign income taxes, and pays dividends as summarized below:

(ii) On December 31, 1987, Corporation A distributes a 5u dividend to Corporation M and a 45u dividend to Corporation Z. At that time Corporation A has a deficit of (100u) in post-1986 undistributed earnings and $10 of post-1986 foreign income taxes. The (100u) deficit (but not the post-1986 foreign income taxes) is carried back to offset the accumulated profits of 1986 and removed from post-1986 undistributed earnings. The accumulated profits for 1986 are reduced to 50u (150u−100u). The dividend is paid out of the reduced 1986 accumulated profits. Foreign taxes deemed paid by Corporation M with respect to the 5u dividend are 12u (120u × (5u / 50u)). See § 1.902-1(b)(3). Corporation M must include 12u in gross income (translated under the rule applicable to foreign income taxes paid on earnings accumulated in pre-effective date years) under section 78 as a dividend. Both the income inclusion and the foreign taxes deemed paid are subject to a separate limitation for dividends from Corporation A, a noncontrolled section 902 corporation. No accumulated profits remain in Corporation A with respect to 1986 after the carryback of the 1987 deficit and the December 31, 1987, dividend distributions to Corporations M and Z.
(iii) On December 31, 1989, Corporation A distributes a 5u dividend to Corporation M and a 45u dividend to Corporation Z. At that time Corporation A has 100u of post-1986 undistributed earnings and $60 of post-1986 foreign income taxes. Therefore, the dividend is considered paid out of Corporation A's post-1986 undistributed earnings. Foreign taxes deemed paid by Corporation M with respect
to the 5u dividend are $3 ($60 × 5%[5u / 100u]). Corporation M must include $3 in gross income under section 78 as a dividend. Both the income inclusion and the foreign taxes deemed paid are subject to a separate limitation for dividends from noncontrolled section 902 corporation A. Corporation A's post-1986 undistributed earnings as of January 1, 1990, are 50u (100u−50u). Corporation A's post-1986 foreign income taxes must be reduced by the amount of foreign taxes that would have been deemed paid if both Corporations M and Z were eligible to compute an amount of deemed paid taxes. Section 1.902-1(a)(8)(i). The amount of foreign income taxes that would have been deemed paid if both Corporations M and Z were eligible to compute an amount of deemed paid taxes on the 50u dividend distributed by Corporation A is $30 ($60 × 50%[50u / 100u]). Thus, post-1986 foreign income taxes as of January 1, 1990, are $30 ($60−$30).

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that Corporation A has a deficit in its post-1986 undistributed earnings of (150u) on December 31, 1987. The deficit is carried back to 1986 and reduces accumulated profits for that year to -0-. Thus, the foreign income taxes paid with respect to the 1986 accumulated profits will never be deemed paid. The 1987 dividend is deemed to be out of Corporation A's 1985 accumulated profits. Foreign taxes deemed paid by Corporation M under section 902 with respect to the 5u dividend paid on December 31, 1987, are 4u (120u × 5u / 150u). See § 1.902-1(b)(3). As a result of the December 31, 1987, dividend distributions, 100u (150u−50u) of accumulated profits and 80u (120u reduced by 40u[120u × 50u / 150u] of foreign taxes that would have been deemed paid had all of Corporation A's shareholders been eligible to compute an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to the dividend paid out of 1985 accumulated profits) remain in Corporation A with respect to 1985.

# Example 3.
(i) From 1986 through 1991, domestic corporation M owns 10 percent of the one class of stock of foreign corporation A. The remaining 90 percent of Corporation A's stock is owned by Corporation Z, a foreign corporation. Corporation A is not a controlled foreign corporation and uses the u as its functional currency. 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. Both Corporation A and Corporation M use the calendar year as the taxable year. Corporation A has pre-1987 accumulated profits and post-1986 undistributed earnings or deficits in post-1986 undistributed earnings, pays pre-1987 and post-1986 foreign income taxes, and pays dividends as summarized below:

(ii) On December 31, 1988, Corporation A distributes a 10u dividend to Corporation M and a 90u dividend to Corporation Z. At that time Corporation A has 100u in its post-1986 undistributed earnings and $120 in its post-1986 foreign income taxes. Corporation M is deemed, under § 1.902-1(b)(1), to have paid $12 ($120 × 10%[10u / 100u]) of the post-1986 foreign income taxes paid by Corporation A and includes that amount in gross income under section 78 as a dividend. Both the income inclusion and the foreign taxes deemed paid are subject to a separate limitation for dividends from noncontrolled section 902 corporation A. Corporation A's post-1986 undistributed earnings as of January 1, 1989, are 0 (100u-100u). Its post-1986 foreign taxes as of January 1, 1989, also are 0, $120 reduced by $120 of foreign income taxes paid that would have been deemed paid if both Corporations M and Z were eligible to compute an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid on the dividend from Corporation A ($120 × 100%[100u / 100u]).
(iii) On December 31, 1990, Corporation A distributes a 12u dividend to Corporation M and a 108u dividend to Corporation Z. At that time Corporation A has 100u in its post-1986 undistributed earnings and $40 in its post-1986 foreign income taxes. The dividend is paid out of post-1986 undistributed earnings to the extent thereof (100u), and the remainder of 20u is paid out of 1986 accumulated profits. Under § 1.902-1(b)(2), the 12u dividend to Corporation M is deemed to be paid out of
post-1986 undistributed earnings to the extent of 10u (100u × 12u / 120u) and the remaining 2u is deemed to be paid out of Corporation A's 1986 accumulated profits. Similarly, the 108u dividend to Corporation Z is deemed to be paid out of post-1986 undistributed earnings to the extent of 90u (100u × 108u / 120u) and the remaining 18u is deemed to be paid out of Corporation A's 1986 accumulated profits. Foreign income taxes deemed paid by Corporation M under section 902 with respect to the portion of the dividend paid out of post-1986 undistributed earnings are $4 ($40 × 10%[10u / 100u]), and foreign taxes deemed paid by Corporation M with respect to the portion of the dividend deemed paid out of 1986 accumulated profits are 1.6u (80u × 2u / 100u). Corporation M must include $4 plus 1.6u translated under the rule applicable to foreign income taxes paid on earnings accumulated in taxable years prior to the effective date of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 in gross income as a dividend under section 78. The income inclusion and the foreign income taxes deemed paid are subject to a separate limitation for dividends from noncontrolled section 902 Corporation A. As of January 1, 1991, Corporation A's post-1986 undistributed earnings are 0 (100u-100u). 80u (100u-20u) of accumulated profits remain with respect to 1986. Post-1986 foreign income taxes as of January 1, 1991, are 0, $40 reduced by $40 of foreign income taxes paid that would have been deemed paid if both Corporations M and Z were eligible to compute an amount of deemed paid taxes on the 100u dividend distributed by Corporation A out of post-1986 undistributed earnings ($40 × 100%[100u / 100u]). Corporation A has 64u of foreign income taxes remaining with respect to 1986, 80u reduced by 16u [80u × 20u / 100u] of foreign income taxes that would have been deemed paid if Corporations M and Z both were eligible to compute an amount of deemed paid taxes on the 20u dividend distributed by Corporation A out of 1986 accumulated profits.
(b)
Carryforward of deficit in pre-1987 accumulated profits of a first- or lower-tier corporation to post-1986 undistributed earnings for purposes of section 902
—(1)
General rule.
For purposes of computing foreign income taxes deemed paid under § 1.902-1(b) with respect to dividends paid by a first- or lower-tier corporation out of post-1986 undistributed earnings, the amount of a deficit in accumulated profits of the foreign corporation determined under section 902 as of the end of its last pre-effective date taxable year is carried forward and reduces post-1986 undistributed earnings on the first day of the foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, or on the first day of the first taxable year in which the ownership requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B) and § 1.902-1(a)(1) through (4) are met if the special effective date of § 1.902-1(a)(13) applies. Any foreign income taxes paid with respect to a pre-effective date year shall not be carried forward and included in post-1986 foreign income taxes. Post-1986 undistributed earnings may not be reduced by the amount of a pre-1987 deficit in earnings and profits computed under section 964(a). See section 960 and the regulations under that section for rules governing the carryforward of deficits and the computation of foreign income taxes deemed paid with respect to deemed income inclusions from controlled foreign corporations. For translation rules governing carryforwards of deficits in pre-1987 accumulated profits to post-1986 taxable years of a foreign corporation with a dollar functional currency, see § 1.985-6(d)(2).
(2)
Effect of pre-effective date deficit.
If a foreign corporation has a deficit in accumulated profits as of the end of its last pre-effective date taxable year, then the foreign corporation cannot pay a dividend out of pre-effective date years unless there is an adjustment made (for example, a refund of foreign taxes paid) that restores section 902 accumulated profits to a pre-effective date taxable year or years. Moreover, if a foreign corporation has a deficit in section 902 accumulated profits as of the end of its last pre-effective date taxable year, then no deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings will be carried back under paragraph (a) of this section. For rules concerning carrybacks of eligible deficits from post-1986 undistributed earnings to reduce pre-1987 earnings and profits computed under section 964(a), see section 960 and the regulations under that section.

Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (b):

# Example 1.
(i) From 1984 through 1988, domestic corporation M owns 10 percent of the one class of stock of foreign corporation A. The remaining 90 percent of Corporation A's stock is owned by Corporation Z, a foreign corporation. Corporation A is not a controlled foreign corporation and uses the u as its functional currency. 1u equals $1 at all
relevant times. Both Corporation A and Corporation M use the calendar year as the taxable year. Corporation A has pre-1987 accumulated profits or deficits in accumulated profits and post-1986 undistributed earnings, pays pre-1987 and post-1986 foreign income taxes, and pays dividends as summarized below:

(ii) On December 31, 1987, Corporation A distributes a 150u dividend, 15u to Corporation M and 135u to Corporation Z. Corporation A has 200u of current earnings and profits for 1987, but its post-1986 undistributed earnings are only 100u as a result of the reduction for pre-1987 accumulated deficits required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Corporation A has $100 of post-1986 foreign income taxes. Only 100u of the 150u distribution is a dividend out of post-1986 undistributed earnings. Foreign income taxes deemed paid by Corporation M in 1987 with respect to the 10u dividend attributable to post-1986 undistributed earnings, computed under § 1.902-1(b), are $10 ($100 × 10%[10u/100u]). Corporation M includes this amount in gross income under section 78 as a dividend. Both the income inclusion and the foreign taxes deemed paid are subject to a separate limitation for dividends from noncontrolled section 902 corporation A. After the distribution, Corporation A has (50u) of post-1986 undistributed earnings (100u −150u) and -0- post-1986 foreign income taxes, $100 reduced by $100 of foreign income taxes paid that would have been deemed paid if both Corporations M and Z were eligible to compute an amount of deemed paid taxes on the 100u dividend distributed by Corporation A out of post-1986 undistributed earnings ($100 × 100%[100u / 100u]).
(iii) The remaining 50u of the 150u distribution cannot be deemed paid out of accumulated profits of a pre-1987 year because Corporation A has an accumulated deficit as of the end of 1986 that eliminated all pre-1987 accumulated profits. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The 50u is a dividend out of current earnings and profits under section 316(a)(2), but Corporation M is not deemed to have paid any additional foreign income taxes paid by Corporation A with respect to that 50u dividend out of current earnings and profits. See § 1.902-1(b)(4).

# Example 2.
(i) From 1986 through 1991, domestic corporation M owns 10 percent of the one class of stock of foreign corporation A.

Corporation A is not a controlled foreign corporation and uses the u as its functional currency. 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. Both Corporation A and Corporation M use the calendar year as the taxable year. Corporation A has pre-1987 accumulated profits or deficits in accumulated profits and post-1986 undistributed earnings, pays post-1986 foreign income taxes, and pays dividends as summarized below:

(ii) On December 31, 1987, Corporation A distributes a 10u dividend to Corporation M and a 90u dividend to Corporation Z. At the time of the distribution, Corporation A has 50u of post-1986 undistributed earnings and 150u of current earnings and profits. Thus,
50u of the dividend distribution (5u to Corporation M and 45u to Corporation Z) is a dividend out of post-1986 undistributed earnings. The remaining 50u is a dividend out of current earnings and profits under section 316(a)(2), but Corporation M is not deemed to have paid any additional foreign income taxes paid by Corporation A with respect to that 50u dividend out of current earnings and profits. See § 1.902-1(b)(4). Note that even if there were no current earnings and profits in Corporation A, the remaining 50u of the 100u distribution cannot be deemed paid out of accumulated profits of a pre1987 year because Corporation A has an accumulated deficit as of the end of 1986 that eliminated all pre-1987 accumulated profits. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Corporation A has $120 of post-1986 foreign income taxes. Foreign taxes deemed paid by Corporation M under section 902 with respect to the 5u dividend out of post-1986 undistributed earnings are $12 ($120 × 10%[5u/50u]). Corporation M includes this amount in gross income as a dividend under section 78. Both the foreign taxes deemed paid and the deemed dividend are subject to a separate limitation for dividends from noncontrolled section 902 corporation A. As of January 1, 1988, Corporation A has (50u) in its post-1986 undistributed earnings (50u−100u) and -0- in its post-1986 foreign income taxes, $120 reduced by $120 of foreign taxes that would have been deemed paid if both Corporations M and Z were eligible to compute an amount of deemed paid taxes on the dividend distributed by Corporation A out of post-1986 undistributed earnings ($120 × 100%[50u / 50u]).
(iii) On December 31, 1989, Corporation A distributes a 10u dividend to Corporation M and a 90u dividend to Corporation Z. Although the distribution is considered a dividend in its entirety out of 1989 earnings and profits pursuant to section 316(a)(2), post-1986 undistributed earnings are (100u). Accordingly, for purposes of section 902, Corporation M is deemed to have paid no post-1986 foreign income taxes. See § 1.902-1(b)(4). Corporation A's post-1986 undistributed earnings as of January 1, 1990, are (200u) ((100u) − 100u). Corporation A's post-1986 foreign income taxes are not reduced because no taxes were deemed paid.
(iv) On December 31, 1990, Corporation A distributes a 5u dividend to Corporation M and a 45u dividend to Corporation Z. At that time Corporation A has 50u of post-1986 undistributed earnings, and $150 of post-1986 foreign income taxes. Foreign taxes deemed paid by Corporation M under section 902 with respect to the 5u dividend are $15 ($150 × 10%[5u / 50u]). Post-1986 undistributed earnings as of January 1, 1991, are -0- (50u − 50u). Post-1986 foreign income taxes as of January 1, 1991, also are -0-, $150 reduced by $150 ($150 × 100%[50u / 50u]) of foreign income taxes that would have been deemed paid if both Corporations M and Z were eligible to compute an amount of deemed paid taxes on the 50u dividend.

# Example.
On February 10, 1976, foreign corporation B pays a dividend out of its accumulated profits for 1975 to foreign corporation A. On February 16, 1976, the date on which it receives the dividend, A Corporation owns 40 percent of the voting stock of B Corporation. Both corporations use the calendar year as the taxable year. On June 1, 1976, A Corporation sells its stock in B Corporation. On January 17, 1977, A Corporation pays a dividend out of its accumulated profits for 1976 to domestic corporation M. M Corporation owns 30 percent of the voting stock of A Corporation on January 20, 1977, the date on which it receives the dividend. M Corporation uses a fiscal year ending on April 30 as the taxable year. On February 16, 1976, A Corporation satisfies the 10-percent stock ownership requirement referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of this section with respect to B Corporation, and on January 20, 1977, M Corporation satisfies the 10-percent stock-ownership requirement referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section with respect to A Corporation. The 5-percent requirement of this paragraph (c)(1) is also satisfied since 30 percent (the percentage of voting stock owned by M Corporation in A Corporation on January 20, 1977), when multiplied by 40 percent (the percentage of voting stock owned by A Corporation in B Corporation on February 16, 1976), equals 12 percent. Accordingly, for its taxable year ending on April 30, 1977, M Corporation is entitled to a credit for a portion of the foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed to be paid, by A Corporation for 1976; and for 1976 A Corporation is deemed to have paid a portion of the foreign income taxes paid or accrued by B Corporation for 1975.
(2)
Amount of foreign taxes deemed paid by a first-tier corporation.
A first-tier corporation which receives dividends in any taxable year from its second-tier corporation shall be deemed to have paid for such year the same proportion of any foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed, in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section, to be paid by its second-tier corporation on or with respect to the accumulated profits, as defined in paragraph (e) of this section, for the taxable year of the second-tier corporation from which such dividends are paid which the amount of such dividends bears to the amount by which such accumulated profits of the second-tier corporation exceed the taxes so paid or accrued. For determining the amount of the foreign income taxes paid or accrued by such second-tier corporation on or with respect to the accumulated profits for the taxable year of such second-tier corporation, see paragraph (f) of this section.
(d)
Second-tier corporation owning stock in a third-tier corporation
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of applying section 902(b)(1) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if a second-tier corporation receives dividends in any taxable year from its third-tier corporation, the foreign income taxes deemed to be paid by the second-tier corporation on or with respect to its own accumulated profits for such year shall be the amount determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section. This paragraph (d) shall not apply unless the product of—
(i) The percentage of voting stock arrived at in applying the 5-percent requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to dividends received by the first-tier corporation from the second-tier corporation, and
(ii) the percentage of voting stock owned by the second-tier corporation in the third-tier corporation equals at least 5 percent. The percentage under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section of voting stock owned by the second-tier corporation in the third-tier corporation is determined as of the time that the dividend distributed by the third-tier corporation is received by the second-tier corporation and thus included in accumulated profits of the second-tier corporation out of which dividends referred to in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section are distributed by the second-tier corporation to the first-tier corporation.

# Example.
On February 27, 1975, foreign corporation C pays a dividend out of its accumulated profits for 1974 to foreign corporation B. On March 3, 1975, the date on which it receives the dividend, B Corporation owns 50 percent of the voting stock of C Corporation. On February 10, 1976, B Corporation pays a dividend out of its accumulated profits for 1975 to foreign corporation A. On February 16, 1976, the date on which it receives the dividend, A Corporation owns 40 percent of the voting stock of B Corporation. All three corporations use the calendar year as the taxable year. On January 17, 1977, A Corporation pays a dividend out of its accumulated profits for 1976 to domestic corporation M. M Corporation owns 30 percent of the voting stock of A Corporation on January 20, 1977, the date on which it receives the dividend. M Corporation uses a fiscal year ending on April 30 as the taxable year. On February 16, 1976, A Corporation satisfies the 10-percent stock ownership requirement referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of this section with respect to B Corporation, and on January 20, 1977, M Corporation satisfies the 10-percent stock-ownership requirement referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section with respect to A Corporation. The 5-percent requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section is also satisfied since 30 percent (the percentage of voting stock owned by M Corporation in A Corporation on January 20, 1977), when multiplied by 40 percent (the percentage of voting stock owned by A Corporation in B Corporation on February 16, 1976), equals 12 percent. On March 3, 1975, B Corporation satisfies the 10 percent stock ownership requirement referred to in paragraph (a)(4) of this section with respect to C Corporation. The 5-percent requirement of this paragraph (d)(1) is also satisfied since 12 percent (the percentage of voting stock arrived at in applying the 5-percent requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to the dividends received by A Corporation from B Corporation on February 16, 1976), when multiplied by 50 percent (the percentage of voting stock owned by B Corporation in C Corporation on March 3, 1975), equals 6 percent. Accordingly, for its taxable year ending on April 30, 1977, M Corporation is entitled to a credit for a portion of the foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed to be paid, by A Corporation for 1976; for 1976 A Corporation is deemed to have paid a portion of the foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed to be paid, by B Corporation for 1975; and for 1975 B Corporation is deemed to have paid a portion of the foreign income taxes paid or accrued by C Corporation for 1974.
(2)
Amount of foreign taxes deemed paid by a second-tier corporation.
For purposes of applying paragraph (c)(2) of this section to a first-tier corporation, a second-tier corporation which receives dividends in its taxable year from its third-tier corporation shall be deemed to have paid for such year the same proportion of any foreign income taxes paid or accrued by its third-tier corporation on or with respect to the accumulated profits, as defined in paragraph (e) of this section, for the taxable year of the third-tier corporation from which such dividends are paid which the amount of such dividends bears to the amount by which such accumulated profits of the third-tier corporation exceed the taxes so paid or accrued. For determining the amount of the foreign income taxes paid or accrued by such third-tier corporation on or with respect to the accumulated profits for the taxable year
of such third-tier corporation, see paragraph (f) of this section.
(e)
Determination of accumulated profits of a foreign corporation.
The accumulated profits for any taxable year of a first-tier corporation and the accumulated profits for any taxable year of a second-tier or third-tier corporation, which are taken into account in applying paragraph (c)(2) or (d)(2) of this section with respect to such first-tier corporation, shall be the sum of—

In making such determination the district director shall, unless it is otherwise established to his satisfaction, treat any dividends which are paid in the first 60 days of any taxable year of such a corporation as having been paid from the accumulated profits of the preceding taxable year or years of such corporation and shall, in other respects, treat any dividends as having been paid from the most recently accumulated profits. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(4), in the case of a foreign corporation the foreign income taxes of which are determined on the basis of an accounting period of less than 1 year, the term “year” shall mean such accounting period.

Effective date.
Except as provided in § 1.902-4, this section applies to any distribution received from a first-tier
corporation by its domestic shareholder after December 31, 1964, and before the beginning of the foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986. If, however, the first day on which the ownership requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B) and § 1.902-1(a)(1) through (4) are met with respect to the foreign corporation is in a taxable year of the foreign corporation beginning after December 31, 1986, then this section shall apply to all taxable years beginning after December 31, 1964, and before the year in which the ownership requirements are first met. See § 1.902-1(a)(13)(i). For corresponding rules applicable to distributions received by the domestic shareholder prior to January 1, 1965, see § 1.902-5 as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised April 1, 1976.

§ 1.902-4
Rules for distributions attributable to accumulated profits for taxable years in which a first-tier corporation was a less developed country corporation.
(a)
In general.
If a domestic shareholder receives a distribution from a first-tier corporation before January 1, 1978, in a taxable year of the domestic shareholder beginning after December 31, 1964, which is attributable to accumulated profits of the first-tier corporation for a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1976, in which the first-tier corporation was a less developed country corporation (as defined in 26 CFR § 1.902-2 revised as of April 1, 1978), then the amount of the credit deemed paid by the domestic shareholder with respect to such distribution shall be calculated under the rules relating to less developed country corporations contained in (26 CFR § 1.902-1 revised as of April 1, 1978).
(b)
Combined distributions.
If a domestic shareholder receives a distribution before January 1, 1978, from a first-tier corporation, a portion of which is described in paragraph (a) of this section, and a portion of which is attributable to accumulated profits of the first-tier corporation for a year in which the first-tier corporation was not a less developed country corporation, then the amount of taxes deemed paid by the domestic shareholder shall be computed separately on each portion of the dividend. The taxes deemed paid on that portion of the dividend described in paragraph (a) shall be computed as specified in paragraph (a). The taxes deemed paid on that portion of the dividend described in this paragraph (b), shall be computed as specified in § 1.902-3.
(c)
Distributions of a first-tier corporation attributable to certain distributions from second- or third-tier corporations.
Paragraph (a) shall apply to a distribution received by a domestic shareholder before January 1, 1978, from a first-tier corporation out of accumulated profits for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1975, if:
(1) The distribution is attributable to a distribution received by the first-tier corporation from a second- or third-tier corporation in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1975.
(2) The distribution from the second- or third-tier corporation is made out of accumulated profits of the second- or third-tier corporation for a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1976, and
(3) The first-tier corporation would have qualified as a less developed country corporation under section 902(d) (as in effect on December 31, 1975), in the taxable year in which it received the distribution.
(d)
Illustrations.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
M, a domestic corporation owns all of the one class of stock of foreign corporation A. Both corporations use the calendar year as the taxable year. A Corporation pays a dividend to M Corporation on January 1, 1977, partly out of its accumulated profits for calendar year 1976 and partly out of its accumulated profits for calendar year 1975. For 1975 A Corporation qualified as a less developed country corporation under the former section 902(d) (as in effect on December 31, 1975). M Corporation is deemed under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section to have paid $63 of foreign income taxes paid by A Corporation on or with respect to its accumulated profits for 1976 and 1975 and M Corporation includes $36 of that amount in gross income as a dividend under section 78,
determined as follows upon the basis of the facts assumed:

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example 1, except that the distribution from A Corporation to M Corporation on January 1, 1977, was from accumulated profits of A Corporation for 1976. A Corporation's accumulated profits for 1976 were made up of income from its trade or business, and a dividend paid by B, a second-tier corporation in 1976. The dividend from B Corporation to A Corporation was from accumulated profits of B Corporation for 1975. A Corporation would have qualified as a less developed country corporation for 1976 under the former section 902(d) (as in effect on December 31, 1975). M Corporation is deemed under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section to have paid $543 of the foreign taxes paid or deemed paid by A Corporation on or with respect to its accumulated profits for 1976, and M Corporation includes $360 of that amount in gross income as a dividend under section 78, determined as follows upon the basis of the facts assumed:

§ 1.903-1
Taxes in lieu of income taxes.
(a)
Overview.
Section 903 provides that the term “income, war profits, and excess profits taxes” includes a tax paid in lieu of a tax on income, war profits, or excess profits that is otherwise generally imposed by any foreign country. Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section define a tax described in section 903. Paragraph (d) of this section provides examples illustrating the application of this section. Paragraph (e) of this section sets forth the applicability date of this section. For purposes of this section and §§ 1.901-2 and 1.901-2A, a tax described in section 903 is referred to as a “tax in lieu of an income tax” or an “in lieu of tax” and the definitions in § 1.901-2(g) apply for purposes of this section. Determinations of the amount of a tax in lieu of an income tax that is paid by a person and determinations of the person by whom such tax is paid are made under § 1.901-2(e) and (f), respectively. Section 1.901-2A contains additional rules applicable to dual capacity taxpayers (as defined in § 1.901-2(a)(2)(ii)(A)).
(b)
Definition of tax in lieu of an income tax
—(1)
In general.
Paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of this section provide the requirements for a foreign levy to qualify as a tax in lieu of an income tax. The rules of this section are applied independently to each separate levy (within the meaning of §§ 1.901-2(d) and 1.901-2A(a)). A foreign tax either is or is not a tax in lieu of an income tax in its entirety for all persons subject to the tax. It is immaterial whether the base of the in lieu of tax bears any relation to realized net gain. The base of the foreign tax may, for example, be gross income, gross receipts or sales, or the number of units produced or exported. The foreign country's reason for imposing a foreign tax on a base other than net income (for example, because of administrative difficulty in determining the amount of income that would otherwise be subject to a net income tax) is immaterial, although paragraph (c)(1) of this section generally requires a showing that the foreign country made a deliberate and cognizant choice to impose the in lieu of tax instead of a net income tax (see paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section).
(2)
Requirements.
A foreign levy is a tax in lieu of an income tax only if—
(i) It is a foreign tax; and
(ii) It satisfies the substitution requirement of paragraph (c) of this section.
(c)
Substitution requirement
—(1)
In general.
A foreign tax (the “tested foreign tax”) satisfies the substitution requirement if, based on the foreign tax law, the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section are satisfied with respect to the tested foreign tax, or the tested foreign tax is a covered withholding tax described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(i)
Existence of generally-imposed net income tax.
A separate levy that is a net income tax (as described in § 1.901-2(a)(3)) is generally imposed by the same foreign country (the “generally-imposed net income tax”) that imposes the tested foreign tax.
(ii)
Non-duplication.
Neither the generally-imposed net income tax nor any other separate levy that is a net income tax is also imposed, in addition to the tested foreign tax, by the same foreign country on any persons with respect to any portion of the income to which the amounts (such as sales or units of production) that form the base of the tested foreign tax relate (the “excluded income”). Therefore, a tested foreign tax does not meet the requirement of this paragraph (c)(1)(ii) if a net income tax imposed by the same foreign country applies to the excluded income of any persons that are subject to the tested foreign tax, even if not all persons subject to the tested foreign tax are subject to the net income tax.
(iii)
Close connection to excluded income.
But for the existence of the tested foreign tax, the generally-imposed net income tax would otherwise have been imposed on the excluded income. The requirement in the preceding sentence is met only if the imposition of such tested foreign tax bears a close connection to the failure to impose the
generally-imposed net income tax on the excluded income; the relationship cannot be merely incidental, tangential, or minor. A close connection must be established with proof that the foreign country made a cognizant and deliberate choice to impose the tested foreign tax instead of the generally-imposed net income tax. Such proof must be based on foreign tax law, or the legislative history of either the tested foreign tax or the generally-imposed net income tax that describes the provisions excluding taxpayers subject to the tested foreign tax from the generally-imposed net income tax. Thus, a close connection exists if the generally-imposed net income tax would apply by its terms to the excluded income, but for the fact that the excluded income is expressly excluded, and the tested foreign tax is enacted contemporaneously with the generally-imposed net income tax. A close connection also exists if the generally-imposed net income tax by its terms does not apply to, but does not expressly exclude, the excluded income, and the tested foreign tax is enacted contemporaneously with the generally-imposed net income tax. Where the tested foreign tax is not enacted contemporaneously with the generally-imposed net income tax and the generally-imposed net income tax is not amended contemporaneously with the enactment of the tested foreign tax to exclude the excluded income or to narrow the scope of the generally-imposed net income tax so as not to apply to the excluded income, a close connection can be established only by reference to the legislative history of the tested foreign tax (or a predecessor in lieu of tax). Not all income derived by persons subject to the tested foreign tax need be excluded income, provided the tested foreign tax applies only to amounts that relate to the excluded income.
(iv)
Jurisdiction to tax excluded income.
If the generally-imposed net income tax, or a hypothetical new tax that is a separate levy with respect to the generally-imposed net income tax, were applied to the excluded income, such generally-imposed net income tax or separate levy would meet the attribution requirement described in § 1.901-2(b)(5).
(2)
Covered withholding tax.
A tested foreign tax is a covered withholding tax if, based on the foreign tax law, the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section are met with respect to the tested foreign tax. See also § 1.901-2(d)(1)(iii) for rules treating withholding taxes as separate levies with respect to each class of income subject to the tax or with respect to each subset of a class of income that is subject to different income attribution rules.
(i)
Withholding tax on nonresidents.
The tested foreign tax is a withholding tax (as defined in section 901(k)(1)(B)) that is imposed on gross income of persons who are nonresidents of the foreign country imposing the tested foreign tax. It is immaterial whether the tested foreign tax is withheld by the payor or is imposed directly on the nonresident taxpayer.
(ii)
Non-duplication.
The tested foreign tax is not in addition to any net income tax that is imposed by the foreign country on any portion of the net income attributable to the gross income that is subject to the tested foreign tax. Therefore, a tested foreign tax does not meet the requirement of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii) if by its terms it applies to gross income of nonresidents that are also subject to a net income tax imposed by the same foreign country on the same income, even if not all nonresidents subject to the tested foreign tax are also subject to the net income tax.
(iii)
Source-based attribution requirement.
The income subject to the tested foreign tax satisfies the attribution requirement described in § 1.901-2(b)(5)(i)(B).
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section.
(1)
Example 1: Tax on gross income from services; non-duplication requirement
—(i)
Facts.
Country X imposes a tax at the rate of 3 percent on the gross receipts of companies, wherever resident, from furnishing specified types of electronically supplied services to customers located in Country X (the “ESS tax”). No deductions are allowed in determining the taxable base of the ESS tax. In addition to the ESS tax, Country X imposes a net income tax within
the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(3) on resident companies (the “resident income tax”) and also imposes a net income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(3) on the income of nonresident companies that is attributable, under reasonable principles, to the nonresident's permanent establishment within Country X (the “nonresident income tax”). Under Country X tax law, a permanent establishment is defined in the same manner as under the 2016 U.S. Model Income Tax Convention. Both the resident income tax and the nonresident income tax, which are separate levies under § 1.901-2(d)(1)(iii), qualify as generally-imposed net income taxes. Under Country X tax law, the ESS tax applies to both resident and nonresident companies regardless of whether the company is also subject to the resident income tax or the nonresident income tax, respectively.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under § 1.901-2(d)(1)(iii), the ESS tax comprises two separate levies, one imposed on resident companies (the “resident ESS tax”), and one imposed on nonresident companies (the “nonresident ESS tax”). Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, neither the resident ESS tax nor the nonresident ESS tax satisfies the substitution requirement, because by its terms the income to which the gross receipts subject to the ESS tax relate is also subject to one of the two generally-imposed net income taxes imposed by Country X. Similarly, under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the nonresident ESS tax is not a covered withholding tax because by its terms it is imposed in addition to the nonresident income tax. The fact that nonresident taxpayers that do not have a permanent establishment in Country X are in practice subject to the nonresident ESS tax but not to the nonresident income tax on the gross receipts included in the base of the nonresident ESS tax is not relevant to the determination of whether the ESS tax meets the substitution requirement under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Therefore, neither the resident ESS tax nor the nonresident ESS tax is a tax in lieu of an income tax.
(2)
Example 2: Tax on gross income from services; attribution of income
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as those in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that under Country X tax law, the nonresident ESS tax is imposed only if the nonresident company does not have a permanent establishment in Country X. If the nonresident company has a Country X permanent establishment, the nonresident income tax applies to the profits attributable to that permanent establishment. In addition, the statutory language and legislative history to the nonresident ESS tax demonstrate that Country X made a cognizant and deliberate choice to impose the nonresident ESS tax instead of the nonresident income tax with respect to the gross receipts that are subject to the nonresident ESS tax.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
General application of substitution requirement.
The nonresident ESS tax meets the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section because Country X has two generally-imposed net income taxes and neither generally-imposed net income tax nor any other separate levy that is a net income tax is imposed by Country X on a nonresident's income to which gross receipts that form the base of the nonresident ESS tax relate (which is the excluded income). The statutory language and legislative history to the nonresident ESS tax demonstrate that Country X made a cognizant and deliberate choice not to impose the nonresident income tax on the excluded income. Therefore, the nonresident ESS tax meets the requirement in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section because, but for the existence of the tested foreign tax, the nonresident income tax would otherwise have been imposed on the excluded income. However, the nonresident ESS tax does not meet the requirement in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, because if Country X had chosen to apply the nonresident income tax (rather than the nonresident ESS tax) to the excluded income, the modified nonresident income tax would fail the attribution requirement in § 1.901-2(b)(5). First, the modified tax would not satisfy the requirement in § 1.901-2(b)(5)(i)(A) because the modified tax would not apply to income attributable under reasonable principles to the nonresident's activities within the foreign
country, since the modified tax is determined by taking into account the location of customers. Second, the modified tax would not satisfy the requirement in § 1.901-2(b)(5)(i)(B) because the excluded income is from services performed outside of Country X. Third, the modified tax would not satisfy the requirement in § 1.901-2(b)(5)(i)(C) because the excluded income is not from sales or dispositions of real property located in Country X or from property forming part of the business property of a taxable presence in Country X. Because the Country X nonresident income tax as applied to the excluded income would fail to meet the attribution requirement in § 1.901-2(b)(5), as required by paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, the nonresident ESS tax does not satisfy the substitution requirement in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(B)
Covered withholding tax analysis.
The nonresident ESS tax meets the requirement in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section because there exists a generally-imposed net income tax. It also meets the requirements in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section because it is a withholding tax on gross receipts of nonresidents and the income attributable to those gross receipts is not subject to a net income tax. However, the nonresident ESS tax does not meet the requirement in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section because the services income subject to the nonresident ESS tax is from electronically supplied services performed outside of Country X. See § 1.901-2(b)(5)(i)(B). Therefore, the nonresident ESS tax is not a covered withholding tax under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Because the nonresident ESS tax does not satisfy the substitution requirement of paragraph (c) of this section, it is not a tax in lieu of an income tax.
(3)
Example 3: Withholding tax on royalties; attribution requirement
—(i)
Facts.
YCo, a resident of Country Y, is a controlled foreign corporation wholly-owned by USP, a domestic corporation. In Year 1, YCo grants a license to XCo, a resident of Country X unrelated to YCo or USP, for the right to use YCo's intangible property (IP) throughout the world, including in Country X. Under Country X's domestic tax law, all royalties paid by a resident of Country X to a nonresident are sourced in Country X and are subject to a 30% withholding tax on the gross income, regardless of whether the nonresident payee has a taxable presence in Country X. Country X's withholding tax on royalties is a separate levy under § 1.901-2(d)(1)(iii). In Year 1, XCo withholds 30u (units of Country X currency) tax from 100u of royalties owed and paid to YCo under the licensing arrangement, of which 50u is attributable to XCo's use of the YCo IP in Country X and 50u is attributable to use of the YCo IP outside Country X. The United States and Country X have an income tax treaty (U.S.-Country X treaty); under the royalties article of the treaty, Country X agreed to impose its withholding tax on royalties paid to a U.S. resident only on royalties paid for IP used in Country X. Country X and Country Y do not have an income tax treaty.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under § 1.901-2(d)(1)(iv), the Country X withholding tax on royalties, as modified by the U.S.-Country X treaty, is a separate levy from the unmodified Country X withholding tax to which YCo was subject (because YCo is not a U.S. resident eligible for benefits under the U.S.-Country X treaty). The Country X withholding tax on royalties, unmodified by the U.S.-Country X treaty, does not meet the attribution requirement in § 1.901-2(b)(5)(i)(B) because Country X's source rule for royalties (based upon residence of the payor) is not reasonably similar to the sourcing rules that apply under the Internal Revenue Code. Thus, under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, the Country X withholding tax paid by YCo is not a covered withholding tax, and none of the 30u of Country X withholding tax paid by YCo with respect to the 100u of royalties for the use of the IP is a payment of foreign income tax.
(4)
Example 4: Withholding tax on royalties; attribution requirement
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section (the facts of
Example 3
), except that XCo only uses the IP in Country X and the 100u of royalties paid to YCo in Year 1 is all attributable to XCo's use of the IP in Country X.
(ii)
Analysis.
The result is the same as in paragraph (d)(3) of this section (the analysis of
Example 3
). Because Country X's source rule for royalties (based upon residence of the payor) is not reasonably similar to the sourcing rules that apply under the Internal Revenue Code, the withholding tax paid by YCo does not meet the attribution requirement in § 1.901-2(b)(5)(i)(B). Under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, the Country X withholding tax paid by YCo is not a covered withholding tax, and none of the 30u of Country X withholding tax paid by YCo with respect to the 100u of royalties for IP used in Country X is a payment of foreign income tax.
(5)
Example 5: Multiple in-lieu-of taxes
—(i)
Facts.
Country X imposes a net income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(3) on the income of nonresident companies that is attributable, under reasonable principles, to the nonresident's activities within Country X (the “trade or business tax”). The trade or business tax applies to all nonresident corporations that engage in business in Country X except for nonresident corporations that engage in insurance activities, which are instead subject to two different taxes (“insurance taxes”). The insurance taxes apply to nonresident corporations that engage in insurance activities that are attributable, under reasonable principles, to the nonresident's activities within Country X. The insurance taxes do not satisfy the cost recovery requirement in § 1.901-2(b)(4). The trade or business tax and the two insurance taxes were enacted contemporaneously, and the statutory language of the trade or business tax expressly excludes gross income derived by nonresident corporations engaged in insurance activities from the trade or business tax.
(ii)
Analysis.
The insurance taxes meet the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section because Country X has a generally-imposed net income tax, the trade or business tax, and neither the trade or business tax nor any other separate levy that is a net income tax is imposed by Country X on a nonresident's gross income to which the amounts that form the base of the insurance taxes (the “excluded income”) relate. The Country X tax law expressly provides that the trade or business tax does not apply to nonresident corporations engaged in insurance activities. In addition, the two insurance taxes were enacted contemporaneously with the trade or business tax. Therefore, it is demonstrated that Country X made a cognizant and deliberate choice to impose the insurance taxes in lieu of the generally-imposed trade or business tax, and the insurance taxes meet the requirement in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section. If the trade or business tax also applied to the excluded income, the trade or business tax would meet the requirement in § 1.901-2(b)(5)(i)(A), because it would apply only to income attributable, under reasonable principles, to the nonresident's activities within the foreign country. Thus, the insurance taxes meet the requirement in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section. Therefore, the insurance taxes satisfy the substitution requirement in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(6)
Example 6: Later-enacted in-lieu-of tax; close connection requirement
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as those in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 5
), except that one of the two insurance taxes applies only to nonresident corporations engaged in the life insurance business in Country X and was enacted five years after the enactment of the trade or business tax and the other insurance tax enacted contemporaneously with the trade or business tax. The legislative history to the later-enacted insurance tax shows that Country X intended to increase the tax imposed on nonresident corporations engaged in life insurance activities and, instead of amending the first insurance tax to increase the rate applicable to life insurance companies, it enacted the second insurance tax that only applies to life insurance corporations.
(ii)
Analysis.
The later-enacted insurance tax meets the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section because Country X has a generally-imposed net income tax, the trade or business tax, and neither the trade or business tax nor any other separate levy that is a net income tax is imposed by Country X on the income
attributable to the activities that form the base of the later-enacted insurance tax. The later-enacted insurance tax meets the requirement in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section because the legislative history to the later-enacted insurance tax demonstrates that Country X made a cognizant and deliberate choice to impose the later-enacted insurance tax on life insurance companies instead of the trade or business tax. The later-enacted insurance tax also meets the requirement of paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section for the reasons set forth in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section. Therefore, the later-enacted insurance tax satisfies the substitution requirement in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(7)
Example 7: Excise tax creditable against net income tax
—(i)
Facts.
Country X imposes an excise tax that does not satisfy the cost recovery requirement in § 1.901-2(b)(4), and a net income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a)(3). The excise tax, which is payable independently of the net income tax, is allowed as a credit against the net income tax. In Year 1, A has a tentative net income tax liability of 100u (units of Country X currency) but is allowed a credit for 30u of excise tax that it paid that year.
(ii)
Analysis.
Pursuant to § 1.901-2(e)(4), the amount of excise tax A has paid to Country X is 30u and the amount of net income tax A has paid to Country X is 70u. The excise tax paid by A does not satisfy the substitution requirement set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section because the excise tax is imposed in addition to, and not in substitution for, the generally-imposed net income tax.
(e)
Applicability dates.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e), this section applies to foreign taxes paid (within the meaning of § 1.901-2(g)(5)) in taxable years beginning on or after December 28, 2021. For foreign taxes paid to Puerto Rico under section 3070.01 of the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code of 2011, as amended (13 L.P.R.A. § 31771) (imposing an excise tax on a controlled group member's acquisition from another group member of certain personal property manufactured or produced in Puerto Rico and certain services performed in Puerto Rico), this section applies to foreign taxes paid (within the meaning of § 1.901-2(g)(5)) in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. For foreign taxes described in the preceding sentence that are paid in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2023, see § 1.903-1 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2021.

§ 1.904-1
Limitation on credit for foreign income taxes.
(a)
In general.
For each separate category described in § 1.904-5(a)(4)(v), the total credit for foreign income taxes (as defined in § 1.901-2(a)) paid or accrued (including those deemed to have been paid or accrued other than by reason of section 904(c)) to any foreign country (as defined in § 1.901-2(g)) does not exceed that proportion of the tax against which such credit is taken which the taxpayer's taxable income from foreign sources (but not in excess of the taxpayer's entire taxable income) in such separate category bears to the taxpayer's entire taxable income for the same taxable year.
(b)
Special computation of taxable income.
For purposes of computing the limitation under paragraph (a) of this section, the taxable income in the case of an individual, estate, or trust is computed without any deduction for personal exemptions under section 151 or 642(b).
(c)
Joint return.
In the case of spouses making a joint return, the applicable limitation prescribed by section 904(a) on the credit for taxes paid or accrued to foreign countries and possessions of the United States is applied with respect to the aggregate taxable income in each separate category from sources without the United States, and the aggregate taxable income from all sources, of the spouses.
(d)
Consolidated group.
For rules relating to the computation of the foreign tax credit limitation for a consolidated group, see § 1.1502-4.
(e)
Applicability dates.
This section applies to taxable years that both begin after December 31, 2017, and end on or after December 4, 2018.
[T.D. 9882, 84 FR 69075, Dec. 17, 2019, as amended by T.D. 9922, 85 FR 72056, Nov. 12, 2020]
§ 1.904-2
Carryback and carryover of unused foreign tax.
(a)
Credit for foreign tax carryback or carryover.
A taxpayer who chooses to claim a credit under section 901 for a taxable year is allowed a credit under that section not only for taxes otherwise allowable as a credit but also for taxes deemed paid or accrued in that year as a result of a carryback or carryover of an unused foreign tax under section 904(c). However, the taxes so deemed paid or accrued are not allowed as a deduction under section 164(a). Foreign tax paid, accrued, or deemed paid under section 960 with respect to section 951A category income, including section 951A category income that is reassigned to a separate category for income resourced under a treaty, may not be carried back or carried forward or deemed paid or accrued under section 904(c). See § 1.904-6 for rules for allocating and apportioning taxes to separate categories. For special rules regarding these computations in case of taxes paid, accrued, or deemed paid with respect to foreign oil and gas extraction income or foreign oil related income, see section 907(f).
(b)
Years to which foreign taxes are carried.
If the taxpayer chooses the benefits of section 901 for a taxable year, any unused foreign tax paid or accrued in that year is carried first to the immediately preceding taxable year and then, as applicable, to each of the ten succeeding taxable years, in chronological order, but only to the extent not absorbed as taxes deemed paid or accrued under paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section in a prior taxable year.
(c)
Definitions.
This paragraph (c) provides definitions that apply for purposes of this section.
(1)
Unused foreign tax.
The term
unused foreign tax
means, with respect to each separate category for any taxable year, the excess of the amount of creditable foreign tax paid or accrued, or deemed paid under section 902 (as in effect on December 21, 2017) or section 960, in such year, over the applicable foreign tax credit limitation under section 904 for the separate category in such year. Unused foreign tax does not include any amount for which a credit is disallowed, including foreign income taxes for which a credit is disallowed or reduced when the tax is paid, accrued, or deemed paid.
(2)
Separate category.
The term
separate category
has the same meaning as provided in § 1.904-5(a)(4)(v).
(3)
Excess limitation
—(i)
In general.
The term
excess limitation
means, with respect to a separate category for any taxable year (the
excess limitation year
) and an unused foreign tax carried from another taxable year (the
excess credit year
), the amount (if any) by which the limitation for that separate category with respect to that excess limitation year exceeds the sum of—
(A) The creditable foreign tax actually paid or accrued or deemed paid under section 902 (as in effect on December 21, 2017) or section 960 with respect to the separate category in the excess limitation year; and
(B) The portion of any unused foreign tax for a taxable year preceding the excess credit year that is absorbed as taxes deemed paid or accrued in the excess limitation year under paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section.
(ii)
Deduction years.
Excess limitation for a taxable year absorbs unused foreign tax, regardless of whether the taxpayer chooses to claim a credit under section 901 for the year. In such case, the amount of the excess limitation, if any, for the year is determined in the same manner as though the taxpayer had chosen to claim a credit under section 901 for that year. For purposes of this determination, if the taxpayer has an overall foreign loss account, the excess limitation in a deduction year is determined based on the amount of the overall foreign loss the taxpayer would have recaptured if the taxpayer had chosen to claim a credit under section 901 for that year and had not made an election under § 1.904(f)-2(c)(2) to recapture more of the overall foreign loss account than is required under § 1.904(f)-2(c)(1).
(d)
Taxes deemed paid or accrued
—(1)
Amount deemed paid or accrued.
The amount of unused foreign tax with respect to a separate category that is deemed paid or accrued in any taxable year to which such unused foreign tax may be carried under paragraph (b) of this section is equal to the smaller of—
(i) The portion of the unused foreign tax that may be carried to the taxable
year under paragraph (b) of this section; or
(ii) The amount, if any, of the excess limitation for such taxable year with respect to the separate category of such unused foreign tax.
(2)
Carryback or carryover tax deemed paid or accrued in the same separate category.
Any unused foreign tax, which is deemed to be paid or accrued under section 904(c) in the year to which it is carried, is deemed to be paid or accrued with respect to the same separate category as the category to which it was assigned in the year in which it was actually paid or accrued. However, see paragraphs (h) through (j) of this section for transition rules in the case of certain carrybacks and carryovers.
(3)
No duplicate disallowance of creditable foreign tax.
Foreign income taxes for which a credit is partially disallowed, including when the tax is paid, accrued, or deemed paid, are not reduced again by reason of the unused foreign tax being deemed to be paid or accrued in the year to which it is carried under section 904(c).
(e)
Periods of less than 12 months.
A fractional part of a year which is a taxable year under sections 441(b) and 7701(a)(23) is a preceding or a succeeding taxable year for the purpose of determining under section 904(c) the years to which the unused foreign tax may be carried, and any unused foreign tax or excess limitation for such fractional part of a year is the unused foreign tax or excess limitation for a taxable year.
(f)
Statement with tax return.
Every taxpayer claiming the benefit of a carryback or carryover of the unused foreign tax to any taxable year for which he chooses to claim a credit under section 901 shall file with his return (or with his claim for refund, if appropriate) for that year as an attachment to his Form 1116 or 1118, as the case may be, a statement setting forth the unused foreign tax deemed paid or accrued under this section and all material and pertinent facts relative thereto, including a detailed schedule showing the computation of the unused foreign tax so carried back or over.
(g) [Reserved]
(h)
Transition rules for carryovers of pre-2003 unused foreign tax and carrybacks of post-2002 unused foreign tax paid or accrued with respect to dividends from noncontrolled section 902 corporations.
For transition rules for carryovers of pre-2003 unused foreign tax, and carrybacks of post-2002 unused foreign tax, paid or accrued with respect to dividends from noncontrolled section 902 corporations, see 26 CFR 1.904-2(h) (revised as of April 1, 2018).
(i)
Transition rules for carryovers of pre-2007 unused foreign tax and carrybacks of post-2006 unused foreign tax.
For transition rules for carryovers of pre-2007 unused foreign tax, and carrybacks of post-2006 unused foreign tax, see 26 CFR 1.904-2(i) (revised as of April 1, 2018).
(j)
Transition rules for carryovers and carrybacks of pre-2018 and post-2017 unused foreign tax
—(1)
Carryover of unused foreign tax
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (j), the terms
post-2017 separate category, pre-2018 separate category,
and
specified separate category
have the meanings set forth in § 1.904(f)-12(j)(1). The rules of this paragraph (j)(1) apply to reallocate to the taxpayer's post-2017 separate categories for foreign branch category income, general category income, passive category income, and specified separate categories of income, any unused foreign taxes (as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section) that were paid or accrued or deemed paid under sections 902 and 960 with respect to income in a pre-2018 separate category.
(ii)
Allocation to the same separate category.
Except as provided in paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section, to the extent any unused foreign taxes paid or accrued or deemed paid with respect to a separate category of income are carried forward to a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, such taxes are allocated to the same post-2017 separate category as the pre-2018 separate category from which the unused foreign taxes are carried.
(iii)
Exception for certain general category unused foreign taxes
—(A)
In general.
To the extent any unused foreign taxes with respect to general category income are carried forward to a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, a taxpayer may choose to allocate those taxes to the taxpayer's post-2017 separate category for foreign branch
category income to the extent the unused foreign taxes would have been allocated to the taxpayer's post-2017 separate category for foreign branch category income, and would have been unused foreign taxes with respect to foreign branch category income if that separate category had applied in the year or years the unused foreign taxes arose. Any remaining unused foreign taxes paid or accrued or deemed paid with respect to general category income carried forward to a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, are allocated to the taxpayer's post-2017 separate category for general category income.
(B)
Safe harbor.
In lieu of applying paragraph (j)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, the taxpayer may choose to allocate the unused foreign taxes with respect to general category income in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, to the taxpayer's post-2017 separate category for foreign branch category income based on a ratio equal to the amount of foreign income taxes assigned to the general category that were paid or accrued by the taxpayer's foreign branches (as defined in § 1.904-4(f)(3)(vii)) bears to all foreign income taxes assigned to the general category that were paid or accrued, or deemed paid by the taxpayer with respect to such taxable year. The amount of taxes paid or accrued by a foreign branch in a taxable year beginning before January1, 2018, means all foreign income taxes properly reflected on the separate set of books and records (as defined in § 1.989(a)-1(d)(1) and (2)) of the foreign branch as an expense (which does not include any taxes deemed paid under section 902 or 960).
(C)
Rules regarding the exception.
A taxpayer applying the exception described in this paragraph (j)(1)(iii) (the
branch carryover exception
) must apply the exception to all of its unused foreign taxes paid or accrued with respect to general category income that are carried forward to all taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. A taxpayer may apply the branch carryover exception on a timely filed original return (including extensions) or an amended return. A taxpayer that applies the exception on an amended return must make appropriate adjustments to eliminate any double benefit arising from application of the exception to years that are not open for assessment.
(D)
Coordination rule.
See § 1.904(f)-12(j)(6) for coordination rule with respect to the exception described in paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section and the exceptions described in § 1.904(f)-12(j)(2) through (4).
(2)
Carryback of unused foreign tax
—(i)
In general.
The rules of this paragraph (j)(2) apply to any unused foreign taxes that were paid or accrued, or deemed paid under section 960, with respect to income in a post-2017 separate category.
(ii)
Passive category income and specified separate categories of income described in § 1.904-4(m).
Any unused foreign taxes paid or accrued or deemed paid with respect to passive category income or a specified separate category of income in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, that are carried back to a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, are allocated to the same pre-2018 separate category as the post-2017 separate category from which the unused foreign taxes are carried.
(iii)
General category income and foreign branch category income.
Any unused foreign taxes paid or accrued or deemed paid with respect to general category income or foreign branch category income in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, that are carried back to a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, are allocated to the taxpayer's pre-2018 separate category for general category income.
(k)
Applicability date.
Paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section apply to taxable years that both begin after December 31, 2017, and end on or after December 4, 2018. Paragraph (j) of this section applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Paragraph (j)(2) of this section also applies to the last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018.

§ 1.904-3
Carryback and carryover of unused foreign tax by spouses making a joint return.
(a)
In General.
This section provides rules, in addition to those prescribed in § 1.904-2, for the carryback and carryover of the unused foreign tax paid or accrued to a foreign country or possession by spouses making a joint return for one or more of the taxable years involved in the computation of the carryback or carryover. The rules in this section apply separately with respect to each separate category as defined in § 1.904-5(a)(4)(v).
(b)
Joint unused foreign tax and joint excess limitation.
In the case of spouses the joint unused foreign tax or the joint excess limitation for a taxable year for which a joint return is made shall be computed on the basis of the combined income, deductions, taxes, and credit of both spouses as if the combined income, deductions, taxes, and credit were those of one individual.
(c)
Continuous use of joint return.
If spouses make a joint return for the current taxable year, and also make joint returns for each of the other taxable years involved in the computation of the carryback or carryover of the unused foreign tax to the current taxable year, the joint carryback or the joint carryover to the current taxable year shall be computed on the basis of the joint unused foreign tax and the joint excess limitations.
(d)
From separate to joint return.
If spouses make a joint return for the current taxable year, but make separate returns for all of the other taxable years involved in the computation of the carryback or carryover of the unused foreign tax to the current taxable year, the separate carrybacks or separate carryovers shall be a joint carryback or a joint carryover to the current taxable year.
(e)
Amounts carried from or through a joint return year to or through a separate return year
—(1)
In general.
It is necessary to allocate to each spouse the spouse's share of an unused foreign tax or excess limitation for any taxable year for which the spouses filed a joint return if—
(i) The spouses file separate returns for the current taxable year and an unused foreign tax is carried thereto from a taxable year for which they filed a joint return;
(ii) The spouses file separate returns for the current taxable year and an unused foreign tax is carried to such taxable year from a year for which they filed separate returns but is first carried through a year for which they filed a joint return; or
(iii) The spouses file a joint return for the current taxable year and an unused foreign tax is carried from a taxable year for which they filed joint returns but is first carried through a year for which they filed separate returns.
(2)
Computation and adjustments.
In the cases described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the separate carryback or carryover of each spouse to the current taxable year shall be computed in the manner described in § 1.904-2 but with the modifications set forth in paragraph (f) of this section. Where applicable, appropriate adjustments are made to take into account the fact that, for any taxable year involved in the computation of the carryback or the carryover, either spouse has combined foreign oil and gas income described in section 907(b) with respect to which the limitation in section 907(a) applies.
(f)
Allocation of unused foreign tax and excess limitation
—(1)
Separate category limitation.
The limitation in a separate category of a particular spouse for a taxable year for which a joint return is made shall be the portion of the limitation on the joint return which bears the same ratio to such limitation as such spouse's foreign source taxable income (with gross income and deductions taken into account to the same extent as taken into account on the joint return) in such separate category (but not in excess of the joint foreign source taxable income) bears to the joint foreign source taxable income in such separate category.
(2)
Unused foreign tax.
For purposes of this section, the term
unused foreign tax
means, with respect to a particular spouse and separate category for a taxable year for which a joint return is made, the excess of the foreign tax paid or accrued by that spouse with respect to that separate category over that spouse's separate category limitation.
(3)
Excess limitation.
For purposes of this section, the term
excess limitation
means, with respect to a particular spouse and separate category for a taxable year for which a joint return is made, the excess of that spouse's separate category limitation over the foreign taxes paid or accrued by such spouse with respect to such separate category for such taxable year.
(4)
Excess limitation to be applied.
The excess limitation of the particular spouse for any taxable year which is applied against the unused foreign tax of that spouse for another taxable year in order to determine the amount of the unused foreign tax which shall be carried back or over to a third taxable year shall be, in a case in which the excess limitation is determined on a joint return, the sum of the following amounts:
(i) Such spouse's excess limitation determined under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph reduced as provided in subparagraph (5)(i) of this paragraph, and
(ii) The excess limitation of the other spouse determined under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph for that taxable year reduced as provided in subparagraphs (5) (i) and (ii) of this paragraph.
(5)
Reduction of excess limitation.
(i) The part of the excess limitation which is attributable to each spouse for the taxable year, as determined under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, shall be reduced by absorbing as taxes deemed paid or accrued under section 904(c) in that year the unabsorbed separate unused foreign tax of such spouse, and the unabsorbed unused foreign tax determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph of such spouse, for taxable years which begin before the beginning of the year of origin of the unused foreign tax of the particular spouse against which the excess limitation so determined is being applied.
(ii) In addition, the part of the excess limitation which is attributable to the other spouse for the taxable year, as determined under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, shall be reduced by absorbing as taxes deemed paid or accrued under section 904(c) in that year the unabsorbed unused foreign tax, if any, of such other spouse for the taxable year which begins on the same date as the beginning of the year of origin of the unused foreign tax of the particular spouse against which the excess limitation so determined is being applied.

(h)
Applicability date.
This section is applicable for taxable years that both begin after December 31, 2017, and end on or after December 4, 2018.

§ 1.904-4
Separate application of section 904 with respect to certain categories of income.
(a)
In general.
A taxpayer is required to compute a separate foreign tax credit limitation for income received or accrued in a taxable year that is described in section 904(d)(1)(A) (section 951A category income), 904(d)(1)(B) (foreign branch category income), 904(d)(1)(C) (passive category income), 904(d)(1)(D) (general category income), or paragraph (m) of this section (specified separate categories). For purposes of this section, the definitions in § 1.904-5(a)(4) apply.
(b)
Passive category income
—(1)
In general.
The term
passive category income
means passive income and specified passive category income.
(2)
Passive income
—(i)
In general.
The term
passive income
means any—
(A) Income received or accrued by any person that is of a kind that would be foreign personal holding company income (as defined in section 954(c), taking into account any exceptions or exclusions to section 954(c), including, for example, section 954(c)(3), (c)(6), (h), or (i)) if the taxpayer were a controlled foreign corporation, including any amount of gain on the sale or exchange of stock in excess of the amount treated as a dividend under section 1248;
(B) Amount includible in gross income under section 1293;
(C) Distributive shares of partnership income treated as passive category income under paragraph (n)(1) of this section, and income from the sale of a partnership interest treated as passive category income under paragraph (n)(2) of this section; or
(D) Income treated as passive category income under the look-through rules in § 1.904-5.
(ii)
Exceptions.
Passive income does not include any export financing interest (as defined in paragraph (h) of this section), any high-taxed income (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section), financial services income (as defined in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section), or any active rents and royalties (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section). In addition, passive income does not include any income that would otherwise be passive but is excluded from passive category income under § 1.904-5(b)(1) or that is assigned to a separate category other than passive category income under § 1.904-5(c)(4)(iii). See also paragraph (k) of this section for rules relating to income resourced under a tax treaty. In determining whether any income is of a kind that would be foreign personal holding company income, the rules of section 864(d)(5)(A)(i) and (6) (treating related person factoring income of a controlled foreign corporation as foreign personal holding company income that is not eligible for the export financing income exception to the separate limitation for passive income) shall apply only in the case of income of a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957). Thus, income earned directly by a United States person that is related person factoring income may be eligible for the exception for export financing interest.
(iii)
Active rents or royalties
—(A)
In general.
For rents and royalties paid or accrued after September 20, 2004, passive income does not include any rents or royalties that are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business, regardless of whether such rents or royalties are received from a related or an unrelated person. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the principles of section 954(c)(2)(A) and the regulations under that section shall apply in determining whether rents or royalties are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business. For this purpose, the term taxpayer shall be substituted for the term controlled foreign corporation if the recipient of the rents or royalties is not a controlled foreign corporation.
(B)
Active conduct of trade or business.
Rents and royalties are considered derived in the active conduct of a trade or business by a United States person or by a controlled foreign corporation (or other entity to which the look-through rules apply) for purposes of section 904 (but not for purposes of section 954) if the requirements of section 954(c)(2)(A) are satisfied by one or more corporations that are members of an affiliated group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1504(a), determined without regard to section 1504(b)(3)) of which the recipient is a member. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B), an affiliated group includes only domestic corporations and foreign corporations that are controlled foreign corporations in which domestic members of the affiliated group own, directly or indirectly, at least 80 percent of the total voting power and value of the stock. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B), indirect ownership shall be determined under section 318 and the regulations under that section.
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (b)(2).
(A)
Example 1.
For Year 1, USP, a domestic corporation, has a net foreign currency gain that would not constitute foreign personal holding company income if USP were a controlled foreign corporation because the gain is directly related to the business needs of USP. See section 954(c)(1)(D). Under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the foreign currency gain is, therefore, not passive category income to USP because it is not income of a kind that would be foreign personal holding company income.
(B)
Example 2.
Controlled foreign corporation, CFC, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USP, a domestic corporation. CFC is regularly engaged in the restaurant franchise business. USP licenses trademarks, tradenames, certain know-how, related services, and certain restaurant designs for which CFC pays USP an arm's length royalty. USP is regularly engaged in the development and licensing of such property. Some of the franchisees are unrelated to CFC and USP. Other franchisees are
related to CFC or USP and use the licensed property outside of CFC's country of incorporation. CFC does not satisfy, but USP does satisfy, the active trade or business requirements of section 954(c)(2)(A). The royalty income earned by CFC from both its related and unrelated franchisees is foreign personal holding company income because CFC does not satisfy the active trade or business requirements of section 954(c)(2)(A) and, in addition, the royalty income from the related franchisees does not qualify for the same country exception of section 954(c)(3) or the look-through exception in section 954(c)(6). However, all of the royalty income earned by CFC is general category income to CFC under § 1.904-4(b)(2)(iii) because USP, a member of CFC's affiliated group, satisfies the active trade or business test (which is applied without regard to whether the royalties are paid by a related person). USP's inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A) of CFC's royalty income is general category income to USP under § 1.904-5(c)(5) and paragraph (d) of this section. The royalties received by USP are general category income to USP under § 1.904-5(b)(1) and paragraph (d) of this section.
(3)
Specified passive category income
means—
(i) Dividends from a DISC or former DISC (as defined in section 992(a)) to the extent such dividends are treated as income from sources without the United States;
(ii) Taxable income attributable to foreign trade income (within the meaning of section 923(b)); or
(iii) Distributions from a FSC (or a former FSC) out of earnings and profits attributable to foreign trade income (within the meaning of section 923(b)) or interest or carrying charges (as defined in section 927(d)(1)) derived from a transaction which results in foreign trade income (as defined in section 923(b)).
(c)
High-taxed income
—(1)
In general.
Income received or accrued by a United States person that would otherwise be passive income is not treated as passive income if the income is determined to be high-taxed income. Income is considered to be high-taxed income if, after allocating expenses, losses, and other deductions of the United States person to that income under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the sum of the foreign income taxes paid or accrued, and deemed paid under section 960, by the United States person with respect to such income (reduced by any portion of such taxes for which a credit is not allowed) exceeds the highest rate of tax specified in section 1 or 11, whichever applies (and with reference to section 15 if applicable), multiplied by the amount of such income (including the amount treated as a dividend under section 78). If, after application of this paragraph (c), income that would otherwise be passive income is determined to be high-taxed income, the income is treated as general category income, foreign branch category income, section 951A category income, or income in a specified separate category, as determined under the rules of this section, and any taxes imposed on that income are considered related to the same separate category of income under § 1.904-6. If, after application of this paragraph (c), passive income is zero or less than zero, any taxes imposed on the passive income are considered related to the same separate category of income to which the passive income (if not reduced to zero or less than zero) would have been assigned had the income been treated as high-taxed income (general category, foreign branch category, section 951A category, or a specified separate category). For additional rules regarding losses related to passive income, see paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Income and taxes shall be translated at the appropriate rates, as determined under sections 986, 987 and 989 and the regulations under those sections, before application of this paragraph (c). For purposes of allocating taxes to groups of income, United States source passive income is treated as any other passive income. In making the determination whether income is high-taxed, however, only foreign source income, as determined under United States tax principles, is relevant.
(2)
Grouping of items of income in order to determine whether passive income is high-taxed income
(i)
Grouping rules
—
Initial allocation and apportionment of deductions and
taxes.
For purposes of determining whether passive income is high-taxed, expenses, losses and other deductions shall be allocated and apportioned initially to each of the groups of passive income (described in paragraphs (c)(3), (4), and (5) of this section) under the rules of §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-17 and 1.865-1 through 1.865-2. Taxpayers that allocate and apportion interest expense on an asset basis may nevertheless apportion passive interest expense among the groups of passive income on a gross income basis. Foreign taxes are allocated to groups under the rules of § 1.904-6(a)(1)(iii). If a loss on a disposition of property gives rise to foreign tax (i.e., the transaction giving rise to the loss is treated under foreign law as having given rise to a gain), the foreign tax shall be allocated to the group of passive income to which gain on the sale would have been assigned under paragraph (c)(3) or (4) of this section. A determination of whether passive income is high-taxed shall be made only after application of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section (if applicable).
(ii)
Reallocation of loss groups.
If, after allocation and apportionment of expenses, losses and other deductions under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the sum of the allocable deductions exceeds the gross income in one or more groups, the excess deductions shall proportionately reduce income in the other groups (but not below zero).
(iii)
Coordination with section 904(b), (f) and (g).
The determination of whether foreign source passive income is high-taxed is made before taking into account any adjustments under section 904(b) or any allocation or recapture of a separate limitation loss, overall foreign loss, or overall domestic loss under section 904(f) and (g).
(3)
Amounts received or accrued by United States persons.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, all passive income received by a United States person are subject to the rules of this paragraph (c)(3). Paragraph (c)(4) of this section provides additional rules for inclusions under section 951(a)(1) or 951A(a) that are passive income, dividends from a controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation that are passive income, and income that is received or accrued by a United States person through a foreign QBU that is passive income. For purposes of this paragraph (c), a foreign QBU is a qualified business unit (as defined in section 989(a)), other than a controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation, that has its principal place of business outside the United States. The rules in this paragraph (c)(3) apply whether the income is received from a controlled foreign corporation of which the United States person is a United States shareholder, from a noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation of which the United States person is a United States shareholder that is a domestic corporation, or from any other person. In applying the rules in this paragraph (c)(3), passive income is not treated as subject to a withholding tax or other foreign tax when a credit is disallowed in full for such foreign tax, for example, under section 901(k). For purposes of determining whether passive income is high-taxed income, the following rules apply:
(i) All passive income received during the taxable year that is subject to a withholding tax of fifteen percent or greater shall be treated as one item of income.
(ii) All passive income received during the taxable year that is subject to a withholding tax of less than fifteen percent (but greater than zero) shall be treated as one item of income.
(iii) All passive income received during the taxable year that is subject to no withholding tax or other foreign tax shall be treated as one item of income.
(iv) All passive income received during the taxable year that is subject to no withholding tax but is subject to a foreign tax other than a withholding tax shall be treated as one item of income.
(4)
Dividends and inclusions from controlled foreign corporations, dividends from noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporations, and income attributable to foreign QBUs.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the rules of this paragraph (c)(4) apply to all dividends and all amounts included in gross income of a United States shareholder under section 951(a)(1) or
951A(a) with respect to the foreign corporation that (after application of the look-through rules of section 904(d)(3) and § 1.904-5) are attributable to passive income received or accrued by a controlled foreign corporation, all dividends from a noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation that are received or accrued by a United States shareholder that (after application of the look-through rules of section 904(d)(4) and § 1.904-5) are treated as passive income, and all amounts of passive income received or accrued by a United States person through a foreign QBU. The grouping rules of paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section apply separately to dividends, to inclusions under section 951(a)(1) and to inclusions under section 951A(a) with respect to each controlled foreign corporation of which the taxpayer is a United States shareholder, and to dividends with respect to each noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation of which the taxpayer is a United States shareholder that is a domestic corporation. The grouping rules of paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section also apply separately to income attributable to each tested unit, as defined in § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(iv), of a controlled foreign corporation, and to each foreign QBU of a noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation or any other look-through entity defined in § 1.904-5(i), or of any United States person.
(5)
Special rules
—(i)
Certain rents and royalties.
All items of rent or royalty income to which an item of rent or royalty expense is directly allocable shall be treated as a single item of income and shall not be grouped with other amounts.
(ii)
Treatment of partnership income.
A partner's distributive share of income from a foreign or domestic partnership that is treated as passive income under paragraph (n)(1)(ii) of this section (generally providing that a less than 10 percent partner's distributive share of partnership income is passive income) is treated as a single item of income and is not grouped with other amounts. A distributive share of income from a partnership that is treated as passive income under paragraph (n)(1)(i) of this section is grouped according to the rules in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, except that the portion, if any, of the distributive share of income attributable to income earned by a domestic partnership through a foreign QBU is separately grouped under the rules of paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(iii)
Currency gain or loss
—(A)
Section 986(c).
Any currency gain or loss with respect to a distribution received by a United States shareholder (other than a foreign QBU of that shareholder) of previously taxed earnings and profits that is recognized under section 986(c) and that is treated as an item of passive income shall be subject to the rules provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section.
(B)
Section 987.
For special rules relating to the allocation and apportionment of foreign income taxes to section 987 items,
see
§ 1.987-6(b)(3).
(C)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (c)(5)(iii).
(

)
Facts.
USP, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of CFC, a controlled foreign corporation organized and operating in Country X that uses the “u” as its functional currency. In Year 1, when the highest rate of U.S. tax in section 11 is 21%, CFC earns 100u of passive category foreign personal holding company income subject to no foreign tax. When included in USP's income under section 951(a), the applicable exchange rate is 1u=$1x. Therefore, USP's section 951(a) inclusion is $100x and no foreign taxes are deemed paid by USP with respect to the inclusion. At the end of Year 1, CFC has previously taxed earnings and profits of 100u and USP's basis in those earnings is $100x. In Year 2, CFC has no earnings and profits and distributes 100u to USP. The value of the earnings when distributed is $150x. Assume that under section 986(c), USP must recognize $50x of passive category income attributable to the appreciation of the previously taxed earnings and profits. Country X does not recognize any gain or loss on the distribution, but imposes a 10u withholding tax on USP with respect to the distribution.
(

)
Analysis.
Because the section 986(c) gain is not subject to any foreign withholding tax or other foreign tax,
under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section the section 986(c) gain is grouped with other items of USP's income that are subject to no withholding tax or other foreign tax. Under paragraph (c)(6)(iii) of this section, the 10u withholding tax is related to passive category income. See section 960(c) and § 1.960-4 for rules relating to the increase in limitation in the year of distribution of previously taxed earnings and profits.
(iv)
Coordination with section 954(b)(4).
For rules relating to passive income of a controlled foreign corporation that is exempt from subpart F treatment because the income is subject to high foreign tax, see section 904(d)(3)(E), § 1.904-4(c)(7)(iii), and § 1.904-5(d)(2).
(6)
Application of this paragraph to additional taxes paid or deemed paid in the year of receipt of previously taxed income
—(i)
Determination made in year of inclusion.
The determination of whether an amount included in gross income under section 951(a)(1) or 951A(a) is high-taxed income is made in the taxable year the income is included in the gross income of the United States shareholder under section 951(a) or 951A(a) (for purposes of this paragraph (c), the
year of inclusion
). Any increase in foreign taxes paid or accrued, or deemed paid, when the taxpayer receives an amount that is excluded from gross income under section 959(a) and that is attributable to a controlled foreign corporation's earnings and profits relating to the amount previously included in gross income will not be considered in determining whether the amount included in income in the year of inclusion is high-taxed income.
(ii)
Exception.
Paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section shall not apply to an increase in tax in a case in which the taxpayer is required to adjust its foreign taxes in the year of inclusion under section 905(c).
(iii)
Allocation of foreign taxes imposed on distributions of previously taxed income.
If an item of income is considered high-taxed income in the year of inclusion and paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section applies, then any increase in foreign income taxes imposed with respect to that item are considered to be related to the same separate category to which the income was assigned in the taxable year of inclusion. If an item of income is not considered to be high-taxed income in the year of inclusion and paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section applies, the following rules shall apply. The taxpayer shall treat an increase in taxes paid or accrued, or deemed paid, on any distribution of the earnings and profits attributable to the amount included in gross income in the year of inclusion as taxes related to passive income to the extent of the excess of the product of the highest rate of tax in section 11 (determined with regard to section 15 and determined as of the year of inclusion) and the amount of the inclusion (after allocation of parent expenses) over the taxes paid or accrued, or deemed paid, in the year of inclusion. The taxpayer shall treat any taxes paid or accrued, or deemed paid, on the distribution in excess of this amount as taxes related to the same category of income to which such inclusion would have been assigned had the income been treated as high-taxed income in the year of inclusion (general category income, section 951A category income, or income in a specified separate category). If these additional taxes are not creditable in the year of distribution, the carryover rules of section 904(c) apply (see section 904(c) and § 1.904-2(a) for rules disallowing carryovers in the section 951A category). For purposes of this paragraph (c)(6), the foreign tax on an inclusion under section 951(a)(1) or 951A(a) is considered increased on distribution of the earnings and profits associated with that inclusion if the total of taxes paid and deemed paid on the inclusion and the distribution (taking into account any reductions in tax and any withholding taxes) exceeds the total taxes deemed paid in the year of inclusion. Any foreign currency loss associated with the earnings and profits that are distributed with respect to the inclusion is not to be considered as giving rise to an increase in tax.
(iv)
Increase in taxes paid by successors.
If passive earnings and profits previously included in income of a United States shareholder are distributed to a person that was not a United States shareholder of the distributing corporation in the year the earnings were included, any increase in foreign taxes
paid or accrued, or deemed paid, on that distribution is treated as taxes related to general category income (or income in a specified separate category, if applicable) in the case of earnings and profits previously included under section 951(a)(1), and is treated as taxes related to section 951A category income (or income in a specified separate category, if applicable) in the case of earnings and profits previously included under section 951A(a), regardless of whether the previously-taxed income was considered high-taxed income under section 904(d)(2)(F) in the year of inclusion.
(7)
Application of this paragraph to certain reductions of tax on distributions of income
—(i)
In general.
If the effective rate of tax imposed by a foreign country on income of a foreign corporation that is included in a taxpayer's gross income is reduced under foreign law on distribution of such income, the rules of this paragraph (c) apply at the time that the income is included in the taxpayer's gross income, without regard to the possibility of a subsequent reduction of foreign tax on the distribution. If the inclusion is considered to be high-taxed income, then the taxpayer must initially treat the inclusion as general category income, section 951A category income, or income in a specified separate category as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. When the foreign corporation distributes the earnings and profits to which the inclusion was attributable and the foreign tax on the inclusion is reduced, then if a redetermination of U.S. tax liability is required under § 1.905-3(b)(2), the taxpayer must redetermine whether the revised inclusion (if any) is considered to be high-taxed income. See § 1.905-3(b)(2)(ii) (requiring a redetermination of the amount of the inclusion, the application of the high-tax exception under section 954(b)(4), and the amount of foreign taxes deemed paid). If, taking into account the reduction in foreign tax, the inclusion is not considered high-taxed income, then the taxpayer, in redetermining its U.S. tax liability for the year or years affected, must treat the inclusion and the associated taxes (as reduced on the distribution) as passive category income and taxes. For purposes of this paragraph (c), the foreign tax on an inclusion under section 951(a)(1) or 951A(a) is considered reduced on distribution of the earnings and profits associated with the inclusion if the total taxes paid and deemed paid on the inclusion and the distribution (taking into account any reductions in tax and any withholding taxes) is less than the total taxes deemed paid in the year of inclusion. Therefore, any foreign currency gain associated with the earnings and profits that are distributed with respect to the inclusion is not taken into account in determining whether there is a reduction of tax requiring a redetermination of whether the inclusion is high-taxed income.
(ii)
Allocation of reductions of foreign tax.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section, reductions in foreign tax shall be allocated among the separate categories under the same principles as those of § 1.904-6 for allocating taxes among the separate categories. Thus, for purposes of determining to which year's taxes the reduction in taxes relates, foreign law shall apply. If, however, foreign law does not attribute a reduction in taxes to a particular year or years, then the reduction in taxes shall be attributable, on an annual last in-first out (LIFO) basis, to foreign taxes potentially subject to reduction that are associated with previously taxed income, then on a LIFO basis to foreign taxes associated with income that under paragraph (c)(7)(iii) of this section remains as passive income but that was excluded from subpart F income or tested income under section 954(b)(4) or section 951A(c)(2)(A)(i)(III), and finally on a LIFO basis to foreign taxes associated with other earnings and profits. Furthermore, in applying the ordering rules of section 959(c), distributions shall be considered made on a LIFO basis first out of earnings described in section 959(c)(1) and (2), then on a LIFO basis out of earnings and profits associated with income that remains passive income under paragraph (c)(7)(iii) of this section but that was excluded from subpart F income or tested income under section 954(b)(4) or section 951A(c)(2)(A)(i)(III), and finally on a LIFO basis out of other earnings and profits. For purposes of this paragraph
(c)(7)(ii), foreign law is not considered to attribute a reduction in tax to a particular year or years if foreign law attributes the tax reduction to a pool or group containing income from more than one taxable year and such pool or group is defined based on a characteristic of the income (for example, the rate of tax paid with respect to the income) rather than on the taxable year in which the income is derived.
(iii)
Treatment of income excluded under section 954(b)(4) or section 951A(c)(2)(A)(i)(III).
If the effective rate of tax imposed by a foreign country on income of a foreign corporation is reduced under foreign law on distribution of that income, the rules of section 954(b)(4) (including for purposes of determining tested income under section 951A(c)(2)(A)(i)(III)) are applied in the year of inclusion without regard to the possibility of a subsequent reduction of foreign tax. See §§ 1.954-1(d)(3)(iii) and 1.951A-2(c)(6)(iv). If a taxpayer excludes passive income from a controlled foreign corporation's foreign personal holding company income or tested income under section 954(b)(4) or section 951A(c)(2)(A)(i)(III), then, notwithstanding the general rule of § 1.904-5(d)(2), the income is considered to be passive category income until distribution of that income. At that time, if after the redetermination of U.S. tax liability required under § 1.905-3(b)(2) the taxpayer still elects to exclude the passive income under section 954(b)(4) or section 951A(c)(2)(A)(i)(III), the rules of this paragraph (c)(7)(iii) apply to determine whether the income is high-taxed income upon distribution and, therefore, income in another separate category. For purposes of determining whether a reduction in tax is attributable to taxes on income excluded under section 954(b)(4) or section 951A(c)(2)(A)(i)(III), the rules of paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section apply. The rules of paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section also apply for purposes of ordering distributions to determine whether such distributions are out of earnings and profits associated with such excluded income. For an example illustrating the operation of this paragraph (c)(7)(iii), see paragraph (c)(8)(vi) of this section (
Example 6
).
(8)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c). All of the examples assume that the highest tax rate under section 11 is 21%, unless otherwise noted.
(i)
Example 1.
CFC, a controlled foreign corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of domestic corporation USP. CFC is a single qualified business unit (QBU) operating in foreign Country X. In Year 1, CFC earns $130x of gross royalty income that is passive income from Country X sources, and incurs $30x of expenses that do not include any payments to USP. CFC's $100x of pre-tax passive income from the royalty is subject to $30x of foreign tax, and is included under section 951(a)(1) in USP's gross income for the taxable year. USP allocates $50x of expenses to the $100x (consisting of the $70x section 951(a)(1) inclusion and $30x section 78 amount), resulting in net passive income of $50x. USP does not elect to exclude from subpart F under section 954(b)(4) the $70x of CFC's net passive income. After application of the high-tax kick-out rules of paragraph (c) of this section, the $50x of USP's net passive income is treated as general category income, and the $30x of taxes deemed paid are treated as taxes imposed on general category income, because the foreign taxes paid and deemed paid on the income exceed the highest U.S. tax rate multiplied by the $50x of net passive income ($30x
$10.5x (21% × $50x)).
(ii)
Example 2.
CFC, a controlled foreign corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of domestic corporation USP. CFC is incorporated and operating in Country Y and has a branch in Country Z. CFC has two QBUs (QBU Y and QBU Z). In Year 1, CFC earns $65x of gross royalty income that is passive income in Country Y through QBU Y and $65x of gross royalty income that is passive income in Country Z through QBU Z. CFC allocates $15x of expenses to the gross royalty income earned by each QBU, resulting in pre-tax passive income of $50x in each QBU. Country Y imposes $5x of foreign tax on the royalty income earned in Y, and Country Z imposes $10x of tax on royalty income earned in Z. All of CFC's income constitutes foreign personal holding
company income that is passive income and is included under section 951(a)(1) in USP's gross income for the taxable year. USP allocates $50x of expenses pro rata to the $100x section 951(a)(1) inclusion attributable to the QBUs (consisting of the $45x section 951(a)(1) inclusion derived through QBU Y, the $5x section 78 amount attributable to QBU Y, the $40x section 951(a)(1) inclusion derived through QBU Z, and the $10x section 78 amount attributable to QBU Z), resulting in net passive income of $50x. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the high-tax kickout rules must be applied separately to the subpart F inclusion attributable to the income earned by QBU Y and the income earned by QBU Z. After application of the high-tax kickout rules, the $25x of net passive income attributable to QBU Y will be treated as passive category income because the foreign taxes paid and deemed paid on the income do not exceed the highest U.S. tax rate multiplied by the $25x of net passive income ($5x
$5.25x (21% × $25x)). The $25x of net passive income attributable to QBU Z will be treated as general category income because the foreign taxes paid and deemed paid on the income exceed the highest U.S. tax rate multiplied by the $25x of net passive income ($10x
$5.25x (21% × $25x)).
(iii)
Example 3.
Domestic corporation USP operates in branch form in foreign countries X and Y. The branches are qualified business units (QBUs), within the meaning of section 989(a). In Year 1, QBU X earns passive royalty income, interest income, and rental income. All of the QBU X passive income is from Country Z sources. The royalty income is not subject to a withholding tax, and is not taxed by Country X, and the interest and the rental income are subject to a 4% and 10% withholding tax, respectively. QBU Y earns interest income in Country Y that is not subject to foreign tax. For purposes of determining whether USP's foreign source passive income is high-taxed income, the rental income and the interest income earned in QBU X are treated as one item of income pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. The interest income earned in QBU Y and the royalty income earned in QBU X are each treated as a separate item of income under paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(3)(iii) of this section. If, after allocation of expenses, QBU X's items of income composed of rental income and interest income are high-taxed income, the income may be treated as foreign branch category income.
(iv)
Example 4.
CFC, a controlled foreign corporation incorporated in foreign Country R, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USP, a domestic corporation. USP and CFC have calendar year taxable years for both U.S. and Country R tax purposes. The highest tax rate under section 11 is 34% and 21% in Year 1 and Year 2, respectively. For Year 1, USP is required under section 951(a)(1) to include in gross income $80x (not including the section 78 amount) attributable to the earnings and profits of CFC for such year, all of which is foreign personal holding company income that is passive rent or royalty income. CFC does not make any distributions in Year 1. Foreign income taxes paid by CFC for Year 1 that are deemed paid by USP for such year under section 960(a) with respect to the section 951(a)(1) inclusion equal $20x. USP properly allocates $30x of expenses to the section 951(a)(1) inclusion. The foreign income tax paid with respect to the section 951(a)(1) inclusion does not exceed the highest U.S. tax rate multiplied by the amount of income after allocation of USP's expenses ($20x
$23.80x (34% × $70x)). Thus, USP's section 951(a)(1) inclusion for Year 1 is included in USP's passive category income and the $20x of taxes attributable to that inclusion are treated as taxes related to passive category income. In Year 2, CFC distributes $70x to USP, and under section 959 that distribution is treated as attributable to the earnings and profits with respect to the amount included in income by USP in Year 1 and is excluded from USP's gross income. Foreign Country R imposes a withholding tax of $14x on the distribution in Year 2. Under paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, the withholding tax in Year 2 does not affect the characterization of the Year 1 inclusion as passive category income, nor does it affect the characterization of the $20x of taxes paid in Year 1 as taxes paid with respect to passive category income. No
further expenses of USP are allocable to the receipt of that distribution. In Year 2, the foreign taxes paid ($14x) exceed the product of the highest U.S. tax rate and the amount of the inclusion reduced by taxes deemed paid in the year of inclusion ($14x
$3.80x ((34% × $70x) − $20x)). Thus, under paragraph (c)(6)(iii) of this section, $3.80x ((34% × $70x) − $20x) of the $14x withholding tax paid in Year 2 is treated as taxes related to passive category income and the remaining $10.20x ($14x − $3.80x) of the withholding tax is treated as related to general category income.
(v)
Example 5.
CFC, a controlled foreign corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USP, a domestic corporation. USP and CFC are calendar year taxpayers. In Year 1, CFC's only earnings consist of $200x of pre-tax passive income that is foreign personal holding company income that is earned in foreign Country X. Under Country X's tax system, the corporate tax on particular earnings is reduced on distribution of those earnings and no withholding tax is imposed. In Year 1, CFC pays $100x of foreign tax with respect to its passive income. USP does not elect to exclude this income from subpart F under section 954(b)(4) and includes $200x in gross income ($100x of net foreign personal holding company income and $100x of the amount under section 78 (the “section 78 dividend”)). At the time of the inclusion, the income is considered to be high-taxed income under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(6)(i) of this section and is general category income to USP ($100x
$42x (21% × $200x)). CFC does not distribute any of its earnings in Year 1. In Year 2, CFC has no additional earnings. On December 31, Year 2, CFC distributes the $100x of earnings from Year 1. At that time, CFC receives a $60x refund from Country X attributable to the reduction of the Country X corporate tax imposed on the Year 1 earnings. The refund is a foreign tax redetermination under § 1.905-3(a) that under §§ 1.905-3(b)(2) and 1.954-1(d)(3)(iii) requires a redetermination of CFC's Year 1 subpart F income and the application of section 954(b)(4), as well as a redetermination of USP's Year 1 inclusion under section 951(a)(1), its deemed paid taxes under section 960(a), and its Year 1 U.S. tax liability. As recomputed taking into account the $60x refund, CFC's Year 1 passive category net foreign personal holding company income is increased by $60x to $160x, CFC's foreign income taxes attributable to that income are reduced from $100x to $40x, and the income still qualifies to be excluded from CFC's subpart F income under section 954(b)(4) ($40x
$37.80x (90% × 21% × $200x)). Assuming USP does not change its Year 1 election, USP's Year 1 inclusion under section 951(a)(1) is increased by $60x to $160x, and the associated deemed paid tax and section 78 dividend are reduced by $60x to $40x. Under paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section, in connection with the adjustments required under section 905(c), USP must redetermine whether the adjusted Year 1 inclusion is high-taxed income of USP. Taking into account the $60x refund, the inclusion is not considered high-taxed income of USP ($40x
$42x (21% × $200x)). Therefore, USP must treat the $200x of income ($160x inclusion plus $40x section 78 amount) and the $40x of taxes associated with the inclusion in Year 1 as passive category income and taxes. USP must also follow the appropriate procedures under § 1.905-4.
(vi)
Example 6.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(8)(v) of this section (the facts in
Example 5
), except that in Year 1, USP elects to apply section 954(b)(4) to exclude CFC's passive income from its subpart F income, both before and after the recomputation of CFC's Year 1 subpart F income and USP's Year 1 U.S. tax liability that is required by reason of the Year 2 $60x foreign tax redetermination. Although the income is not considered to be subpart F income, under paragraph (c)(7)(iii) of this section it remains passive category income until distribution. In Year 2, the $100x distribution is a dividend to USP, because CFC has $160x of accumulated earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3) (the $100x of earnings in Year 1 increased by the $60x refund received in Year 2 that under § 1.905-3(b)(2) is taken into account in Year 1). Under paragraph (c)(7)(iii) of this section, USP must determine whether the dividend income is high-taxed income to USP in Year 2.
The treatment of the dividend as passive category income may be relevant in determining deductions allocable or apportioned to such dividend income or related stock that are excluded in the computation of USP's foreign tax credit limitation under section 904(a) in Year 2. See section 904(b)(4). Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the dividend income is passive category income to USP because the foreign taxes paid and deemed paid by USP ($0x) with respect to the dividend income do not exceed the highest U.S. tax rate on that income.
(vii)
Example 7.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(8)(v) of this section (the facts in
Example 5
), except that the distribution in Year 2 is subject to a withholding tax of $25x. Under paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section, USP must redetermine whether its Year 1 inclusion should be considered high-taxed income of USP because there is a net $35x reduction ($60x refund of foreign corporate tax—$25x withholding tax) of foreign tax. By taking into account both the reduction in foreign corporate tax and the additional withholding tax, the inclusion continues to be considered high-taxed income of USP in Year 1 ($65x
$42x (21% × $200)). USP must follow the appropriate section 905(c) procedures. USP must redetermine its U.S. tax liability for Year 1, but the Year 1 inclusion and the $65x taxes ($40x of deemed paid tax in Year 1 and $25x withholding tax in Year 2) will continue to be treated as general category income and taxes.
(viii)
Example 8.
(A) CFC, a controlled foreign corporation operating in Country G, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USP, a domestic corporation. USP and CFC are calendar year taxpayers. Country G imposes a tax of 50% on CFC's earnings. Under Country G's system, the foreign corporate tax on particular earnings is reduced on distribution of those earnings to 30% and no withholding tax is imposed. Under Country G's law, distributions are treated as made out of a pool of undistributed earnings subject to the 50% tax rate. For Year 1, CFC's only earnings consist of passive income that is foreign personal holding company income that is earned in foreign Country G. CFC has taxable income of $110x for Federal income tax purposes and $100x for Country G purposes. Country G, therefore, imposes a tax of $50x on the Year 1 earnings of CFC. USP does not elect to exclude this income from subpart F under section 954(b)(4) and includes $110x in gross income ($60x of net foreign personal holding company income under section 951(a) and $50x of the section 78 dividend). The highest rate of tax under section 11 in Year 1 is 34%. Therefore, at the time of the section 951(a) inclusion, the income is considered to be high-taxed income under paragraph (c) of this section ($50x
$37.4x (34% × $110x)) and is general category income to USP. CFC does not distribute any of its earnings in Year 1.
(B) In Year 2, CFC earns general category income that is not subpart F income or tested income. CFC again has $110x in taxable income for Federal income tax purposes and $100x in taxable income for Country G purposes, and CFC pays $50x of tax to foreign Country G. In Year 3, CFC has no taxable income or earnings. On December 31, Year 3, CFC distributes $60x of its total $120x of earnings and receives a refund of foreign tax of $24x. The $24x refund is a foreign tax redetermination under § 1.905-3(a) that under § 1.905-3(b)(2) requires a redetermination of CFC's Year 1 subpart F income and USP's deemed paid taxes and Year 1 U.S. tax liability. Country G treats the distribution of earnings as out of the 50% tax rate pool of $200x of earnings accumulated in Year 1 and Year 2, as calculated for Country G tax purposes. However, under paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, the distribution, and, therefore, the reduction of tax is treated as first attributable to the $60x of passive category earnings attributable to income previously taxed in Year 1, and none of the distribution is treated as made out of the $60x of earnings accumulated in Year 2 (which is not previously taxed). Because 40 percent (the reduction in tax rates from 50 percent to 30 percent is a 40 percent reduction in the tax) of the $50x of foreign taxes attributable to the $60x of Year 1 passive income as calculated for Federal income tax purposes is refunded, $20x of the $24x foreign tax refund reduces foreign taxes on CFC's Year 1 passive income from $50x to $30x. The other $4x of the tax
refund reduces the taxes imposed in Year 2 on CFC's general category income from $50x to $46x.
(C) Under paragraph (c)(7) of this section, in connection with the section 905(c) adjustment USP must redetermine whether its Year 1 subpart F inclusion is considered high-taxed income. By taking into account the reduction in foreign tax, the inclusion is increased by $20x to $80x, the deemed paid taxes are reduced by $20x to $30x, and the inclusion is not considered high-taxed income ($30x
34% × $110x). Therefore, USP must treat the revised section 951(a) inclusion and the taxes associated with the section 951(a) inclusion as passive category income and taxes in Year 1. USP must follow the appropriate procedures under § 1.905-4.
(ix)
Example 9.
USP, a domestic corporation, earns $100x of passive royalty income from sources within the United States. Under the laws of Country X, however, that royalty is considered to be from sources within Country X, and Country X imposes a 5% withholding tax on the payment of the royalty. USP also earns $100x of foreign source passive dividend income from Country Y subject to a 10% withholding tax to which $15x of expenses are allocated. In determining whether USP's passive income is high-taxed, the $5x withholding tax on USP's royalty income is allocated to passive income, and to the group of passive income described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section (passive income subject to a withholding tax of less than 15% (but greater than zero)). For purposes of determining whether the income is high-taxed, however, only the $85x of foreign source dividend income (and not the $100x of U.S. source royalty income) is taken into account. The foreign source dividend income is treated as passive category income because the foreign taxes paid on the passive income in the group ($15x) do not exceed the highest U.S. tax rate multiplied by the $85x of net foreign source income in the group ($15x
$17.85x ($100x − $15x) × 21%).
(x)
Example 10.
In Year 1, P, a U.S. citizen with a tax home in Country X, earns the following items of gross income: $400x of foreign source, passive interest income not subject to foreign withholding tax but subject to Country X income tax of $100x, $200x of foreign source, passive royalty income subject to a 5% foreign withholding tax (foreign tax paid is $10x), $1,300x of foreign source, passive rental income subject to a 25% foreign withholding tax (foreign tax paid is $325x), $500x of foreign source, general category loss, and $2,000x of U.S. source capital gain that is not subject to any foreign tax. P has a $900x deduction allocable to its passive rental income. P's only other deduction is a $700x capital loss on the sale of stock that is allocated to foreign source passive category income under § 1.865-2(a)(3)(i). The $700x capital loss is initially allocated to the group of passive income described in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section (passive income subject to no withholding tax but subject to foreign tax other than withholding tax). This group comprises the $400x of interest income not subject to foreign withholding tax but subject to Country X income tax. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the $300x amount by which the capital loss exceeds the income in the group must be reallocated to the net income in the other groups described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, but the $500x general category separate limitation loss is not allocated until the high-tax kickout rules are applied to determine whether the passive income is high-taxed income. P's $200x of royalty income subject to a 5% withholding tax is described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section (passive income that is subject to a withholding tax of less than 15%, but greater than zero). P's $1,300x of rental income subject to a 25% withholding tax is described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section (passive income that is subject to a withholding tax of 15% or greater). The $1,300x of rental income is reduced by the $900x deduction allocable to such income. Therefore, the total net income in the other groups under paragraph (c)(3) is $600x, the $200x of royalty income and the $400x of rental income. The ($300x) net loss in the net basis tax group thus reduces the royalty income by $100x to $100x ($200x − ($300x × (200x/600x))) and the rental income by $200x to $200x ($400x − ($300x × (400x/600x))). The $100x of net royalty income is not high-taxed and remains
passive category income because the foreign taxes of $10x do not exceed the highest U.S. rate of tax on that income, which is 37% for individuals ($10x
$37x (37% × $100x)). Under the high-tax kickout, the $200x of rental income and the $325x of associated foreign tax are assigned to the general category.
(xi)
Example 11.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(8)(x) of this section (the facts in
Example 10
), except the amount of the capital loss that is allocated under § 1.865-2(a)(3)(i) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section to the group of foreign source passive income subject to no withholding tax but subject to foreign tax other than withholding tax is $1,200x. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the excess deductions of $800x must be reallocated to the $200x of net royalty income subject to a 5% withholding tax and the $400x of net rental income subject to a 15% or greater withholding tax. The income in each of these groups is reduced to zero, and the foreign taxes imposed on the rental and royalty income are considered related to general category income. The remaining loss of $200x constitutes a separate limitation loss with respect to passive category income.
(xii)
Example 12.
In Year 1, USP, a domestic corporation, earns a $100x dividend that is foreign source passive income subject to a 30% withholding tax. The dividend is not paid by a specified 10-percent owned foreign corporation (as defined in section 245A(b)(1)). A foreign tax credit for the withholding tax on the dividend is disallowed under section 901(k). A deduction for the tax is allowed, however, under sections 164 and 901(k)(7). In determining whether USP's passive income is high-taxed, under paragraph (c)(3) of this section the $100x dividend and the $30x deduction are allocated to the group of income described in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section (passive income subject to no withholding tax or other foreign tax).
(d)
General category income.
The term
general category income
means all income other than passive category income, foreign branch category income, section 951A category income, and income in a specified separate category. Any item that is excluded from the passive category under paragraph (c) or (h) of this section or § 1.904-5(b)(1) is included in general category income only to the extent that such item does not meet the definition of another separate category. General category income also includes income treated as general category income under the look-through rules referenced in § 1.904-5(a)(2).
(e)
Financial services income
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Treatment of financial services income.
Passive income that is characterized as financial services income is not assigned to the passive category but is assigned in accordance with this paragraph (e)(1)(i). Financial services income that meets the definition of foreign branch category income (see paragraph (f)(1) of this section) is treated as income in that category. Financial services income of a controlled foreign corporation that is included in gross income of a United States shareholder under section 951A(a) is treated as section 951A category income in the hands of the United States shareholder. Financial services income that is neither treated as foreign branch category income nor treated as section 951A category income is treated as general category income. Distributions, interest, rents, or royalties received from a related person that is a financial services entity that would be assigned to the passive category under the look-through rules in § 1.904-5, but for the fact such amounts are paid by a financial services entity (and, therefore, not attributable to passive category income of the payor), are assigned to separate categories (other than the passive category) under the rules in this section.
(ii)
Definition of financial services income.
The term
financial services income
means income derived by a financial services entity, as defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, that is:
(A) Income derived in the active conduct of a banking, insurance, financing, or similar business (active financing income as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section);
(B) Passive income as defined in section 904(d)(2)(B) and paragraph (b) of this section as determined before the application of the exception for high-taxed income but after the application
of the exception for export financing interest; or
(C) Incidental income as defined in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
(2)
Active financing income
—(i)
Income included.
For purposes of paragraph (e)(1) and (e)(3) of this section, income is active financing income only if it is described in any of the following subdivisions.
(A) Income that is of a kind that would be insurance income as defined in section 953(a) (including related party insurance income as defined in section 953(c)(2)) and determined without regard to those provisions of section 953(a)(1)(A) that limit insurance income to income from countries other than the country in which the corporation was created or organized.
(B) Income from the investment by an insurance company of its unearned premiums or reserves ordinary and necessary to the proper conduct of the insurance business, income from providing services as an insurance underwriter, income from insurance brokerage or agency services, and income from loss adjuster and surveyor services.
(C) Income from investing funds in circumstances in which the taxpayer holds itself out as providing a financial service by the acceptance or the investment of such funds, including income from investing deposits of money and income earned investing funds received for the purchase of traveler's checks or face amount certificates.
(D) Income from making personal, mortgage, industrial, or other loans.
(E) Income from purchasing, selling, discounting, or negotiating on a regular basis, notes, drafts, checks, bills of exchange, acceptances, or other evidences of indebtedness.
(F) Income from issuing letters of credit and negotiating drafts drawn thereunder.
(G) Income from providing trust services.
(H) Income from arranging foreign exchange transactions, or engaging in foreign exchange transactions.
(I) Income from purchasing stock, debt obligations, or other securities from an issuer or holder with a view to the public distribution thereof or offering or selling stock, debt obligations, or other securities for an issuer or holder in connection with the public distribution thereof, or participating in any such undertaking.
(J) Income earned by broker-dealers in the ordinary course of business (such as commissions) from the purchase or sale of stock, debt obligations, commodities futures, or other securities or financial instruments and dividend and interest income earned by broker dealers on stock, debt obligations, or other financial instruments that are held for sale.
(K) Service fee income from investment and correspondent banking.
(L) Income from interest rate and currency swaps.
(M) Income from providing fiduciary services.
(N) Income from services with respect to the management of funds.
(O) Bank-to-bank participation income.
(P) Income from providing charge and credit card services or for factoring receivables obtained in the course of providing such services.
(Q) Income from financing purchases from third parties.
(R) Income from gains on the disposition of tangible or intangible personal property or real property that was used in the active financing business (as defined in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section) but only to the extent that the property was held to generate or generated active financing income prior to its disposition.
(S) Income from hedging gain with respect to other active financing income.
(T) Income from providing traveller's check services.
(U) Income from servicing mortgages.
(V) Income from a finance lease. For this purpose, a finance lease is any lease that is a direct financing lease or a leveraged lease for accounting purposes and is also a lease for tax purposes.
(W) [Reserved]
(X) Income from providing investment advisory services, custodial services, agency paying services, collection agency services, and stock transfer agency services.
(Y) Any similar item of income that is disclosed in the manner provided in the instructions to the Form 1118 or 1116 or that is designated as a similar item of income in guidance published by the Internal Revenue Service.
(3)
Financial services entities
—(i)
In general.
The term “financial services entity” means an individual or entity that is predominantly engaged in the active conduct of a banking, insurance, financing, or similar business (active financing business) for any taxable Year. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, a determination of whether an entity is a financial services entity shall be done on an entity-by-entity basis. An individual or entity is predominantly engaged in the active financing business for any year if for that year at least 80 percent of its gross income is income described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section. For this purpose, gross income includes all income realized by an individual or entity, whether includible or excludible from gross income under other operative provisions of the Code, but excludes gain from the disposition of stock of a corporation that prior to the disposition of its stock is related to the transferor within the meaning of section 267(b). For this purpose, income received from a related person that is a financial services entity shall be excluded if such income is characterized under the look-through rules of section 904(d)(3) and § 1.904-5. In addition, income received from a related person that is not a financial services entity but that is characterized as financial services income under the look-through rules shall be excluded. Any income received from a related person that is characterized under the look-through rules and that is not otherwise excluded by this paragraph will retain its character either as active financing income or other income in the hands of the recipient for purposes of determining if the recipient is a financial services entity and if the income is financial services income to the recipient. For purposes of this paragraph, related person is defined in § 1.904-5(i)(1).
(ii)
Special rule for affiliated groups.
In the case of any corporation that is not a financial services entity under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, but is a member of an affiliated group, such corporation will be deemed to be a financial services entity if the affiliated group as a whole meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(ii), affiliated group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a), determined without regard to section 1504(b)(3). In counting the income of the group for purposes of determining whether the group meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, the following rules apply. Only the income of group members that are United States corporations or foreign corporations that are controlled foreign corporations in which United States members of the affiliated group own, directly or indirectly, at least 80 percent of the total voting power and value of the stock shall be included. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(ii), indirect ownership shall be determined under section 318 and the regulations under that section. The income of the group will not include any income from transactions with other members of the group. Passive income will not be considered to be active financing income merely because that income is earned by a member of the group that is a financial services entity without regard to the rule of this paragraph (e)(3)(ii).
(iii)
Treatment of partnerships and other pass-through entities
For purposes of determining whether a partner (including a partnership that is a partner in a second partnership) is a financial services entity, all of the partner's income shall be taken into account, except that income that is excluded under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section shall not be taken into account. Thus, if a partnership is determined to be a financial services entity none of the income of the partner received from the partnership that is characterized under the look-through rules shall be included for purpose of determining if the partner is a financial services entity. If a partnership is determined not to be a financial services entity, then income of the partner from the partnership that is characterized under the look-through rules will be taken into account (unless such income is financial services income) and such income
will retain its character either as active financing income or as other income in the hands of the partner for purposes of determining if the partner is a financial service entity and if the income is financial services income to the partner. If a partnership is a financial services entity and the partner's income from the partnership is characterized as financial services income under the look-through rules, then, for purposes of determining a partner's foreign tax credit limitation, the income from the partnership shall be considered to be financial services income to the partner regardless of whether the partner is itself a financial services entity. The rules of this paragraph (e)(3)(iii) will apply for purposes of determining whether an owner of an interest in any other pass-through entity the character of the income of which is preserved when such income is included in the income of the owner of the interest is a financial services entity.
(iv) [Reserved]
(4)
Definition of incidental income
—(i)
In general
—(A)
Rule.
Incidental income is income that is integrally related to active financing income of a financial services entity. Such income includes, for example, income from precious metals trading and commodity trading that is integrally related to futures income. If securities, shares of stock, or other types of property are acquired by a financial services entity as an ordinary and necessary incident to the conduct of an active financing business, the income from such property will be considered to be financial services income but only so long as the retention of such property remains an ordinary or necessary incident to the conduct of such business. Thus property, including stock, acquired as the result of, or in order to prevent, a loss in an active financing business upon a loan held by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of such business will be considered ordinary and necessary to the conduct of such business, but income from such property will be considered financial services income only so long as the holding of such property remains an ordinary and necessary incident to the conduct of such business. If an entity holds such property for five years or less then the property is considered held incident to the financial services business. If an entity holds such property for more than five years, a presumption will be established that the entity is not holding such property incident to its financial services business. An entity will be able to rebut the presumption by demonstrating that under the facts and circumstances it is not holding the property as an investment. However, the fact that an entity holds the property for more than five years and is not able to rebut the presumption that it is not holding the property incident to its financial services business will not affect the characterization of any income received from the property during the first five years as financial services income.
(B) [Reserved]
(ii)
Income that is not incidental income.
Income that is attributable to non-financial activity is not incidental income within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4) (i) and (ii) of this section solely because such income represents a relatively small proportion of the taxpayer's total income or that the taxpayer engages in non-financial activity on a sporadic basis. Thus, for example, income from data processing services provided to related or unrelated parties or income from the sale of goods or non-financial services (for example travel services) is not financial services income, even if the recipient is a financial services entity.
(f)
Foreign branch category income
—(1)
Foreign branch category income
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section, the term
foreign branch category income
means income of a United States person, other than a pass-through entity, that is—
(A) Income attributable to foreign branches of the United States person held directly or indirectly through disregarded entities;
(B) A distributive share of partnership income that is attributable to foreign branches held by the partnership directly or indirectly through disregarded entities, or held indirectly by the partnership through another partnership or other pass-through entity that holds the foreign branch directly
or indirectly through disregarded entities; and
(C) Income from other pass-through entities determined under principles similar to those described in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(B) of this section.
(ii)
Passive category income excluded from foreign branch category income.
Income assigned to the passive category under paragraph (b) of this section is not foreign branch category income, regardless of whether the income is described in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section. Income that is treated as passive category income under the look-through rules in § 1.904-5 is also excluded from foreign branch category income, regardless of whether the income is attributable to a foreign branch. However, income that would be passive category income but for the application of section 904(d)(2)(B)(iii) (export financing interest and high-taxed income) or 904(d)(2)(C) (financial services income) and also meets the definition of foreign branch category income is foreign branch category income.
(iii)
Income arising from U.S. activities excluded from foreign branch category income.
Gross income that is attributable to a foreign branch and that arises from activities carried out in the United States by any foreign branch, including income that is reflected on a foreign branch's separate books and records, is not assigned to the foreign branch category. Instead, such income is assigned to the general category or a specified separate category under the rules of this section. However, under paragraph (f)(2)(vi) of this section, gross income (including U.S. source gross income) attributable to activities carried on outside the United States by the foreign branch may be assigned to the foreign branch category by reason of a disregarded payment to a foreign branch from a foreign branch owner or another foreign branch that is allocable to income recorded on the books and records of the payor foreign branch or foreign branch owner.
(iv)
Income arising from stock excluded from foreign branch category income
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1)(iv)(B) of this section, gross income that is attributable to a foreign branch and that comprises items of income arising from stock of a corporation (whether foreign or domestic), including gain from the disposition of such stock or any inclusion under section 951(a), 951A(a), 1248, or 1293(a), is not assigned to the foreign branch category. Instead, such income is assigned to the general category or a specified separate category under the rules of this section.
(B)
Exception for dealer property.
Paragraph (f)(1)(iv)(A) of this section does not apply to gain recognized from dispositions of stock of a corporation, if the stock would be dealer property (as defined in § 1.954-2(a)(4)(v)) if the foreign branch were a controlled foreign corporation.
(2)
Gross income attributable to a foreign branch
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in this paragraph (f)(2), gross income is attributable to a foreign branch to the extent the gross income (as adjusted to conform to Federal income tax principles) is reflected on the separate set of books and records (as defined in § 1.989(a)-1(d)(1) and (2)) of the foreign branch. Gross income that is not attributable to the foreign branch and is therefore attributable to the foreign branch owner is income in a separate category (other than the foreign branch category) under the other rules of this section.
(ii)-(iii) [Reserved]
(iv)
Disposition of interests in certain entities
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, gross income attributable to a foreign branch does not include gain from the disposition of an interest in a partnership or other pass-through entity or an interest in a disregarded entity. See also paragraph (n)(2) of this section for general rules relating to the sale of a partnership interest.
(B)
Exception for sales by a foreign branch in the ordinary course of business.
The rule in paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(A) of this section does not apply to gain from the sale or exchange of an interest in a partnership or other pass-through entity or an interest in a disregarded entity if the gain is reflected on the books and records of a foreign branch and the interest is held by the foreign branch in the ordinary course of its active trade or business. An interest is considered to be held in the ordinary course of the foreign branch's
active trade or business only if the foreign branch—
(
1
) Directly engages in the same, or a related, trade or business as that partnership, other pass-through entity, or disregarded entity; and
(
2
) In the case of a partnership or other pass-through entity, the foreign branch owns 10 percent or more of the capital or profits interests in the partnership or other pass-through entity.
(v)
Adjustments to items of gross income reflected on the books and records.
If a principal purpose of recording or failing to record an item of gross income on the books and records of a foreign branch, or of making or not making a disregarded payment described in paragraph (f)(2)(vi) of this section, is the avoidance of Federal income tax, the purposes of section 904, or the purposes of section 250 (in connection with section 250(b)(3)(A)(i)(VI)), the item must be attributed to one or more foreign branches or the foreign branch owner in a manner that reflects the substance of the transaction. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2)(v), interest received by a foreign branch from a related person is presumed to be attributable to the foreign branch owner (and not to the foreign branch) unless the interest income meets the definition of financial services income under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2)(v), a related person is any person that bears a relationship to the foreign branch owner described in section 267(b) or 707.
(vi)
Attribution of gross income to which disregarded payments are allocable
—(A)
In general.
If a foreign branch makes a disregarded payment to its foreign branch owner or a second foreign branch, and the disregarded payment is allocable to gross income that would be attributable to the foreign branch under the rules in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (v) of this section, the gross income attributable to the foreign branch is adjusted downward (but not below zero) to reflect the allocable amount of the disregarded payment, and the gross income attributable to the foreign branch owner or the second foreign branch is adjusted upward by the same amount as the downward adjustment, translated (if necessary) from the foreign branch's functional currency to U.S. dollars (or the second foreign branch's functional currency, as applicable) at the spot rate (as defined in § 1.988-1(d)) on the date of the disregarded payment. For rules addressing multiple disregarded payments in a taxable year, see paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(F) of this section. Similarly, if a foreign branch owner makes a disregarded payment to its foreign branch and the disregarded payment is allocable to gross income attributable to the foreign branch owner, the gross income attributable to the foreign branch owner is adjusted downward (but not below zero) to reflect the allocable amount of the disregarded payment, and the gross income attributable to the foreign branch is adjusted upward by the same amount as the downward adjustment, translated (if necessary) from U.S. dollars to the foreign branch's functional currency at the spot rate on the date of the disregarded payment. An adjustment to the amount of attributable gross income under this paragraph (f)(2)(vi) does not change the total amount, character, or source of the United States person's gross income; does not change the amount of a United States person's income in any separate category other than the foreign branch and general categories (or a specified separate category associated with the foreign branch and general categories); and has no bearing on the analysis of whether an item of gross income is eligible to be resourced under an income tax treaty.
(B)
Allocation of disregarded payments
—(
1
)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(B)(
2
) of this section, whether a disregarded payment is allocable to gross income attributable to a foreign branch or gross income attributable to its foreign branch owner, and the source and separate category of the gross income to which the disregarded payment is allocable, is determined under the following rules:
(
i
) Disregarded payments from a foreign branch owner to its foreign branch are allocable to gross income attributable to the foreign branch owner to the extent a deduction for that payment or any disregarded cost recovery deduction relating to that payment, if
regarded, would be allocated and apportioned to gross income attributable to the foreign branch owner under the principles of §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T and 1.861-17 (without regard to exclusive apportionment) by treating foreign source gross income and U.S. source gross income in each separate category (determined prior to the application of this paragraph (f)(2)(vi) to the disregarded payment at issue) each as a statutory grouping; and
(
ii
) Disregarded payments from a foreign branch to its foreign branch owner or to another foreign branch are allocable to gross income attributable to the payor foreign branch to the extent a deduction for that payment or any disregarded cost recovery deduction relating to that payment, if regarded, would be allocated and apportioned to gross income attributable to the payor foreign branch under the principles of §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T and 1.861-17 (without regard to exclusive apportionment) by treating foreign source gross income and U.S. source gross income in each separate category (determined before the application of this paragraph (f)(2)(vi) to the disregarded payment at issue) each as a statutory grouping.
(
2
)
Special rule for certain disregarded payments.
Whether a disregarded payment made in connection with a sale or exchange of property is allocable to gross income attributable to a foreign branch or its foreign branch owner, and the source and separate category of the gross income to which the disregarded payment is allocable, is determined under the following rules:
(
i
) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(D) of this section, disregarded payments from a foreign branch owner to its foreign branch in respect of non-inventory property are allocable to the gross income attributable to the foreign branch owner, if any, that is recognized with respect to a regarded sale or exchange of that property (including gross income arising in a later taxable year) to the extent of the adjusted disregarded gain with respect to the transferred property, and in the same proportions as the source and separate category of the gain recognized on the regarded sale or exchange of the transferred property;
(
ii
) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(D) of this section, disregarded payments from a foreign branch to its foreign branch owner or to another foreign branch in respect of non-inventory property are allocable to the gross income attributable to the foreign branch, if any, that is recognized with respect to a regarded sale or exchange of that property (including gross income arising in a later taxable year) to the extent of the adjusted disregarded gain with respect to the transferred property, and in the same proportions as the source and separate category of the gain recognized on the regarded sale or exchange of the transferred property; and
(
iii
) The principles of paragraphs (f)(2)(vi)(B)(
2
)(
i
) and (
ii
) of this section apply in the case of disregarded payments in respect of inventory property between a foreign branch and its foreign branch owner or between foreign branches to the extent the disregarded payment, if regarded, would, for purposes of determining gross income, be subtracted from gross receipts that are regarded for Federal income tax purposes.
(
3
)
Timing of reattribution
—(
i
)
In general.
The gross income attributable to the foreign branch is adjusted under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(B)(
1
) of this section only in the taxable year that a disregarded payment, if regarded, would be allowed as a deduction (including by giving rise to disregarded cost recovery deductions), or otherwise would be taken into account as an increase to cost of goods sold.
(
ii
)
Disregarded sales of property.
The gross income attributable to a foreign branch is adjusted under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(B)(
2
) of this section only in the taxable year or years in which gain is recognized by reason of the disposition of property with an adjusted disregarded basis in a transaction that is regarded for Federal income tax purposes.
(C)
Exclusion of certain disregarded payments.
Paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(A) of this section does not apply to the following payments, accruals, or other transfers between a foreign branch and its foreign branch owner, or between foreign branches, that are disregarded for Federal income tax purposes:
(
1
) Interest, and interest equivalents that, if regarded, would be described in §§ 1.861-9(b) and 1.861-9T(b);
(
2
) Remittances from the foreign branch to its foreign branch owner, except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(D) of this section;
(
3
) Contributions of money, securities, and other property from the foreign branch owner to its foreign branch, except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(D) of this section; or
(
4
) Any disregarded payment that, if made to a foreign branch and regarded for Federal income tax purposes, could not result in the attribution of gross income to a foreign branch (for example, the sale of an interest in a partnership by a foreign branch to its foreign branch owner, unless the sale or exchange occurred in the ordinary course of business within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(B) of this section).
(D)
Certain transfers of intangible property
—(
1
)
In general.
For purposes of applying this paragraph (f)(2)(vi), the amount of gross income attributable to a foreign branch (and the amount of gross income attributable to its foreign branch owner) must be adjusted under the principles of paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(B) of this section to reflect all transactions that are disregarded for Federal income tax purposes in which property described in section 367(d)(4) is transferred to or from a foreign branch or between foreign branches, whether or not a disregarded payment is made in connection with the transfer. In determining the amount of gross income that is attributable to a foreign branch that must be adjusted by reason of this paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(D), the principles of sections 367(d) and 482 apply. For example, if a foreign branch owner transfers property described in section 367(d)(4) to a foreign branch, the principles of section 367(d) are applied by treating the foreign branch as a separate foreign corporation to which the property is transferred in exchange for stock of the corporation in a transaction described in section 351. Similarly, if a foreign branch remits property described in section 367(d)(4) to its foreign branch owner, the foreign branch is treated as having sold the transferred property to the foreign branch owner in exchange for annual payments contingent on the productivity or use of the property, the amounts of which are determined under the principles of section 367(d).
(
2
)
Transactions occurring before December 7, 2018.
Paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(D)(
1
) of this section does not apply to a disregarded transfer of property that occurred before December 7, 2018.
(
3
)
Transitory ownership
—(
i
)
In general.
Paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(D)(
1
) of this section does not apply to disregarded transfers of property by a foreign branch or a foreign branch owner (such foreign branch or foreign branch owner, the
limited transferor
), if the conditions in paragraphs (f)(2)(vi)(D)(
3
)(
ii
) and (
iii
) of this section are met.
(
ii
)
Transitory ownership period.
The limited transferor's ownership of the property is transitory.
(
iii
)
Use of property.
The limited transferor does not develop, exploit, or otherwise employ the property in a trade or business, other than in the ordinary course of the limited transferor's business during the period of transitory ownership.
(
iv
)
Predecessors.
For purposes of paragraphs (f)(2)(vi)(D)(
3
)(
ii
) and (
iii
) of this section, a reference to a limited transferor that is a foreign branch owner includes any predecessor to the foreign branch owner. No person is a predecessor with respect to a foreign branch under this paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(D)(
3
)(
iv
).
(
4
)
Multiple transfers of intangible property.
If the same intangible property is transferred in a series of transfers described in paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(D)(
1
) of this section, each successive transfer is separately subject to the provisions of paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(D)(
1
) and will not terminate or otherwise affect the application of paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(D)(
1
) to a prior transfer described in paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(D)(
1
).
(E)
Amount of disregarded payments.
The amount of each disregarded payment used to make an adjustment under this paragraph (f)(2)(vi) (or the absence of any adjustment) must be determined in a manner that results in the attribution of the proper amount of gross income to each of a foreign branch and its foreign branch owner
under the principles of section 482, applied as if the foreign branch were a corporation.
(F)
Multiple disregarded payments.
In the case of multiple disregarded payments, this paragraph (f)(2)(vi) is applied with respect to each disregarded payment, and under the ordering rules specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(vi)(F)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2)(vi), paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(F)(
1
) of this section applies before paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(F)(
2
) of this section.
(
1
)
Income initially attributable to a foreign branch.
In applying this paragraph (f)(2)(vi) to gross income that would, but for this paragraph (f)(2)(vi), be attributable to a foreign branch, adjustments related to disregarded payments from a foreign branch to another foreign branch are computed first, followed by adjustments related to disregarded payments from a foreign branch to its foreign branch owner, followed by adjustments related to disregarded payments from a foreign branch owner to its foreign branch.
(
2
)
Income initially attributable to a foreign branch owner.
In applying this paragraph (f)(2)(vi) to gross income that would, but for this paragraph (f)(2)(vi), be attributable to a foreign branch owner, adjustments related to disregarded payments from a foreign branch owner to a foreign branch are computed first, followed by adjustments related to disregarded payments from a foreign branch to another foreign branch, followed by adjustments related to disregarded payments from a foreign branch to its foreign branch owner.
(G)
Effect of disregarded payments made and received by non-branch taxable units
—(
1
)
In general.
For purposes of determining the amount, source, and character of gross income attributable to a foreign branch and its foreign branch owner under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the rules of paragraph (f)(2) of this section apply to a non-branch taxable unit as though the non-branch taxable unit were a foreign branch or a foreign branch owner, as appropriate, to attribute gross income to the non-branch taxable unit and to further attribute, under this paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(G), the income of a non-branch taxable unit to one or more foreign branches or to a foreign branch owner. See paragraph (f)(4)(xvi) of this section (
Example 16
).
(
2
)
Foreign branch group income.
The income of a foreign branch group is attributed to the foreign branch that owns the group. The income of a foreign branch group is the aggregate of the U.S. gross income that is attributed, under the rules of this paragraph (f)(2), to each member of the foreign branch group, determined after accounting for all disregarded payments made and received by each member of the foreign branch group.
(
3
)
Foreign branch owner group income.
The income of a foreign branch owner group is attributed to the foreign branch owner that owns the group. The income of a foreign branch owner group income is the aggregate of the U.S. gross income that is attributed, under the rules of this paragraph (f)(2), to each member of the foreign branch owner group, determined after accounting for all disregarded payments made and received by each member of the foreign branch owner group.

means, with respect to property transferred in a transaction that is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes—
(A) The amounts that would be allowed as a deduction, and that would give rise to an adjustment described in section 1016(a)(2), with respect to the transferred property if the transfer (and the foreign branch) were regarded for Federal income tax purposes, to the extent that, under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(B)(
1
) of this section, the deduction would be allocable to—

(B)
Trade or business outside the United States.
Activities carried out in the United States, whether or not such activities are described in § 1.989(a)-1(b)(3), do not constitute the conduct of a trade or business outside the United States. Activities carried out outside the United States that constitute a permanent establishment under the terms of an income tax treaty between the United States and the country in which the activities are carried out
constitute a trade or business conducted outside the United States for purposes of this paragraph (f)(3)(vii)(B). In determining whether activities constitute a trade or business under § 1.989(a)-1(c), disregarded payments are taken into account and may give rise to a trade or business, provided that the activities (together with any other activities of the QBU) would otherwise satisfy the rule in § 1.989(a)-1(c).
(C)
Activities of a partnership, estate, trust, or corporation
—(

(
ii
) Comprise a foreign branch.
(
2
)

A foreign branch described in this paragraph (f)(3)(vii)(C) is treated as maintaining a separate set of books and records with respect to the activities described in paragraph (f)(3)(vii)(C)(
1
) of this section, and must determine, as the context requires, the items of gross income, disregarded payments, and any other items that would be reflected on those books and records in applying this paragraph (f) with respect to the foreign branch. The principles of § 1.1503(d)-5(c) apply for purposes of determining which items would be reflected on such books and records.
(viii)
Foreign branch group.

(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (f).
(i)
Example 1: Determination of foreign branches and foreign branch owner
—(A)
Facts.
(
1
) P, a domestic corporation, is a partner in PRS, a domestic partnership. All other partners in PRS are unrelated to P. PRS conducts activities solely in Country A (the Country A Business), and those activities constitute a trade or business outside the United States within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(vii)(B) of this section. PRS reflects items of income, gain, loss, and expense of the Country A Business on the books and records of PRS's home office. PRS is in the business of manufacturing bicycles.
(
2
) PRS owns FDE1, a disregarded entity organized in Country B. FDE1 conducts activities in Country B (the Country B Business), and those activities constitute a trade or business outside the United States within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(vii)(B) of this section. FDE1 maintains a set of
books and records that are separate from those of PRS, and the separate set of books and records reflects items of income, gain, loss, and expense with respect to the Country B Business. FDE1 is in the business of selling bicycles manufactured by PRS.
(
3
) FDE1 owns FDE2, a disregarded entity organized in Country C. FDE2 conducts activities in Country C (the Country C Business), and those activities constitute a trade or business outside the United States within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(vii)(B) of this section. FDE2 maintains a set of books and records that are separate from those of PRS and FDE1, and the separate set of books and records reflects items of income, gain, loss, and expense with respect to the Country C Business. FDE2's paper business is not related to FDE1's bicycle sales business, and FDE1 does not hold its interest in FDE2 in the ordinary course of its trade or business.
(B)
Analysis.
(
1
) Country A Business's activities comprise a trade or business conducted outside the United States within the meaning of § 1.989(a)-1(b)(2)(ii)(A) and (b)(3) (in each case, as modified by paragraph (f)(3)(vii) of this section). PRS does not maintain a separate set of books and records with respect to the Country A Business. However, under paragraph (f)(3)(vii)(C) of this section, the Country A Business's activities are deemed to satisfy the requirement of § 1.989(a)-1(b)(2)(ii)(B) that a QBU maintain a separate set of books and records with respect to the relevant activities. Thus, for purposes of this paragraph (f), the activities of the Country A Business constitute a QBU as defined in § 1.989-1(b)(2)(ii) and (b)(3), as modified by paragraph (f)(3)(vii) of this section, that conducts a trade or business outside the United States. Accordingly, the activities of the Country A Business constitute a foreign branch within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(vii) of this section. PRS, the person that owns the Country A Business, is the foreign branch owner, within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(ix) of this section, with respect to the Country A Business.
(
2
) Country B Business's activities comprise a trade or business outside the United States within the meaning of § 1.989(a)-1(b)(2)(ii)(A) and (b)(3) (in each case, as modified by paragraph (f)(3)(vii) of this section). PRS maintains a separate set of books and records with respect to the Country B Business, as described in § 1.989(a)-1(b)(2)(ii)(B). Thus, for purposes of this section, the activities of the Country B Business constitute a QBU as defined in § 1.989-1(b)(2)(ii) and (b)(3), as modified by paragraph (f)(3)(vii) of this section, that conducts a trade or business outside the United States. Accordingly, the activities of the Country B Business constitute a foreign branch within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(vii) of this section. Under paragraph (f)(3)(ix) of this section, PRS, the person that owns the Country B Business indirectly through FDE1 (a disregarded entity), is the foreign branch owner with respect to the Country B Business.
(
3
) The same analysis that applies to the Country B Business applies to the Country C Business. Accordingly, the activities of the Country C Business constitute a foreign branch within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(vii) of this section. PRS, the person that owns the Country C Business indirectly through FDE1 and FDE2 (disregarded entities), is the foreign branch owner with respect to the Country C Business.
(ii)
Example 2: Sale of foreign branch
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that in Year 1, FDE1 sells FDE2 to an unrelated person, recording gain from the sale on its books and records. In Year 2, PRS sells FDE1 to another unrelated person, recording gain from the sale on its books and records. In each year, PRS allocates a portion of the gain to P.
(B)
Analysis
—(
1
)
Sale of FDE2.
Under paragraph (f)(1)(i)(B) of this section, P's distributive share of gain recognized by PRS in connection with the sales of FDE1 and FDE2 constitutes foreign branch category income if it is attributable to a foreign branch held by PRS directly or indirectly through one or more disregarded entities. PRS's gross income from the Year 1 sale of FDE2 is reflected on the separate set of
books and records maintained with respect to the Country B Business (a foreign branch) operated by FDE1. Therefore, absent an exception, under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section PRS's gross income from the sale of FDE2 would be attributable to the Country B Business, and would constitute foreign branch category income. However, under paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section, gross income attributable to the Country B Business does not include gain from the sale or exchange of an interest in FDE2, a disregarded entity, unless the interest in FDE2 is held by the Country B Business in the ordinary course of its active trade or business (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(B) of this section). In this case, the Country B Business does not hold FDE2 in the ordinary course of its active trade or business within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. As a result, P's distributive share of gain from the sale of FDE2 is not attributable to a foreign branch, and is not foreign branch category income.
(
2
)
Sale of FDE1.
The analysis of PRS's sale of FDE1 in Year 2 is the same as the analysis for the sale of FDE2, except that PRS, through its Country A Business, holds FDE1 in the ordinary course of its active trade or business within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(B) of this section because the Country A Business engages in a trade or business that is related to the trade or business of FDE1. Therefore, P's distributive share of gain from the sale of FDE1 is attributable to a foreign branch, and is foreign branch category income.
(iii)
Example 3: Disregarded payment for services
—(A)
Facts.
P, a domestic corporation, owns FDE, a disregarded entity that is a foreign branch within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(vii) of this section. FDE's functional currency is the U.S. dollar. In Year 1, P accrues and records on its books and records (and not FDE's books and records) $1,000x of gross income from the performance of services to unrelated parties that is not passive category income, $400x of which is foreign source income in respect of services performed outside the United States by employees of FDE and $600x of which is U.S. source income in respect of services performed in the United States. Absent the application of paragraph (f)(2)(vi) of this section, the $1,000x of gross income earned by P would be general category income that would not be attributable to FDE. FDE provides services in support of P's gross income from services. P compensates FDE for its services with an arm's length payment of $400x, which is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes. The deduction for the payment of $400x from P to FDE would be allocated to P's $1,000x of general category gross services income and apportioned entirely to the $400x of foreign source services income under §§ 1.861-8 and 1.861-8T principles (treating foreign source general category gross income and U.S. source general category gross income each as a statutory grouping) if the payment were regarded for Federal income tax purposes.
(B)
Analysis.
The disregarded payment from P, a United States person, to FDE, its foreign branch, is not recorded on FDE's separate books and records (as adjusted to conform to Federal income tax principles) within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section because it is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes. However, the disregarded payment is allocable to gross income attributable to P because a deduction for the payment, if it were regarded, would be allocated and apportioned to the $400x of P's foreign source services income. Accordingly, under paragraphs (f)(2)(vi)(A) and (f)(2)(vi)(B)(
3
) of this section, the amount of gross income attributable to the FDE foreign branch (and the gross income attributable to P) is adjusted in Year 1 to take the disregarded payment into account. As such, $400x of P's foreign source gross income from the performance of services is attributable to the FDE foreign branch for purposes of this section. Therefore, $400x of the foreign source gross income that P earned with respect to its services in Year 1 constitutes gross income that is assigned to the foreign branch category.

Example 4: Disregarded payment for non-inventory property
—(A)
Facts.
P, a domestic corporation, owns FDE, a disregarded entity that is a foreign
branch within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(vii) of this section. FDE's functional currency is the U.S. dollar. P holds Asset A, a non-depreciable asset, with an adjusted basis of $200x. In Year 1, P sells Asset A, which will be used in FDE's manufacturing business, to FDE for $500x. FDE makes no other disregarded payments with respect to Asset A. No adjustments described in section 1016(a) apply with respect to Asset A while FDE holds Asset A. In Year 3, FDE sells Asset A to a third party for $600x and reflects $400x of gross income on its separate set of books and records (that is, $600x amount realized less Asset A's $200x adjusted basis). Under sections 865(e)(1) and 904(d)(2)(B)(i), the income arising from the sale of Asset A is foreign source income that is not treated as passive category income. Asset A is not inventory property. Absent the application of paragraph (f)(2)(vi) of this section, the entire $400x of gross income earned by P by reason of FDE's sale of Asset A would be attributable to FDE and be treated as foreign branch category income.

Disregarded basis determinations.
If regarded, the $500x payment from FDE to P would result in FDE holding Asset A with a basis of $500x under section 1012. Accordingly, the tentative disregarded basis (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(xiii) of this section) with respect to Asset A is $500x. Because there are no adjustments described in section 1016 with respect to Asset A (including any adjustments resulting from any disregarded payments made with respect to the transferred property), the adjusted disregarded basis (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section) with respect to Asset A is $500x.
(

)
Adjusted disregarded gain.
Under paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section, the adjusted disregarded gain with respect to Asset A is $300x, which is equal to the lesser of $300x (FDE's adjusted disregarded basis in Asset A ($500x) less the adjusted basis of Asset A at the time that Asset A was transferred to FDE ($200x)) and $400x (the gain (if any) attributable to the regarded sale or exchange of Asset A).
(

)
Attribution of gross income.
Under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(A) of this section, the gross income attributable to FDE ($400x) is adjusted downward to the extent that the $500x disregarded payment from FDE to P is allocable to gross income of FDE that is reflected on FDE's separate set of books and records. Under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(B)(
2
)(
ii
) of this section, the $500x payment from FDE to P is allocable to gross income attributable to FDE to the extent of FDE's adjusted disregarded gain ($300x) with respect to Asset A. The source and separate category of the gross income of FDE to which the payment is allocable is proportionate to the source and separate category of the gain recognized by FDE with respect to Asset A. Accordingly, $300x of the payment is allocable to foreign source income that would be foreign branch category income. Thus, under paragraphs (f)(2)(vi)(A) and (f)(2)(vi)(B)(
3
) of this section, foreign source gross income attributable to P is adjusted upward by $300x (increasing foreign source general category income by $300x) and foreign source gross income attributable to FDE is adjusted downward by $300x (decreasing foreign source foreign branch category income by $300x) in Year 3.

—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(4)(iv)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 4
), except as set forth in this paragraph (f)(4)(v)(A). Asset A is depreciable property. In Year 2, P is entitled to a $20x depreciation deduction with respect to Asset A, $18x of which is allocated and apportioned to non-passive category gross income attributable to FDE under §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T and $2x of which is allocated and apportioned to passive category gross income under §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T. If the transfer of Asset A were regarded for Federal income tax purposes, FDE would be entitled to a $50x depreciation deduction, 90% of which would be allocated and apportioned to non-passive category gross income attributable to FDE under §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T and 10% of which would be allocated and apportioned to passive category gross income under §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T. In Year 2, FDE earns $315x of gross income that it reflects on its
books and records that, in the absence of paragraph (f)(2)(vi) of this section, would be foreign branch category income. FDE also earns $35x of passive category income in Year 2 from the non-active rental of a portion of Asset A. In Year 3, FDE reflects $420x of gross income on its separate set of books and records by reason of the sale of Asset A (that is, $600x amount realized less Asset A's $180x adjusted basis), $42x of which is passive category income under paragraph (b) of this section.

Attribution of gross income in Year 2.
The disregarded payment from FDE to P in Year 1 is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes, and does not generate gross income. However, under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(B)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section, the disregarded payment is allocable to gross income attributable to FDE to the extent of any disregarded cost recovery deduction relating to that payment in Year 2. Under paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section, the disregarded cost recovery deduction with respect to Asset A is $30x, which is $50x (the amount that would be allowed as a deduction, and that would give rise to an adjustment described in section 1016(a)(2), with respect to Asset A if the transfer of Asset A to FDE were regarded for Federal income tax purposes, to the extent that the deduction would be allocable to income attributable to a foreign branch), reduced by $20x (the amount allowed as a deduction, and that gives rise to an adjustment described in section 1016(a)(2), with respect to Asset A, to the extent allocable to income attributable to a foreign branch). If regarded, $27x (90% of $30x) of the disregarded cost recovery deduction would be allocated and apportioned to non-passive category gross income attributable to FDE under §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T and $3x (10% of $30x) would be allocated and apportioned to passive category gross income under §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T. Accordingly, under paragraphs (f)(2)(vi)(A) and (f)(2)(vi)(B)(
3
) of this section, the $315x of non-passive category gross income that would otherwise be attributed to FDE is reduced to $288x ($315x less $27x), and the non-passive category gross income attributable to P is increased by $27x in Year 2. As a result, in Year 2, P's foreign branch category gross income is $288x, and its general category gross income is increased by $27x. P's passive category gross income is $35x.

Adjusted disregarded basis.
If regarded, the $500x payment from FDE to P would result in FDE holding Asset A with a basis of $500x under section 1012. Accordingly, the tentative disregarded basis (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(xiii) of this section) with respect to Asset A is $500x. To determine FDE's adjusted disregarded basis with respect to Asset A under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, FDE's tentative disregarded basis is reduced by $30x (the disregarded cost recovery deduction with respect to Asset A), resulting in an adjusted disregarded basis of $470x.

Adjusted disregarded gain.
Under paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section, the adjusted disregarded gain with respect to Asset A is $270x, which is equal to the lesser of $270x (FDE's adjusted disregarded basis in Asset A ($470x) less the adjusted basis of Asset A at the time that Asset A was transferred to FDE ($200x)), and $420x (the gain attributable to the regarded sale or exchange of Asset A).

Sale of Asset A.
Under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(A) of this section, the gross income attributable to FDE ($420x) by reason of the sale of Asset A is adjusted downward to the extent that the $500x disregarded payment from FDE to P is allocable to gross income that would be attributable to FDE under paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (v) of this section. Under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(B)(
2
)(
ii
) of this section, the $500x payment from FDE to P is allocable to gross income attributable to FDE to the extent of the adjusted disregarded gain with respect to Asset A, which is $270x. The source and separate category of the gross income of FDE to which that amount is allocable is proportionate to the source and separate category of the $420x of gain recognized on the regarded sale of Asset A ($378x of foreign source non-passive category income and $42x of foreign source passive category income). Consequently, under paragraphs (f)(2)(vi)(A) and
(f)(2)(vi)(B)(
3
) of this section, in Year 3, gross income attributable to P is adjusted upward by $270x (increasing P's foreign source general category gross income by $243x, which bears the same proportion to $270x as the foreign source non-passive gain ($378x) bears to P's overall gain with respect to Asset A ($420x)), and the foreign source gross income attributable to FDE is adjusted downward by $270x (with foreign source foreign branch category gross income reduced by $243x). P also has $42x of foreign source passive category income from the sale of Asset A.

—(A)
Facts.
P, a domestic corporation, owns FDE, a disregarded entity that is a foreign branch within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(vii) of this section. FDE's functional currency is the U.S. dollar. P manufactures portable electronic devices, which it sells to FDE for $1,500x during a taxable year in a transaction that is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes. In the same taxable year, FDE sells the portable electronic devices to its customers for $1,750x. P uses an overall accrual method of accounting
and has $1,300x of cost of goods sold for the taxable year, $1,200x of which were incurred prior to the disregarded sale to FDE and recorded on P's separate set of books and records and $100x of which were incurred after the disregarded sale and recorded on the books and records of FDE. P reports $450x of gross income for the taxable year: $1,750x of gross receipts less cost of goods sold of $1,300x. The $450x of gross income from the sale of portable electronic devices is U.S. source income under section 863(b).

In general.
The gross receipts from the sale of portable electronic devices ($1,750x), which results in U.S. source gross income of $450x, is recorded on FDE's separate books and records (as adjusted to conform to Federal income tax principles). Therefore, the gross income ($450x) generally would be foreign branch category income under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. However, under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(A) of this section, the amount of gross income attributable to FDE (and the gross income attributable to P) is adjusted to take the disregarded payment for the portable electronic devices from FDE to P into account. If both FDE and the disregarded payment from FDE to P were recognized for Federal income tax purposes, the amount of the payment ($1,500x) would reduce FDE's gross income. Therefore, under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(B)(

Accordingly, under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(A) of this section, general category U.S. source gross income attributable to P is adjusted upward by $300x and the non-passive category U.S. source gross income attributable to FDE is adjusted downward by $300x.

Absent the application of paragraph (f)(2)(vi) of this section, the gross income earned by P through its U.S. office would be general category income. FDE accrues and records on its books and records $3,400x of gross income from the performance of web design services for Customer B, an unrelated party (the Customer B services). The gross income from the Customer B services performed by FDE is non-passive category income and, under section 862(a)(3), is foreign source income.

Disregarded payment from FDE to P.
The disregarded payment from FDE to P is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes, and does not generate gross income. However, the disregarded payment is allocable to non-passive category gross income attributable to FDE because a deduction for the payment, if it were regarded, would be allocated to FDE's $3,400x of non-passive category foreign source gross services income under § 1.861-8. Under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(A) of this section, the amount of non-passive category foreign source gross income attributable to FDE is adjusted downward, and the amount of general category foreign source gross income attributable to P (in its capacity as a foreign branch owner) is adjusted upward, to take the disregarded payment into account. Thus, $300x of FDE's foreign source gross income relating to the Customer B services is attributable to P for purposes of this section, and $3,100x of that income is attributable to FDE.

Disregarded payment from FDE1 to FDE2.
The $1,000x of gross income earned by FDE1 from the Customer A services would, but for paragraph (f)(2)(vi) of this section, be attributable to FDE1 (a foreign branch). Accordingly, under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(F)(
1
) of this section, adjustments related to disregarded payments from FDE1 to FDE2 are computed before adjustments related to disregarded payments from FDE2 to P (in its capacity as a foreign branch owner). The disregarded payment from FDE1 to FDE2 is not recorded on FDE2's separate books and records (as adjusted to conform to Federal income tax principles) within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section because it is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes. However, the disregarded payment is allocable to gross income attributable to FDE1 because a deduction for the payment, if it were regarded, would be allocated to FDE1's $1,000x of non-passive category foreign source gross services income under § 1.861-8. Accordingly, under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(A) of this section, the amount of non-passive category foreign source gross income attributable to FDE1 is adjusted downward, and the amount of non-passive category foreign source gross income attributable to FDE2 is adjusted upward, to take the disregarded payment into account. Thus, $200x of FDE1's non-passive category foreign source gross income from the performance of Customer A services is attributable to FDE2 for purposes of this section, and $800x of that income is attributable to FDE1.

Disregarded payment from FDE2 to P.
The disregarded payment from FDE2 to P is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes, and does not generate gross income. However, the disregarded payment is allocable to gross income attributable to FDE2 because a deduction for the payment, if it were regarded, would be allocated to FDE2's $200x of non-passive category foreign source gross services income under § 1.861-8. Under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(A) of this section, the amount of non-passive category foreign source gross income attributable to FDE2 is adjusted downward, and the amount of general category foreign source gross income attributable to P is adjusted upward, to take the $50x disregarded payment into account. Thus, $50x of non-passive category foreign source gross income relating to the Customer A services is attributable to P for purposes of this section, $150x of that income is attributable to FDE2, and $800x of that income remains attributable to FDE1. FDE2's $1,100x of U.S. source royalty income is not adjusted under paragraph (f)(2)(vi) of this section and remains foreign branch category income.

Facts.
P, a domestic corporation that has a calendar taxable year, owns FDE, a disregarded entity that is a foreign branch within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(vii) of this section. FDE's functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Asset A, a patent with a useful life ending on December 31, Year 2, was obtained with respect to a discovery that was made by FDE in the course of its trade or business and was used in that trade or business until December 31, Year 1. On December 31, Year 1, FDE remits Asset A to P and receives no consideration. Asset A has an adjusted basis of $0. In Year 2, P uses Asset A to generate general category gross income. P earns $1,000x of general category U.S. source gross income in Year 2, including the income generated by its use of Asset A. If FDE were a domestic corporation, P were a foreign corporation, and Asset A had
been transferred in exchange for stock in a transaction described in section 351, such that section 367(d) applied by its terms (but all other facts remained the same), the payment determined under section 367(d) for Year 2 would be $300x. A disregarded payment for the use of Asset A, if it were regarded, would be allocated to FDE's $1,000x of general category U.S. source gross income under § 1.861-8.
(B)
Analysis.
The remittance of Asset A by FDE to P is a transfer of intangible property described in section 367(d)(4) from a foreign branch to its foreign branch owner. The facts in paragraph (f)(4)(xii)(A) of this section do not implicate an exception in paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(D)(
2
) or (
3
) of this section. Therefore, this is a transaction to which paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(D)(
1
) of this section applies. The foreign branch is treated as having sold the transferred property to the foreign branch owner in exchange for annual payments contingent on the productivity or use of the property, the amount of which for Year 2 is determined under the principles of section 367(d) to be $300x. Thus, in Year 2, P is treated as making a $300x disregarded payment to FDE. The payment would be allocable to general category U.S. source income under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(B)(
1
)(
i
) of this section. Therefore, $300x of P's non-passive category U.S. source gross income is attributable to FDE under paragraphs (f)(2)(vi)(A) and (f)(2)(vi)(B)(
3
) of this section. P has $700x of general category U.S. source gross income and $300x of foreign branch category U.S. source gross income in Year 2.
(xiii)
Example 13: Disregarded payment from domestic corporation to foreign branch
—(A)
Facts.
P, a domestic corporation, owns FDE, a disregarded entity that is a foreign branch. FDE's functional currency is the U.S. dollar. In Year 1, P accrues and records on its books and records for Federal income tax purposes $400x of gross income from the license of intellectual property to unrelated parties that is not passive category income, all of which is U.S. source income. P also accrues $600x of foreign source passive category interest income. P compensates FDE for services that FDE performs in a foreign country with an arm's length payment of $350x, which FDE records on its books and records; the transaction is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes. Absent the application of paragraph (f)(2)(vi) of this section, the $400x of gross income earned by P from the license would be general category income that would not be attributable to FDE. If the $350x disregarded payment from P to FDE were regarded for Federal income tax purposes, the deduction for the payment would be allocated and apportioned entirely to P's $400x of general category gross licensing income under the principles of §§ 1.861-8 and 1.861-8T (treating U.S. source general category gross income and foreign source passive category gross income each as a statutory grouping). P and FDE incur no other expenses.
(B)
Analysis.
The $350x disregarded payment from P, a United States person, to FDE, its foreign branch, is not recorded on FDE's separate books and records (as adjusted to conform to Federal income tax principles) under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section because it is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes. The disregarded payment is allocable to gross income attributable to P because a deduction for the payment, if it were regarded, would be allocated and apportioned to the $400x of P's U.S. source licensing income. Accordingly, under paragraphs (f)(2)(vi)(A) and (f)(2)(vi)(B)(
3
) of this section, the amount of gross income attributable to the FDE foreign branch (and the gross income attributable to P) is adjusted in Year 1 to take the disregarded payment into account. Accordingly, $350x of P's $400x U.S. source general category gross income from the license is attributable to the FDE foreign branch for purposes of this section. Therefore, $350x of the U.S. source gross income that P earned with respect to its license in Year 1 constitutes U.S. source gross income that is assigned to the foreign branch category and $50x remains U.S. source general category income. P's $600x of foreign source passive category interest income is unchanged.
(xiv)
Example 14: Regarded payment from non-consolidated domestic corporation to a foreign branch
—(A)
Facts.
The
facts are the same as those in paragraph (f)(4)(xiii)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 13
), except P wholly owns USS, and USS (rather than P) owns FDE. P and USS do not file a consolidated return. USS has no gross income other than the $350x foreign source services income from the $350x payment it receives from P, through FDE.
(B)
Analysis.
The $350x services payment from P, a United States person, to FDE, a foreign branch of USS, is not a disregarded payment because the transaction is regarded for Federal income tax purposes. Under §§ 1.861-8 and 1.861-8T, P's $350x deduction for the services payment is allocated and apportioned to its U.S. source general category gross income. The payment of $350x from P to USS is services income attributable to FDE, and foreign branch category income of USS under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. Accordingly, USS has $350x of foreign source foreign branch category gross income. P has $600x of foreign source passive category income and $400x of U.S. source general category gross income and a $350x deduction for the services payment, resulting in $50x of U.S. source general category taxable income to P.
(xv)
Example 15: Regarded payment from a member of a consolidated group to a foreign branch of another member of the consolidated group
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as those in paragraph (f)(4)(xiv)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 14
), except that P and USS are members of an affiliated group that files a consolidated return pursuant to section 1502 (P group).
(B)
Analysis
—(
1
)
Definitions under § 1.1502-13.
Under § 1.1502-13(b)(1), the $350x services payment from P to FDE, a foreign branch of USS, is an intercompany transaction between P and USS; USS is the selling member, P is the buying member, P has a deduction of $350x for the services payment that is a corresponding item, and USS has $350x of income that is an intercompany item. The payment is not a disregarded payment because the transaction is regarded for Federal income tax purposes.

Timing and attributes under § 1.1502-13
—(
i
)
Separate entity versus single entity analysis.
Under a separate entity analysis, the result is the same as in paragraph (f)(4)(xiv)(B) of this section (the analysis in
Example 14
), whereby P has $600x of foreign source passive category income and $50x of U.S. source general category income, and USS has $350x of foreign source foreign branch category income. In contrast, under a single entity analysis, the result is the same as in paragraph (f)(4)(xiii)(B) of this section (the analysis in
Example 13
), whereby P has $600x of foreign source passive category income, $50x of U.S. source general category income, and $350x of U.S. source foreign branch category income.
(
ii
)
Application of the matching rule.
Under the matching rule in § 1.1502-13(c), the timing, character, source, and other attributes of USS's $350x intercompany item and P's $350x corresponding item are redetermined to produce the effect of transactions between divisions of a single corporation, as if the services payment had been made to a foreign branch of that corporation. Accordingly, all of USS's foreign source income of $350x is redetermined to be U.S. source, rather than foreign source, income. Therefore, for purposes of § 1.1502-4(c)(1), the P group has $600x of foreign passive category income, $50x of U.S. source general category income, and $350x of U.S. source foreign branch category income.
(xvi)
Example 16: Disregarded payment made from non-branch taxable unit
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as those in paragraph (f)(4)(xiii)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 13
), except that P also wholly owns FDE1, a disregarded entity that is a non-branch taxable unit. In addition, FDE1 (rather than P) is the entity that properly accrues and records on its books and records the $400x of U.S. source general category income from the license of intellectual property and the $600x of foreign source passive category interest income, and FDE1 (rather than P) is the entity that makes the $350x payment, which is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes, to FDE in compensation for services.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(G) of this section, the rules of paragraph (f)(2) of this section apply to attribute gross income to FDE1, a non-
branch taxable unit, as though FDE1 were a foreign branch. Under these rules, the $400x of licensing income and the $600 of interest income are initially attributable to FDE1. This income is adjusted in Year 1 to account for the $350x disregarded payment, which is allocable to the $400x of licensing income of FDE1. Accordingly, $50x of the $400x of U.S. source general category licensing income is attributable to FDE1 and $350x of this income is attributable to the FDE foreign branch. To determine the income that is attributable to P, the foreign branch owner, and FDE, the foreign branch, the income that is attributed to FDE1, after taking into account all of the disregarded payments that it makes and receives, must be further attributed to one or more foreign branches or a foreign branch owner under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(G) of this section. Under paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(G) of this section, the income of FDE1 is attributed to the foreign branch group or foreign branch owner group of which it is a member. Because FDE1 is wholly owned by P, FDE is a member solely of the foreign branch owner group that is owned by P. See definition of “foreign branch owner group” in § 1.904-4(f)(3). All the income that is attributed to FDE1 under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, namely, the $50x of U.S. source general category licensing income and the $600x of foreign source passive category interest income, is further attributed to P. See § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi)(G)(
3
). Therefore, the result is the same as in paragraph (f)(4)(xiii)(B) of this section (the analysis in
Example 13
).
(g)
Section 951A category income
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the term
section 951A category income
means amounts included (directly or indirectly through a pass-through entity) in gross income of a United States person under section 951A(a).
(2)
Exceptions for passive category income.
Section 951A category income does not include any amounts included under section 951A(a) that are allocable to passive category income under § 1.904-5(c)(6).
(h)
Export financing interest
—(1)
Definitions
—(i)
Export financing interest.
The term “export financing interest” means any interest derived from financing the sale (or other disposition) for use or consumption outside the United States of any property that is manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted in the United States by the taxpayer or a related person, and not more than 50 percent of the fair market value of which is attributable to products imported into the United States. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “United States” includes the fifty States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
(ii)
Fair market value.
For purposes of this paragraph, the fair market value of any property imported into the United States shall be its appraised value, as determined by the Secretary under section 402 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1401a) in connection with its importation. For purposes of determining the foreign content of an item of property imported into the United States, see section 927 and the regulations thereunder.
(iii)
Related person.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term “related person” has the meaning given it by section 954(d)(3) except that such section shall be applied by substituting “the person with respect to whom the determination is being made” for “controlled foreign corporation” each place it applies.
(2)
Treatment of export financing interest.
Except as provided in paragraph (h)(3) of this section, if a taxpayer (including a financial services entity) receives or accrues export financing interest from an unrelated person, then that interest is not treated as passive category income. Instead, the interest income is treated as foreign branch category income, section 951A category income, general category income, or income in a specified separate category under the rules of this section.
(3)
Exception.
Unless it is received or accrued by a financial services entity, export financing interest shall be treated as passive category income if that income is also related person factoring income. For this purpose, related person factoring income is—
(i) Income received or accrued by a controlled foreign corporation that is income described in section 864(d)(6)
(income of a controlled foreign corporation from a loan for the purpose of financing the purchase of inventory property of a related person); or
(ii) Income received or accrued by any person that is income described in section 864(d)(1) (income from a trade receivable acquired from a related person).
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (h)(3) of this section.
(i)
Example 1.
Controlled foreign corporation CFC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of domestic corporation USP. CFC is not a financial services entity and has accumulated cash reserves. USP has uncollected trade and service receivables of foreign obligors. USP sells the receivables at a discount (“factors”) to CFC. The income derived by CFC on the receivables is related person factoring income. The income is also export financing interest. Because the income is related person factoring income, the income is passive category income to CFC.
(ii)
Example 2.
Domestic corporation USS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of domestic corporation USP. USS is not a financial services entity, does not have any foreign qualified business entities, and has accumulated cash reserves. USP has uncollected trade and service receivables of foreign obligors. USP factors the receivables to USS. The income derived by USS on the receivables is related person factoring income. The income is also export financing interest. The income will be passive category income to USS.
(iii)
Example 3.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section (the facts in
Example 2
), except that instead of factoring USP's receivables, USS finances the sales of USP's goods by making loans to the purchasers of USP's goods. The interest derived by USS on these loans is export financing interest and is not related person factoring income. The income will be general category income to USS.
(5)
Income eligible for section 864(d)(7) exception (same country exception) from related person factoring treatment
—(i)
Income other than interest.
If any foreign person receives or accrues income that is described in section 864(d)(7) (income on a trade or service receivable acquired from a related person in the same foreign country as the recipient) and such income would also meet the definition of export financing interest if section 864(d)(1) applied to such income (income on a trade or service receivable acquired from a related person treated as interest), then the income is considered to be export financing interest and is not treated as passive category income. The income is treated as foreign branch category income, section 951A category income, general category income, or income in a specified separate category under the rules of this section.
(ii)
Interest income.
If export financing interest is received or accrued by any foreign person and that income would otherwise be treated as related person factoring income of a controlled foreign corporation under section 864(d)(6) if section 864(d)(7) did not apply, section 904(d)(2)(B)(iii)(I) applies and the interest is not treated as passive category income. The income is treated as general category income in the hands of the controlled foreign corporation.
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (h)(5):
(A)
Example 1.
CFC1, a controlled foreign corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of domestic corporation USP. CFC2, a controlled foreign corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CFC1. CFC1 and CFC2 are incorporated in Country M. In Year 1, USP sells tractors to CFC2, which CFC2 sells to X, an unrelated foreign corporation organized in Country M. The tractors are to be used in Country M. CFC2 uses a substantial part of its assets in its trade or business located in Country M. CFC2 has uncollected trade receivables from X that it factors to CFC1. The income is not related person factoring income because it is described in section 864(d)(7) (income eligible for the same country exception) and is tested income. If section 864(d)(1) applied, the income CFC1 derived from the receivables would meet the definition of export financing interest. The income, therefore, is considered to be export financing interest and is general category income to CFC1 and may be section 951A category income to USP.
(B)
Example 2.
CFC1, a controlled foreign corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of domestic corporation, USP. CFC2, a controlled foreign corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CFC1. CFC1 and CFC2 are incorporated in Country M. In Year 1, USP sells tractors to CFC2, which CFC2 sells to X, a foreign partnership that is organized in Country M and is related to CFC1 and CFC2. CFC1 makes a loan to X to finance the tractor sales. The interest earned by CFC1 from financing the sales is described in section 864(d)(7) and is export financing interest and is tested income. Therefore, the income is general category income to CFC1 and may be section 951A category income to USP.
(i)
Interaction of section 907(c) and income described in this section.
If a person receives or accrues income that is income described in section 907(c) (relating to oil and gas income), the rules of section 907(c) and the regulations thereunder, as well as the rules of this section, shall apply to the income. The reduction in amount allowed as foreign tax provided by section 907(a) shall therefore be calculated separately for income in each separate category.
(j)
Special rule for DASTM gain or loss.
Any DASTM gain or loss computed under § 1.985-3(d) must be allocated among the categories of income under the rules of § 1.985-3 (e)(2)(iv) or (e)(3). The rules of § 1.985-3(e) apply before the rules of section 904(d)(2)(B)(iii)(II) (the exception from passive income for high-taxed income).
(k)
Separate category under section 904(d)(6) or 865(h) for items resourced under treaties
—(1)
Section 904(d)(6)
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (k)(1)(iv)(A) of this section, sections 904(a), (b), (c), (d), (f), and (g) and sections 907 and 960 are applied separately to any item of income that, without regard to a treaty obligation of the United States, would be treated as derived from sources within the United States, but under a treaty obligation of the United States such item of income would be treated as arising from sources outside the United States, and the taxpayer chooses the benefits of such treaty obligation.
(ii)
Aggregation of items of income in each other separate category.
For purposes of applying the general rule of paragraph (k)(1) of this section, items of income in each other separate category of income that are resourced under each applicable treaty are aggregated in a single separate category for income in that separate category that is resourced under that treaty. For example, all items of passive category income that would otherwise be treated as derived from sources within the United States but which the taxpayer chooses to treat as arising from sources outside the United States pursuant to a provision of a bilateral U.S. income tax treaty are treated as income in a separate category for passive category income resourced under the particular treaty, and the high-tax kickout grouping rules of paragraph (c) of this section are applied separately to the groups of passive income included in that separate category. Any items of resourced high-taxed passive income are assigned to a separate category for general (or other) category income resourced under a tax treaty. Items of income described in paragraph (k)(1) of this section are not combined with other income that is foreign source income under the Code, even if the other income arises from sources within the jurisdiction with which the United States has a bilateral income tax treaty (“treaty jurisdiction”) and is included in the same separate category to which the resourced income would be assigned without regard to section 904(d)(6). Items of income described in paragraph (k)(1) of this section are also not combined with other items of resourced income that are subject to a separate limitation by reason of a Code provision other than section 904(d)(6).
(iii)
Related taxes.
Foreign taxes, including foreign taxes paid to a foreign jurisdiction other than the treaty jurisdiction on an item of resourced income, are allocated to each separate category described in paragraph (k)(1)(ii) of this section in accordance with § 1.904-6.
(iv)
Coordination with certain income tax treaty provisions
—(A)
Exception for special relief from double taxation for individual residents of treaty jurisdictions.
Section 904(d)(6)(A) and paragraph (k)(1) of this section do not apply to any item of income deemed to be from
foreign sources by reason of the relief from double taxation rules in any U.S. income tax treaty that is solely applicable to U.S. citizens who are residents of the other Contracting State.
(B)
U.S. competent authority assistance.
For purposes of applying paragraph (k)(1) of this section, if, under the mutual agreement procedure provisions of an applicable income tax treaty, the U.S. competent authority agrees to allow a taxpayer to treat an item of income as foreign source income, where such item of income would otherwise be treated as derived from sources within the United States, then the taxpayer is considered to have chosen the benefits of such treaty obligation to treat the item as foreign source income.
(v)
Coordination with other Code provisions.
Section 904(d)(6)(A) and paragraph (k)(1) of this section do not apply to any item of income to which any of section 245(a)(10), 865(h), or 904(h)(10) applies.
See also
paragraph (l) of this section.
(2)
Section 865(h).
If any gain, as defined in section 865(h)(2)(A)(i), would be treated as derived from sources within the United States under section 865, but pursuant to a treaty obligation of the United States such gain would be treated as arising from sources outside the United States, and the taxpayer chooses the benefits of such treaty obligation, then that gain will be treated as foreign source income. However, sections 904(a), (b), (c), (d), (f), and (g) and sections 907 and 960 are applied separately to amounts described in the preceding sentence with respect to each treaty under which the taxpayer has claimed benefits and, within each treaty, to each separate category of income. The principles of the rules in paragraphs (k)(1)(ii) through (iv) of this section apply to gains, and foreign taxes on gains, that are subject to a separate limitation under section 865(h).
(l)
Priority rule.
Income that meets the definitions of a specified separate category and another category of income described in section 904(d)(1) is subject to the separate limitation described in paragraph (m) of this section and is not treated as general category income, foreign branch category income, passive category income, or section 951A category income.
(m)
Income treated as allocable to a specified separate category.
If section 904(a), (b), and (c) are applied separately to any category of income under the Internal Revenue Code (for example, under section 245(a)(10), 865(h), 901(j), 904(d)(6), or 904(h)(10)), that category of income is treated for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code as if it were a separate category listed in section 904(d)(1). For purposes of this section, a separate category that is treated as if it were listed in section 904(d)(1) by reason of the first sentence in this paragraph (m) is referred to as a
specified separate category.
(n)
Income from partnerships and other pass-through entities
—(1)
Distributive shares of partnership income
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (n)(1)(ii) of this section, a partner's distributive share of partnership income is characterized as passive category income to the extent that the distributive share is a share of income earned or accrued by the partnership in the passive category. A partner's distributive share of partnership income that is not described in the first sentence of this paragraph (n) is treated as foreign branch category income, general category income, or income in a specified separate category under the rules of this section. The principles of the rules in this paragraph (n)(1)(i) also apply to characterize a person's share of income from any other pass-through entity.
(ii)
Less than 10 percent partners partnership interests
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (n)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, if any limited partner owns less than 10 percent of the value in a partnership, the partner's distributive share of partnership income from the partnership is passive income to the partner (subject to the exception for high-taxed income under section 904(d)(2)(B)(iii)(II) and paragraph (c) of this section), and the partner's distributive share of partnership deductions from the partnership is allocated and apportioned under the principles of § 1.861-8 only to the partner's passive income from that partnership. See also § 1.861-9(e)(4) for rules for apportioning partnership interest expense.
(B)
Exception for partnership interest held in the ordinary course of business.
If a partnership interest described in paragraph (n)(1)(ii)(A) of this section is held in the ordinary course of a partner's active trade or business, the rules of paragraph (n)(1)(i) of this section apply for purposes of characterizing the partner's distributive share of the partnership income. A partnership interest is considered to be held in the ordinary course of a partner's active trade or business if the partner (or a member of the partner's affiliated group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1504(a) and without regard to section 1504(b)(3))) engages (other than through a less than 10 percent interest in a partnership) in the same or a related trade or business as the partnership.
(2)
Income from the sale of a partnership interest
—(i)
In general.
To the extent a partner recognizes gain on the sale of a partnership interest, that income shall be treated as passive income to the partner, subject to the exception for high-taxed income under section 904(d)(2)(B)(iii)(II) and paragraph (c) of this section.
(ii)
Exception for sale by 25-percent owner.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section, in the case of a sale of an interest in a partnership by a partner that is a 25-percent owner of the partnership, determined by applying section 954(c)(4)(B) and substituting “partner” for “controlled foreign corporation” every place it appears, for purposes of determining the separate category to which the income recognized on the sale of the partnership interest is assigned such partner is treated as selling the proportionate share of the assets of the partnership attributable to such interest.
(3)
Value of a partnership interest.
For purposes of paragraphs (n)(1) and (2) of this section, a partner will be considered as owning 10 percent of the value of a partnership for a particular year if the partner, together with any person that bears a relationship to the partner described in section 267(b) or 707, owns 10 percent of the capital and profits interest of the partnership. For purposes of this paragraph (n)(3), value will be determined at the end of the partnership's taxable year.
(4)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (n).
(i)
Facts.
PRS is a domestic partnership. PRS has two general partners, A and B. A and B each have a greater than 10% interest in PRS. PRS also has two limited partners, C and D. C has a 50% interest in the partnership and D has a 9% interest. D's partnership interest is not held in the ordinary course of business. A, B, C and D are all United States persons. In Year 1, PRS has $100x of general category non-subpart F income on which it pays no foreign tax.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (n)(1)(i) of this section, A's, B's, and C's distributive shares of PRS's income are not passive category income. Under paragraph (n)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, because D is a limited partner with a less than 10% interest in PRS, D's distributive share of PRS's income is passive category income.
(o)
Separate category of section 78 gross up.
The amount included in income under section 78 by reason of taxes deemed paid under section 960 is assigned to the separate category to which the taxes are allocated under 1.904-6(e).
(p)
Separate category of foreign currency gain or loss.
Foreign currency gain or loss recognized under section 986(c) with respect to a distribution of previously taxed earnings and profits (as described in section 959 or 1293(c)) is assigned to the separate category or categories of the previously taxed earnings and profits from which the distribution is made. See § 1.987-6(b) for rules on assigning section 987 gain or loss on a remittance from a section 987 QBU to a separate category or categories.
(q)
Applicability date.
(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (q)(2) and (3) of this section, this section applies for taxable years that both begin after December 31, 2017, and end on or after December 4, 2018.
(2) Paragraphs (c)(7)(i) and (iii) and (c)(8)(v) through (viii) apply to taxable years ending on or after December 16, 2019. For taxable years that both begin after December 31, 2017, and end on or after December 4, 2018, and also end before December 16, 2019, see § 1.904-
4(c)(7)(i) and (iii) as in effect on December 17, 2019.
(3) Except as provided in the following sentence, paragraph (f) of this section applies to taxable years that begin after December 31, 2019, and end on or after November 2, 2020. Paragraph (f)(2)(vi)(D)(
4
) of this section applies to taxable years that begin on or after October 10, 2024.

§ 1.904-5
Look-through rules as applied to controlled foreign corporations and other entities.
(a)
Scope and definitions
—(1)
Look-through rules under section 904(d)(3) to passive category income.
Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for determining the extent to which dividends, interest, rents, and royalties received or accrued by certain eligible persons, and inclusions under sections 951(a)(1) and 951A(a), are treated as passive category income. Paragraph (g) of this section provides rules applying the principles of paragraph (c) of this section to foreign source interest, rents, and royalties paid by a domestic corporation to a related corporation. Paragraph (h) of this section provides rules for assigning a partnership payment to a partner described in section 707 to the passive category. Paragraph (i) of this section provides rules applying the principles of this section to assign distributions and payments from certain related entities to the passive category or to treat the distributions and payments as not in the passive category.
(2)
Other look-through rules under section 904(d).
Under section 904(d)(4) and paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, certain dividends from noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporations are treated as income in a separate category. Under section 904(d)(3)(H) and paragraph (j) of this section, certain inclusions under section 1293 are treated as income in a separate category. Paragraph (i) of this section provides rules applying the principles of this section to assign distributions from certain related entities to separate categories.
(3)
Other rules provided in this section.
Paragraph (b) of this section provides operative rules for this section. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules addressing exceptions to passive category income for certain purposes in the case of controlled foreign corporations that meet the requirements of section 954(b)(3)(A) (de minimis rule) or section 954(b)(4) (high-tax exception). Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules for characterizing a controlled foreign corporation's foreign base company income and gross insurance income when section 954(b)(3)(B) (full inclusion rule) applies. Paragraph (f) of this section modifies the look-through rules for certain types of income. Paragraph (k) of this section provides ordering rules for applying the look-through rules. Paragraph (l) of this section provides examples illustrating the application of certain rules in this section. Paragraphs (m) and (n) of this section provide rules related to the resourcing rules described in section 904(h).
(4)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
(i) The term
controlled foreign corporation
has the meaning given such term by section 957 (taking into account the special rule for certain captive insurance companies contained in section 953(c)), determined without applying section 318(a)(3)(A), (B), and (C) so as to consider a United States person as owning stock which is owned by a person who is not a United States person.
(ii) The term
look-through rules
means the rules described in this section that assign income to a separate category based on the separate category of the income to which it is allocable.
(iii) The term
noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation
has the meaning provided in section 904(d)(2)(E)(i).
(iv) The term
pass-through entity
means a partnership, S corporation, or any other person (whether domestic or foreign) other than a corporation to the extent that the income or deductions of the person are included in the income of one or more direct or indirect owners or beneficiaries of the person. For example, if a domestic trust is
subject to Federal income tax on a portion of its income and its owners are subject to tax on the remaining portion, the domestic trust is treated as a domestic pass-through entity with respect to such remaining portion.
(v) The term
separate category
means, as the context requires, any category of income described in section 904(d)(1)(A), (B), (C), or (D), any specified separate category of income as defined in § 1.904-4(m), or any category of earnings and profits to which income described in such provisions is attributable.
(vi) The term
United States shareholder
has the meaning given such term by section 951(b) (taking into account the special rule for certain captive insurance companies contained in section 953(c)), determined without applying section 318(a)(3)(A), (B), and (C) so as to consider a United States person as owning stock which is owned by a person who is not a United States person, except that for purposes of this section, a United States shareholder includes any member of the controlled group of the United States shareholder. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(4)(vi), the controlled group is any member of the affiliated group within the meaning of section 1504(a)(1) except that “more than 50 percent” is substituted for “at least 80 percent” wherever it appears in section 1504(a)(2). When used in reference to a noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation described in section 904(d)(2)(E)(i)(II), the term
United States shareholder
also means a taxpayer that meets the stock ownership requirements described in section 904(d)(2)(E)(i)(II).
(b)
Operative rules
—(1)
Assignment of income not assigned under the look-through rules.
Except as provided by the look-through rules, dividends, interest, rents, and royalties received or accrued by a taxpayer from a controlled foreign corporation in which the taxpayer is a United States shareholder are excluded from passive category income. Income excluded from the passive category under this paragraph (b)(1) is assigned to another separate category (other than the passive category) under the rules in § 1.904-4.
(2)
Priority and ordering of look-through rules.
Except as provided in this paragraph (b)(2), to the extent the look-through rules assign income to a separate category, the income is assigned to that separate category rather than the separate category to which the income would have been assigned under § 1.904-4 (not taking into account § 1.904-4(l)). See paragraph (k) of this section for ordering rules for applying the look-through rules. However, passive income that is financial services income is assigned to a separate category under the rules in § 1.904-4(e)(1), (f)(1), and (l), regardless of whether the look-through rules otherwise would have assigned such income to the passive category.
(c)
Rules for specific types of inclusions and payments
—(1)
Scope.
Subject to the exceptions in paragraph (f) of this section, paragraphs (c)(2) through (6) (other than paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section) of this section provide look-through rules with respect to interest, rents, royalties, dividends, and inclusions under sections 951(a)(1) and 951A(a) that are received or accrued from a controlled foreign corporation in which the taxpayer is a United States shareholder. Paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section provides a look-through rule for dividends received from a noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation by a domestic corporation that is a United States shareholder in the foreign corporation.
(2)
Interest
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph, related person interest is any interest paid or accrued by a controlled foreign corporation to any United States shareholder in that corporation (or to any other related person) to which the look-through rules of section 904(d)(3) and this section apply. Unrelated person interest is all interest other than related person interest. Related person interest is treated as passive category income to the extent it is allocable to passive category income of the controlled foreign corporation. If related person interest is received or accrued from a controlled foreign corporation by two or more persons, the amount of interest received or accrued by each person that is allocable to passive category income is determined by multiplying the
amount of related person interest allocable to passive category income by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the amount of related person interest received or accrued by that person and the denominator is the total amount of related person interest paid or accrued by the controlled foreign corporation. Solely for purposes of assigning interest income to a separate category under section 904(d)(3) and the look-through rule in this paragraph (c)(2), the rules in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section for allocating and apportioning interest expense of a controlled foreign corporation apply for purposes of characterizing interest income in the hands of the recipient, even if a deduction for the interest expense is deferred or disallowed to the controlled foreign corporation.
(ii)
Allocating and apportioning expenses of a controlled foreign corporation including interest paid to a related person.
Related person interest and other expenses of a controlled foreign corporation shall be allocated and apportioned in the following manner:
(A) Gross income in each separate category shall be determined;
(B) Any expenses that are definitely related to less than all of gross income as a class, including unrelated person interest that is directly allocated to income from a specific property, shall be allocated and apportioned under the principles of §§ 1.861-8 or 1.861-10T, as applicable, to income in each separate category;
(C) Related person interest shall be allocated to and shall reduce (but not below zero) the amount of passive foreign personal holding company income as determined after the application of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section;
(D) To the extent that related person interest exceeds passive foreign personal holding company income as determined after the application of paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) (B) and (C) of this section, the related person interest shall be apportioned under the rules of this paragraph to separate categories other than passive income.
(
1
) If under § 1.861-9T, the modified gross income method of apportioning interest expense is elected, related person interest shall be apportioned as follows:
EC07OC91.034
(
2
) If under § 1.861-9T, the asset method of apportioning interest expense is elected, related person interest shall be apportioned according to the following formula:
EC07OC91.035
(E) Any other expenses (including unrelated person interest that is not directly allocated to income from a specific property) that are not definitely related expenses or that are definitely related to all of gross income as a class shall be apportioned under the rules of this paragraph to reduce income in each separate category.
(
1
) If under § 1.861-9T, the modified gross income method of apportioning interest expense is elected, the interest expense shall be apportioned as follows:
EC07OC91.036
(
2
) If under § 1.861-9T, the asset method of apportioning interest expense is elected, then the expense shall be apportioned as follows:
EC07OC91.037
(
3
) Expenses other than interest shall be apportioned in a similar manner depending on the apportionment method used.
See
§ 1.861-8T(c)(1) (i)-(vi).
(iii)
Allocating and apportioning expenses of a noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation.
Expenses of a noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation shall be allocated and apportioned in the same manner as expenses of a controlled foreign corporation under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, except that the related person interest rule of paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(C) and (D) of this section shall not apply.
(iv)
Definitions
—(A)
Value of assets and reduction in value of assets and gross income.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) (D) and (E) of this section, the value of total assets is the value of assets in all categories (determined under the principles of § 1.861-9T(g)). See § 1.861-10T(d)(2) to determine the reduction in value of assets and gross income for purposes of apportioning additional third person interest expense that is not directly allocated when some interest expense has been directly allocated. For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, any reduction in the value of assets for indebtedness that relates to interest allocated under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section is made before determining the average of asset values. For rules relating to the averaging of reduced asset values see § 1.861-9T(g)(2).
(B)
Related person debt allocated to passive assets.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, related person debt allocated to passive assets is determined as follows:
EC07OC91.038
For this purpose, the term
total related person debt
means the sum of the principal amounts of obligations of a controlled foreign corporation owed to any United States shareholder of such corporation or to any related entity (within the meaning of paragraph (g) of this section) determined at the end of the taxable year.
(v)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(2).
(A)
Example 1.
(
1
) CFC, a controlled foreign corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USP, a domestic corporation. In Year 1, CFC earns $200x of foreign personal holding company income that is passive category income. CFC also earns $100x of foreign base company sales income that is general category income. CFC has $2,000x of passive category assets and $2,000x of general category assets. In Year 1, CFC makes a $150x interest payment to USP with respect to a $1,500x loan from USP. CFC also pays $100x of interest to an unrelated person on a $1,000x loan from that person. CFC has no other expenses. CFC uses the asset method to apportion interest expense.
(
2
) Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the $150x related person interest payment is allocable to CFC's passive category foreign personal holding company income. Therefore, the $150x interest payment is passive category income to USP. Because the entire related person interest payment is allocated to passive category income under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, none of the related person interest payment is apportioned to general category income under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(D) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, the entire amount of the related person debt is allocable to passive category assets ($1,500x = $1,500x × $150x/$150x). Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, $20x of the interest expense paid to an unrelated person is apportioned to passive category income ($20x = $100x × ($2,000x − $1,500x)/($4,000x − $1,500x)), and $80x of the interest expense paid to an unrelated person is apportioned to general category income ($80x = $100x × $2,000x/($4,000x − $1,500x)).
(B)
Example 2.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that CFC uses the modified gross income method to apportion interest expense. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, the unrelated person interest expense is apportioned based on gross income. Therefore, $33x of interest expense paid to an unrelated person is apportioned to CFC's passive category income ($33x = $100x × ($200x − $150x)/($300x − $150x)) and $67x of interest expense paid to an unrelated person is apportioned to CFC's general category income ($67x = $100x × $100x/($300x − $150x)).
(C)
Example 3.
(
1
) The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that CFC has an additional $50x of third person interest expense that is directly allocated to income from a specific property that produces only passive category income. The principal amount of indebtedness to which the interest relates is $500x. CFC also has $50x of additional non-interest expenses that are not definitely related expenses and that are apportioned on an asset basis.
(
2
) Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the $50x of directly allocated third person interest is first allocated to reduce the passive category income of CFC. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the $150x of related person interest is allocated to the remaining $150x of passive category income. Under paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, all of the related person debt is allocated to passive category assets ($1,500x = $1,500x × $150x/$150x).
(
3
) Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, the non-interest expenses that are not definitely related are apportioned on the basis of the asset values reduced by the allocated related person debt. Therefore, $10x of these expenses are apportioned to the passive category ($50x × ($2,000x − $1,500x)/($4,000x − $1,500x)) and $40x are apportioned to the general category ($50x × $2,000x/($4,000x − $1,500x)).
(
4
) In order to apportion third person interest (that was not directly allocated third person interest) between the categories of assets, the value of assets in a separate category must also
be reduced under the principles of § 1.861-8 by the indebtedness relating to the specifically allocated interest. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, the value of assets in the passive category for purposes of apportioning the additional third person interest = 0 ($2,000x minus $500x (the principal amount of the debt, the interest payment on which is directly allocated to specific interest-producing properties) minus $1,500x (the related person debt allocated to passive category assets)). Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, all $100x of the non-definitely related third person interest expense is apportioned to the general category ($100x = $100x × $2,000x/($4,000x − $500x − $1,500x)).
(D)
Example 4.
(
1
) CFC, a controlled foreign corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USP, a domestic corporation. In Year 1, CFC earns $100x of foreign personal holding company income that is passive category income. CFC also earns $100x of foreign base company sales income that is general category income. CFC has $1,000x of general category assets and $1,000x of passive category assets. In Year 1, CFC makes a $150x interest payment to USP on a $1,500x loan from USP and has $20x of general and administrative expenses (G
A) that under the principles of §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T is treated as directly allocable to all of CFC's gross income. CFC also makes a $25x interest payment to an unrelated person on a $250x loan from the unrelated person. CFC has no other expenses. CFC uses the asset method to apportion interest expense. CFC uses the modified gross income method to apportion G
A.
(
2
) Under paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, related person debt allocated to passive category assets equals $1,000x ($1,000x = $1,500x × $100x/$150x).Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, $100x of the interest payment to USP is allocable to CFC's passive category foreign personal holding company income. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(D) of this section, the additional $50x of related person interest expense is apportioned to CFC's general category income ($50x = $50x × $1,000x/$1,000x).
(
3
) Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, none of the $25x of interest expense paid to an unrelated person is apportioned to passive category income ($0 = $25x × ($1,000x − $1,000x)/($2,000x − $1,000x)). All $25x of the interest expense paid to an unrelated person is apportioned to general category income ($25x = $25x × $1,000x/($2,000x − $1,000x)). Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, none of the G
A is allocable to CFC's passive category foreign personal holding company income ($0 = $20x × ($100x − $100x)/($200x − $100x)). All $20x of the G
A is apportioned to CFC's general category income ($20x = $20x × $100x/($200x − $100x)).
(E)
Example 5.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(D) of this section (the facts in
Example 4
), except that CFC uses the modified gross income method to apportion interest expense. As in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(D) of this section (
Example 4
), $100x of the interest payment to USP is allocated to passive category income under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(D) of this section, the additional $50x of related person interest expense is apportioned to general category income ($150x—100x × $100x/$100x). Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, none of the unrelated person interest expense and none of the G
A is apportioned to passive category income, because after the application of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, no income remains in the passive category.
(F)
Example 6.
CFC2, a controlled foreign corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CFC1, a controlled foreign corporation. CFC1 is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USP, a domestic corporation. CFC1 and CFC2 are incorporated in the same country. In Year 1, USP sells tractors to CFC2, which CFC2 sells to X, a foreign corporation that is related to both CFC1 and CFC2 and is organized in the same country as CFC1 and CFC2. CFC1 makes a loan to × to finance the tractor sales. Assume that the interest earned by CFC1 from financing the sales is export financing interest that is neither related person factoring income nor foreign personal holding company income. Under § 1.904-4(h), the export financing interest earned by CFC1 is, therefore, general category income. CFC1 earns no other
income. CFC1 makes a $100x interest payment to USP. The $100x of interest paid is not allocable under the look-through rules and paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section to passive category income of CFC1. The income is general category income to USP.
(3)
Rents and royalties.
Any rents or royalties received or accrued from a controlled foreign corporation in which the taxpayer is a United States shareholder are treated as passive category income to the extent they are allocable to passive category income of the controlled foreign corporation under the principles of §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T.
(4)
Dividends
—(i)
Look-through rule for controlled foreign corporations.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, any dividend paid or accrued out of the earnings and profits of any controlled foreign corporation is treated as passive category income in proportion to the ratio of the portion of earnings and profits attributable to passive category income to the total amount of earnings and profits of the controlled foreign corporation. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(4), the term “dividend” includes any amount included in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(B) as a pro rata share of a controlled foreign corporation's increase in earnings invested in United States property.
(ii)
Special rule for dividends attributable to certain loans.
If a dividend is distributed to a taxpayer by a controlled foreign corporation, that controlled foreign corporation is the recipient of loan proceeds from a related look-through entity (within the meaning of § 1.904-5(i)), and the purpose of such loan is to alter the characterization of the dividend for purposes of this section, then, to the extent of the principal amount of the loan, the dividend shall be characterized with respect to the earnings and profits of the related person lender rather than with respect to the earnings and profits of the dividend payor. A loan will not be considered made for the purpose of altering the characterization of a dividend if the loan would have been made or maintained on substantially the same terms irrespective of the dividend. The determination of whether a loan would have been made or maintained on substantially the same terms irrespective of the dividend will be made taking into account all the facts and circumstances of the relationship between the lender and the borrower. Thus, for example, a loan by a related party lender to a controlled foreign corporation that arises from the sale of inventory in the ordinary course of business will not be considered a loan made for the purpose of altering the character of any dividend paid by the borrower.
(iii)
Look-through rule for dividends from noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporations
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(B) of this section, any dividend that is distributed by a noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation and received or accrued by a domestic corporation that is a United States shareholder of such foreign corporation is treated as income in a separate category in proportion to the ratio of the portion of earnings and profits attributable to income in such category to the total amount of earnings and profits of the noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation.
(B)
Inadequate substantiation.
A dividend distributed by a noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation is treated as income in the separate category described in section 904(d)(4)(C)(ii) if the Commissioner determines that the look-through characterization of the dividend cannot reasonably be determined based on the available information.
(5)
Inclusions under section 951(a)(1)(A).
Any amount included in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A) is treated as passive category income to the extent the amount included is attributable to income received or accrued by the controlled foreign corporation that is passive category income. All other amounts included in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A) are treated as general category income or income in a specified separate category under the rules in § 1.904-4. For rules concerning a distributive share of partnership income, see § 1.904-4(n). For rules concerning the gross up under section 78, see § 1.904-4(o). For rules concerning inclusions under section 951(a)(1)(B), see paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.
(6)
Inclusions under section 951A(a).
Any amount included in gross income under section 951A(a) is treated as passive category income to the extent the amount included is attributable to income received or accrued by the controlled foreign corporation that is passive category income. All other amounts included in gross income under section 951A(a) are treated as section 951A category income or income in a specified separate category under the rules in § 1.904-4. For rules concerning a distributive share of partnership income, see § 1.904-4(n). For rules concerning the gross up under section 78, see § 1.904-4(o).
(7)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (c) of this section.
(i)
Example 1
—(A)
Facts.
CFC, a controlled foreign corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USP, a domestic corporation. In Year 1, CFC earns $100x of net income, $85x of which is general category foreign base company sales income and $15x of which is passive category foreign personal holding company income. No foreign tax is imposed on the income. CFC's income of $100x is subpart F income taxed currently to USP under section 951(a)(1)(A).
(B)
Analysis.
Because $15x of the subpart F inclusion is attributable to passive category income of CFC, under section 904(d)(3)(B) and paragraph (c)(5) of this section $15x of the subpart F inclusion is passive category income to USP. The remaining $85x subpart F inclusion is general category income to USP.
(ii)
Example 2
—(A)
Facts.
CFC1, a controlled foreign corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USP, a domestic corporation. CFC2 is a controlled foreign corporation wholly owned by CFC1 and is incorporated and operates all of its business in the same country as CFC1. All of CFC2's earnings and profits are attributable to passive category foreign personal holding company income. USP elects to exclude CFC2's income from subpart F income under section 954(b)(4). In Year 1, CFC2 makes a distribution to CFC1 and CFC1 makes a distribution to USP, all of which is attributable to Year 1 earnings and profits. CFC1 has no earnings and profits in Year 1 other than those received from CFC2.
(B)
Analysis.
(
1
) With respect to the dividend from CFC2 to CFC1, such amount is not subpart F income.
See
section 954(c)(3). Under section 904(d)(3)(D) and (E) and paragraphs (c)(4) and (d)(2) of this section the dividend income is not passive category income and therefore under § 1.904-4 it is general category income to CFC1. Under section 951A(c)(2)(A)(i)(IV), such dividend income is not tested income.
(
2
) With respect to the dividend from CFC1 to USP, under section 904(d)(3)(D) and (E) and paragraphs (c)(4) and (d)(2) of this section, such dividend income is not passive category income and therefore under § 1.904-4 is general category income to USP.
(iii)
Example 3
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 2
), except that CFC1 receives interest income from CFC2 instead of dividend income.
(B)
Analysis.
Under section 904(d)(3)(C) and paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the interest income is passive category income to CFC1 because such interest is properly allocable to the passive category income of CFC2. The interest income from CFC2 is subpart F income of CFC1 taxable to USP because such income reduces the subpart F income of CFC2 or such interest is properly allocable to the subpart F income of CFC2.
See
section 954(c)(3) and (6). Under section 904(d)(3)(B) and paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the subpart F inclusion is passive category income to USP. Under section 959(a), the distribution from CFC1 to USP is excluded from USP's gross income.
(iv)
Example 4
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(7)(iii)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 3
), except that USP elects to exclude CFC1's interest income from subpart F income under section 954(b)(4).
(B)
Analysis.
Under section 904(d)(3)(D) and (E) and paragraphs (c)(4) and (d)(2) of this section, the distribution from CFC1 to USP is not a passive category dividend and therefore under § 1.904-4 is general category income to USP.
(v)
Example 5
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(7)(iv)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 4
), except that USP receives interest income from CFC1 instead of dividend income.
(B)
Analysis.
Under section 904(d)(3)(C) and paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the interest income is passive category income to USP because such interest is properly allocable to passive category income of CFC1.
(d)
Effect of exclusions from subpart F income

De minimis amount of subpart F income.
If the sum of a controlled foreign corporation's gross foreign base company income (determined under section 954(a) without regard to section 954(b)(5)) and gross insurance income (determined under section 953(a)) for the taxable year is less than the lesser of 5 percent of gross income or $1,000,000, then none of that income is treated as passive category income. In addition, if the test in the first sentence of this paragraph (d)(1) is satisfied, for purposes of paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(D) and (E) of this section (apportionment of interest expense to passive income using the asset method), any passive assets are not treated as passive category assets but are treated as assets in the general category or a specified separate category. The determination in the first sentence of this paragraph (d)(1) is made before the application of the exception for certain income subject to a high rate of foreign tax described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(2)
Exception for certain income subject to high foreign tax.
Except as provided in § 1.904-4(c)(7)(iii) (relating to reductions in tax upon distribution), for purposes of the dividend look-through rule of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, an item of net income that would otherwise be passive category income (after application of the priority rules of § 1.904-4(l)) and that is received or accrued by a controlled foreign corporation is not treated as passive category income, and the earnings and profits attributable to such income is not treated as passive category earnings and profits, if the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary under section 954(b)(4) that the income was subject to an effective rate of income tax imposed by a foreign country greater than 90 percent of the maximum rate of tax specified in section 11 (with reference to section 15, if applicable). Such income is treated as general category income or income in a specified separate category under the rules in § 1.904-4. The first sentence of this paragraph (d)(2) has no effect on amounts (other than dividends) paid or accrued by a controlled foreign corporation to a United States shareholder of such controlled foreign corporation to the extent those amounts are allocable to passive category income of the controlled foreign corporation.
(3)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (d).
(i)
Facts.
CFC, a controlled foreign corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USP, a domestic corporation. In Year 1, CFC earns $100x of gross income, $4x of which is interest that is foreign personal holding company income and $96x of which is gross manufacturing income that is not subpart F income. CFC has no other earnings for Year 1. CFC has no expenses and pays no foreign taxes.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under the de minimis rule of section 954(b)(3)(A) and § 1.954-1(b)(1)(i), none of CFC's income is treated as foreign base company income. All of CFC's income, therefore, is treated as general category income and tested income. In Year 1, USP has a GILTI inclusion amount with respect to CFC. Such amount is section 951A category income to USP.
(e)
Treatment of subpart F income in excess of 70 percent of gross income
—(1)
Rule.
If the sum of a controlled foreign corporation's gross foreign base company income (determined without regard to section 954(b)(5)) and gross insurance income for the taxable year exceeds 70 percent of the gross income, then all of the controlled foreign corporation's gross income shall be treated as foreign base company income (whichever is appropriate) and, thus, included in a United States shareholder's gross income. However, the inclusion in gross income of an amount that would not otherwise be subpart F income does not affect its character for purposes of determining whether the
income is within a separate category. The determination of whether the controlled foreign corporation's gross foreign base company income and gross insurance income exceeds 70 percent of gross income is made before the exception for certain income subject to a high rate of foreign tax.
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (e).
(i)
Facts.
Controlled foreign corporation CFC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USP, a domestic corporation. CFC earns $100x, $75x of which is foreign personal holding company income and $25x of which is non-subpart F services income. CFC's gross and net income are equal.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under the 70 percent full inclusion rule of section 954(b)(3)(B), the entire $100x is foreign base company income currently taxable to USP under section 951. Because $75x of the $100x section 951 inclusion is attributable to CFC's passive category income, $75x of the inclusion is passive category income to USP. The remaining $25x of the inclusion is treated as general category income to USP.
(f)
Modification of look-through rules for certain income.
(1) [Reserved]
(2)
Distributions from a FSC.
Income received or accrued by a taxpayer that, under the rules of paragraph (c)(4) of this section (look-through rules for dividends), would be treated as foreign trade income or as passive income that is interest and carrying charges (as defined in section 927(d)(1)), and that is also a distribution from a FSC (or a former FSC), shall be treated as a distribution from a FSC (or a former FSC).
(g)
Application of look-through rules to certain domestic corporations.
The principles of paragraph (c) of this section shall apply to any foreign source interest, rents and royalties paid by a domestic corporation to a related corporation. For this purpose, a domestic corporation and another corporation are considered to be related if one owns, directly or indirectly, stock possessing more than 50 percent of the total voting power of all classes of stock of the other corporation or more than 50 percent of the total value of the other corporation. In addition, a domestic corporation and another corporation shall be considered to be related if the same United States shareholders own, directly or indirectly, stock possessing more than 50 percent of the total voting power of all classes of stock or more than 50 percent of the total value of each corporation. For purposes of this paragraph, the constructive stock ownership rules of section 318 and the regulations under that section apply.
(h)
Application of look-through rules to payments from a partnership or other pass-through entity.
Payments to a partner described in section 707 (
e.g.,
payments to a partner not acting in capacity as a partner) are characterized as passive category income to the extent that the payment is attributable under the principles of § 1.861-8 and this section to passive category income of the partnership, if the payments are interest, rents, or royalties that would be characterized under the controlled foreign corporation look-through rules of paragraph (c) of this section if the partnership were a foreign corporation, and the partner who receives the payment owns 10 percent or more of the value of the partnership (as determined under § 1.904-4(n)(3)). A payment by a partnership to a member of the controlled group (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(vi) of this section) of the partner is characterized under the look-through rules of this paragraph (h) if the payment would be a section 707 payment entitled to look-through treatment if it were made to the partner. The rules in this paragraph (h) do not apply with respect to interest to the extent the interest income is assigned to a separate category under the downstream partnership loan rules described in § 1.861-9(e)(8). The principles of the rules in this paragraph (h) apply to characterize a payment from any other pass-through entity.
(i)
Application of look-through rules to related entities
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (i)(2) and (3) of this section, the principles of this section shall apply to distributions and payments that are subject to the look-through rules of section 904(d)(3) and this section from a controlled foreign corporation or other entity otherwise
entitled to look-through treatment (a “look-through entity”) under this section to a related look-through entity. A noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation shall be considered a look-through entity only to the extent provided in paragraph (i)(3) of this section. Two look-through entities shall be considered to be related to each other if one owns, directly or indirectly, stock possessing more than 50 percent of the total voting power of all classes of voting stock of the other entity or more than 50 percent of the total value of such entity. In addition, two look-through entities are related if the same United States shareholders own, directly or indirectly, stock possessing more than 50 percent of the total voting power of all voting classes of stock (in the case of a corporation) or more than 50 percent of the total value of each look-through entity. In the case of a corporation, value shall be determined by taking into account all classes of stock. For purposes of this paragraph (i)(1), indirect ownership of stock is determined under section 318. In the case of a partnership or other pass-through entity, indirect ownership and value is determined under the rules in paragraph (i)(2) of this section.
(2)
Indirect ownership and value of a partnership interest.
A person is considered as owning, directly or indirectly, more than 50 percent of the value of a partnership if the person, together with any other person that bears a relationship to the first person that is described in section 267(b) or 707, owns more than 50 percent of the capital and profits interests of the partnership. For purposes of this paragraph (i)(2), value will be determined at the end of the partnership's taxable year. The principles of this paragraph (i)(2) apply with respect to a person that owns a pass-through entity other than a partnership.
(3)
Special rule for dividends between certain foreign corporations.
Solely for purposes of dividend payments between controlled foreign corporations, noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporations, or a controlled foreign corporation and a noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation, the two foreign corporations are considered related look-through entities if the same person is a United States shareholder of both foreign corporations.
(4) [Reserved]
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (i):
(i)
Example 1.
USP, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of CFC1, a controlled foreign corporation. CFC1 owns 40% of the stock of CFC2, a Country X corporation that is a controlled foreign corporation. The remaining 60% of the stock of CFC2 is owned by V, a domestic corporation, unrelated to USP. The percentages of value and voting power of CFC2 owned by CFC1 and V correspond to their percentages of stock ownership. CFC2 owns 40% (by vote and value) of the stock of CFC3, a Country Z corporation that is a controlled foreign corporation. The remaining 60% of CFC3 is owned by unrelated United States persons. CFC3 earns exclusively general category income that is neither subpart F income nor tested income. In Year 1, CFC3 makes an interest payment of $100x to CFC2. Look-through principles do not apply because CFC2 and CFC3 are not related look-through entities under paragraph (i)(1) of this section (because CFC2 does not own more than 50% of the voting power or value of CFC3). The interest is passive category income to CFC2 and is subpart F income of CFC2 that is taxable to USP and V. Under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, USP and V's subpart F inclusion with respect to CFC2 is passive category income.
(ii)
Example 2.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(5)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that instead of a $100x interest payment, CFC3 pays a $50x dividend to CFC2 in Year 1. USP and V each own, directly or indirectly, more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of both CFC2 and CFC3, and, therefore, CFC2 and CFC3 have the same United States shareholders. Pursuant to paragraph (i)(3) of this section, because CFC2 and CFC3 have a common United States shareholder, for purposes of applying this section to the dividend from CFC2 to CFC3, CFC2 and CFC3 are treated as
related look-through entities. Therefore, look-through principles apply. Because CFC3 has no passive category income or earnings and profits, the dividend income is characterized as general category income to CFC2. The dividend is subpart F income of CFC2 that is taxable to USP and V. Under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the subpart F inclusions of USP and V are not passive category income to USP and V and therefore under § 1.904-4 the subpart F inclusions are general category income to USP and V.
(iii)
Example 3.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(5)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that CFC3 pays both a $100x interest payment and a $50x dividend to CFC2, and CFC2 owns 80% (by vote and value) of CFC3. Under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, CFC2 and CFC3 are related look-through entities, because CFC2 owns more than 50% (by vote and value) of CFC3. Therefore, look-through principles apply to both the interest and dividend income paid or accrued by CFC3 to CFC2, and CFC2 treats both types of income as general category income because CFC3 does not have any passive category earnings. Under paragraph (c)(5) of this section and § 1.904-4, the resulting subpart F inclusions are general category income to USP and V.
(iv)
Example 4.
USP, a domestic corporation, owns 50% of the voting stock of CFC1, a controlled foreign corporation. CFC1 owns 10% of the voting stock of CFC2, a controlled foreign corporation. The remaining 50% of the stock of CFC1 is owned by X. The remaining 90% of the stock of CFC2 is owned by Y. X and Y are each United States shareholders of CFC2 but are not related to USP, CFC1, or each other. In Year 1, CFC2 pays a $100x dividend to CFC1. Under paragraph (i)(3) of this section because no person is a United States shareholder of both CFC1 and CFC2 (USP and X each own only 5% of CFC2), CFC1 and CFC2 are not related look-through entities. Because CFC2 is not a related person to CFC1 within the meaning of section 954(d)(3), section 954(c)(3) and (c)(6) are inapplicable, and the dividend is subpart F income of CFC1 that is taxable to USP and X. Therefore, under section 904(d)(2)(B)(i) and § 1.904-4(b)(2)(i)(A), because the dividend income is foreign personal holding company income, it is passive category income to CFC1.
(v)
Example 5.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(5)(iv) of this section (the facts in
Example 4
), except that X owns 10% of the voting stock of CFC2 and Y owns only 80% of the voting stock of CFC2. Because CFC2 is not a related person to CFC1 within the meaning of section 954(d)(3), the dividend is subpart F income of CFC1 that is taxable to USP and X. In addition, because X is a United States shareholder of both CFC1 and CFC2, CFC2 and CFC1 are related look-through entities under paragraph (i)(3) of this section, the dividend income is general category income to CFC1 and the subpart F inclusion is general category income to USP and X.
(j)
Look-through rules applied to passive foreign investment company inclusions.
If a passive foreign investment company is a controlled foreign corporation and the taxpayer is a United States shareholder in that passive foreign investment company, any amount included in gross income under section 1293 shall be treated as income in a separate category to the extent the amount so included is attributable to income received or accrued by that controlled foreign corporation that is described as income in the separate category.
(k)
Ordering rules
—(1)
In general.
Income received or accrued by a related person to which the look-through rules apply is characterized under § 1.904-4 before amounts included from, or paid or distributed by that person and received or accrued by a related person. For purposes of determining the character of income received or accrued by a person from a related person if the payor or another related person also receives or accrues income from the recipient and the look-through rules apply to the income in all cases, the rules of paragraph (k)(2) of this section apply.
(2)
Specific rules.
For purposes of characterizing income under this paragraph, the following types of income are characterized in the order stated:
(i) Rents and royalties;
(ii) Interest;
(iii) Inclusions under sections 951(a)(1)(A) and 951A(a) and distributive shares of partnership income;
(iv) Dividend distributions.
If an entity is both a recipient and a payor of income described in any one of the categories described in (k)(2) (i) through (iv) of this section, the income received will be characterized before the income that is paid. In addition, the amount of interest paid or accrued, directly or indirectly, by a person to a related person shall be offset against and eliminate any interest received or accrued, directly or indirectly, by a person from that related person before application of the ordering rules of this paragraph. In a case in which a person pays or accrues interest to a related person, and also receives or accrues interest indirectly from the related person, the smallest interest payment is eliminated and the amount of all other interest payments are reduced by the amount of the smallest interest payment.
(l)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section.
(1)
Example 1
—(i)
Facts.
CFC1 and CFC2, controlled foreign corporations, are wholly-owned subsidiaries of USP, a domestic corporation. CFC1 and CFC2 are incorporated in two different foreign countries and CFC2 is a financial services entity. In Year 1, CFC1 earns $100x of gross income that is passive category foreign personal holding company income. CFC1's only expense is a $50x interest payment to CFC2. CFC1's $50x of pre-tax income is subject to $20x of foreign income tax, and USP elects to exclude CFC1's $30x of net income from subpart F income under section 954(b)(4).
(ii)
Analysis.
The $50x of interest is foreign personal holding company income in CFC2's hands because section 954(c)(3)(A)(i) (same country exception for interest payments) and section 954(c)(6) do not apply, because the interest payment is allocable to and reduces CFC1's subpart F income. The $50x of interest income is also passive category income to CFC2 because CFC1 and CFC2 are related look-through entities within the meaning of paragraph (i)(1) of this section and, therefore the look-through rules of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section apply to characterize the interest payment. However, because CFC2 is a financial services entity, under § 1.904-4(e)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the income is treated as financial services income and therefore as general category income in CFC2's hands. Thus, with respect to CFC2, under § 1.904-4(d) and paragraph (c)(5) of this section, USP includes in its gross income a $50x general category inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A) attributable to the general category foreign personal holding company income.
(2)
Example 2
—(i)
Facts.
USP, a domestic corporation, owns 75% of USS, a domestic corporation. USP and USS are not financial services entities. In Year 1, USS's earnings consist of $100x of foreign source passive income. USS makes a $100x foreign source royalty payment to USP.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (g) of this section, the royalty payment to USP is subject to the look-through rules of paragraph (c)(3) of this section and is characterized as passive category income the extent that it is allocable to such income in USS's hands.
(3)
Example 3
—(i)
Facts.
USP, a domestic corporation, owns 100% of the stock of CFC1, a controlled foreign corporation, and CFC1 owns 100% of the stock of CFC2, a controlled foreign corporation. CFC1 has $100x of passive foreign personal holding company income from unrelated persons and $100x of general category income. CFC1 also has $50x of interest income from CFC2. CFC1 pays CFC2 $100x of interest.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (k)(2) of this section, the $100x interest payment from CFC1 to CFC2 is reduced for limitation purposes to the extent of the $50x interest payment from CFC2 to CFC1 before application of the rules in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Therefore, the interest payment from CFC2 to CFC1 is disregarded. CFC1 is treated as if it paid $50x of interest to CFC2, all of which is allocable to CFC1's passive category foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the $50x interest payment from CFC1 to CFC2 is passive category income.
(4)
Example 4
—(i)
Facts.
USP, a domestic corporation, owns 100% of the stock of CFC1, a controlled foreign corporation. CFC1 owns 100% of the stock of CFC2, a controlled foreign corporation, and 100% of the stock of CFC3, a controlled foreign corporation. In Year 1, CFC2 pays CFC1 $5x of interest, CFC1 pays CFC3 $10x of interest, and CFC3 pays CFC2 $20x of interest.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (k)(2) of this section, the interest payments from CFC1 to CFC3 must be offset by the amount of interest that CFC1 is considered as receiving indirectly from CFC3 and the interest payment from CFC3 to CFC2 is offset by the amount of the interest payment that CFC3 is considered as receiving indirectly from CFC2. The $10x payment by CFC1 to CFC3 is reduced by $5x, the amount of the interest payment from CFC2 to CFC1 that is treated as being paid indirectly by CFC3 to CFC1. Similarly, the $20x interest payment from CFC3 to CFC2 is reduced by $5x, the amount of the interest payment from CFC1 to CFC3 that is treated as being paid indirectly by CFC2 to CFC3. Therefore, under paragraph (k)(2) of this section, CFC2 is treated as having made no interest payment to CFC1, CFC1 is treated as having paid $5x of interest to CFC3, and CFC3 is treated as having paid $15x to CFC2.
(5)
Example 5
—(i)
Facts.
USP, a domestic corporation, owns 100% of the stock of CFC1, a controlled foreign corporation, and CFC1 owns 100% of the stock of CFC2, a controlled foreign corporation. In Year 1, CFC1 earns $100x of passive category foreign personal holding company income and $100x of general category non-subpart F sales income from unrelated persons and $100x of general category non-subpart F interest income from a related person. CFC1 pays $150x of interest to CFC2. CFC2 earns $200x of general category sales income from unrelated persons and the $150x interest payment from CFC1. CFC2 pays CFC1 $100x of interest. USP does not have an inclusion under section 951A.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A) Under paragraph (k)(2) of this section, the $100x interest payment from CFC2 to CFC1 reduces the $150x interest payment from CFC1 to CFC2. CFC1 is treated as though it paid $50x of interest to CFC2. CFC2 is treated as though it made no interest payment to CFC1.
(B) Under paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section, the remaining $50x interest payment from CFC1 to CFC2 is then characterized. The interest payment is first allocable under the rules of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section to CFC1's passive category income. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the $50x interest payment to CFC2 is passive category income. The interest income is foreign personal holding company income in CFC2's hands. CFC2, therefore, has $50x of passive category subpart F income and $200x of general category non-subpart F income.
(C) Under paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section, inclusions under section 951(a)(1)(A) are characterized next. USP has an inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A) with respect to CFC1 of $50x that is attributable to passive category income of CFC1 and is treated as passive category income to USP. USP has an inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A) with respect to CFC2 of $50x that is attributable to passive category income of CFC2 and is treated as passive category income to USP.

Example 6
—(i)
Facts.
USP, a domestic corporation, owns 100% of the stock of CFC1, a controlled foreign corporation, and CFC1 owns 100% of the stock of CFC2, a controlled foreign corporation. USP also owns 100% of the stock of CFC3, a controlled foreign corporation. CFC1, CFC2, and CFC3 are all incorporated in different foreign countries. In Year 1, CFC1 earns $100x of passive category foreign personal holding company income and $200x of general category non-subpart F income from unrelated persons. CFC1 also receives a $150x distribution from CFC2. CFC1 pays $100x of interest to CFC2 and $100x of interest to CFC3. CFC3 earns $300x of general category non-subpart F income and the $100x of interest received from CFC1. CFC3 pays a $100x royalty to CFC2. The royalty is directly allocable to CFC3's general category income and the royalty is not subpart F income to CFC2. CFC2 earns the $100x interest payment received
from CFC1 and the $100x royalty received from CFC3. USP does not have an inclusion under section 951A.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A) Under paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section, the royalty paid by CFC3 to CFC2 is characterized first. With respect to CFC2, the royalty is general category non-subpart F income.
(B) Under paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section, the interest payments from CFC1 to CFC2 and CFC3 are characterized next. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the interest payments are first allocable to CFC1's passive category income. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, $50x of the interest payment to CFC2 is passive category income and $50x of the interest payment to CFC3 is passive category income. The remaining $50x paid to CFC2 is general category income and the remaining $50x paid to CFC3 is general category income. Because $100x of the interest income received or accrued from CFC1 is properly allocable to income of CFC1 which is not subpart F income, under section 954(c)(6) the general category interest income is not treated as foreign personal holding company income to CFC2 and CFC3. The remaining $100x of interest income received or accrued from CFC1 is passive category subpart F foreign personal holding company income to both recipients. Therefore, CFC3 and CFC2 each have $50x of passive category subpart F foreign personal holding company income related to the interest received from CFC1.
(C) Under paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section, USP's $50x inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A) with respect to CFC2 is characterized next. Under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, USP's inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A) is attributable to the passive category portion of the interest income received by CFC2 from CFC1 and is passive category income to USP. Under paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section, USP's $50x inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A) with respect to CFC3 is also characterized next. Under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, USP's inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A) is attributable to the passive category portion of the interest income received by CFC3 from CFC2 and is passive category income to USP.
(D) Under paragraph (k)(2)(iv) of this section, the $150x distribution from CFC2 to CFC1 is characterized next. The first $50x of the distribution is out of passive category earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2). The remaining $100x of the distribution is a dividend that is not attributable to CFC2's passive category income, so under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section it is general category income to CFC1 in its entirety. Because $100x of the dividend received or accrued from CFC2 is attributable to income of CFC2 which is not subpart F income, under section 954(c)(6) such dividend income is not treated as foreign personal holding company income of CFC1.
(7)
Example 7
—(i)
Facts.
USP, a domestic corporation, owns 100% of the stock of CFC1, a controlled foreign corporation, and CFC1 owns 100% of the stock of CFC2, a controlled foreign corporation. USP also owns 100% of the stock of CFC3, a controlled foreign corporation. CFC1, CFC2, and CFC3 are all incorporated in different foreign countries. In Year 1, CFC2 earns $100x of general category income that is not subpart F income and distributes the entire amount to CFC1 as a dividend. CFC1 earns $100x of passive category foreign personal holding company income and the $100x dividend from CFC2. CFC1 pays $100x of interest to CFC3. CFC3 earns $200x of general category income that is foreign base company income and the $100x of interest income from CFC1. USP does not have an inclusion under section 951A.
(ii)
Analysis.
This transaction does not involve circular payments and, therefore, the ordering rules of paragraph (k)(2) of this section do not apply. Instead, pursuant to paragraph (k)(1) of this section, income received is characterized first. CFC2's earnings and, thus, the dividend from CFC2 to CFC1 are characterized first. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, CFC1 includes the $100x dividend from CFC2 in gross income as general category income because none of CFC2's earnings are passive category income. CFC1 thus has $100x of passive category foreign personal holding company income and $100x of general category income that is excluded from subpart F income under section 954(c)(6)(A). The interest
payment from CFC1 to CFC3 is then characterized as $100x passive category income under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section because it is allocable to passive foreign personal holding company income of CFC1. For Year 1, CFC3 thus has $200x of general category income that is subpart F income, and $100x of passive category foreign personal holding company income. For Year 1, under § 1.904-4(d) and paragraph (c)(5) of this section, USP includes in its gross income an inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A) with respect to CFC3, $200x of which is general category income and $100x of which is passive category income.
(m)
Application of section 904(h)
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (m) applies to certain amounts derived from controlled foreign corporations and noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporations that are treated as United States-owned foreign corporations as defined in section 904(h)(6). For purposes of determining the portion of an interest payment that is allocable to income earned or accrued by a controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporations from sources within the United States under section 904(h)(3), the rules in paragraph (m)(2) of this section apply. For purposes of determining the portion of a dividend (which, for purposes of this paragraph (m), includes amounts described in section 951(a)(1)(B)) paid or accrued by a controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporations that is treated as from sources within the United States under section 904(h)(4), the rules in paragraph (m)(4) of this section apply. For purposes of determining the portion of an amount included in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A), 951A(a), or 1293 that is attributable to income of the controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporations from sources within the United States under section 904(h)(2), the rules in paragraph (m)(5) of this section apply. In order to determine whether section 904(h) applies, section 904(h)(5) (exception if a United States-owned foreign corporation has a
de minimis
amount of United States source income) shall be applied to the total amount of earnings and profits of a controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporations for a taxable year without regard to the characterization of those earnings under section 904(d).

Treatment of interest payments
—(i)
Interest payments from controlled foreign corporations.
If interest is received or accrued by a United States shareholder or a person related to a United States shareholder (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) from a controlled foreign corporation, the interest shall be considered to be allocable to income of the controlled foreign corporation from sources within the United States for purposes of section 904(d) to the extent that the interest is allocable under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section to passive income that is from sources within the United States. If related person interest is less than or equal to passive income, the related person interest will be allocable to United States source passive income based on the ratio of United States source passive income to total passive income. To the extent that related person interest exceeds passive income, and, therefore, is allocated under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(D) of this section to income in a separate category other than passive, the following formulas apply in determining the portion of the interest payment that is from sources within the United States. If the taxpayer uses the gross income method to allocate interest, the portion of the interest payment from sources within the United States is determined as follows:
