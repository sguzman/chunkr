(ii) If the employer requests review under section 4219(b)(2)(A) of ERISA of the plan's withdrawal liability determination or the schedule of payments established by the plan, expiration of the period described in section 4221(a)(1) of ERISA for initiation of arbitration; or
(iii) If arbitration is timely initiated either by the plan, the employer or both, issuance of the arbitrator's decision.
(2) Any amounts due before the expiration of the period described in paragraph (c)(1) shall be paid in accordance with the schedule established by the plan sponsor. If a payment is not made when due under the schedule, the payment is overdue and interest shall accrue in accordance with the rules and at the same rate set forth in § 4219.32.
(d)
Overpayments.
If the plan sponsor or an arbitrator determines that payments made in accordance with the schedule of payments established by the plan sponsor have resulted in an overpayment of withdrawal liability, the plan sponsor shall refund the overpayment, with interest, in a lump sum. The plan sponsor shall credit interest on the overpayment from the date of the overpayment to the date on which the overpayment is refunded to the employer at the same rate as the rate for overdue withdrawal liability payments, as established under § 4219.32 or by the plan pursuant to § 4219.33.
§ 4219.32
Interest on overdue, defaulted and overpaid withdrawal liability.
(a)
Interest assessed.
The plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan—
(1) Shall assess interest on overdue withdrawal liability payments from the due date, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, until the date paid, as defined in paragraph (e); and
(2) In the event of a default, may assess interest on any accelerated portion of the outstanding withdrawal liability from the due date, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, until the date paid, as defined in paragraph (e).
(b)
Interest rate.
Except as otherwise provided in rules adopted by the plan pursuant to § 4219.33, interest under this section shall be charged or credited for each calendar quarter at an annual rate equal to the average quoted prime rate on short-term commercial loans for the fifteenth day (or next business day if the fifteenth day is not a business day) of the month preceding the beginning of each calendar quarter, as reported by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Statistical Release H.15 (“Selected Interest Rates”).
(c)
Calculation of interest.
The interest rate under paragraph (b) of this section is the nominal rate for any calendar quarter or portion thereof. The amount of interest due the plan for overdue or defaulted withdrawal liability, or due the employer for overpayment, is equal to the overdue, defaulted, or overpaid amount multiplied by:
(1) For each full calendar quarter in the period from the due date (or date of overpayment) to the date paid (or date of refund), one-fourth of the annual rate in effect for that quarter;
(2) For each full calendar month in a partial quarter in that period, one-twelfth of the annual rate in effect for that quarter; and
(3) For each day in a partial month in that period, one-three-hundred-sixtieth of the annual rate in effect for that month.
(d)
Due date.
Except as otherwise provided in rules adopted by the plan, the due date from which interest accrues shall be, for an overdue withdrawal liability payment and for an amount of withdrawal liability in default, the date of the missed payment that gave rise to the delinquency or the default.
(e)
Date paid.
Any payment of withdrawal liability shall be deemed to have been paid on the date on which it is received.
§ 4219.33
Plan rules concerning overdue and defaulted withdrawal liability.
Plans may adopt rules relating to overdue and defaulted withdrawal liability, provided that those rules are consistent with ERISA. These rules may include, but are not limited to, rules for determining the rate of interest to be charged on overdue, defaulted and overpaid withdrawal liability (provided that the rate reflects prevailing market rates for comparable obligations); rules providing reasonable grace periods during which late payments may be made without interest; additional definitions of default which indicate a substantial likelihood that an employer will be unable to pay its withdrawal liability; and rules pertaining to acceleration of the outstanding balance on default. Plan rules adopted under this section shall be reasonable. Plan rules shall operate and be applied uniformly with respect to each employer, except that the rules may take into account the creditworthiness of an employer. Rules which take into account the creditworthiness of an employer shall state with particularity the categories of creditworthiness the plan will use, the specific differences in treatment accorded employers in different categories, and the standards and procedures for assigning an employer to a category.

granting class approval.
§ 4220.2
Definitions.
The following terms are defined in § 4001.2 of this chapter: employer, ERISA, IRS, multiemployer plan, PBGC, plan, and plan sponsor.
§ 4220.3
Requests for PBGC approval.
(a)
Filing of request
—(1)
In general.
A request for approval of an amendment filed with the PBGC in accordance with this section shall constitute notice to the PBGC for purposes of the 90-day period specified in section 4220 of ERISA. A request is treated as filed on the date on which a request containing all information required by paragraph (d) of this section is received by the PBGC. Subpart C of part 4000 of this chapter provides rules for determining when the PBGC receives a submission.
(2)
Method of filing.
The PBGC applies the rules in subpart A of part 4000 of this chapter to determine permissible methods of filing with the PBGC under this part.
(b)
Who may request.
The plan sponsor, or a duly authorized representative acting on behalf of a plan sponsor, shall sign and submit the request.
(c)
Where to file.
See § 4000.4 of this chapter for information on where to file.
(d)
Information.
Each request filed shall contain the following information:
(1) The name of the plan for which the amendment is being submitted, and the name, address and the telephone number of the plan sponsor or its duly authorized representative.
(2) The nine-digit Employer Identification Number (EIN) assigned by the IRS to the plan sponsor and the three-digit Plan Identification Number (PIN) assigned by the plan sponsor to the plan, and, if different, the EIN or PIN last filed with PBGC. If no EIN or PIN has been assigned, that fact must be indicated.
(3) A copy of the amendment as adopted, including its proposed effective date.
(4) A copy of the most recent actuarial valuation of the plan.

(e)
Supplemental information.
The PBGC may require a plan sponsor to submit any other information that the PBGC determines to be necessary to review a request under this part. The PBGC may suspend the running of the 90-day period pursuant to § 4220.4(c), pending the submission of the supplemental information.
(f)
Computation of time.
The PBGC applies the rules in subpart D of part 4000 of this chapter to compute any time period under this part.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1212-0031)
[61 FR 34108, July 1, 1996, as amended at 68 FR 61356, Oct. 28, 2003]
§ 4220.4
PBGC action on requests.
(a)
General.
Upon receipt of a complete request, the PBGC shall notify the plan sponsor in writing of the date of commencement of the 90-day period specified in section 4220 of ERISA. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the PBGC shall approve or disapprove a plan amendment submitted to it under this part within 90 days after receipt of a complete request for approval. If the PBGC fails to act within the 90-day period, or within that period notifies the plan sponsor that it will not disapprove the amendment, the amendment may be made effective without the approval of the PBGC.
(b)
Decision on request.
The PBGC's decision on a request for approval shall be in writing. If the PBGC disapproves the plan amendment, the decision shall state the reasons for the disapproval. An approval by the PBGC constitutes its finding only with respect to the issue of risk as set forth in section 4220(c) of ERISA, and not with respect to whether the amendment is otherwise properly adopted in accordance with the terms of ERISA and the plan in question.
(c)
Suspension of the 90-day period.
The PBGC may suspend the running of the 90-day period referred to in paragraph (a) of this section if it determines that additional information is required under § 4220.3(e). When it does so, PBGC's request for additional information will advise the plan sponsor that the running of 90-day period has been suspended. The 90-day period will resume running on the date on which the additional information is received by the PBGC, and the PBGC will notify the plan sponsor of that date upon receipt of the information.

§ 4221.1
Purpose and scope.
(a)
Purpose.
The purpose of this part is to establish procedures for the arbitration, pursuant to section 4221 of ERISA, of withdrawal liability disputes arising under sections 4201 through 4219 and 4225 of ERISA.
(b)
Scope.
This part applies to arbitration proceedings initiated pursuant to section 4221 of ERISA and this part on or after September 26, 1985. On and after the effective date, any plan rules governing arbitration procedures (other than a plan rule adopting a PBGC-approved arbitration procedure in accordance with § 4221.14) are effective only to the extent that they are consistent with this part and adopted by the arbitrator in a particular proceeding.
§ 4221.2
Definitions.
The following terms are defined in § 4001.2 of this chapter: ERISA, IRS, multiemployer plan, PBGC, plan, and plan sponsor.
In addition, for purposes of this part:
Arbitrator
means an individual or panel of individuals selected according to this part to decide a dispute concerning withdrawal liability.
Employer
means an individual, partnership, corporation or other entity against which a plan sponsor has made
a demand for payment of withdrawal liability pursuant to section 4219(b)(1) of ERISA.
Party
or
parties
means the employer and the plan sponsor involved in a withdrawal liability dispute.
Withdrawal liability dispute
means a dispute described in § 4221.1(a) of this chapter.
§ 4221.3
Initiation of arbitration.
(a)
Time limits—in general.
Arbitration of a withdrawal liability dispute may be initiated within the time limits described in section 4221(a)(1) of ERISA.
(b)
Waiver or extension of time limits.
Arbitration shall be initiated in accordance with this section, notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of any agreement entered into by the parties before the date on which the employer received notice of the plan's assessment of withdrawal liability. The parties may, however, agree at any time to waive or extend the time limits for initiating arbitration.
(c)
Establishment of timeliness of initiation.
A party that unilaterally initiates arbitration is responsible for establishing that the notice of initiation of arbitration was timely received by the other party. If arbitration is initiated by agreement of the parties, the date on which the agreement to arbitrate was executed establishes whether the arbitration was timely initiated.
(d)
Contents of agreement or notice.
If the employer initiates arbitration, it shall include in the notice of initiation a statement that it disputes the plan sponsor's determination of its withdrawal liability and is initiating arbitration. A copy of the demand for withdrawal liability and any request for reconsideration, and the response thereto, shall be attached to the notice. If a party other than an employer initiates arbitration, it shall include in the notice a statement that it is initiating arbitration and a brief description of the questions on which arbitration is sought. If arbitration is initiated by agreement, the agreement shall include a brief description of the questions submitted to arbitration. In no case is compliance with formal rules of pleading required.
(e)
Effect of deficient agreement or notice.
If a party fails to object promptly in writing to deficiencies in an initiation agreement or a notice of initiation of arbitration, it waives its right to object.
§ 4221.4
Appointment of the arbitrator.
(a)
Appointment of and acceptance by arbitrator.
The parties shall select the arbitrator within 45 days after the arbitration is initiated, or within such other period as is mutually agreed after the initiation of arbitration, and shall mail to the designated arbitrator a notice of his or her appointment. The notice of appointment shall include a copy of the notice or agreement initiating arbitration, a statement that the arbitration is to be conducted in accordance with this part, and a request for a written acceptance by the arbitrator. The arbitrator's appointment becomes effective upon his or her written acceptance, stating his or her availability to serve and making any disclosures required by paragraph (b) of this section. If the arbitrator does not accept in writing within 15 days after the notice of appointment is mailed or delivered to him or her, he or she is deemed to have declined to act, and the parties shall select a new arbitrator in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
(b)
Disclosure by arbitrator and disqualification.
Upon accepting the appointment, the arbitrator shall disclose to the parties any circumstances likely to affect his or her impartiality, including any bias or any financial or personal interest in the result of the arbitration and any past or present relationship with the parties or their counsel. If any party determines that the arbitrator should be disqualified because of the information disclosed, that party shall notify all other parties and the arbitrator no later than 10 days after the arbitrator makes the disclosure required by this paragraph (but in no event later than the commencement of the hearing under § 4221.6). The arbitrator shall then withdraw, and the parties shall select another arbitrator in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
(c)
Challenge and withdrawal.
After the arbitrator has been selected, a party may request that he or she withdraw from the proceedings at any point
before a final award is rendered on the ground that he or she is unable to render an award impartially. The request for withdrawal shall be served on all other parties and the arbitrator by hand or by certified or registered mail (or by any other method that includes verification or acknowledgment of receipt and meets (if applicable) the requirements of § 4000.14 of this chapter) and shall include a statement of the circumstances that, in the requesting party's view, affect the arbitrator's impartiality and a statement that the requesting party has brought these circumstances to the attention of the arbitrator and the other parties at the earliest practicable point in the proceedings. If the arbitrator determines that the circumstances adduced are likely to affect his or her impartiality and have been presented in a timely fashion, he or she shall withdraw from the proceedings and notify the parties of the reasons for his or her withdrawal. The parties shall then select a new arbitrator in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
(d)
Filling vacancies.
If the designated arbitrator declines his or her appointment or, after accepting his or her appointment, is disqualified, resigns, dies, withdraws, or is unable to perform his or her duties at any time before a final award is rendered, the parties shall select another arbitrator to fill the vacancy. The selection shall be made, in accordance with the procedure used in the initial selection, within 20 days after the parties receive notice of the vacancy. The matter shall then be reheard by the newly chosen arbitrator, who may, in his or her discretion, rely on all or any portion of the record already established.
(e)
Failure to select arbitrator.
If the parties fail to select an arbitrator within the time prescribed by this section, either party or both may seek the designation and appointment of an arbitrator in a United States district court pursuant to the provisions of title 9 of the United States Code.
[61 FR 34109, July 1, 1996, as amended at 68 FR 61356, Oct. 28, 2003]
§ 4221.5
Powers and duties of the arbitrator.
(a)
Arbitration hearing.
Except as otherwise provided in this part, the arbitrator shall conduct the arbitration hearing under § 4221.6 in the same manner, and shall possess the same powers, as an arbitrator conducting a proceeding under title 9 of the United States Code.
(1)
Application of the law.
In reaching his or her decision, the arbitrator shall follow applicable law, as embodied in statutes, regulations, court decisions, interpretations of the agencies charged with the enforcement of ERISA, and other pertinent authorities.
(2)
Prehearing discovery.
The arbitrator may allow any party to conduct prehearing discovery by interrogatories, depositions, requests for the production of documents, or other means, upon a showing that the discovery sought is likely to lead to the production of relevant evidence and will not be disproportionately burdensome to the other parties. The arbitrator may impose appropriate sanctions if he or she determines that a party has failed to respond to discovery in good faith or has conducted discovery proceedings in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment. The arbitrator may, at the request of any party or on his or her own motion, require parties to give advance notice of expert or other witnesses that they intend to introduce.
(3)
Admissibility of evidence.
The arbitrator determines the relevance and materiality of the evidence offered during the course of the hearing and is the judge of the admissibility of evidence offered. Conformity to legal rules of evidence is not necessary. To the extent reasonably practicable, all evidence shall be taken in the presence of the arbitrator and the parties. The arbitrator may, however, consider affidavits, transcripts of depositions, and similar documents.
(4)
Production of documents or other evidence.
The arbitrator may subpoena witnesses or documents upon his or her own initiative or upon request by any party after determining that the evidence is likely to be relevant to the dispute.
(b)
Prehearing conference.
If it appears that a prehearing conference will expedite the proceedings, the arbitrator may, at any time before the commencement of the arbitration hearing under § 4221.6, direct the parties to appear at a conference to consider settlement of the case, clarification of issues and stipulation of facts not in dispute, admission of documents to avoid unnecessary proof, limitations on the number of expert or other witnesses, and any other matters that could expedite the disposition of the proceedings.
(c)
Proceeding without hearing.
The arbitrator may render an award without a hearing if the parties agree and file with the arbitrator such evidence as the arbitrator deems necessary to enable him or her to render an award under § 4221.8.
§ 4221.6
Hearing.
(a)
Time and place of hearing established.
Unless the parties agree to proceed without a hearing as provided in § 4221.5(c), the parties and the arbitrator shall, no later than 15 days after the written acceptance by the arbitrator is mailed to the parties, establish a date and place for the hearing. If agreement is not reached within the 15-day period, the arbitrator shall, within 10 additional days, choose a location and set a hearing date. The date set for the hearing may be no later than 50 days after the mailing date of the arbitrator's written acceptance.
(b)
Notice.
After the time and place for the hearing have been established, the arbitrator shall serve a written notice of the hearing on the parties by hand, by certified or registered mail, or by any other method that includes verification or acknowledgment of receipt and meets (if applicable) the requirements of § 4000.14 of this chapter.
(c)
Appearances.
The parties may appear in person or by counsel or other representatives. Any party that, after being duly notified and without good cause shown, fails to appear in person or by representative at a hearing or conference, or fails to file documents in a timely manner, is deemed to have waived all rights with respect thereto and is subject to whatever orders or determinations the arbitrator may make.
(d)
Record and transcript of hearing.
Upon the request of either party, the arbitrator shall arrange for a record of the arbitration hearing to be made by stenographic means or by tape recording. The cost of making the record and the costs of transcription and copying are costs of the arbitration proceedings payable as provided in § 4221.10(b) except that, if only one party requests that a transcript of the record be made, that party shall pay the cost of the transcript.
(e)
Order of hearing.
The arbitrator shall conduct the hearing in accordance with the following rules:
(1)
Opening.
The arbitrator shall open the hearing and place in the record the notice of initiation of arbitration or the initiation agreement. The arbitrator may ask for statements clarifying the issues involved.
(2)
Presentation of claim and response.
The arbitrator shall establish the procedure for presentation of claim and response in such a manner as to afford full and equal opportunity to all parties for the presentation of their cases.
(3)
Witnesses.
All witnesses shall testify under oath or affirmation and are subject to cross-examination by opposing parties. If testimony of an expert witness is offered by a party without prior notice to the other party, the arbitrator shall grant the other party a reasonable time to prepare for cross-examination and to produce expert witnesses on its own behalf. The arbitrator may on his or her own initiative call expert witnesses on any issue raised in the arbitration. The cost of any expert called by the arbitrator is a cost of the proceedings payable as provided in § 4221.10(b).
(f)
Continuance of hearing.
The arbitrator may, for good cause shown, grant a continuance for a reasonable period. When granting a continuance, the arbitrator shall set a date for resumption of the hearing.
(g)
Filing of briefs.
Each party may file a written statement of facts and argument supporting the party's position. The parties' briefs are due no later than 30 days after the close of the hearing. Within 15 days thereafter,
each party may file a reply brief concerning matters contained in the opposing brief. The arbitrator may establish a briefing schedule and may reduce or extend these time limits. Each party shall deliver copies of all of its briefs to the arbitrator and to all opposing parties.
[61 FR 34109, July 1, 1996, as amended at 68 FR 61356, Oct. 28, 2003]
§ 4221.7
Reopening of proceedings.
(a)
Grounds for reopening.
At any time before a final award is rendered, the proceedings may be reopened, on the motion of the arbitrator or at the request of any party, for the purpose of taking further evidence or rehearing or rearguing any matter, if the arbitrator determines that—
(1) The reopening is likely to result in new information that will have a material effect on the outcome of the arbitration;
(2) Good cause exists for the failure of the party that requested reopening to present such information at the hearing; and
(3) The delay caused by the reopening will not be unfairly injurious to any party.
(b)
Comments on and notice of reopening.
The arbitrator shall allow all affected parties the opportunity to comment on any motion or request to reopen the proceedings. If he or she determines that the proceedings should be reopened, he or she shall give all parties written notice of the reasons for reopening and of the schedule of the reopened proceedings.
§ 4221.8
Award.
(a)
Form.
The arbitrator shall render a written award that—
(1) States the basis for the award, including such findings of fact and conclusions of law (which need not be explicitly designated as such) as are necessary to resolve the dispute;
(2) Adjusts (or provides a method for adjusting) the amount or schedule of payments to be made after the award to reflect overpayments or underpayments made before the award was rendered or requires the plan sponsor to refund overpayments in accordance with § 4219.31(d); and
(3) Provides for an allocation of costs in accordance with § 4221.10.
(b)
Time of award.
Except as provided in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, the arbitrator shall render the award no later than 30 days after the proceedings close. The award is rendered when filed or served on the parties as provided in § 4221.13. The award is final when the period for seeking modification or reconsideration in accordance with § 4221.9(a) has expired or the arbitrator has rendered a revised award in accordance with § 4221.9(c).
(c)
Reopened proceedings.
If the proceedings are reopened in accordance with § 4221.7 after the close of the hearing, the arbitrator shall render the award no later than 30 days after the date on which the reopened proceedings are closed.
(d)
Absence of hearing.
If the parties have chosen to proceed without a hearing, the arbitrator shall render the award no later than 30 days after the date on which final statements and proofs are filed with him or her.
(e)
Agreement for extension of time.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (b), (c), and (d), the parties may agree to an extension of time for the arbitrator's award in light of the particular facts and circumstances of their dispute.
(f)
Close of proceedings.
For purposes of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the proceedings are closed on the date on which the last brief or reply brief is due or, if no briefs are to be filed, on the date on which the hearing or rehearing closes.
(g)
Publication of award.
After a final award has been rendered, the plan sponsor shall make copies available upon request to the PBGC and to all companies that contribute to the plan. The plan sponsor may impose reasonable charges for copying and postage.
§ 4221.9
Reconsideration of award.
(a)
Motion for reconsideration and objections.
A party may seek modification or reconsideration of the arbitrator's award by filing a written motion with the arbitrator and all opposing parties within 20 days after the award is rendered. Opposing parties may file objections to modification or reconsideration within 10 days after the motion is filed. The filing of a written motion for
modification or reconsideration suspends the 30-day period under section 4221(b)(2) of ERISA for requesting court review of the award. The 30-day statutory period again begins to run when the arbitrator denies the motion pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section or renders a revised award.
(b)
Grounds for modification or reconsideration.
The arbitrator may grant a motion for modification or reconsideration of the award only if—
(1) There is a numerical error or a mistake in the description of any person, thing, or property referred to in the award; or
(2) The arbitrator has rendered an award upon a matter not submitted to the arbitrator and the matter affects the merits of the decision; or
(3) The award is imperfect in a matter of form not affecting the merits of the dispute.
(c)
Decision of arbitrator.
The arbitrator shall grant or deny the motion for modification or reconsideration, and may render an opinion to support his or her decision within 20 days after the motion is filed with the arbitrator, or within 30 days after the motion is filed if an objection is also filed.
§ 4221.10
Costs.
The costs of arbitration under this part shall be borne by the parties as follows:
(a)
Witnesses.
Each party to the dispute shall bear the costs of its own witnesses.
(b)
Other costs of arbitration.
Except as provided in § 4221.6(d) with respect to a transcript of the hearing, the parties shall bear the other costs of the arbitration proceedings equally unless the arbitrator determines otherwise. The parties may, however, agree to a different allocation of costs if their agreement is entered into after the employer has received notice of the plan's assessment of withdrawal liability.
(c)
Attorneys' fees.
The arbitrator may require a party that initiates or contests an arbitration in bad faith or engages in dilatory, harassing, or other improper conduct during the course of the arbitration to pay reasonable attorneys' fees of other parties.
§ 4221.11
Waiver of rules.
Any party that fails to object in writing in a timely manner to any deviation from any provision of this part is deemed to have waived the right to interpose that objection thereafter.
§ 4221.12
Calculation of periods of time.
The PBGC applies the rules in subpart D of part 4000 of this chapter to compute any time period under this part.
[68 FR 61356, Oct. 28, 2003]
§ 4221.13

§ 4221.14
PBGC-approved arbitration procedures.
(a)
Use of PBGC-approved arbitration procedures.
In lieu of the procedures prescribed by this part, an arbitration may be conducted in accordance with an alternative arbitration procedure approved by the PBGC in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. A plan may by plan amendment require the use of a PBGC-approved procedure for all arbitrations of withdrawal liability disputes, or the parties may agree to the use of a PBGC-approved procedure in a particular case.
(b)
Scope of alternative procedures.
If an arbitration is conducted in accordance with a PBGC-approved arbitration procedure, the alternative procedure
shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, with the following exceptions:
(1) The time limits for the initiation of arbitration may not differ from those provided for by § 4221.3.
(2) The arbitrator shall be selected after the initiation of the arbitration.
(3) The arbitrator shall give the parties opportunity for prehearing discovery substantially equivalent to that provided by § 4221.5(a)(2).
(4) The award shall be made available to the public to at least the extent provided by § 4221.8(g).
(5) The costs of arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with § 4221.10.
(c)
Procedure for approval of alternative procedures.
The PBGC may approve arbitration procedures on its own initiative by publishing an appropriate notice in the
Federal Register.
The sponsor of an arbitration procedure may request PBGC approval of its procedures by submitting an application to the PBGC. The application shall include:
(1) A copy of the procedures for which approval is sought;
(2) A description of the history, structure and membership of the organization that sponsors the procedures; and
(3) A discussion of the reasons why, in the sponsoring organization's opinion, the procedures satisfy the criteria for approval set forth in this section.
(d)
Criteria for approval of alternative procedures.
The PBGC shall approve an application if it determines that the proposed procedures will be substantially fair to all parties involved in the arbitration of a withdrawal liability dispute and that the sponsoring organization is neutral and able to carry out its role under the procedures. The PBGC may request comments on the application by publishing an appropriate notice in the
Federal Register.
Notice of the PBGC's decision on the application shall be published in the
Federal Register.
Unless the notice of approval specifies otherwise, approval will remain effective until revoked by the PBGC through a
Federal Register
notice.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 4231.1
Purpose and scope.
(a)
General
—(1)
Purpose.
The purpose of this part is to prescribe notice requirements under section 4231 of ERISA for mergers and transfers of assets or liabilities among multiemployer pension plans. This part also interprets the other requirements of section 4231 of ERISA and prescribes special rules for de minimis mergers and transfers.
(2)
Scope.
This part applies to mergers and transfers among multiemployer plans where all of the plans immediately before and immediately after the transaction are multiemployer plans covered by title IV of ERISA.
(b)
Additional requirements.
Subpart B of this part sets forth the additional requirements for and procedures specific to a request for a facilitated merger.
§ 4231.2
Definitions.
The following terms are defined in § 4001.2 of this chapter:
annuity, Code, EIN, ERISA, fair market value, guaranteed benefit, IRS, multiemployer plan, normal retirement age, PBGC, plan, plan sponsor, plan year,
and
PN.
In addition, the following terms are defined for purposes of this part:
Actuarial valuation
means a valuation of assets and liabilities performed by an enrolled actuary using the actuarial assumptions used for purposes of determining the charges and credits to the funding standard account under section 304 of ERISA and section 431 of the Code.
Advocate
means the Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate under section 4004 of ERISA.
Critical and declining status
has the same meaning as the term has under section 305(b)(6) of ERISA and section 432(b)(6) of the Code.
Critical status
has the same meaning as the term has under section 305(b)(2) of ERISA and section 432(b)(2) of the Code, and includes “critical and declining status” as defined in section 305(b)(6) of ERISA and section 432(b)(6) of the Code.
De minimis merger
is defined in § 4231.7(b).
De minimis transfer
is defined in § 4231.7(c).
Effective date
means, with respect to a merger or transfer, the earlier of—
(1) The date on which one plan assumes liability for benefits accrued under another plan involved in the transaction; or
(2) The date on which one plan transfers assets to another plan involved in the transaction.
Facilitated merger
means a merger of two or more multiemployer plans facilitated by PBGC under section 4231(e) of ERISA, including a merger that is facilitated with financial assistance under section 4231(e)(2) of ERISA.
Fair market value of assets
has the same meaning as the term has for minimum funding purposes under section 304 of ERISA and section 431 of the Code.
Financial assistance
means periodic or lump sum financial assistance payments from PBGC under section 4261 of ERISA.
Financial assistance merger
means a merger facilitated by PBGC for which PBGC provides financial assistance (within the meaning of section 4261 of ERISA) under section 4231(e)(2) of ERISA.
Insolvent
has the same meaning as insolvent under section 4245(b) of ERISA.
Merged plan
means a plan that is the result of the merger of two or more multiemployer plans.
Merger
means the combining of two or more plans into a single plan. For example, a consolidation of two plans into a new plan is a merger.
Significantly affected plan
means a plan that—
(1) Transfers assets that equal or exceed 15 percent of its assets before the transfer,
(2) Receives a transfer of unfunded accrued benefits that equal or exceed 15 percent of its assets before the transfer,
(3) Is created by a spinoff from another plan, or
(4) Engages in a merger or transfer (other than a de minimis merger or transfer) either—
(i) After such plan has terminated by mass withdrawal under section 4041A(a)(2) of ERISA, or
(ii) With another plan that has so terminated.
Transfer
and
transfer of assets or liabilities
mean a diminution of assets or liabilities with respect to one plan and the acquisition of these assets or the assumption of these liabilities by another plan or plans (including a plan that did not exist prior to the transfer). However, the shifting of assets or liabilities pursuant to a written reciprocity agreement between two multiemployer plans in which one plan assumes liabilities of another plan is not a transfer of assets or liabilities. In addition, the shifting of assets between several funding media used for a single plan (such as between trusts, between annuity contracts, or between trusts and annuity contracts) is not a transfer of assets or liabilities.
Unfunded accrued benefits
means the excess of the present value of a plan's accrued benefits over the plan's fair market value of assets, determined on the basis of the actuarial valuation required under § 4231.5.
§ 4231.3
Requirements for mergers and transfers.
(a)
General requirements.
A plan sponsor may not cause a multiemployer plan to merge with one or more multiemployer plans or transfer assets or liabilities to or from another multiemployer plan unless the merger or transfer satisfies all of the following requirements:
(1) No participant's or beneficiary's accrued benefit is lower immediately after the effective date of the merger or transfer than the benefit immediately before that date (except as provided under § 4231.4(b)).
(2) Actuarial valuations of the plans that existed before the merger or transfer have been performed in accordance with § 4231.5.
(3) For each plan that exists after the transaction, an enrolled actuary—
(i) Determines that the plan meets the applicable plan solvency requirement set forth in § 4231.6; or
(ii) Otherwise demonstrates that benefits under the plan are not reasonably expected to be subject to suspension under section 4245 of ERISA.
(4) The plan sponsor notifies PBGC of the merger or transfer in accordance with §§ 4231.8 and 4231.9.
(b)
Compliance determination.
If a plan sponsor requests a determination that a merger or transfer that may otherwise be prohibited by section 406(a) or (b)(2) of ERISA satisfies the requirements of section 4231 of ERISA, the plan sponsor must submit the information described in § 4231.10 in addition to
the information required by § 4231.9. PBGC may request additional information if necessary to determine whether a merger or transfer complies with the requirements of section 4231 and subpart A of this part. Plan sponsors are not required to request a compliance determination. Under section 4231(c) of ERISA, if PBGC determines that the merger or transfer complies with section 4231 of ERISA and subpart A of this part, the merger or transfer will not constitute a violation of the prohibited transaction provisions of section 406(a) and (b)(2) of ERISA.
(c)
Certified change in bargaining representative.
Transfers of assets and liabilities pursuant to a change of collective bargaining representative certified under the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947 or the Railway Labor Act, as amended, are governed by section 4235 of ERISA. Plan sponsors involved in such transfers are not required to comply with subpart A of this part. However, under section 4235(f)(1) of ERISA, the plan sponsors of the plans involved in the transfer may agree to a transfer that complies with sections 4231 and 4234 of ERISA. Plan sponsors that elect to comply with sections 4231 and 4234 of ERISA must comply with the rules in subpart A of this part.
(d)
Informal consultation.
A plan sponsor may contact PBGC on an informal basis to discuss a potential merger or transfer.
§ 4231.4
Preservation of accrued benefits.
(a)
General.
Section 4231(b)(2) of ERISA and § 4231.3(a)(1) require that no participant's or beneficiary's accrued benefit may be lower immediately after the effective date of the merger or transfer than the benefit immediately before the merger or transfer. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a plan that assumes an obligation to pay benefits for a group of participants satisfies this requirement only if the plan contains a provision preserving all accrued benefits. The determination of what is an accrued benefit must be made in accordance with section 411 of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
(b)
Waiver.
PBGC may waive the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, § 4231.3(a)(1), and section 4231(b)(2) of ERISA to the extent the accrued benefit is suspended under section 305(e)(9) of ERISA contemporaneously with the merger or transfer. If waived, the plan provision described under paragraph (a) of this section may exclude accrued benefits only to the extent those benefits are suspended under section 305(e)(9) of ERISA contemporaneously with the merger or transfer.
§ 4231.5
Valuation requirement.
The actuarial valuation requirement under section 4231(b)(4) of ERISA and § 4231.3(a)(2) is satisfied if an actuarial valuation has been performed for the plan based on the plan's assets and liabilities as of a date not earlier than the first day of the last plan year ending before the proposed effective date of the transaction. If the actuarial valuation required under this section is not complete when the notice of merger or transfer is filed, the plan sponsor may provide the most recent actuarial valuation for the plan with the notice, and the actuarial valuation required under this section when complete. For a significantly affected plan involved in a transfer (other than a plan that is a significantly affected plan only because the transfer involves a plan that has terminated by mass withdrawal under section 4041A(a)(2) of ERISA), the valuation must separately identify assets, contributions, and liabilities being transferred and must be based on the actuarial assumptions and methods that are expected to be used for the plan for the first plan year beginning after the transfer.
§ 4231.6
Plan solvency tests.
(a)
General.
For a plan that is not a significantly affected plan, the plan solvency requirement of section 4231(b)(3) of ERISA and § 4231.3(a)(3)(i) is satisfied if—
(1) The plan's expected fair market value of assets immediately after the merger or transfer equals or exceeds five times the benefit payments for the last plan year ending before the proposed effective date of the merger or transfer; or
(2) In each of the first five plan years beginning on or after the proposed effective date of the merger or transfer, the plan's expected fair market value of assets as of the beginning of the plan year plus expected contributions and investment earnings equal or exceed expected expenses and benefit payments for the plan year.
(b)
Significantly affected plans.
The plan solvency requirement of section 4231(b)(3) of ERISA and § 4231.3(a)(3)(i) is satisfied for a significantly affected plan if all of the following requirements are met:
(1) Expected contributions equal or exceed the estimated amount necessary to satisfy the minimum funding requirement of section 431 of the Code for the five plan years beginning on or after the proposed effective date of the transaction.
(2) The plan's expected fair market value of assets immediately after the transaction equals or exceeds the total amount of expected benefit payments for the first five plan years beginning on or after the proposed effective date of the transaction.
(3) Expected contributions for the first plan year beginning on or after the proposed effective date of the transaction equal or exceed expected benefit payments for that plan year.
(4) Expected contributions for the amortization period equal or exceed the unfunded accrued benefits plus expected normal costs for the period. The enrolled actuary may select as the amortization period either—
(i) The first 25 plan years beginning on or after the proposed effective date of the transaction, or
(ii) The amortization period for the resulting base when the combined charge base and the combined credit base are offset under section 431(b)(5) of the Code.
(c)
Rules for determinations.
In determining whether a transaction satisfies the plan solvency requirements set forth in this section, the following rules apply:
(1) Expected contributions after a merger or transfer must be determined by assuming that contributions for each plan year will equal contributions for the last full plan year ending before the date on which the notice of merger or transfer is filed with PBGC. If expected contributions include withdrawal liability payments, such payments must be shown separately. If the withdrawal liability payments are not the assessed amounts, or are not in accordance with the schedule of payments, or include future assessments, include the basis for such differences, with supporting data, calculations, assumptions, and methods. In addition, contributions must be adjusted to reflect—
(i) The merger or transfer;
(ii) Any change in the rate of employer contributions that has been negotiated (whether or not in effect); and
(iii) Any trend of changing contribution base units over the preceding five plan years or other period of time that can be demonstrated to be more appropriate.
(2) Expected normal costs must be determined under the funding method and assumptions expected to be used by the plan actuary for purposes of determining the minimum funding requirement under section 431 of the Code. If an aggregate funding method is used for the plan, normal costs must be determined under the entry age normal method.
(3) Expected benefit payments must be determined by assuming that current benefits remain in effect and that all scheduled increases in benefits occur.
(4) The plan's expected fair market value of assets immediately after the merger or transfer must be based on the most recent data available immediately before the date on which the notice is filed.
(5) Expected investment earnings must be determined using the same interest assumption to be used for determining the minimum funding requirement under section 431 of the Code.
(6) Expected expenses must be determined using expenses in the last plan year ending before the notice is filed, adjusted to reflect any anticipated changes.
(7) Expected plan assets for a plan year must be determined by adjusting the most current data on the plan's fair market value of assets to reflect expected contributions, investment
earnings, benefit payments and expenses for each plan year between the date of the most current data and the beginning of the plan year for which expected assets are being determined.
§ 4231.7
De minimis mergers and transfers.
(a)
Special plan solvency rule.
The determination of whether a de minimis merger or transfer satisfies the plan solvency requirement in § 4231.6(a) may be made without regard to any other de minimis mergers or transfers that have occurred since the most recent actuarial valuation.
(b)
De minimis merger defined.
A merger is de minimis if the present value of accrued benefits (whether or not vested) of one plan is less than 3 percent of the other plan's fair market value of assets.
(c)
De minimis transfer defined.
A transfer of assets or liabilities is de minimis if—
(1) The fair market value of assets transferred, if any, is less than 3 percent of the fair market value of assets of all of the transferor plan's assets;
(2) The present value of the accrued benefits transferred (whether or not vested) is less than 3 percent of the fair market value of assets of all of the transferee plan's assets; and
(3) The transferee plan is not a plan that has terminated under section 4041A(a)(2) of ERISA.
(d)
Value of assets and benefits.
For purposes of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the value of plan assets and accrued benefits may be determined as of any date prior to the proposed effective date of the transaction, but not earlier than the date of the most recent actuarial valuation.
(e)
Aggregation required.
In determining whether a merger or transfer is de minimis, the assets and accrued benefits transferred in previous de minimis mergers and transfers within the same plan year must be aggregated as described in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section. For the purposes of those paragraphs, the value of plan assets may be determined as of the date during the plan year on which the total value of the plan's assets is the highest.
(1) A merger is not de minimis if the total present value of accrued benefits merged into a plan, when aggregated with all prior de minimis mergers of and transfers to that plan effective within the same plan year, equals or exceeds 3 percent of the value of the plan's assets.
(2) A transfer is not de minimis if, when aggregated with all previous de minimis mergers and transfers effective within the same plan year—
(i) The value of all assets transferred from a plan equals or exceeds 3 percent of the value of the plan's assets; or
(ii) The present value of all accrued benefits transferred to a plan equals or exceeds 3 percent of the plan's assets.
§ 4231.8
Filing requirements; timing and method of filing.
(a)
When to file.
Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, a notice of a proposed merger or transfer, and, if applicable, a request for a compliance determination or facilitated merger (which may be filed separately or combined), must be filed not less than the following number of days before the proposed effective date of the transaction—
(1) 270 days in the case of a facilitated merger under § 4231.12;
(2) 120 days in the case of a merger (other than a facilitated merger) for which a compliance determination under § 4231.10 is requested, or a transfer; or
(3) 45 days in the case of a merger for which a compliance determination under § 4231.10 is not requested.
(b)
Method of filing.
PBGC applies the rules in subpart A of part 4000 of this chapter to determine permissible methods of filing with PBGC under this part.
(c)

(d)
Who must file.
The plan sponsors of all plans involved in a merger or transfer, or the duly authorized representative(s) acting on behalf of the plan sponsors, must jointly file the notice required by subpart A of this part, and, if applicable, a request for a facilitated merger under § 4231.12.
(e)
Where to file.
See § 4000.4 of this chapter for information on where to file.
(f)
Date of filing.
PBGC applies the rules in subpart C of part 4000 of this chapter to determine the date a submission under this part was filed with PBGC.

(g)
Waiver of timing of notice.
PBGC may waive the timing requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and section 4231(b)(1) of ERISA if—
(1) A plan sponsor demonstrates to the satisfaction of PBGC that failure to complete the merger or transfer in less than the applicable notice period set forth in paragraph (a) of this section will cause harm to participants or beneficiaries of the plans involved in the transaction;
(2) PBGC determines that the transaction complies with the requirements of section 4231 of ERISA; or
(3) PBGC completes its review of the transaction.
§ 4231.9

Each notice of proposed merger or transfer required under section 4231(b)(1) of ERISA and this subpart must contain the following information:
(a) For each plan involved in the merger or transfer—
(1) The name of the plan;
(2) The name, address and telephone number of the plan sponsor and of the plan sponsor's duly authorized representative, if any; and
(3) The plan sponsor's EIN and the plan's PN and, if different, the EIN or PN last filed with PBGC. If no EIN or PN has been assigned, the notice must so indicate.
(b) Whether the transaction being reported is a merger or transfer, whether it involves any plan that has terminated under section 4041A(a)(2) of ERISA, whether any significantly affected plan is involved in the transaction (and, if so, identifying each such plan), and whether it is a de minimis transaction as defined in § 4231.7 (and, if so, including an enrolled actuary's certification to that effect).
(c) The proposed effective date of the transaction.
(d) Except as provided under § 4231.4(b), a copy of each plan provision stating that no participant's or beneficiary's accrued benefit will be lower immediately after the effective date of the merger or transfer than the benefit immediately before that date.
(e) For each plan that exists after the transaction, one of the following statements, certified by an enrolled actuary:
(1) A statement that the plan satisfies the applicable plan solvency test set forth in § 4231.6, indicating which is the applicable test, and including the supporting data, calculations, assumptions, and methods.

(f) For each plan that exists before a transaction (unless the transaction is de minimis and does not involve either a request for financial assistance, or any plan that has terminated under section 4041A(a)(2) of ERISA), a copy of the most recent actuarial valuation report that satisfies the requirements of § 4231.5.
(g) For each significantly affected plan that exists after the transaction, the following information used in making the plan solvency determination under § 4231.6(b):
(1) The present value of the accrued benefits and plan's fair market value of assets under the valuation required by § 4231.5, allocable to the plan after the transaction.
(2) The fair market value of assets in the plan after the transaction (determined in accordance with § 4231.6(c)(4)).
(3) The expected benefit payments for the plan for the first plan year beginning on or after the proposed effective date of the transaction (determined in accordance with § 4231.6(c)(3)).
(4) The contribution rates in effect for the plan for the first plan year beginning on or after the proposed effective date of the transaction.
(5) The expected contributions for the plan for the first plan year beginning on or after the proposed effective date of the transaction (determined in accordance with § 4231.6(c)(1)).
§ 4231.10
Request for compliance determination.
(a)
General.
The plan sponsor(s) of one or more plans involved in a merger or transfer, or the duly authorized representative(s) acting on behalf of the plan sponsor(s), may file a request for a determination that the transaction complies with the requirements of section 4231 of ERISA. If the plan sponsor(s) requests a compliance determination, the request must be filed with the notice of merger or transfer under § 4231.3(a)(4), and must contain the information described in paragraph (c) of this section, as applicable.
(b)
Single request permitted for all de minimis transactions.
A plan sponsor may submit a single request for a compliance determination covering all de minimis mergers or transfers that occur between one plan valuation and the next. However, the plan sponsor must still notify PBGC of each de minimis merger or transfer separately, in accordance with §§ 4231.8 and 4231.9. The single request for a compliance determination may be filed concurrently with any one of the notices of a de minimis merger or transfer.
(c)
Contents of request.
A request for a compliance determination concerning a merger or transfer that is not de minimis must contain—
(1) A copy of the merger or transfer agreement; and
(2) For each significantly affected plan, other than a plan that is a significantly affected plan only because the merger or transfer involves a plan that has terminated by mass withdrawal under section 4041A(a)(2) of ERISA, copies of all actuarial valuations performed within the 5 years preceding the date of filing the notice required under § 4231.3(a)(4).
§ 4231.11
Actuarial calculations and assumptions.
(a)
Most recent valuation.
All calculations required by this part must be based on the most recent actuarial valuation as of the date of filing the notice, updated to show any material changes.
(b)
Assumptions.
All calculations required by this part must be performed by an enrolled actuary based on methods and assumptions each of which is reasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations), and which, in combination, offer the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan.
(c)
Updated calculations.
PBGC may require updated calculations and representations based on the actual effective date of a merger or transfer if that date is more than one year after the notice is filed, based on revised actuarial assumptions, or based on other good cause.

# Subpart B—Additional Rules for Facilitated Mergers
§ 4231.12
Request for facilitated merger.
(a)
General.
(1) The plan sponsors of the plans involved in a proposed merger may request that PBGC facilitate the merger. Facilitation may include training, technical assistance, mediation, communication with stakeholders, and support with related requests to other government agencies. Facilitation may also include financial assistance to the merged plan. PBGC has discretion under section 4231(e) of ERISA to take such actions as it deems appropriate to facilitate the merger of two or more multiemployer plans if it determines, after consultation with the Advocate, that the proposed merger is in the interests of the participants and beneficiaries of at least one of the plans, and is not reasonably expected to be adverse to the overall interests of the participants and beneficiaries of any of the plans involved in the proposed merger. For a facilitated merger, including a financial assistance merger, the requirements of section 4231(b) of ERISA and subpart A of this part must be satisfied in addition to the requirements of section 4231(e) of ERISA
and this subpart. The procedures set forth in this subpart represent the exclusive means by which PBGC will approve a request for a facilitated merger under section 4231(e) of ERISA.
(2)
Financial assistance.
Subject to the requirements in section 4231(e) of ERISA and this subpart, in the case of a request for a financial assistance merger, PBGC may in its discretion provide financial assistance (within the meaning of section 4261 of ERISA). Such financial assistance will be with respect to the guaranteed benefits payable under the critical and declining status plan(s) involved in the facilitated merger.
(b)
Information requirements.
(1) A request for a facilitated merger, including a request for a financial assistance merger, must be filed with the notice of merger under § 4231.3(a)(4), and must contain the information described in § 4231.10, and a detailed narrative description with supporting documentation demonstrating that the proposed merger is in the interests of participants and beneficiaries of at least one of the plans, and is not reasonably expected to be adverse to the overall interests of the participants and beneficiaries of any of the plans. If a financial assistance merger is requested, the narrative description and supporting documentation may consider the effect of financial assistance in making these demonstrations.
(2) If a financial assistance merger is requested, the request must contain the information required in §§ 4231.13 through 4231.16 in addition to the information required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(3) PBGC may require the plan sponsors to submit additional information to determine whether the requirements of section 4231(e) of ERISA are met or to enable it to facilitate the merger.
(c)
Duty to amend and supplement.
During any time in which a request for a facilitated merger, including a request for a financial assistance merger, is pending final action by PBGC, the plan sponsors must promptly notify PBGC in writing of any material fact or representation contained in or relating to the request, or in any supporting documents, that is no longer accurate or was omitted.
§ 4231.13
Plan information for financial assistance merger.
A request for a financial assistance merger must include the following information for each plan involved in the merger:
(a) The most recent trust agreement, including all amendments adopted since the last restatement.
(b) The most recent plan document, including all amendments adopted since the last restatement.
(c) The most recent summary plan description (SPD), and all summaries of material modification issued since the most recent SPD.
(d) If applicable, the most recent rehabilitation plan (or funding improvement plan), including all subsequent amendments and updates, and the percentage of total contributions received under each schedule of the rehabilitation plan (or funding improvement plan) for the most recent plan year available.
(e) A copy of the plan's most recent IRS determination letter.
(f) A copy of the plan's most recent Form 5500 (Annual Report Form) and all schedules and attachments (including the audited financial statement).

(h) A schedule of withdrawal liability payments collected in each of the most recent five plan years.
(i) If applicable, a copy of the plan sponsor's application for suspension of benefits under section 305(e)(9)(G) of ERISA (including all attachments and exhibits).
§ 4231.14
Description of financial assistance merger.
A request for a financial assistance merger must include the following information about the proposed financial assistance merger:
(a) A detailed description of the proposed financial assistance merger, including any larger integrated transaction of which the merger is a part (including, but not limited to, an application for suspension of benefits under section 305(e)(9)(G) of ERISA).
(b) A narrative description of the events that led to the plan sponsors' decision to submit a request for a financial assistance merger.
(c) A narrative description of significant risks and assumptions relating to the proposed financial assistance merger and the projections provided in support of the request.
(d) A detailed description of the estimated total amount of financial assistance the plan sponsors request for each year, including the supporting data, calculations, assumptions, and a description of the methodology used to determine the estimated amounts.
§ 4231.15
Actuarial and financial information for financial assistance merger.
A request for a financial assistance merger must include the following actuarial and financial information for the plans involved in the merger:
(a) A copy of the actuarial valuation performed for each of the two plan years before the most recent actuarial valuation filed in accordance with § 4231.9(f).
(b) If applicable, a copy of the plan actuary's most recent annual actuarial certification under section 305(b)(3) of ERISA, including a detailed description of the assumptions used in the certification, and the basis under which they were determined. The description must include information about the assumptions used for the projection of future contributions, withdrawal liability payments, and investment returns, and any other assumption that may have a material effect on projections.
(c) A detailed statement certified by an enrolled actuary that the merger is necessary for one or more of the plans involved to avoid or postpone insolvency, including the basis for the conclusion, supporting data, calculations, assumptions, and a description of the methodology. This statement must demonstrate for each critical and declining status plan involved in the merger that the date the plan projects to become insolvent (without reflecting the merger) is earlier than the date the merged plan projects to become insolvent (the merged plan may reflect the proposed financial assistance). Include as an exhibit annual cash flow projections for each critical and declining status plan involved in the merger through the date the plan projects to become insolvent (using an open group valuation and without reflecting the merger). Annual cash flow projections must reflect the following information:
(1) Fair market value of assets as of the beginning of the year.
(2) Contributions and withdrawal liability payments.
(3) Benefit payments organized by participant type (
e.g.,
active, retiree, terminated vested).
(4) Administrative expenses.
(5) Fair market value of assets as of the end of the year.
(d) For each critical and declining status plan involved in the merger, a long-term projection (at least 50 to 90 years) of benefit disbursements by participant type (
e.g.,
active, retiree, terminated vested) (without reflecting the merger) reflecting reduced benefit disbursements at the PBGC-guarantee level (which may be estimated) beginning with the proposed effective date of the merger (using a closed group valuation and no accruals after the proposed effective date of the merger). Include the supporting data, calculations, assumptions, and, if applicable, a description of estimates used for this projection.
(e) A detailed statement certified by an enrolled actuary that financial assistance is necessary for the merged plan to become or remain solvent, including the basis for the conclusion, supporting data, calculations, assumptions, and a description of the methodology. Include as an exhibit annual cash flow projections for the merged plan with the proposed financial assistance (based on the actuarial assumptions and methods that will be used under the merged plan). Annual cash flow projections must reflect the information listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section. In addition, include as an exhibit a statement certified by an enrolled actuary of whether the merged plan would be in critical status for purposes of paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section, including the basis for the conclusion.
(1) If the merged plan would be in critical status immediately following
the merger without the proposed financial assistance (as reasonably determined by the enrolled actuary or as set forth in this paragraph), the enrolled actuary's certified statement must demonstrate that the merged plan will avoid insolvency under section 305(e)(9)(D)(iv) of ERISA and the regulations thereunder (excluding stochastic projections) with the proposed financial assistance. The enrolled actuary may determine whether the merged plan would be in critical status based on the combined data and projections underlying the status certifications of each of the plans for the plan year immediately preceding the merger, including any selected updates in the data based on the experience of the plans in the immediately preceding plan year (reasonable adjustments are permitted but not required).
(2) If the merged plan would not be in critical status immediately following the merger without the proposed financial assistance (as reasonably determined by the enrolled actuary or as set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section), the enrolled actuary's certified statement must demonstrate that the merged plan is not projected to become insolvent during the 20 plan years beginning after the proposed effective date of the merger with the proposed financial assistance (using the methodologies set forth under section 305(b)(3)(B)(iv) of ERISA and the regulations thereunder). If such a demonstration is possible without the proposed financial assistance, or if the amount of financial assistance requested exceeds the amount needed to satisfy this demonstration, the enrolled actuary's certified statement must demonstrate that financial assistance is necessary to mitigate the adverse effects of the merger on the merged plan's ability to remain solvent. The demonstration that financial assistance is necessary to mitigate the adverse effects of the merger on the merged plan's ability to remain solvent may be based on stress testing over a long-term period (and may reflect reasonable future adverse experience), using a reasonable method in accordance with generally accepted actuarial standards.
(f) If applicable, a copy of the plan actuary's certification under section 305(e)(9)(C)(i) of ERISA.
(g) The rules in § 4231.6(c) apply to the solvency projections described in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section, unless section 305(e)(9)(D)(iv) of ERISA and the regulations thereunder apply and specify otherwise.
§ 4231.16
Participant census data for financial assistance merger.
A request for a financial assistance merger must include a copy of the census data used for the projections described in § 4231.15(c) through (e), including:
(a) Participant type (retiree, beneficiary, disabled, terminated vested, active, alternate payee).
(b) Gender.
(c) Date of birth.
(d) Credited service for guarantee calculation (
i.e.,
number of years of participation).
(e) Vested accrued monthly benefit.
(f) Monthly benefit guaranteed by PBGC.
(g) Benefit commencement date (for participants in pay status and others for which the reported benefit will not be payable at normal retirement age).
(h) For each participant in pay status—
(1) Form of payment, and
(2) Data relevant to the form of payment, including:

(ii) For a Social Security level income benefit, the date of any change in the benefit amount, and the benefit amount after such change;
(iii) For a 5-year certain or 10-year certain benefit (or similar benefit), the relevant defined period; or
(iv) For a form of payment not otherwise described in this section, the data necessary for the valuation of the form of payment.
(i) If an actuarial increase for postponed retirement applies, or if the form of annuity is a Social Security level income benefit, the monthly vested benefit payable at normal retirement age in normal form of annuity.
§ 4231.17
PBGC action on a request for facilitated merger.
(a)
General.
PBGC may approve or deny a request for a facilitated merger, including a request for a financial assistance merger, at its discretion if the requirements of section 4231 of ERISA are satisfied. PBGC will notify the plan sponsor(s) in writing of its decision on a request. If PBGC denies the request, PBGC's written decision will state the reason(s) for the denial. If PBGC approves a request for a financial assistance merger, PBGC will provide a financial assistance agreement detailing the total amount and terms of the financial assistance as soon as practicable after notifying the plan sponsor(s) in writing of its approval.
(b)
Final agency action.
PBGC's decision to approve or deny a request for a facilitated merger, including a request for a financial assistance merger, is a final agency action for purposes of judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 701
et seq.
).
§ 4231.18
Jurisdiction over financial assistance merger.
(a)
General.
PBGC will retain jurisdiction over the merged plan resulting from a financial assistance merger to carry out the purposes, terms, and conditions of the financial assistance merger, the financial assistance agreement, sections 4231 and 4261 of ERISA, and the regulations thereunder.
(b)
Financial assistance agreement.
PBGC may, upon providing notice to the plan sponsor, make changes to the financial assistance agreement in response to changed circumstances consistent with sections 4231 and 4261 of ERISA and the regulations thereunder.

§ 4233.12
PBGC action on application for partition.
(a)
Review period.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, PBGC will approve or deny an application for partition submitted to it under this part within 270 days after the date PBGC issued a notice to the plan sponsor of the completed application under § 4233.10(c).
(b)
Determination on application.
PBGC may approve or deny an application at its discretion. PBGC will notify the plan sponsor in writing of PBGC's decision on an application. If PBGC denies the application, PBGC's written decision will state the reason(s) for the denial. If PBGC approves the application, PBGC will issue a partition order under section 4233(c) of ERISA and § 4233.14.
(c)
Conditional determination on application.
At the request of a plan sponsor, PBGC may, in its discretion, issue an approval of an application conditioned on Treasury issuing a final authorization to suspend under section 305(e)(9)(H)(vi) of ERISA and any other terms and conditions set forth in the conditional approval. The conditional approval will include a written statement of preliminary findings, conclusions, and conditions. The conditional approval is not a final agency action.

[80 FR 35229, June 19, 2015, as amended at 80 FR 79695, Dec. 23, 2015]
§ 4233.13
Coordinated application process for partition and benefit suspension.
(a)
Interagency coordination.
For a plan sponsor that has requested a conditional approval of a partition pursuant to § 4233.12(c), PBGC may render either a conditional approval or a final denial of the application on an expedited basis, provided that the plan sponsor has submitted a completed application to PBGC as prescribed by § 4233.10. PBGC will consult with Treasury and the Department of Labor in the course of reviewing an application for partition.
(1) If PBGC denies the application for partition, it will notify the plan sponsor in writing of PBGC's decision in accordance with § 4233.12(b), and will notify Treasury to allow it to take appropriate action on the benefit suspension application.
(2) If PBGC grants a conditional approval of partition, it will notify the plan sponsor in writing of PBGC's decision in accordance with § 4233.12(c), and will provide Treasury with a copy of PBGC's decision along with PBGC's record of the decision.
(3) If Treasury does not issue the final authorization to suspend, PBGC's conditional approval under § 4233.12(c) will be null and void.
(4) If Treasury issues a final authorization to suspend, PBGC will issue a final partition order under § 4233.14 and section 4233(c) of ERISA. The effective date of a final partition order must satisfy the requirements of section 305(e)(9)(D)(v) of ERISA.
(b)
Combined notice.
A plan sponsor submitting an application for benefit suspensions under section 305(e)(9) of ERISA with Treasury, and a partition under section 4233 of ERISA with PBGC, may combine the PBGC model notice for coordinated applications provided at Appendix A with the Treasury model notice in Appendix A of Rev. Proc. 2015-34 in satisfaction of the notice requirement of this part.
[80 FR 35229, June 19, 2015, as amended at 80 FR 79695, Dec. 23, 2015]
§ 4233.14
Partition order.
(a)
General provisions.
The partition order will describe the liabilities to be transferred to the successor plan under section 4233(c) of ERISA, and the manner in which financial assistance will be provided by PBGC under section 4261 of ERISA. The partition order will also set forth PBGC's findings and conclusions on an application for partition, the effective date of partition, the obligations and responsibilities of the plan sponsor to the original plan and successor plan, and such other information as PBGC may deem appropriate.
(b)
Terms and conditions.
The partition order will set forth the terms and conditions of the partition and will incorporate by reference the applicable requirements under sections 4233(d) and 4233(e) of ERISA.
(1) The plan sponsors of the original plan and the successor plan must amend the original plan and successor
plan, respectively, to reflect the benefits payable to participants and beneficiaries as a result of the partition order.
(2) The plan sponsors of the original plan and successor plan must maintain a written record of the respective plans' compliance with the terms of the partition order, section 4233 of ERISA, and this part.
§ 4233.15
Nature and operation of successor plan.
(a)
Nature of plan.
The plan created by the partition order is a successor plan to which section 4022A applies, and an insolvent plan under section 4245 of ERISA.
(b)
Treatment of plan.
The successor plan will be treated as a terminated multiemployer plan to which section 4041A(d) of ERISA applies because there are no contributing employers with an obligation to contribute within the meaning of section 4212 of ERISA as of the effective date of the partition. The treatment of the successor plan as a terminated plan under this paragraph will not be taken into account for purposes of determining the withdrawal liability of contributing employers to the original plan under sections 4201 and 4233(d)(3) of ERISA.
(c)
Administration of plan.
The plan sponsor of the original plan and the administrator of such plan will be the plan sponsor and the administrator, respectively, of the successor plan. PBGC will retain the right to remove and replace the plan sponsor of the successor plan pursuant to section 4042(b)(2) of ERISA.
§ 4233.16
Coordination of benefits under original plan and successor plan.
(a)
Successor plan benefits.
Subject to the limitations contained in section 4022A of ERISA, the only benefit amounts payable under a successor plan are successor plan benefits as defined in § 4233.2.
(b)
Guarantee of successor plan benefit.
When a participant's or beneficiary's benefit is partially or wholly transferred to a successor plan, the PBGC guarantee applicable to such benefit becomes payable under the successor plan. The benefit remaining in the original plan as of the effective date of the partition, if any, is not subject to a new guarantee, and any increase in the PBGC guarantee amount payable under the original plan will arise solely, if at all, due to an increase in the accrued benefit under a plan amendment following the effective date of the partition, or an additional accrual attributable to service after the effective date of the partition.
(c)
PBGC financial assistance.
Subject to the conditions contained in section 4261 of ERISA, PBGC will provide financial assistance to the successor plan in an amount sufficient to enable the successor plan to pay only the PBGC-guaranteed amount transferred to the successor plan pursuant to the partition order, and reasonable and necessary administrative expenses if approved by PBGC. The receipt of benefits payable under a successor plan receiving financial assistance from PBGC will be treated as the receipt of guaranteed benefits under section 4022A.
(d)
Payment of monthly benefits.
The plan sponsors of an original plan and a successor plan may, but are not required to, pay monthly benefits payable under the original plan and successor plan, respectively, in a single monthly payment pursuant to a written cost-sharing or expense allocation agreement between the plans.
§ 4233.17
Continuing jurisdiction.
(a) PBGC will continue to have jurisdiction over the original plan and the successor plan to carry out the purposes, terms, and conditions of the partition order, section 4233 of ERISA, and this part.
(b) PBGC may, upon providing notice to the plan sponsor, make changes to the partition order in response to changed circumstances consistent with section 4233 of ERISA and this part.
Pt. 4233, App. A

# Appendix A to Part 4233—Model Notices

# NOTICE OF APPLICATION FOR PARTITION FOR [INSERT PLAN NAME]

# [For plans filing an application for partition only]
[Insert Date]
This notice is to inform you that, on [
insert Date
], [
insert Plan Sponsor's Name
] (“Board of
Trustees”) filed a complete application with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”) requesting approval for a partition of the [
insert Pension Fund name, Employer Identification Number, and three-digit Plan Number
] (the “Plan”).

# What is partition?
A multiemployer plan that is in critical and declining status may apply to PBGC for an order that separates (
i.e.,
partitions) and transfers the PBGC-guaranteed portion of certain participants' and beneficiaries' benefits to a newly-created successor plan. The total amount transferred from the original plan to the successor plan is the minimum amount needed to keep the original plan solvent. While the Board of Trustees will administer the successor plan, PBGC will provide financial assistance to the successor plan to pay the transferred benefits.
PBGC guarantees benefits up to a legal limit. However, if the PBGC-guaranteed amount payable by the successor plan is less than the benefit payable under the original plan, Federal law requires the original plan to pay the difference. Therefore, partition will
not
change the total amount payable to any participant or beneficiary.

# What are the rules for partition?
Federal law permits, but does not require, PBGC to approve an application for partition. PBGC generally will make a decision on the application for partition within 270 days. A plan is eligible for partition if certain requirements are met, including:
1. The pension plan is in critical and declining status. A plan is in critical and declining status if it is in critical status (which generally means the plan's funded percentage is less than 65%) and is projected to run out of money within 15 years (or 20 years if there are twice as many inactive as active participants, or if the plan's funded percentage is less than 80%).
2. PBGC determines, after consulting with the PBGC Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate, that the Board of Trustees has taken (or is taking) all reasonable measures to avoid insolvency. Reasonable measures may include contribution increases or reductions in the rate of benefit accruals.
3. PBGC determines that: (1) Providing financial assistance in a partition will be significantly less than providing financial assistance in the event the plan becomes insolvent; and (2) partition is necessary for the plan to remain solvent.
4. PBGC certifies to Congress that its ability to meet existing financial assistance obligations to other multiemployer plans (including plans that are insolvent or projected to become insolvent within 10 years) will not be impaired by the partition.
5. The cost of the partition is paid exclusively from PBGC's multiemployer insurance fund.

# Why is partition needed?
The Plan is in critical and declining status, is [
insert funded percentage
] funded, and is projected to become insolvent by [
insert expected insolvency date
]. The Board of Trustees asserts that it has taken reasonable measures to avoid insolvency, but has determined that these measures are insufficient and that the proposed partition is necessary for the Plan to avoid insolvency.
[
Insert brief statement of the amount of liabilities the Board of Trustees proposes to partition and indicate whether it is the minimum amount needed for the Plan to remain solvent.
] [
If applicable, insert brief statement summarizing the proposed classes of participants and beneficiaries whose benefits will be partially or wholly transferred if the application is granted, and a summary of the factors considered.
] If instead the Plan is allowed to become insolvent, the benefits of
all
participants and beneficiaries whose benefits exceed the PBGC-guaranteed amount would be reduced to the PBGC-guaranteed amount.

# What is PBGC's multiemployer plan guarantee?
Federal law sets the maximum that PBGC may guarantee. For multiemployer plan benefits, PBGC guarantees a monthly benefit payment equal to 100 percent of the first $11 of the Plan's monthly benefit accrual rate, plus 75 percent of the next $33 of the accrual rate, times each year of credited service. The PBGC's maximum guarantee, therefore, is $35.75 per month times a participant's years of credited service.
PBGC guarantees vested pension benefits payable at normal retirement age, early retirement benefits, and certain survivor benefits, if the participant met the eligibility requirements for a benefit before plan termination or insolvency. A benefit or benefit increase that has been in effect for less than 60 months is not eligible for PBGC's guarantee. PBGC also does not guarantee benefits above the normal retirement benefit, disability benefits not in pay status, or non-pension benefits, such as health insurance, life insurance, death benefits, vacation pay, or severance pay.

# How will I know when PBGC has made a decision on the application for partition?
If PBGC approves the Board of Trustees' application for partition, PBGC will issue a notice to affected participants and beneficiaries whose benefits will be transferred to the successor plan no later than 14 days after it issues the order of partition. You may also visit
www.pbgc.gov/MPRA
for a list of applications for partition received by PBGC and the status of those applications.

# Your Rights To Receive Information About Your Plan and its Benefits
Your plan's Summary Plan Description (“SPD”) will include information on the procedures for claiming benefits, which will apply to both the original and successor plans until the Plan provides you a new SPD. You also have the legal right to request documents from the original plan to help you understand the partition and your rights such as:
• The plan document, trust agreement, and other documents governing the Plan (e.g., collective bargaining agreements);
• The latest SPD and summaries of material modification;
• The Plan's Form 5500 annual reports, including audited financial statements, filed with the U.S. Department of Labor during the last six years;
• The Plan's annual funding notices for the last six years;
• Actuarial reports (including reports submitted in support of the application for partition) furnished to the Plan within the last six years;
• The Plan's current rehabilitation plan, including contribution schedules; and
• Any quarterly, semi-annual or annual financial reports prepared for the Plan by an investment manager, fiduciary or other advisor and furnished to the Plan within the last six years.
If your benefits are transferred to the successor plan, you will be furnished a successor plan SPD within 120 days of the partition; and the plan document, trust agreement, and other documents governing the successor plan will be available for review following the partition.
The plan administrator must respond to your request for these documents within 30 days, and may charge you the cost per page for the least expensive means of reproducing documents, but cannot charge more than 25 cents per page. The Plan's Form 5500 annual reports are also available free of charge at
http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/5500main.html.
Some of the documents also may be available for examination, without charge, at the plan administrator's office, your worksite, or union hall.

PBGC guarantees benefits up to a legal limit.

Therefore, partition will

further change the total amount payable to any participant or beneficiary.

# What are the rules for partition?
Federal law permits, but does not require, PBGC to approve an application for partition. PBGC generally will make a decision on the application for partition within 270 days. A plan is eligible for partition if certain requirements are met, including:

2. PBGC determines, after consulting with the PBGC Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate, that the Board of Trustees has taken (or is taking) all reasonable measures to avoid insolvency, including reducing benefits to the maximum allowed under the law.
3. PBGC determines that: (1) Providing financial assistance in a partition will be significantly less than providing financial assistance in the event the plan becomes insolvent; and (2) partition is necessary for the plan to remain solvent.
4. PBGC certifies to Congress that its ability to meet existing financial assistance obligations to other multiemployer plans (including plans that are insolvent or projected to become insolvent within 10 years) will not be impaired by the partition.
5. The cost of the partition is paid exclusively from PBGC's multiemployer insurance fund.

means transfer and transfer of assets or liabilities as defined in § 4231.2 of this chapter.
§ 4262.3
Eligibility for special financial assistance.
(a)
In general.
Subject to all the provisions of this section, a multiemployer plan is eligible for special financial assistance in any of the following cases:
(1)
Critical and declining status plans.
The plan is in critical and declining status within the meaning of section 305(b)(6) of ERISA for the specified year; or
(2)
Plans with a suspension of benefits.
A suspension of benefits has been approved with respect to the plan under section 305(e)(9) of ERISA as of March 11, 2021; or
(3)
Critical status plans.
The plan:
(i) Is certified to be in critical status within the meaning of section 305(b)(2) of ERISA for a specified year; and
(ii) The percentage calculated under paragraph (c)(2) of this section was less than 40 percent; and
(iii) The ratio of the total number of active participants at the end of the plan year required to be entered on the Form 5500 that was required to be filed for a specified year to the sum of inactive participants (retired or separated participants receiving benefits, other retired or separated participants entitled to future benefits, and deceased participants whose beneficiaries are receiving or are entitled to receive benefits) required to be entered on such Form 5500 was less than 2 to 3; or, the ratio of the total number of active participants at the beginning of the plan year required to be entered on Form 5500 Schedule MB that was required to be filed for a specified year to the sum of inactive participants (retired participants and beneficiaries receiving payment and terminated vested participants) required to be entered on such Form 5500 Schedule MB was less than 2 to 3.
(4)
Insolvent plans.
The plan became insolvent for purposes of section 418E of the Code after December 16, 2014, and has remained insolvent and has not terminated under section 4041A of ERISA as of March 11, 2021.
(b)
Specified year.
For purposes of this section, the term
specified year
means a plan year specified by the plan sponsor beginning in 2020, 2021, or 2022. The specified years for paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section need not be the same.
(c)
Additional rules for critical status plans
—(1)
Elected status.
Election of critical status under section 305(b)(4) of ERISA does not satisfy the requirement for the certification of critical status by the plan's actuary under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.
(2)
Percentage.
The percentage calculated as—
(i) The current value of net assets as of the first day of the plan year that was required to be entered on the Form 5500 Schedule MB that was required to be filed for a specified year; plus
(ii) The current value of withdrawal liability due to be received by the plan on an accrual basis, reflecting a reasonable allowance for amounts considered uncollectible, as of the first day of the plan year for the specified year in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section (if not already included in the current value of net assets in paragraph (c)(2)(i)); divided by
(iii) The current liability attributable to all benefits as of the first day of the plan year required to be entered on the Form 5500 Schedule MB specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
(d)
Actuarial assumptions.
Determinations of eligibility under paragraph (a)(1) or (3) of this section must be made in accordance with the provisions in this paragraph (d).
(1)
Certifications completed before January 1, 2021.
For certifications of plan status completed before January 1, 2021, PBGC will accept assumptions incorporated in the determination of whether a plan is in critical status or critical and declining status as described in section 305(b) of ERISA unless such assumptions are clearly erroneous.
(2)
Certifications completed after December 31, 2020.
For certifications of plan status completed after December 31, 2020, the determination of whether a plan is in critical status or critical and declining status for purposes of eligibility for special financial assistance must be made using the assumptions that the plan used in its most recently completed certification of plan status before January 1, 2021, unless such assumptions (excluding the plan's interest rate assumption) are unreasonable.
(3)
Changes in assumptions.
If a plan determines that use of the assumptions under paragraph (d)(2) of this section is unreasonable, the plan's application may include a proposed change in the assumptions (excluding the plan's interest rate assumption), as described in § 4262.5.
§ 4262.4
Amount of special financial assistance.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Plans other than MPRA plans.
Subject to paragraph (f) of this section and to the adjustment for the date of payment as described in § 4262.12, the amount of special financial assistance for a plan that is not a MPRA plan is the lowest whole dollar amount (not less than $0) for which, as of the last day of each plan year during the SFA coverage period, projected SFA assets and projected non-SFA assets are both greater than or equal to zero.
(2)
MPRA plans.
Subject to paragraph (f) of this section and to the adjustment for the date of payment as described in § 4262.12, the amount of special financial assistance for a MPRA plan is the greatest of the amount determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the amount determined under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, and the amount determined under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
(i) The amount determined under this paragraph (a)(2)(i) is the lowest whole dollar amount (not less than $0) for which, as of the last day of each plan year during the SFA coverage period, projected SFA assets and projected non-SFA assets are both greater than or equal to zero, and, as of the last day of the SFA coverage period, the sum of projected SFA assets and projected non-SFA assets is greater than the amount of such sum as of the last day of the immediately preceding plan year.
(ii) The amount determined under this paragraph (a)(2)(ii) is the present value of benefits paid and expected to be paid by the plan during the SFA coverage period attributable to the reinstatement of benefits under § 4262.15(a)(1), payment of previously suspended benefits under § 4262.15(a)(2), and any restoration of benefits under 26 CFR 1.432(e)(9)-1(e)(3), calculated using the SFA interest rate under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(3)
MPRA plan definition.
For purposes of this section,
MPRA plan
means a plan that is eligible for special financial assistance under § 4262.3(a)(2).
(b)
Projected SFA assets.
The amount of projected SFA assets for a plan is determined by projecting special financial assistance forward annually until the projected SFA assets are exhausted, using the following annual cash flows:
(1) Benefits paid and expected to be paid by the plan during the SFA coverage period, including any reinstatement of benefits attributable to the elimination of reductions in a participant's or beneficiary's benefit due to a suspension of benefits under sections 305(e)(9) or 4245(a) of ERISA as required under § 4262.15(a)(1), payment of previously suspended benefits under § 4262.15(a)(2), and any restoration of benefits under 26 CFR 1.432(e)(9)-1(e)(3), assuming such reinstated benefits are paid beginning as of the SFA measurement date and excluding any benefit increases resulting from contribution increases agreed to on or after July 9, 2021, as demonstrated by the execution of a document described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section;
(2) Administrative expenses paid and expected to be paid by the plan during the SFA coverage period, excluding the amount owed to PBGC under section 4261 of ERISA (which is added to the amount of special financial assistance in § 4262.12 determined as of the date special financial assistance is paid); and
(3) Investment returns expected to be earned by amounts attributable to special financial assistance calculated using the SFA interest rate described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, excluding investment returns for the plan year in which the sum of annual projected benefit payments and administrative expenses for the year exceeds the beginning-of-year projected SFA assets.
(c)
Projected non-SFA assets.
The amount of projected non-SFA assets for a plan is determined by projecting the fair market value of plan assets on the SFA measurement date forward annually, using the following annual cash flows:
(1) Benefits paid and expected to be paid by the plan during the SFA coverage period after the projected SFA assets described in paragraph (b) of this section are fully exhausted, including any reinstatement of benefits attributable to the elimination of reductions
in a participant's or beneficiary's benefit due to a suspension of benefits under sections 305(e)(9) or 4245(a) of ERISA as required under § 4262.15(a)(1), payment of previously suspended benefits under § 4262.15(a)(2), and any restoration of benefits under 26 CFR 1.432(e)(9)-1(e)(3), assuming such reinstated benefits are paid beginning as of the SFA measurement date and excluding any benefit increases resulting from contribution increases agreed to on or after July 9, 2021, as demonstrated by the execution of a document described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section;
(2) Administrative expenses paid and expected to be paid by the plan during the SFA coverage period after the projected SFA assets described in paragraph (b) of this section are fully exhausted, excluding the amount owed to PBGC under section 4261 of ERISA (which is added to the amount of special financial assistance in § 4262.12 determined as of the date special financial assistance is paid);
(3) Employer contributions paid and expected to be paid to the plan during the SFA coverage period, excluding contribution rate increases agreed to on or after July 9, 2021, as demonstrated by the execution of a document increasing a plan's contribution rate. The document referred to in this paragraph (c)(3) is either—
(i) A collective bargaining agreement not rejected by the plan; or
(ii) A document reallocating contribution rates;
(4) Withdrawal liability payments made and expected to be made to the plan during the SFA coverage period taking into account a reasonable allowance for amounts considered uncollectible;
(5) Other payments made and expected to be made to the plan (excluding the amount of financial assistance under section 4261 of ERISA and special financial assistance to be received by the plan) during the SFA coverage period; and
(6) Investment returns expected to be earned by assets not attributable to special financial assistance calculated using the non-SFA interest rate described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(d)
Deterministic basis.
The projections in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section must be performed on a deterministic basis using assumptions as described in paragraph (e) of this section. For a plan other than a plan described in § 4262.4(g), the projections must be based on the participant census data used to prepare the plan's actuarial valuation report, either—
(1) For the plan year in which occurs the plan's SFA measurement date; or
(2) If there is no such report for that plan year, for the preceding plan year.
(e)
Actuarial assumptions.
The amount of special financial assistance must be determined in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and practices and the provisions in this paragraph (e).
(1) The non-SFA interest rate is the lesser of the rate in paragraph (e)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
(i) The interest rate in this paragraph (e)(1)(i) is the interest rate used for funding standard account purposes as projected in the plan's most recently completed certification of plan status before January 1, 2021.
(ii) The interest rate in this paragraph (e)(1)(ii) is the interest rate that is 200 basis points higher than the rate specified in section 303(h)(2)(C)(iii) of ERISA (disregarding modifications made under section 303(h)(2)(C)(iv)) for the month in which such rate is the lowest among the 4 calendar months ending with the month in which the plan's initial application for special financial assistance is filed, taking into account only rates that have been issued by the IRS as of the day that is the day before the date the plan's initial application is filed.
(2) The SFA interest rate is the lesser of the rate in paragraph (e)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section.
(i) The interest rate in this paragraph (e)(2)(i) is the interest rate in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.
(ii) The interest rate in this paragraph (e)(2)(ii) is the interest rate that is 67 basis points higher than the average of the rates specified in section 303(h)(2)(C)(i), (ii), and (iii) of ERISA (disregarding modifications made under section 303(h)(2)(C)(iv)) for the month in which such average is the lowest among the 4 calendar months
ending with the month in which the plan's initial application for special financial assistance is filed, taking into account only rates that have been issued by the IRS as of the day that is the day before the date the plan's initial application is filed.
(3) The actuarial assumptions (other than the interest rate assumptions under paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section) are those used for the plan's most recently completed certification of plan status before January 1, 2021, unless such assumptions are unreasonable.
(4) If a plan determines that use of the actuarial assumptions under paragraph (e)(3) of this section is unreasonable, the plan's application may include a proposed change in the assumptions (excluding the interest rate assumptions under paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section), as described in § 4262.5.
(f)
Certain events
—(1)
General rules.
(i) The special financial assistance of a plan that experiences one or more of the events described in paragraph (f)(2), (3), or (4) of this section during the period beginning on July 9, 2021, and ending on the SFA measurement date is limited to the amount of special financial assistance that would have applied to the plan on the SFA measurement date if the events had not occurred, as determined in a reasonable manner.
(ii) The special financial assistance of a plan that experiences a merger event during the period described in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section is limited to the sum of the amounts of special financial assistance that would have applied to the plans involved in the merger on the SFA measurement date if the merger had not occurred, as determined in a reasonable manner. If any of the plans involved in the merger also experiences one or more of the events described in paragraph (f)(2), (3), or (4) of this section during the period described in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, the amount of special financial assistance for that plan on the SFA measurement date, determined as if the merger had not occurred, must be determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section.
(2)
Transfers.
The event described in this paragraph (f)(2) is a transfer of assets or liabilities (including a spinoff).
(3)
Benefit increases.
The event described in this paragraph (f)(3) is the execution of a plan amendment increasing accrued or projected benefits under a plan, other than a restoration of suspended benefits that satisfies the requirements of 26 CFR 1.432(e)(9)-1(e)(3).
(4)
Contribution reductions.
The event described in this paragraph (f)(4) is the execution of a document reducing a plan's contribution rate (including any reduction in benefit accruals adopted simultaneously or arising from a pre-existing linkage between benefit accruals and contributions), but only if the plan does not demonstrate (in accordance with the special financial assistance instructions on PBGC's website at
www.pbgc.gov
) that the risk of loss to participants and beneficiaries is reduced (disregarding special financial assistance) by execution of the document. The document referred to in this paragraph (f)(4) is either—
(i) A collective bargaining agreement not rejected by the plan; or
(ii) A document reallocating contribution rates.
(5)
Effect of pre-event ineligibility.
In determining the amount of special financial assistance that would have applied to a plan if an event described in this paragraph (f) had not occurred, if the plan would have been ineligible for special financial assistance under § 4262.3 in the absence of the event, then the amount of special financial assistance is deemed to be $0 (zero).
(6)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section.
(i)
Example 1.
Plan A applies for special financial assistance. If the limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section did not apply, Plan A would be entitled to special financial assistance in the amount of $20X. Before the SFA measurement date, but on or after July 9, 2021, Plan A transferred a portion of its assets and liabilities to Plan B. If the transfer had not occurred, Plan A would, as of the SFA measurement date, be entitled to special financial assistance in the amount of $40X. Although an event described in paragraph
(f)(2) of this section occurred with respect to Plan A, Plan A's special financial assistance is unaffected by the limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section and is $20X. Plan B also applies for special financial assistance. If the limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section did not apply, Plan B would be entitled to special financial assistance in the amount of $30X. If the transfer from Plan A had not occurred, Plan B would, as of the SFA measurement date, be ineligible for special financial assistance. As a result of the event described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section reduces Plan B's special financial assistance from $30X to $0.
(ii)
Example 2.
Plan C applies for special financial assistance. If the limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section did not apply, Plan C would be entitled to special financial assistance in the amount of $40X. Before the SFA measurement date, but on or after July 9, 2021, Plans A and B were merged into existing Plan C. If the mergers had not occurred, Plan A would not be eligible for special financial assistance, and Plan B and Plan C would be entitled, respectively, to $10X and $5X of special financial assistance as of the SFA measurement date. As a result of the merger event described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, the limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section reduces Plan C's special financial assistance from $40X to $15X.
(iii)
Example 3.
Plan A applies for special financial assistance. If the limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section did not apply, Plan A would be entitled to special financial assistance in the amount of $10X. Before the SFA measurement date, but on or after July 9, 2021, projected benefits under Plan A were increased. If the increase had not occurred, Plan A would, as of the SFA measurement date, be ineligible for special financial assistance. As a result of the event described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, applying the limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section and in accordance with paragraph (f)(5) of this section, Plan A is treated as being entitled to special financial assistance of $0.
(iv)
Example 4.
Plan A applies for special financial assistance. If the limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section did not apply, Plan A would be entitled to special financial assistance in the amount of $10X. Before the SFA measurement date, but on or after July 9, 2021, Plan A's contribution rate was reduced. Plan A's benefit formula states that the monthly benefit accrual for a participant for a plan year is 2.0 percent of the contributions paid on behalf of the participant for that plan year. Since there is a pre-existing linkage between benefit accruals and contributions, the event described in paragraph (f)(4) of this section includes both the reduction in benefit accruals and the reduction in the contribution rate. If the contribution rate reduction and the reduction in benefit accruals had not occurred, Plan A would, as of the SFA measurement date, be entitled to special financial assistance of $8X. Plan A does not provide a demonstration that the risk of loss to participants and beneficiaries is reduced (disregarding special financial assistance) due to the reduction in contribution rate and the reduction in benefit accruals. As a result of the events described in paragraph (f)(4) of this section, the limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section reduces Plan A's special financial assistance from $10X to $8X.
(g)
Filers under the interim provisions of this part.
If a plan's application for special financial assistance under the terms of this part as in effect before August 8, 2022 was filed before that date, the plan may choose to proceed in accordance with paragraph (g)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section (whichever applies).
(1)

(ii) Not supplement the plan's application.
(2)
Pending application.
If the plan's application for special financial assistance was not approved, withdrawn, or
denied, and was pending, as of August 8, 2022, the plan may—
(i) Withdraw the plan's application in accordance with § 4262.11(d) and file a revised application as described in paragraph (g)(5) of this section; or
(ii) Not withdraw the plan's application and have the application reviewed under the terms of this part as in effect before August 8, 2022 as described in paragraph (g)(7) of this section.
(3)

(4)
Denied application.
If the plan's application for special financial assistance was not pending as of August 8, 2022, because the application was denied, the plan may file a revised application as described in paragraph (g)(5) of this section. Any revised application must address the reasons cited by PBGC for the denial.
(5)
Revised application.
Any revised application for special financial assistance filed by a plan under this paragraph (g) is processed in the same way as an initial application, and must demonstrate eligibility and the amount of the plan's special financial assistance determined under the provisions of this part as in effect on August 8, 2022, subject to adjustment as described in § 4262.12(a), and use the following base data:
(i) The plan's SFA measurement date determined as the last day of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the date the plan's initial application for special financial assistance was filed;
(ii) The plan's participant census data determined under this part as in effect before August 8, 2022; and

§ 4262.5
PBGC review of plan assumptions.
(a)
In general.
(1) As set forth in § 4262.3(d)(1), PBGC will accept the assumptions used by a plan to determine eligibility for special financial assistance under § 4262.3(d)(1) unless PBGC determines that such assumptions are clearly erroneous.
(2) PBGC will accept the assumptions used by a plan to determine eligibility for special financial assistance under § 4262.3(d)(2) or to determine the amount of special financial assistance under § 4262.4(e)(3) unless PBGC determines that an assumption is unreasonable.
(3) PBGC will accept a plan's changes in assumptions under paragraph (c) of this section except to the extent that PBGC determines that an assumption is individually unreasonable, or the proposed changed assumptions are unreasonable in the aggregate.
(b)
Reasonableness of assumptions.
(1) Each of the actuarial assumptions and methods used for the actuarial projections (excluding the interest rate assumptions under § 4262.4(e)(1) and (2)) must be reasonable in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and practices, taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations. The actuary's selection of assumptions about future covered employment and contribution levels (including contribution base units and contribution rates) may be based on information provided by the plan sponsor, which must act in good faith in providing the information.
(2) If a plan has a change in assumptions under paragraph (c) of this section, each of the actuarial assumptions and methods (other than the interest rate assumptions under § 4262.4(e)(1) and (2)) must be reasonable and the combination of those actuarial assumptions and methods (excluding the interest rate assumptions under § 4262.4(e)(1) and (2)) must also be reasonable.
(c)
Changes in assumptions.
If a plan determines that use of an assumption described in § 4262.3(d)(2) or § 4262.4(e)(3) is unreasonable, the plan's application may include a proposed change in the assumptions (excluding the plan's interest rate assumptions under § 4262.4(e)(1) and (2)).
(1) The application for special financial assistance must—
(i) Describe why the original assumption is no longer reasonable;
(ii) Propose to use a different assumption (the changed assumption); and
(iii) Demonstrate that the changed assumption is reasonable.
(2) PBGC will provide guidelines for changed assumptions on PBGC's website at
www.pbgc.gov.

(ii) An assumption is unreasonable, a proposed change in assumption is individually unreasonable, or the proposed changed assumptions are unreasonable in the aggregate, and notify the plan sponsor of the reasons for the determination; or
(iii) The plan is not an eligible multiemployer plan, and notify the plan sponsor of the reasons the plan fails to be eligible for special financial assistance; or
(3) Fail to act on the application, in which case the application is deemed approved, and notify the plan sponsor of the payment of special financial assistance in accordance with § 4262.12.
(b)

Except where otherwise provided by statutes or regulations, PBGC will charge interest and other amounts permitted on an overdue debt in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (31 CFR parts 900 through 999). The date from which interest is computed is not extended by litigation or the filing of any form of appeal.

The prohibition in the preceding sentence does not apply to a good faith allocation of:
(i) Contributions pursuant to a reciprocity agreement;
(ii) Costs of securing shared space, goods, or services, where such allocation does not constitute a prohibited transaction under ERISA or is exempt from such prohibited transaction provisions pursuant to section 408(b)(2) or 408(c)(2) of ERISA, or pursuant to a specific prohibited transaction exemption issued by the Department of Labor under section 408(a) of ERISA;
(iii) The actual cost of services provided to the plan by an unrelated third party; or
(iv) Contributions where the contributions to a plan that receives special financial assistance required for each base unit are not reduced, except as otherwise permitted by paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Request for exception.
No earlier than 5 years after the end of the plan year in which the plan receives payment of special financial assistance under § 4262.12, the plan sponsor may request approval from PBGC for an exception from the conditions under paragraph (e) of this section by demonstrating to the satisfaction of PBGC that, taking into account the value of any proposed reallocation of contributions, the plan will avoid insolvency, that the reallocation is needed due to a significant increase in health benefit costs due to a change in Federal law which goes into effect after March 11, 2021, that the reallocation is no more than a 10 percent reduction in the amount of the contribution rate negotiated on or before March 11, 2021, that is allocable to the pension plan, and that the reallocation relating to any change in Federal law is for no more than 5 years. A continuation of the reallocation of contributions relating to any change in Federal law after the initial reallocation beyond 5 years must satisfy the requirement for a contribution decrease under paragraph (d) of this section. A subsequent change in Federal law causing a significant increase in health benefit costs is a separate event for purposes of applying this exception, except that a plan may reallocate contributions under this exception from the conditions under paragraph (e) of this section for no more than 10 years cumulatively for all reallocation requests during the SFA coverage period. A request for PBGC approval of a proposed reallocation of contributions must be submitted by the plan sponsor or its duly authorized representative and must contain all of the following identifying, actuarial, and financial information:
(i) Name, address, email, and telephone number of the plan sponsor and the plan sponsor's authorized representatives, if any.
(ii) The nine-digit employer identification number (EIN) assigned to the plan sponsor by the IRS and the three-digit plan identification number (PN) assigned to the plan by the plan sponsor, and, if different, the EIN and PN last filed with PBGC. If an EIN or PN
has not been assigned, that should be indicated.
(iii) A certification by the enrolled actuary that the plan or any of its component parts received special financial assistance and the most recent value of special financial assistance assets.
(iv) The EIN assigned to the plan sponsor by the IRS and the PN assigned to the plan by the plan sponsor of the plan that applied for special financial assistance, if not the same as the EIN and PN in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section.
(v) A copy of the proposed reallocation of contributions amendment.
(vi) Most recent plan document or restatement of the plan document and all subsequent amendments adopted (if any).
(vii) A copy of the most recent actuarial valuation performed for the plan before the date of the plan's submission of a request for approval under this paragraph (e)(2), and the actuarial valuation performed for each of the 2 plan years immediately preceding the most recent actuarial valuation.
(viii) A copy of the plan actuary's most recent certification under section 305(b)(3) of ERISA, including a detailed description of the assumptions used in the certification, and the basis under which they were determined. The description must include information about the assumptions used for the projection of future contributions, withdrawal liability payments, and investment returns, and any other assumption that may have a material effect on projections.
(ix) A statement certified by an enrolled actuary of the effect of the proposed reallocation of contributions on the plan's existing contributions, and a demonstration that the expected contributions equal or exceed the estimated amount necessary, taking into account the proposed reallocation of contributions, to satisfy the minimum funding requirement of section 431 of the Code.
(x) A detailed statement certified by an enrolled actuary that the plan is projected to avoid insolvency, taking into account the value of the proposed reallocation of contributions. The statement must include the basis for the conclusion, supporting data, calculations, assumptions, a description of the methodology, the basis for assumptions used, and the present value of the proposed reallocation of contributions.
(xi) The statement in paragraph (e)(2)(x) of this section must include an exhibit showing the annual cash flow projection for the plan for 30 years beginning on or after the proposed adoption date of the amendment. The cash flow projection should use an open group valuation. Annual cash flow projections must reflect the following information:
(A) Fair market value of assets as of the beginning of the year, splitting the assets by special financial assistance and non-special financial assistance amounts.
(B) Contributions and withdrawal liability payments expected to be made to the plan taking into account a reasonable allowance for amounts considered uncollectible.
(C) Plan level benefit payments organized by participant type (
e.g.,
active, retiree, terminated vested) for the projection period.
(D) Administrative expenses for the projection period.
(E) Assumed investment return separately for special financial assistance and non-special financial assistance amounts.
(F) Fair market value of assets as of the end of the year.
(xii) The present value of accrued benefits.
(xiii) A demonstration that the reallocation is needed due to a significant increase in health benefit costs due to a change in Federal law, that the reallocation is no more than a 10 percent reduction in the amount of the contribution rate negotiated on or before March 11, 2021, going to the pension plan, and that the reallocation is for no more than 5 years for a reallocation request relating to any single change in Federal law and no more than 10 years cumulatively for all reallocation requests during the plan's SFA coverage period.
(xiv) Any additional information PBGC determines it needs to review a request for approval of a proposed amendment, including any adjustments
to assumptions required by PBGC in its review of whether the plan is projected to avoid insolvency.
(f)
Transfer or merger.
During the SFA coverage period, a plan must not engage in a transfer of assets or liabilities (including a spinoff) or merger except with PBGC's approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in 29 CFR part 4231, the plans involved in the transaction must request approval from PBGC.
(1)
In general.
PBGC will approve a proposed transfer of assets or liabilities (including a spinoff) or merger if PBGC determines that the transaction complies with section 4231(a)-(d) of ERISA and that the transaction, or the larger transaction of which the transfer or merger is a part, does not unreasonably increase PBGC's risk of loss with respect to any plan involved in the transaction, and is not reasonably expected to be adverse to the overall interests of the participants and beneficiaries of any of the plans involved in the transaction.
(2)
Request for approval.
A request for approval of a proposed transfer of assets or liabilities (including a spinoff) or merger must be submitted by the plan sponsor or its duly authorized representative and must contain the information that must be submitted with a notice of merger or transfer and a request for a compliance determination under subpart A of part 4231 of this chapter and all of the following information for each of the plans involved in the transaction:
(i) A certification by the enrolled actuary that the plan or any of its component parts received special financial assistance and the most recent value of special financial assistance assets.
(ii) A copy of the actuarial valuation performed for each of the 2 plan years before the most recent actuarial valuation filed in accordance with § 4231.9(f) of this chapter.
(iii) A copy of the plan actuary's most recent certification under section 305(b)(3) of ERISA, including a detailed description of the assumptions used in the certification, and the basis under which they were determined. The description must include information about the assumptions used for the projection of future contributions, withdrawal liability payments, and investment returns, and any other assumption that may have a material effect on projections.
(iv) A detailed narrative description demonstrating that the transaction does not unreasonably increase PBGC's risk of loss with respect to any plan involved in the transaction. The narrative must be supported by a detailed determination certified by the enrolled actuary of the present value of financial assistance under section 4261 of ERISA which is calculated using the guaranteed benefits and administrative expenses presented in the cash flow projections under paragraph (f)(2)(v) of this section, discounted using interest rates published under section 4044 of ERISA. The certification must include supporting data, calculations, assumptions, a description of the methodology, the basis for assumptions used, and the projected date of insolvency.
(v) The statement in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section must include an exhibit showing the annual cash flow projections for each plan before and after the transaction, through the year that each plan pays its last dollar of benefit (but not to exceed 100 years). The cash flow projection should use an open group valuation until the plan reaches insolvency. Annual cash flow projections must reflect the following information:
(A) Fair market value of assets as of the beginning of the year, splitting the assets by special financial assistance and non-special financial assistance amounts.
(B) Contributions and withdrawal liability payments taking into account a reasonable allowance for amounts considered uncollectible.
(C) Plan level benefit payments organized by participant type (
e.g.,
active, retiree, terminated vested) for the projection period.
(D) Guaranteed benefits payable post insolvency by participant type (
e.g.,
active, retiree, terminated vested).
(E) Administrative expenses for the projection period.
(F) Assumed investment return separately for special financial assistance and non-special financial assistance amounts.
(G) Fair market value of assets as of the end of the year.
(vi) If the plan requests that PBGC approve that a waiver of the conditions in paragraph (b)(1) of this section (retrospective benefits), paragraph (d) of this section (contribution decreases), and the condition in paragraph (e) of this section relating to allocating contributions and other income applies to the merged plan, a demonstration that the requirements for a waiver in paragraph (f)(4) of this section are met.
(vii) A detailed narrative description with supporting documentation demonstrating that the transaction is not reasonably expected to be adverse to the overall interests of the participants and beneficiaries of any of the plans involved in the transaction. The narrative description and supporting documentation must consider the projected month and year of plan insolvency for each of the plans before and after the transaction.
(viii) Any additional information PBGC determines it needs to review a request for approval of a proposed transfer of assets or liabilities (including a spinoff) or merger.
(3)
Application of conditions with respect to an approved transfer or merger.
If PBGC approves a transfer of assets and liabilities (that is not a merger) from a plan that receives special financial assistance to another plan (the transferee plan) under this paragraph (f), the restrictions and conditions that apply to the plan that receives special financial assistance will also apply to the transferee plan as determined by PBGC as a condition of the approval. If PBGC approves a merger under this paragraph (f), the restrictions and conditions that apply to a plan that receives special financial assistance will apply after the merger as follows:
(i) The restrictions in §§ 4262.13(b) and 4262.14 and the conditions in this paragraph (f) (transfer or merger), paragraph (h) of this section (withdrawal liability settlement), paragraph (i) of this section (annual compliance statement), and paragraph (j) of this section (audit) apply to the merged plan.
(ii) The conditions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section (prospective benefit increase), paragraph (c) of this section (allocation of plan assets), and paragraph (e) of this section relating to allocating expenses do not apply to the merged plan.
(iii) In the absence of a waiver described in paragraph (f)(4) of this section, the condition in paragraph (b)(1) of this section (retrospective benefit increase) continues to apply to participants in the plan that received special financial assistance before the merger, the condition in paragraph (d) of this section (contribution decreases) continues to apply to employers who had an obligation to contribute to the plan that received special financial assistance before the merger, and the condition in paragraph (e) of this section relating to allocating contributions and other income continues to apply to contributions or income relative to the plan that received special financial assistance before the date of the merger.
(iv) For the condition described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section (withdrawal liability interest assumption), the merged plan must use the interest assumptions under § 4044.54 of this chapter to determine the unfunded vested benefits that arose under the plan that received special financial assistance before the date of the merger for purposes of allocating unfunded vested benefits under subpart D of part 4211 of this chapter and determining withdrawal liability for employers that participated in that plan.
(v) For the condition described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section (withdrawal liability amount of special financial assistance required to be phased in), the merged plan must apply the special financial assistance phase-in condition to determine the unfunded vested benefits that arose under the plan that received special financial assistance before the date of the merger for purposes of allocating unfunded vested benefits under subpart D of part 4211 of this chapter and determining withdrawal liability for employers that participated in that plan.
(4)
Waiver of conditions with respect to an approved merger.
A plan may request a waiver of the condition in paragraph (b)(1) of this section (retrospective benefit increase), paragraph (d) of this section (contribution decreases), and the
condition in paragraph (e) of this section relating to allocating contributions and other income for the merged plan in the plan's request for PBGC's approval of a merger pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section. If any of the plans involved in the merger engage in multiple transactions in any 1-year period, the transactions will be considered in the aggregate. The plan's application must demonstrate the following requirements for a waiver—
(i) The total current value of assets of the plans that received special financial assistance before the merger must be 25 percent or less of the total current value of assets of the merged plan, calculated using the current value of assets most recently required before the merger to be entered by the plans on the Form 5500 Schedule MB.
(ii) The total current liability of the plans that received special financial assistance before the merger must be 25 percent or less of the total current liability of the merged plan, calculated using the current liability most recently required before the merger to be entered by the plans on the Form 5500 Schedule MB.
(iii) In the most recent certification of plan status for any plan that did not receive special financial assistance before the merger, the plan actuary must have certified that the plan is not in endangered or critical status (including critical and declining status) and is not projected to be in critical status within 5 years from the date of the plan's request for approval, and the plan must not be described in section 432(b)(5) of the Code.
(g)
Withdrawal liability determination
—(1)
Interest assumptions.
A plan must use the interest assumptions under § 4044.54 of this chapter in determining the unfunded vested benefits of the plan under section 4213(c) of ERISA (for the purpose of determining withdrawal liability), and in determining the amortization schedule under section 4219(c)(1)(A) of ERISA, beginning with the first plan year in which the plan receives payment of special financial assistance under § 4262.12 and until the later of—
(i) The end of the tenth plan year after the first plan year in which the plan receives payment of special financial assistance under § 4262.12; or
(ii) The end of the plan year described in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section (if the special financial assistance most recently paid to the plan as of the end of that plan year is calculated under this part as in effect before August 8, 2022); otherwise the end of the plan year described in paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section.
(iii) The plan year described in this paragraph (g)(1)(iii) is the plan year by which the plan is projected to exhaust any SFA assets as determined under the methodology of § 4262.4(b), applying the interest rate under § 4262.4(e)(2) to the special financial assistance as determined as of the SFA measurement date as determined under this part as in effect before August 8, 2022. However, if the first plan year in which the plan receives payment of special financial assistance is after the plan year that includes the plan's SFA measurement date, the plan year by which the plan is projected to exhaust any SFA assets is deferred by the number of years by which the first plan year in which the plan receives payment is after the plan year that includes the plan's SFA measurement date.
(iv) The end of the plan year by which, according to the plan's projection, the plan is projected to exhaust any SFA assets, as determined under § 4262.4(b). However, if the first plan year in which the plan receives payment of special financial assistance is after the plan year that includes the plan's SFA measurement date, the plan year by which the plan is projected to exhaust any SFA assets is deferred by the number of years by which the first plan year in which the plan receives payment of special financial assistance is after the plan year that includes the plan's SFA measurement date.
(2)
Phase-in of SFA
—(i)
In general.
In determining unfunded vested benefits under section 4213(c) of ERISA (for the purpose of determining withdrawal liability), the procedures in this paragraph (g)(2) must be followed.
(ii)
Phase-in period.
The procedures in this paragraph (g)(2) apply to the determination of unfunded vested benefits as of the end of any determination year
that is not earlier than the payment year or later than the exhaustion year.
(iii)
Determination year.
For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2), the determination year is the plan year as of the end of which unfunded vested benefits are being valued.
(iv)
Payment year.
For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2), the payment year is the first plan year in which the plan receives special financial assistance.
(v)
Determination of exhaustion year.
For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2), if the special financial assistance most recently paid to the plan as of the last day of the determination year is calculated under this part as amended effective August 8, 2022, then the exhaustion year is the plan year described in paragraph (g)(2)(vi) of this section; otherwise, the exhaustion year is the plan year described in paragraph (g)(2)(vii) of this section.
(vi)
Exhaustion year.
The plan year described in this paragraph (g)(2)(vi) is the plan year by which, according to the plan's projection, the plan is projected to exhaust any SFA assets, as determined under § 4262.4(b). However, if the first plan year in which the plan receives payment of SFA is after the plan year that includes the plan's SFA measurement date, the exhaustion year is deferred by the number of years by which the payment year is after the plan year that includes the plan's SFA measurement date.
(vii)
Exhaustion year before any SFA paid under this part.
The plan year described in this paragraph (g)(2)(vii) is the plan year by which the plan is projected to exhaust any SFA assets, determined under the methodology of § 4262.4(b), applying the interest rate under § 4262.4(e)(2) to the special financial assistance as determined as of the SFA measurement date as determined under this part as in effect before August 8, 2022. However, if the first plan year in which the plan receives payment of SFA is after the plan year that includes the plan's SFA measurement date, the exhaustion year is deferred by the number of years by which the payment year is after the plan year that includes the plan's SFA measurement date.
(viii)
SFA assets excluded.
The value of the plan assets taken into account as of the end of each determination year is the value of the assets that would otherwise be taken into account in the absence of this provision reduced by the amount described in paragraph (g)(2)(ix) of this section. The value of plan assets determined under this paragraph (g)(2)(viii) may not be less than zero.
(ix)
Calculation of SFA assets excluded
—(A)
In general.
Except for plans required to pay make-up payments described in § 4262.15(b), the amount described in this paragraph (g)(2)(ix)(A) is, as of the end of the determination year—
(
1
) The total amount of special financial assistance paid to the plan under § 4262.12 (as determined under § 4262.12(a) or (b), or under § 4262.12(b) and (c) for plans paid under a supplemented application, as applicable), minus the amount paid to PBGC under § 4262.12(e), as of the end of the determination year;
(
2
) Multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years determined under paragraph (g)(2)(x) of this section as of the end of the determination year and the denominator of which is the number of years determined under paragraph (g)(2)(xi) of this section as of the end of the determination year.
(B)
Plans required to pay make-up payments.
For plans required to pay make-up payments described in § 4262.15(b), the amount described in this paragraph (g)(2)(ix)(B) is, as of the end of the determination year—
(
1
) The total amount of special financial assistance paid to the plan under § 4262.12 (as determined under § 4262.12(a) or (b), or under § 4262.12(b) and (c) for plans paid under a supplemented application, as applicable), minus the amount paid to PBGC under § 4262.12(e), and minus the amount of make-up payments paid by the plan to participants and beneficiaries under § 4262.15(b) whether the payments are made from SFA assets or non-SFA assets, as of the end of the determination year;
(
2
) Multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years determined under paragraph (g)(2)(x) of this section as of the end of
the determination year and the denominator of which is the number of years determined under paragraph (g)(2)(xi) of this section as of the end of the determination year.
(x)
Numerator.
The number of years determined under this paragraph (g)(2)(x) is the number of plan years in the period beginning with the determination year and ending with the exhaustion year.
(xi)
Denominator.
The number of years determined under this paragraph (g)(2)(xi) is the number of plan years in the period beginning with the payment year and ending with the exhaustion year.
(xii)
Plan year.
For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2), any reference to a plan year means a complete plan year.
(xiii)
No receivable.
Special financial assistance assets must be excluded from the determination of unfunded vested benefits until the date that special financial assistance is paid to the plan under § 4262.12, and no receivable shall be set up as of any earlier date in anticipation of the plan receiving such payment.
(xiv)
Reporting.
For any withdrawal liability assessed during the phase-in period, the amount described under paragraph (g)(2)(ix) of this section must be reported in the plan's annual statement of compliance (as required under paragraph (i) of this section) for the plan year in which the liability is assessed.
(xv)
Applicability.
This paragraph (g)(2) applies to a plan in determining withdrawal liability for withdrawals occurring after the plan year in which the plan receives payment of special financial assistance under this part. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, for a plan that received special financial assistance under this part in effect before August 8, 2022, this paragraph (g)(2) will not apply unless the plan files a supplemented application under this part. If the plan files a supplemented application, this paragraph (g)(2) applies to the plan in determining withdrawal liability for withdrawals occurring on or after the date the plan files the supplemented application.
(xvi)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
(A)
Example 1.
Plan A, a calendar-year plan, filed an application for special financial assistance under this part with an SFA measurement date in plan year 2023 and received a special financial assistance payment of $1,000,000 in 2024. In the plan's application, Plan A is projected to exhaust its special financial assistance assets during plan year 2028. Accordingly, the payment year is 2024 and the exhaustion year is 2029 (the projected SFA exhaustion year in the application plus 1 year for the difference between the plan year that includes the SFA measurement date and the payment year). Employer P withdraws from Plan A in 2028. For Employer P: {1} the determination year is 2027; {2} the numerator of the phase-in fraction is 3 (2027 to 2029); {3} the denominator of the phase-in fraction is 6 (2024 to 2029); and {4} the phased in amount is $500,000 ($1,000,000 ×
3/6
). If total assets (assuming no phased recognition of SFA) are $100,000,000, unfunded vested benefits are based on assets of $99,500,000.
(B)
Example 2.
Plan B, a calendar-year plan, filed an application for special financial assistance under the terms of the interim provisions of this part with an SFA measurement date in plan year 2022 and received a special financial assistance payment of $1,000,000 in 2022. According to the methodology under paragraph (g)(2) of this section and the information submitted in the plan's application under the interim provisions of this part, Plan B is projected to exhaust its special financial assistance assets during plan year 2028. However, Plan B files a supplemented application under this part in 2023 and receives an additional special financial assistance payment of $100,000 in 2024. In Plan B's supplemented application, the plan is projected to exhaust its special financial assistance assets during plan year 2030. Employer R withdraws from Plan B in 2024, which is after Plan B filed a supplemented application. For Employer R: {1} the payment year is 2022; {2} the determination year is 2023; {3} the exhaustion year is 2028; {4} the numerator of the phase-in fraction is 6 (2023 to 2028); {5} the denominator of
the phase-in fraction is 7 (2022 to 2028); and {6} the phased in amount is $857,143 ($1,000,000 ×
6/7
). If total assets (assuming no phased recognition of SFA) are $100,000,000, unfunded vested benefits are based on assets of $99,142,857. Employer S withdraws from Plan B in 2028. For Employer S: {1} the payment year is 2022; {2} the determination year is 2027; {3} the exhaustion year is 2030; {4} the numerator of the phase-in fraction is 4 (2027 to 2030); {5} the denominator of the phase-in fraction is 9 (2022 to 2030); and {6} the phased in amount is $488,889 ($1,100,000 ×
4/9
). If total assets (assuming no phased recognition of SFA) are $100,000,000, unfunded vested benefits are based on assets of $99,511,111. If, instead of withdrawing in 2024, Employer R withdrew from Plan B in 2023 before Plan B filed its supplemented application, the phase-in condition would not apply and unfunded vested benefits would be based on total assets of $100,000,000.
(C)
Example 3.
Plan C, a calendar-year plan, filed an application for special financial assistance under this part with an SFA measurement date in plan year 2024 and received a special financial assistance payment of $1,000,000 in 2025. According to the plan's application, Plan C is projected to exhaust its SFA assets during plan year 2024. Accordingly, the payment year is 2025 and the exhaustion year is 2025 (the projected SFA exhaustion year in the application plus 1 year for the difference between the plan year that includes the SFA measurement date and the payment year). Employer T withdraws from Plan C in 2026. For Employer T: {1} the determination year is 2025; {2} the numerator of the phase-in fraction is 1 (2025 to 2025); {3} the denominator of the phase-in fraction is 1 (2025 to 2025); and {4} the phased in amount is $1,000,000 ($1,000,000 ×
1/1
). If total assets (assuming no phased recognition of SFA) are $100,000,000, unfunded vested benefits are based on assets of $99,000,000.
(D)
Example 4.
In plan year 2022, Plan D received an SFA payment amount of $50,000,000 (not including the amount paid to PBGC for repayment of traditional financial assistance) and a supplemented SFA payment amount of $30,000,000. A total of $20,000,000 in lump-sum make-up payments were paid by Plan D in plan year 2022. An employer withdraws in 2023. At the end of the determination year (2022), the amount of SFA required to be excluded from assets equals $60,000,000 ($50,000,000 + $30,000,000—$20,000,000). If, instead, the make-up payments were paid by Plan D in plan year 2023, the amount of SFA required to be excluded from assets at the end of the determination year (2022) would equal $80,000,000. Under this scenario, Plan D's unfunded vested benefit liability would be the same at the end of the determination year because the additional $20,000,000 of SFA required to be excluded from assets offsets the $20,000,000 in SFA that the plan still holds for make-up payments but has not yet distributed as of the end of the determination year. Similarly, if the employer withdraws in 2024, the make-up payments were paid in 2023, and the phase-in fraction was 9/10th for 2023, the amount of SFA excluded from the assets at the end of the determination year (2023) would be $54,000,000 (9/10th × $60,000,000), where the $60,000,000 is calculated as the total $80,000,000 in SFA paid to the plan minus the $20,000,000 in make-up payments that were disbursed prior to the end of the determination year.
(3)
Request for exception.
The plan sponsor of a plan eligible for special financial assistance may request approval from PBGC for an exception from the conditions under paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section by demonstrating to the satisfaction of PBGC that the exception lessens the risk of loss to plan participants and beneficiaries and does not increase expected employer withdrawals. The plan sponsor must also demonstrate to the satisfaction of PBGC that the exception does not increase the amount of the plan's special financial assistance or unreasonably increase PBGC's risk of loss. A request for PBGC approval of an exception must be submitted by the plan sponsor, or its duly authorized representative, either before an initial application or before a revised application for special financial assistance is filed by the plan, and must contain all of the following identifying, actuarial, and financial information:
(i) Name, address, email, and telephone number of the plan sponsor and the plan sponsor's authorized representatives, if any.
(ii) The nine-digit employer identification number (EIN) assigned to the plan sponsor by the IRS and the three-digit plan identification number (PN) assigned to the plan by the plan sponsor, and, if different, the EIN and PN last filed with PBGC. If an EIN or PN has not been assigned, that should be indicated.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 4281.1
Purpose and scope.
(a)
General
—(1)
Purpose.
When a multiemployer plan terminates by mass withdrawal under section 4041A(a)(2) of ERISA, the plan's assets and benefits must be valued annually under section 4281(b) of ERISA, and plan benefits may have to be reduced or suspended to the extent provided in section 4281 (c) or (d). This part implements the provisions of section 4281 and provides rules for applying for financial assistance from the PBGC under section 4261 of ERISA. The plan valuation rules in this part also apply to the determination of reallocation liability under section 4219(c)(1)(D) of ERISA and subpart B of part 4219 of this chapter for multiemployer plans that undergo mass withdrawal (with or without termination).
(2)
Scope.
This part applies to multiemployer plans covered by title IV of ERISA that have terminated by mass withdrawal under section 4041A(a)(2) of ERISA (including plans created by partition pursuant to section 4233 of ERISA). Subpart B of this part also applies to covered multiemployer plans that have undergone mass withdrawal without terminating.
(b)
Subpart B.
Subpart B establishes rules for determining the value of multiemployer plan benefits and assets, including outstanding claims for withdrawal liability, for plans required to perform annual valuations under section 4281(b) of ERISA or allocate unfunded vested benefits under section 4219(c)(1)(D) of ERISA.
(c)
Subpart C.
Subpart C sets forth procedures under which the plan sponsor of a terminated plan shall amend the plan to reduce benefits subject to reduction in accordance with section 4281(c) of ERISA and § 4041A.24(b) of this chapter. Subpart C applies to a plan for which the annual valuation required by § 4041A.24(a) indicates that the value of nonforfeitable benefits under the plan exceeds the value of the plan's assets (including claims for withdrawal liability) if, at the end of the plan year for which that valuation was done, the plan provided any benefits subject to reduction. Benefit reductions required to be made under subpart C shall not apply to accrued benefits under plans or plan amendments adopted on or before March 26, 1980, or under collective bargaining agreements entered into on or before March 26, 1980.
(d)
Subpart D.
Subpart D sets forth the procedures under which the plan sponsor of an insolvent plan must suspend benefit payments and issue insolvency notices in accordance with section 4281(d) of ERISA and § 4041A.25 (c) and (d) of this chapter. Subpart D applies to a plan that has been amended under section 4281(c) of ERISA and subpart C of this part to eliminate all benefits subject to reduction and to a plan that provided no benefits subject to reduction as of the date on which the plan terminated.

[61 FR 34118, July 1, 1996, as amended at 84 FR 18725, May 2, 2019]
§ 4281.12
Benefits to be valued.
(a)
Form of benefit.
The plan sponsor shall determine the form of each benefit to be valued, without regard to the form of benefit valued in any prior year, in accordance with the following rules:
(1) If a benefit is in pay status as of the valuation date, the plan sponsor shall value the form of benefit being paid.
(2) If a benefit is not in pay status as of the valuation date but a valid election with respect to the form of benefit has been made on or before the valuation date, the plan sponsor shall value the form of benefit so elected.
(3) If a benefit is not in pay status as of the valuation date and no valid election with respect to the form of benefit has been made on or before the valuation date, the plan sponsor shall value the form of benefit that, under the terms of the plan or applicable law, is payable in the absence of a valid election.
(b)
Timing of benefit.
The plan sponsor shall value benefits whose starting date is subject to election—
(1) By assuming that the starting date of each benefit is the earliest date, not preceding the valuation date, that could be elected; or
(2) By using any other assumption that the plan sponsor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the PBGC is more reasonable under the circumstances.
§ 4281.13
Benefit valuation methods—in general.
Except as otherwise provided in § 4281.16 (regarding plans that are closing out), the plan sponsor must value benefits as of the valuation date by—

[61 FR 34118, July 1, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 38307, July 16, 1998; 84 FR 18726, May 2, 2019; 89 FR 48309, June 6, 2024]
§§ 4281.14-4281.15
[Reserved]
§ 4281.16
Benefit valuation methods—plans closing out.
(a)
Applicability.
For purposes of the annual valuation required by section 4281(b) of ERISA, the plan sponsor shall value the plan's benefits in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section if,—
(1)
Plans closed out before valuation.
Before the time when the valuation is performed, the plan has satisfied in full all liabilities for payment of nonforfeitable benefits, in a manner consistent with the terms of the plan and applicable law, by the purchase of one or more nonparticipating irrevocable commitments from one or more insurers, with respect to all benefits payable as annuities, and by the payment of single-sum cash distributions, with respect to benefits not payable as annuities; or
(2)
Plans to be closed out after valuation.
As of the time when the valuation is performed, the plan sponsor reasonably expects that the plan will close out before the next annual valuation date and the plan sponsor has a currently exercisable bid or bids to provide the irrevocable commitment(s) described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the total cost of the irrevocable commitment(s) under the bid, plus the total amount of the single-sum cash distributions described in paragraph (a)(1), does not exceed the value of the plan's assets, exclusive of outstanding claims for withdrawal liability, as determined under this subpart.
(b)
Valuation rule.
The present value of nonforfeitable benefits under this section is the total amount of single-sum cash distributions made or to be made plus the cost of the irrevocable commitment(s) purchased or to be purchased in order to satisfy in full all liabilities of the plan for nonforfeitable benefits.
§ 4281.17
Asset valuation methods—in general.
(a)
General rule.
The plan sponsor shall value plan assets as of the valuation date, using the valuation methods prescribed by this section and § 4281.18 (regarding outstanding claims for withdrawal liability), and deducting administrative liabilities in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Assets other than withdrawal liability claims.
The plan sponsor shall value any plan asset (other than an outstanding claim for withdrawal liability) by such method or methods as the plan sponsor reasonably believes most accurately determine fair market value.
(c)
Adjustment for administrative liabilities.
In determining the total value of plan assets, the plan sponsor shall subtract all plan liabilities, other than liabilities to pay benefits. For this purpose, any obligation to repay financial assistance received from the PBGC under section 4261 of ERISA is a plan liability other than a liability to pay benefits. The obligation to repay financial assistance shall be valued by determining the value of the scheduled payments in the same manner as prescribed in § 4281.18(a) for valuing claims for withdrawal liability.
§ 4281.18
Outstanding claims for withdrawal liability.
(a)
Value of claim.
The plan sponsor shall value an outstanding claim for withdrawal liability owed by an employer described in paragraph (b) of this section in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section:
(1) If the schedule of withdrawal liability payments provides for one or more series of equal payments, the plan sponsor shall value each series of payments as an annuity certain in accordance with the provisions of § 4281.13.
(2) If the schedule of withdrawal liability payments provides for one or
more payments that are not part of a series of equal payments as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the plan sponsor shall value each such unequal payment as a lump-sum payment in accordance with the provisions of § 4281.13.
(b)
Employers neither liquidated nor in insolvency proceedings.
The plan sponsor shall value an outstanding claim for withdrawal liability under paragraph (a) of this section if, as of the valuation date—
(1) The employer has not been completely liquidated or dissolved; and
(2) The employer is not the subject of any case or proceeding under title 11, United States Code, or any case or proceeding under similar provisions of state insolvency laws; except that the claim for withdrawal liability of an employer that is the subject of a proceeding described in this paragraph (b)(2) shall be valued under paragraph (a) of this section if the plan sponsor determines that the employer is reasonably expected to be able to pay its withdrawal liability in full and on time.
(c)
Claims against other employers.
The plan sponsor shall value at zero any outstanding claim for withdrawal liability owed by an employer that does not meet the conditions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

# Subpart C—Benefit Reductions
§ 4281.31
Plan amendment.
The plan sponsor of a plan described in § 4281.31 shall amend the plan to eliminate those benefits subject to reduction in excess of the value of benefits that can be provided by plan assets. Such reductions shall be effected by a pro rata reduction of all benefits subject to reduction or by elimination or pro rata reduction of any category of benefit. Benefit reductions required by this section shall apply only prospectively. An amendment required under this section shall take effect no later than six months after the end of the plan year for which it is determined that the value of nonforfeitable benefits exceeds the value of the plan's assets.

§ 4281.42
Retroactive payments.
(a)
Erroneous resource benefit level.
If, by the end of a year in which benefits were suspended under § 4281.41, the plan sponsor determines in writing that the plan's available resources in that year could have supported benefit payments above the resource benefit level determined for that year, the plan sponsor may distribute the excess resources to each affected participant and beneficiary who received benefit payments that year on a pro rata basis. The amount distributed to each participant under this paragraph may not exceed the amount that, when added to benefit payments already made, brings the total benefit for the plan year up to the total benefit provided under the plan.
(b)
Benefits paid below resource benefit level.
If, by the end of a plan year in which benefits were suspended under § 4281.41, any benefit has not been paid at the resource benefit level, amounts up to the resource benefit level that were unpaid shall be distributed to each affected participant and beneficiary on a pro rata basis to the extent possible, taking into account the plan's total available resources in that year.
§ 4281.43
Notice of insolvency.
(a)
Requirement of notice.
The plan sponsor of a plan that determines that the plan is insolvent in the current plan year or is expected to be insolvent in the next plan year must file with PBGC a notice of insolvency containing the information described in § 4281.44(a) and issue to plan participants and beneficiaries a notice of insolvency containing the information described in § 4281.44(b).

A notice of insolvency may be combined with a notice of insolvency benefit level under § 4281.45 for the same plan year.
(b)
When to provide notice.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the plan sponsor must file or issue the notices of insolvency under paragraph (a) of this section by the later of—

Disclosure of other information.
(a)
In general.
Upon the request of any person submitted in accordance with subpart B of this part, the Disclosure Officer will make any document (or portion thereof) from the records of PBGC in the custody of any official of PBGC available for inspection unless PBGC reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption under the provisions of section 552(b) of FOIA and subpart C of this part or disclosure is otherwise prohibited by law. The procedures in subpart B of this part must be used for records that are not made available in PBGC's electronic reading room under § 4901.4 and may be used for records that are available in the electronic reading room. Records are not records of PBGC and are not required to be furnished under FOIA, if they could only be produced by manipulation of existing information (such as computer analyses of existing data), thus creating information not previously in existence.
(b)
Discretionary disclosure.
Unless prohibited from disclosure by § 4901.21(a), the Disclosure Officer may make any document (or portion thereof) from the records of PBGC available for inspection if the Disclosure Officer determines that disclosure furthers the public interest and does not impede the discharge of any of the functions of PBGC.

# Subpart B—Procedure for Formal Requests
§ 4901.11
Submission of requests for access to records.
(a)
In general.
A request to inspect any record subject to this subpart must be submitted in writing to the Disclosure Officer, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, by mail, in-person delivery, or electronic telecommunication in accordance with the FOIA instructions on PBGC's website,
www.pbgc.gov.
To facilitate processing, “FOIA request” should appear prominently on the request.
(b)
Assistance with requests.
A person who intends to submit or has submitted a request to inspect any record subject to this subpart may at any time seek assistance from a FOIA Public Liaison listed on PBGC's website,
www.pbgc.gov.
PBGC's FOIA Public Liaisons are responsible for assisting in reducing delays, increasing transparency and understanding of the status of requests, and assisting in the resolution of disputes.
[87 FR 43995, July 25, 2022]
§ 4901.12
Description of information requested.
(a)
In general.
Each disclosure request should reasonably describe the record or records sought in sufficient detail to permit identification and location with a reasonable amount of effort. So far as practicable, the request should specify the subject matter of the record, the place where and date or approximate date when made, the person or office that made it, and any other pertinent identifying details.
(b)
Deficient descriptions.
(1) If the description is insufficient to enable a professional employee familiar with the subject area of the disclosure request to locate the record with a reasonable amount of effort, the Disclosure Officer will notify the requester and, to the extent possible, indicate the additional information required. PBGC will make every reasonable effort to assist a requester in the identification and location of the record or records sought. PBGC will not withhold records merely because of difficulty in finding them.
(2) A requester who is attempting to modify or reformulate a disclosure request may discuss the request with a FOIA Public Liaison, who is available to assist the requester in reasonably describing the records sought. If the requester fails to reasonably describe the records sought, PBGC's response to the request may be delayed or denied.
(3) Any amended disclosure request must meet the requirements for a request under paragraph (a) of this section.
(c)
Requests for categories of records.
Disclosure requests calling for all records falling within a reasonably specific category will be regarded as reasonably described within the meaning of this section and section 552(a)(3) of FOIA if PBGC is reasonably able to determine which records come within the request and to search for and collect them without unduly interfering with PBGC operations. If PBGC operations would be unduly disrupted, the Disclosure Officer will promptly notify the requester and provide an opportunity to confer in an attempt to reduce the request to manageable proportions.
[61 FR 34123, July 1, 1996, as amended at 87 FR 43995, July 25, 2022]
§ 4901.13
Receipt by agency of request.
The Disclosure Officer will note the date and time of receipt on each disclosure request for access to records. A disclosure request is deemed received and the period within which PBGC acts on the request, as set forth in § 4901.14, begins on the next working day following receipt, except that a disclosure request is deemed received only if and when PBGC receives all of the following:
(a) A sufficient description under § 4901.12;
(b) Payment or assurance of payment if required under § 4901.33(b); and
(c) The requester's consent to pay substantial search, review, and/or duplication charges under subpart D of this part if PBGC determines that such charges may be substantial and so notifies the requester. Consent must be in the form of a statement that charges under subpart D of this part will be acceptable either in any amount or up to a specified amount. To avoid possible delay, a requester may include such a statement in an initial disclosure request.
[87 FR 43995, July 25, 2022]
§ 4901.14
Action on request.
(a)
Time for action.
Promptly and in any event within 20 working days after receipt of a disclosure request (subject to extension under § 4901.16), the Disclosure Officer will take action with respect to each requested item (or portion of an item) under either paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section. Following receipt, PBGC may ask the requester for information once and toll the 20-day period until PBGC receives such information.
(b)
Request granted.
If the Disclosure Officer determines that the disclosure request will be granted, PBGC will so advise the requester and will promptly make the records available to the requester. PBGC will accommodate any specification of the preferred form or format for the sought record as stated in the request, if the record is readily reproducible in the preferred form or format.
(c)
Request denied.
If the Disclosure Officer determines that the disclosure request will be denied, PBGC will so advise the requester in writing with a brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including, if applicable, a reference to the specific exemption(s) authorizing the denial and an explanation of how each such exemption applies to the matter withheld.
(d)
Records not located.
If the Disclosure Officer determines that, despite a reasonably calculated search to uncover all relevant documents, the requested records could not be located, PBGC will issue a “no-records” response, and so advise the requester in writing.
(e)
Information for requester.
Written responses issued under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section will include the name and title of the person(s) responsible for the denial, outline the appeal procedure available, and notify the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from a PBGC FOIA Public Liaison or the Office of Government Information Services.
[87 FR 43995, July 25, 2022]
§ 4901.15
Appeals from denial of requests.
(a)
Submittal of appeals.
A requester may appeal any adverse determination by the Disclosure Officer of a request under FOIA, including a denial of a request for access to records, expedited action, or fee waiver. The requester may file a written appeal within 90 days from the date of the denial or, in the case of a partial denial, 90 days from the date the requester receives the disclosed material. The appeal must include the grounds for appeal and any supporting statements or arguments. The requester must address the appeal to the General Counsel, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and must submit the appeal by mail, in-person delivery, or electronic telecommunication in accordance with the FOIA instructions on PBGC's website,
www.pbgc.gov.
To facilitate processing, the words “FOIA appeal” should appear prominently on the appeal.
(b)
Receipt and consideration of appeal.
The General Counsel will note the date and time of receipt on each appeal and notify the requester thereof. Within 20 working days after receipt of an appeal (subject to extension under § 4901.16), the General Counsel will issue a decision on the appeal.
(1) The General Counsel will determine de novo whether the denial of disclosure was in accordance with FOIA and this part.
(2) Unless otherwise ordered by the court, the General Counsel may act on an appeal notwithstanding the pendency of an action for judicial relief in the same matter and, if no appeal has been filed, may treat the pending action as the filing of an appeal.
(c)
Decision on appeal.
As to each item (or portion of an item) whose nondisclosure is appealed, the General Counsel will either—
(1) Grant the appeal and so advise the requester in writing, in which case the records with respect to which the appeal is granted will promptly be made available to the requester; or
(2) Deny the appeal and so advise the requester in writing with a brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including a reference to the specific exemption(s) authorizing the denial, an explanation of how each such exemption applies to the matter withheld, and notice of the provisions for judicial review in section 552(a)(4) of FOIA. The General Counsel's decision will be the final action of PBGC with respect to the request.
(d)
Records of appeals.
Copies of both grants and denials of appeals will be collected in one file available in PBGC's electronic reading room under § 4901.4(d)(1) and indexed under § 4901.4(e).
[61 FR 34123, July 1, 1996, as amended at 68 FR 61358, Oct. 28, 2003; 82 FR 26992, June 13, 2017; 87 FR 43996, July 25, 2022]
§ 4901.16
Extensions of time.
In unusual circumstances (as described in section 552(a)(6)(B) of FOIA), the time to respond to a disclosure request under § 4901.14(a) or an appeal under § 4901.15(b) may be extended as reasonably necessary to process the request or appeal. The Disclosure Officer will notify the requester in writing within the original time period of the unusual circumstances and the date when a response is expected to be sent. When the extension for a disclosure request exceeds 10 working days, the notice will provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the disclosure request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. This notice will also alert the requester of the availability of a PBGC FOIA Public Liaison for assistance and the Office of Government Information Services for dispute resolution services. The maximum extension for responding to an appeal is 10 working days minus the amount of any extension on the request to which the appeal relates.
[87 FR 43996, July 25, 2022]
§ 4901.17
Expedited action on requests and appeals.
(a)
In general.
Upon a request submitted in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, PBGC will expedite a disclosure request under § 4901.11 or an appeal under § 4901.15 if PBGC determines that the requester has demonstrated one of the following:
(1) The disclosure request or appeal involves circumstances in which the lack of expedited action could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual or the loss of an individual's substantial due process rights.
(2) The requester is primarily engaged in disseminating information and the disclosure request or appeal is urgently needed to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity.
(b)
Timing and method of request.
A request for PBGC to expedite a disclosure request or an appeal may be made at any time and must be made by mail, in-person delivery, or electronic telecommunication in accordance with the FOIA instructions on PBGC's website,
www.pbgc.gov.
(c)
Action on request.
(1) PBGC will notify the requester within 10 calendar days of receipt of a request for expedited action whether PBGC will expedite a disclosure request or an appeal.
(2)
Request granted.
If PBGC determines that the request for expedited action will be granted, PBGC will take action on the disclosure request or the appeal as soon as practicable.
(3)
Request denied.
If PBGC determines that the request for expedited action will be denied, PBGC will so advise the requester in writing with a brief statement of the reasons for the denial. The writing will also include the name and title or position of the person(s) responsible for the denial, outline the appeal procedure available, and notify the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from a
PBGC FOIA Public Liaison or the Office of Government Information Services. PBGC will act on any appeal of that decision expeditiously.
[87 FR 43996, July 25, 2022]
§ 4901.18
Exhaustion of administrative remedies.
If the Disclosure Officer fails to make a determination to grant or deny access to requested records, or the General Counsel does not make a decision on appeal from a denial of access to PBGC records, within the time prescribed (including any extension) for making such determination or decision, the requester's administrative remedies will be deemed exhausted and the requester may apply for judicial relief under FOIA. However, since a court may allow PBGC additional time to act as provided in FOIA, processing of the disclosure request or appeal will continue and PBGC will so advise the requester.
[87 FR 43997, July 25, 2022]

# Subpart C—Restrictions on Disclosure
§ 4901.21
Restrictions in general.

Unless prohibited from disclosure by paragraph (a) of this section, PBGC need not but may, as provided in § 4901.5(b), disclose records exempted from FOIA, which include as of August 24, 2022 records under:
(1) Section 552(b)(2) of FOIA, dealing in general with internal agency personnel rules and practices;
(2) Section 552(b)(4) of FOIA, dealing in general with trade secrets and commercial and financial information;
(3) Section 552(b)(5) of FOIA, dealing in general with inter-agency and intra-agency memoranda and letters;
(4) Section 552(b)(6) of FOIA, dealing in general with personnel, medical, and similar files;
(5) Section 552(b)(7) of FOIA, dealing in general with records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes;

[87 FR 43997, July 25, 2022]
§ 4901.22
Partial disclosure.
If an otherwise disclosable record contains some material that is protected from disclosure, the record will not for that reason be withheld from disclosure if deletion of the protected material is feasible. This principle will be applied in particular to identifying details the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
[61 FR 34123, July 1, 1996, as amended at 87 FR 43997, July 25, 2022]
§ 4901.23
Record of concern to agency other than PBGC.
When reviewing a record in response to a disclosure request, PBGC will determine whether another agency is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under FOIA. As to any such record, PBGC will proceed in one of the following ways:
(a)
Consultation with another agency.
When the record contains information of interest to another agency, PBGC will make a release determination only if its interest in the record is the primary interest and only after PBGC consults with that agency.
(b)
Referral to another agency.
(1) When an agency other than PBGC has primary interest in the record, then PBGC will refer the responsibility for responding to the disclosure request regarding that record to that agency.
(2) Whenever PBGC refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a disclosure request to another agency, PBGC will document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral, informing the requester of the name(s) of the agency to which the record was referred, including that agency's FOIA office.
[87 FR 43997, July 25, 2022]
§ 4901.24
Special rules for trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information submitted to PBGC.
(a)
Application.
To the extent permitted by law, this section applies to a request for disclosure of a record that contains information that has been designated by the submitter in good faith in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section or a record that PBGC has reason to believe contains such information, unless one of the following applies:
(1) Access to the information is denied.
(2) The information has been published or officially made available to the public.
(3) Disclosure of the information is required by law other than FOIA.
(4) The designation under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous, except that in such a case PBGC will notify the submitter in writing of a determination to disclose the information within a reasonable time before the disclosure date (which shall be specified in the notice).
(b)
Designation by submitter.
To designate information as being subject to this section, the submitter must, at the time of submission or by a reasonable time thereafter, assert that information being submitted is confidential business information and designate, with appropriate markings, the portion(s) of the submission to which the assertion applies. Any designation under this paragraph (b) will expire 10 years after the date of submission unless a longer designation period is requested and reasonable justification is provided.
(c)
Notification to submitter of disclosure request.
When disclosure of information subject to this section may be made, the Disclosure Officer or (where disclosure may be made in response to an appeal) the General Counsel will promptly notify the submitter, describing (or providing a copy of) the information that may be disclosed, and afford the submitter a reasonable period of time to object in writing to the requested disclosure. (The notification to the submitter may be oral or written; if oral, it will be confirmed in writing.) When a submitter is notified under this paragraph (c), the requester will be notified that the submitter is being afforded an opportunity to object to disclosure.
(d)
Objection of submitter.
A submitter's statement objecting to disclosure must specify all grounds relied upon for opposing disclosure of any portion(s) of the information under section 552(b) of FOIA and, with respect to the exemption in section 552(b)(4), demonstrate why the information is a trade secret or is commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. Facts asserted must be certified or otherwise supported. (Information provided pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under FOIA.) Any timely objection of a submitter under this paragraph (d) will be carefully considered in determining whether to grant a disclosure request or appeal.
(e)
Notification to submitter of decision to disclose.
If the Disclosure Officer or (where disclosure is in response to an appeal) the General Counsel decides to disclose information subject to this section despite the submitter's objections, the Disclosure Officer (or General Counsel) will give the submitter written notice, explaining briefly why the information is to be disclosed despite those objections, describing the information to be disclosed, and specifying the date when the information will be disclosed to the requester. The notification will, to the extent permitted by law, be provided a reasonable number of days before the disclosure date so specified, and a copy will be provided to the requester.
(f)
Notification to submitter of action to compel disclosure.
The Disclosure Officer or the General Counsel will promptly notify the submitter if a requester brings suit seeking to compel disclosure.
[61 FR 34123, July 1, 1996, as amended at 87 FR 43997, July 25, 2022]

# Subpart D—Fees
§ 4901.31
Charges for services.
(a)
In general.
Pursuant to the provisions of section 552 of FOIA, as amended, PBGC will assess charges to cover
the direct costs of searching for, reviewing, and/or duplicating records requested under FOIA, except where the charges are limited or waived under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, according to the fee schedule in § 4901.32. No charge will be assessed if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, no charge for searching (or in the case of a requester described under section 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of FOIA, for duplication) will be assessed if PBGC has failed to comply with any time limit under section 552(a)(6) of FOIA.
(1)
Direct costs
means those expenditures which PBGC actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a disclosure request under FOIA and this part. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space, and heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored.
(2)
Search
means all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a disclosure request under FOIA and this part, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of materials within a document, if required. Searches may be done manually or by computer using existing programming. Search is distinguishable from “review” which is defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(3)
Review
means the process of examining documents located in response to a disclosure request under FOIA and this part to determine whether any portion of any document located is permitted or required to be withheld. It also includes processing any documents for disclosure,
e.g.,
doing all that is necessary to redact them and otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.
(4)
Duplication
means the process of making a copy of a document necessary to respond to a disclosure request under FOIA and this part, in a form that is reasonably usable by the requester. Copies can take the form of paper copy, audio-visual materials, or electronic records, among others.
(b)
Categories of requesters.
For purposes of assessing fees, requesters who seek access to records under FOIA and this part are divided into three categories: commercial use requesters, non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters, and all other requesters. PBGC will determine the category of a requester and charge fees according to the following rules.
(1)
Commercial use requesters.
(i) When records are requested for commercial use, PBGC will assess charges, as provided in this subpart, for the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought. Fees for search and review may be charged even if the record searched for is not found or if, after it is found, it is determined that the request to inspect it may be denied under section 552(b) of FOIA and this part.
(ii) A “commercial use” request is a request that asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. PBGC's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis dependent upon on the requester's intended use of the information. PBGC will notify requesters of their placement in this category.
(2)
Non-commercial scientific or educational institutions, or news media requesters.
(i) When records are requested by a non-commercial scientific or educational institution or a news media requester, PBGC will assess charges, as provided in this subpart, for the full direct cost of duplication only, excluding charges for the first 100 pages.
(ii) A non-commercial scientific institution is an institution that is not operated for a “commercial use” as that term is defined in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.
(iii) An educational institution is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the request is made in connection with his or her role at the educational institution.
PBGC may seek verification from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research and PBGC will advise requesters of their placement in this category.
(iv)(A) A representative of the news media is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term news means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive. A “freelance” journalist who demonstrates a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity will be considered as a representative of the news media.
(B) To be eligible for inclusion in this category, the request must not be made for a commercial use. A request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester who is a representative of the news media will not be considered to be a request that is for a commercial use.
(3)
All other requesters.
When records are requested by requesters who do not fit into any of the categories in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section, PBGC will assess charges, as provided in this subpart, for the full direct cost of searching for and duplicating the records sought, with the exceptions that there will be no charge for the first 100 pages of duplication and the first 2 hours of search time. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, there will be no charge for search time in the event of requests under the Privacy Act of 1974 from subjects of records filed in PBGC's systems of records for the disclosure of records about themselves. Search fees, where applicable, may be charged even if the record sought is not found.
(c)
Aggregation of requests.
If PBGC reasonably believes that a requester or group of requesters is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, PBGC will aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly. In no case will PBGC aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects from one requester.
(d)
Waiver or reduction of charges.
Circumstances under which any fee listed in § 4901.32 may be waived or reduced are set forth in § 4901.34.
(e)
Unusual or exceptional circumstances.
Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if PBGC fails to comply with a time limit under section 552(a)(6) of FOIA, PBGC may nevertheless assess a charge for search and review services (or in the case of a requester described under section 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II), for duplication) if one of the following circumstances applies:
(1) PBGC has determined that unusual circumstances (as defined in section 552(a)(6)(B) of FOIA) apply, PBGC needs more than 10 additional days to process the disclosure request, and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, provided that:
(i) PBGC has provided timely written notice of this determination to the requester; and
(ii) PBGC has discussed with the requester, or made three or more good-faith attempts to do so, via written mail, electronic mail, or telephone how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request.
(2) PBGC has determined that unusual circumstances (as defined in section 552(a)(6)(B) of FOIA) apply, PBGC has provided timely written notice to the requester of the unusual circumstances extending the time limit by 10 additional days, and PBGC processes the disclosure request within that time.
(3) A court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist (as defined in section 552(a)(6)(C) of FOIA) and has issued an order excusing PBGC's failure to comply with the time limit.
[61 FR 34123, July 1, 1996, as amended at 82 FR 26992, June 13, 2017; 87 FR 43997, July 25, 2022]
§ 4901.32
Fee schedule.
(a)
Charges for searching and review of records.
Charges applicable under this subpart to the search for and review of records will be made according to the following fee schedule:
(1)
Search time and review time.
For ordinary search services and review services, PBGC charges $54.00 per hour. PBGC charges fees in quarter hour increments.
(2)
Retrieving records stored by NARA.
For disclosure requests that require the retrieval of records stored at a Federal records center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), PBGC charges additional costs in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.
(b)
Charges for duplication of records.
Charges applicable under this subpart for obtaining requested copies of records made available for inspection will be made according to the following fee schedule and subject to the following conditions.
(1)
Standard copying fee.
$0.15 for each page of record copies furnished.
(2)
Voluminous material.
If the volume of page copy desired by the requester is such that the reproduction charge at the standard page rate would be in excess of $50, the person desiring reproduction may request a special rate quotation from PBGC.
(3)
Indexes.
Pursuant to section 552(a)(2) of FOIA copies of indexes or supplements thereto which are maintained as therein provided but which have not been published will be provided on request at a cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication.
(c)
Other charges.
The scheduled fees, set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, for furnishing records made available for inspection and duplication represent the direct costs of furnishing the copies at the place of duplication. Upon request, single copies of the records will be mailed, postage prepaid, free of charge. Actual costs of transmitting records by special methods such as registered, certified, or special delivery mail or messenger, and of special handling or packaging, if required, will be charged in addition to the scheduled fees.
[61 FR 34123, July 1, 1996, as amended at 87 FR 43999, July 25, 2022]
§ 4901.33
Payment of fees.
(a)
Medium of payment.
Payment of the applicable fees as provided in this section must be made by check, money order, or other PBGC permitted method, and in accordance with the FOIA instructions on PBGC's website,
www.pbgc.gov.
(b)
Advance payment or assurance of payment.
Payment or assurance of payment before work is begun or continued on a disclosure request may be required as follows:
(1) Where PBGC estimates or determines that charges allowable under the rules in this subpart, are likely to exceed $250, PBGC may require advance payment of the entire fee or assurance of payment, as follows:
(i) Where the requester has a history of prompt payment of fees under this part, PBGC will notify the requester of the likely cost and obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment; or
(ii) Where the requester has no history of payment for requests made pursuant to FOIA and this part, PBGC may require the requester to make an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated charges.
(2) Where the requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timely fashion (
i.e.,
within 30 days of the date of the billing), PBGC may require the requester to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest as provided in paragraph (c) of this section (or demonstrate that he has, in fact, paid the fee) and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee.
(c)
Late payment interest charges.
PBGC may assess late payment interest charges on any amounts unpaid by the 31st day after the date a bill is sent to a requester. Interest will be assessed at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date the bill is sent.
[61 FR 34123, July 1, 1996, as amended at 68 FR 61358, Oct. 28, 2003; 87 FR 43999, July 25, 2022]
§ 4901.34
Waiver or reduction of charges.
(a) The Disclosure Officer may waive or reduce fees otherwise applicable under this subpart when disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. A fee waiver or reduction request must set forth full and complete information upon which the request is based.
(b) If the Disclosure Officer determines that the request for fee waiver or reduction will be denied, the requester will be so advised in writing with a brief statement of the reasons for the denial. The writing will include the name and title or position of the person(s) responsible for the denial, outline the appeal procedure available, and notify the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from a PBGC FOIA Public Liaison or the Office of Government Information Services.

§ 4902.4
Disclosure of record to an individual.
(a) When the disclosure officer grants a request for access to records under § 4902.3, such records shall be made available when the requester is advised of the determination or as promptly thereafter as possible. At the requester's option, the record will be made available for the requester's inspection and copying at the PBGC, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. on any working day, or a copy of the record will be mailed to the requester. Current information on where the records may be inspected and copied can be obtained on PBGC's Web site,

Action on request for amendment of a record.
(a) Within 20 working days after receipt by the PBGC of a request for amendment of a record under § 4902.5, unless for good cause shown the Director of the PBGC extends such 20-day period, the disclosure officer shall notify the requester in writing whether and to what extent the request shall be granted. To the extent that the request is granted, the disclosure officer shall cause the requested amendment to be made promptly.
(b) When a request for amendment of a record is denied in whole or in part, the denial shall include a statement of the reasons therefor, the procedures for appealing such denial, and a notice that the requester has a right to assistance in preparing an appeal of the denial.

To the extent that the appeal is granted, the General Counsel or, where appropriate, the Director or Director's designee, shall cause the requested amendment to be made promptly. To the extent that the appeal is denied, the decision shall include the reasons for the denial and a notice of the requester's right to submit a brief statement setting forth reasons for disputing the denial of appeal, to seek judicial review of the denial pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(A), and to obtain further information concerning the provisions for judicial review under that section.
(c) An individual whose appeal has been denied in whole or in part may submit a brief summary statement setting forth reasons for disputing such denial. Such statement shall be submitted within 30 days of receipt of the denial of the appeal to the Disclosure Officer. Any such statement shall be made available by the PBGC to anyone to whom the record is subsequently furnished and may also be accompanied, at the discretion of the PBGC,
by a brief statement summarizing the PBGC's reasons for refusing to amend the record. The PBGC shall also provide copies of the individual's statement of dispute to all prior recipients of the record with respect to whom an accounting of the disclosure of the record was maintained pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(1).

Standard copying fee.
There shall be a charge of $0.15 per page of record copies furnished. Where the copying fee is less than $1.50, it shall not be assessed.

No charge will be made for manual copying by the requester of any document made available for inspection under § 4902.4. The PBGC shall provide facilities for such copying without charge between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. on any working day.
§ 4902.9
Privacy Act provisions for which PBGC claims an exemption.
Subsections 552a(j) and (k) of title 5, U.S.C., authorize PBGC to exempt systems of records meeting certain criteria from various other subsections of section 552a. This section contains a summary of the Privacy Act provisions for which PBGC claims an exemption for the systems of records discussed in this part pursuant to, and to the extent permitted by, subsections 552a(j) and (k):
(a) Subsection (c)(3) of 5 U.S.C. 552a requires an agency to make available to the individual named in the records an accounting of each disclosure of records.
(b) Subsection (c)(4) of 5 U.S.C. 552a requires an agency to inform any person or other agency to which a record has been disclosed of any correction or notation of dispute the agency has made to the record in accordance with subsection (d) of the Privacy Act.
(c) Subsections (d)(1) through (4) of 5 U.S.C. 552a require an agency to permit an individual to gain access to records about the individual, to request amendment of such records, to request a review of an agency decision not to amend such records, and to provide a statement of disagreement about a disputed record to be filed and disclosed with the disputed record.
(d) Subsection (e)(1) of 5 U.S.C. 552a requires an agency to maintain in its records only such information about an individual that is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose required by statute or executive order of the President.
(e) Subsection (e)(2) of 5 U.S.C. 552a requires an agency to collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under federal programs.
(f) Subsection (e)(3) of 5 U.S.C. 552a requires an agency to inform each person whom it asks to supply information of the authority under which the information is sought, whether disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, the principal purpose(s) for which the information will be used, the routine uses that may be made of the information, and the effects of not providing the information.
(g) Subsection (e)(4)(G) and (H) of 5 U.S.C. 552a requires an agency to publish a
Federal Register
notice of its procedures whereby an individual can be notified upon request whether the system of records contains information about the individual, how to gain access to any record about the individual contained in the system, and how to contest its content.
(h) Subsection (e)(5) of 5 U.S.C. 552a requires an agency to maintain its records with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to ensure fairness to the individual in making any determination about the individual.
(i) Subsection (e)(8) of 5 U.S.C. 552a requires an agency to make reasonable efforts to serve notice on an individual when any record on such individual is made available to any person under compulsory legal process when such process becomes a matter of public record.
(j) Subsection (f) of 5 U.S.C. 552a requires an agency to establish procedures whereby an individual can be notified upon request if any system of records named by the individual contains a record pertaining to the individual, obtain access to the record, and request amendment.
(k) Subsection (g) of 5 U.S.C. 552a provides for civil remedies if an agency fails to comply with the access and amendment provisions of subsections (d)(1) and (d)(3), and with other provisions of the Privacy Act, or any rule promulgated thereunder, in such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual.
[74 FR 27082, June 8, 2009]
§ 4902.10
Specific exemption: Personnel Security Investigation Records.
(a)
Exemption.
Under the authority granted by 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), PBGC hereby exempts the system of records entitled “PBGC-12, Personnel Security Investigation Records” from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f), to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to PBGC under an express promise of confidentiality or, before September 27, 1975, under an implied promise of confidentiality.
(b)
Reasons for exemption.
The reasons for asserting this exemption are to insure the gaining of information essential to determining suitability and fitness for PBGC employment or for work for PBGC as a contractor or as an employee of a contractor, access to information, and security clearances, to insure that full and candid disclosures are obtained in making such determinations, to prevent subjects of such determinations from thwarting the completion of such determinations, and to avoid revealing the identities of persons who furnish information to PBGC in confidence.
[74 FR 27082, June 8, 2009, as amended at 89 FR 96532, Dec. 5, 2024]
§ 4902.11
Specific exemptions: Office of Inspector General Investigative File System.
(a)
Criminal Law Enforcement
—(1)
Exemption.
Under the authority granted by 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), PBGC hereby exempts the system of records entitled “PBGC-17, Office of Inspector General Investigative File System” from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (c)(4), (d)(1) through (4), (e)(1) through (3), (e)(4)(G) and (H), (e)(5), (e)(8), (f), and (g) because the system contains information pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws.
(2)
Reasons for exemption.
The reasons for asserting this exemption are:
(i) Disclosure to the individual named in the record pursuant to subsections (c)(3), (c)(4), or (d)(1) through (4) could seriously impede or compromise the investigation by alerting the target(s), subjecting a potential witness or witnesses to intimidation or improper influence, and leading to destruction of evidence.
(ii) Application of subsection (e)(1) is impractical because the relevance of specific information might be established only after considerable analysis and as the investigation progresses. Effective law enforcement requires the Office of Inspector General to keep information that may not be relevant to a specific Office of Inspector General investigation, but which may provide leads for appropriate law enforcement and to establish patterns of activity that might relate to the jurisdiction of the Office of Inspector General and/or other agencies.
(iii) Application of subsection (e)(2) would be counterproductive to performance of a criminal investigation because it would alert the individual to the existence of an investigation.
(iv) Application of subsection (e)(3) could discourage the free flow of information in a criminal law enforcement inquiry.
(v) The requirements of subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) do not apply because this system is exempt from the provisions of subsection (d). Nevertheless, PBGC has published notice of its notification, access, and contest procedures because access is appropriate in some cases.
(vi) Although the Office of Inspector General endeavors to maintain accurate records, application of subsection (e)(5) is impractical because maintaining only those records that are accurate, relevant, timely, and complete and that assure fairness in determination is contrary to established investigative techniques. Information that may initially appear inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete may, when collated and analyzed with other available information, become more pertinent as an investigation progresses.
(vii) Application of subsection (e)(8) could prematurely reveal an ongoing criminal investigation to the subject of the investigation.
(viii) The provisions of subsection (g) do not apply to this system if an exemption otherwise applies.
(b)
Other Law Enforcement
—(1)
Exemption.
Under the authority granted by 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), PBGC hereby exempts the system of records entitled “PBGC-17, Office of Inspector General Investigative File System” from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d)(1) through (4), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) for the same reasons as stated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, that is, because the system contains investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes other than material within the scope of subsection 552a(j)(2).
(2)
Reasons for exemption.
The reasons for asserting this exemption are because the disclosure and other requirements of the Privacy Act could substantially compromise the efficacy and integrity of the Office of Inspector General operations. Disclosure could invade the privacy of other individuals and disclose their identity when they were expressly promised confidentiality. Disclosure could interfere with the integrity of information which would otherwise be subject to privileges (see, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5)), and which could interfere with other important law enforcement concerns (see, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)).
(c)
Federal Civilian or Contract Employment
—(1)
Exemption.
Under the authority granted by 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), PBGC hereby exempts the system of records entitled “PBGC-17, Office of Inspector General Investigative File System” from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d)(1) through (4), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) because the system contains investigatory material compiled for the purpose of determining eligibility or qualifications for federal civilian or contract employment.
(2)
Reason for exemption.
The reason for asserting this exemption is to protect from disclosure the identity of a confidential source when an express promise of confidentiality has been given to obtain information from sources who would otherwise be unwilling to provide necessary information.
[74 FR 27082, June 8, 2009, as amended at 89 FR 96532, Dec. 5, 2024]
§ 4902.12
Specific exemptions: Insider Threat and Data Loss Prevention.
(a)
Exemption.
Under the authority granted by 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), PBGC hereby exempts the system of records entitled “PBGC-26, PBGC Insider Threat and Data Loss Prevention” from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) and (f).
(b)
Reasons for exemption.
The reasons for asserting the exemption in this section are because the disclosure and other requirements of the Privacy Act could substantially compromise the efficacy and integrity of PBGC's ability to investigate insider threat activities and the improper exfiltration of personally identifiable information. Disclosure could invade the privacy of other individuals and disclose their identity when they were expressly promised confidentiality. Disclosure could interfere with the integrity of information which would otherwise be subject to privileges, see,
e.g.,
5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5), and which could interfere
with other important law enforcement concerns, see,
e.g.,
5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7).

§ 4902.13
Specific exemptions: Legal case management.
(a)
Exemption.
Under the authority granted by 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), PBGC hereby exempts the system of records entitled “PBGC-19, Office of Negotiations and Restructuring/Office of General Counsel Case Management System” from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f).
(b)
Reasons for exemption.
The reasons for asserting this exemption are because the disclosure and other requirements of the Privacy Act could substantially compromise the efficacy and integrity of PBGC's ability to investigate administrative, civil, or criminal legal matters. Disclosure could invade the privacy of individuals and disclose their identity when they were expressly promised confidentiality. Disclosure could interfere with the integrity of information which would otherwise be subject to legal privileges, see,
e.g.,
5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5), and which could interfere with other important law enforcement concerns, see,
e.g.,
5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7).

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 4903.1
What definitions apply to this part?
The following terms are defined in § 4001.2 of this chapter: Code, PBGC, and Person. In addition, for purposes of this part:
Administrative offset or offset
means withholding funds payable by the United States (including funds payable by the United States on behalf of a state government) to, or held by the United States for, a person to satisfy a debt owed by the person. The term “administrative offset” can include, but is not limited to, the offset of Federal salary, vendor, retirement, and Social Security benefit payments. The terms “centralized administrative offset” and “centralized offset” refer to the process by which the Treasury Department's Financial Management Service offsets Federal payments through the Treasury Offset Program.
Administrative wage garnishment
means the process by which a Federal agency orders a non-Federal employer to withhold amounts from a debtor's wages to satisfy a debt, as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3720D, 31 CFR 285.11, and this part.
Agency or Federal agency
means an executive department or agency; a military department; the United States Postal Service; the Postal Regulatory Commission; any nonappropriated fund instrumentality described in 5 U.S.C. 2105(c); the United States Senate; the United States House of Representatives; any court, court administrative office, or instrumentality in the judicial or legislative branches of the Government; or a Government corporation.
Creditor agency
means any Federal agency that is owed a debt.
Debt
means any amount of money, funds or property that has been determined by an appropriate official of the Federal Government to be owed to the United States government, including government-owned corporations, by a person. As used in this part, the term “debt” can include a debt owed to PBGC, but does not include debts arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1
et seq.
).
Debtor
means a person who owes a debt to the United States.
Delinquent debt
means a debt that has not been paid by the date specified in the agency's initial written demand for payment or applicable agreement or instrument (including a post-delinquency payment agreement) unless other satisfactory payment arrangements have been made.
Disposable pay
has the same meaning as that term is defined in 5 CFR 550.1103.
Employee
or
Federal employee
means a current employee of PBGC or other Federal agency, including a current member of the uniformed services, including the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service, the National Guard, and the reserve forces of the uniformed services.
FCCS
means the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 31 CFR parts 900-904.
Financial Management Service (FMS)
means the Treasury Department bureau that is responsible for the centralized collection of delinquent debts through the offset of Federal payments and other means.
Payment agency
or
Federal payment agency
means any Federal agency that transmits payment requests in the form of certified payment vouchers, or other similar forms, to a disbursing official for disbursement. The payment
agency may be the agency that employs the debtor. In some cases, PBGC may be both the creditor agency and payment agency.
Salary offset
means a type of administrative offset to collect a debt under Section 5514 of Title 5 of the United States Code and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K by deduction(s) at one or more officially established pay intervals from the current pay account of an employee with or without his or her consent.
Tax debt
means a debt arising under the Code.
Tax refund offset
means the reduction by the IRS of a tax overpayment payable to a taxpayer by the amount of past-due, legally enforceable debt owed by that taxpayer to a Federal agency pursuant to Treasury regulations.
§ 4903.2
What do these regulations cover?
(a)
Scope.
This part provides procedures for the collection of debts owed to PBGC, other than those subject to recoupment (29 CFR 4022, subpart E). This part also provides procedures for collection of other debts owed to the United States when a request for offset of a payment, for which PBGC is the payment agency, is received by PBGC from another agency (for example, when a PBGC employee owes a student loan debt to the United States Department of Education).
(b)
Applicability.
(1) This part applies to PBGC when collecting a debt owed to PBGC; to persons who owe debts to PBGC; to persons controlled by or controlling persons who owe debts to a Federal agency, and to Federal agencies requesting offset of a payment issued by PBGC as a payment agency (including salary payments to PBGC employees).
(2) This part does not apply to debts owed to PBGC being collected through recoupment under subpart E of part 4022 of this chapter. Benefits paid by PBGC generally will not be offset, subject to limited exceptions (e.g., in certain fiduciary breach situations).
(3) This part does not apply to tax debts, to any debt based in whole or in part on conduct in violation of the antitrust laws, nor to any debt for which there is an indication of fraud or misrepresentation, as described in § 900.3 of the FCCS, unless the debt is returned by the Department of Justice to PBGC for handling.
(4) Nothing in this part precludes the use of other statutory or regulatory authority to collect or dispose of any debt.
See,
for example, 5 U.S.C. 5705, Advancements and Deductions, which authorizes PBGC to recover travel advances by offset of up to 100 percent of a Federal employee's accrued pay.
See, also,
5 U.S.C. 4108, governing the collection of training expenses.
(5) To the extent that provisions of laws, other regulations, and PBGC enforcement policies differ from the provisions of this part, those provisions of law, other regulations, and PBGC enforcement policies apply to the remission or mitigation of fines, penalties, and forfeitures, and to debts arising under ERISA, rather than the provisions of this part.
(c)
Additional policies and procedures.
PBGC may, but is not required to, promulgate additional policies and procedures consistent with this part, the FCCS, and other applicable law, policies, and procedures.
(1) PBGC does not intend this regulation to prohibit PBGC from demanding the return of specific property or the payment of its value.
(2) The failure of PBGC to comply with any provision in this regulation will not serve as a defense to the existence of the debt.
(d)
Duplication not required.
Nothing in this part requires PBGC to duplicate notices or administrative proceedings required by contract, this part, or other laws or regulations.
(e)
Use of multiple collection remedies allowed.
PBGC and other Federal agencies may simultaneously use multiple collection remedies to collect a debt, except as prohibited by law. This part is intended to promote aggressive debt collection, using for each debt all available and appropriate collection remedies. To provide PBGC with flexibility in determining which remedies will be most efficient in collecting the particular debt, these remedies are not listed in any prescribed order.
§ 4903.3
Do these regulations adopt the Federal Claims Collection Standards (FCCS)?
This part adopts and incorporates all provisions of FCCS. This part also supplements the FCCS by prescribing procedures consistent with FCCS, as necessary and appropriate for PBGC operations.
§ 4903.4
What rules apply for purposes of filing with PBGC, determining dates of filings, and computation of time?
(a)
How and where to file.
PBGC applies the rules in subpart A of part 4000 of this chapter to determine permissible methods of filing with PBGC under this part.
See
§ 4000.4 of this chapter for information on where to file.
(b)
Date of filing.
PBGC applies the rules in subpart C of part 4000 of this chapter to determine the date that a submission under this part was filed with PBGC.
(c)
Computation of time.
PBGC applies the rules of subpart D of part 4000 of this chapter to compute any time period under this part.

# Subpart B—Procedures To Collect Debts Owed to PBGC
§ 4903.5
What notice will PBGC send to a debtor when collecting a debt owed to PBGC?
(a)
Notice requirements.
PBGC will collect debts owed to PBGC. PBGC will promptly send at least one written notice to a debtor informing the debtor of the consequences of failing to pay or otherwise resolve a debt owed to PBGC. The notice(s) will be sent to the debtor at the most current address of the debtor in PBGC's records. Generally, before starting the collection actions described in §§ 4903.6 and 4903.10 through 4903.18 of this part, PBGC will send no more than two written notices to the debtor. The notice will explain why the debt is owed to PBGC, the amount of the debt, how a debtor may pay the debt or make alternate repayment arrangements, how a debtor may review non-privileged documents related to the debt, how a debtor may dispute the debt, the collection remedies available to PBGC if the debtor refuses or otherwise fails to pay the debt, and other consequences to the debtor if the debt is not paid. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the written notice(s) will explain to the debtor:
(1) The nature and amount of the debt, and the facts giving rise to the debt;
(2) How interest, penalties, and administrative costs are added to the debt, the date by which payment must be made to avoid such charges, and that such assessments must be made unless excused in accordance with 31 CFR 901.9 (see § 4903.6 of this part);
(3) The date by which payment should be made to avoid the enforced collection actions described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section;
(4) PBGC's willingness to discuss alternative payment arrangements and how the debtor may enter into a written agreement to repay the debt under terms acceptable to PBGC (

Private collection agency.
Refer the debt to a private collection agency (

Treasury Department's Financial Management Service.
Refer the debt to
the Financial Management Service for collection (
see
§ 4903.10 of this part);

see
§ 4903.10 of this part);
(8) How the debtor may inspect and copy non-privileged records related to the debt;
(9) How the debtor may request a review of PBGC's determination that the debtor owes a debt to PBGC and present evidence that the debt is not delinquent or legally enforceable (
see
§§ 4903.11(c) and 4903.12(c) of this part);
(10) How a debtor who is an individual may request a hearing if PBGC intends to garnish the debtor's private sector (
i.e.,
non-Federal) wages (see § 4903.14(a) of this part), including:
(i) The method and time period for requesting a hearing;
(ii) That a request for a hearing, timely filed on or before the 15th business day following the date of the mailing of the notice, will stay the commencement of administrative wage garnishment, but not other collection procedures; and
(iii) The name and address of the office to which the request for a hearing should be sent.
(11) How a debtor who is an individual and a Federal employee subject to Federal salary offset may request a hearing (
see
§ 4903.13(e) of this part), including:
(i) The method and time period for requesting a hearing;

(vi) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations, or evidence may subject the Federal employee to penalties under the False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3731) or other applicable statutory authority, and criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 1001, and 1002, or other applicable statutory authority;
(vii) That unless prohibited by contract or statute, amounts paid on or deducted for the debt which are later waived or found not owed to the United States will be promptly refunded to the employee; and
(viii) That proceedings with respect to such debt are governed by 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 31 U.S.C. 3716.
(12) How the debtor may request a waiver of the debt, if applicable.
See,
for example, §§ 4903.6 and 4903.13(f) of this part.
(13) How the debtor's spouse may claim his or her share of a joint income tax refund by filing Form 8379 with the Internal Revenue Service (

see
28 U.S.C. 3201(e); 31 U.S.C. 3720B, 31 CFR 285.13, and § 4903.18(a) of this part); and
(16) That the debtor should advise PBGC of a bankruptcy proceeding of the debtor or another person liable for the debt being collected.
(b)
Exceptions to notice requirements.
PBGC may omit from a notice to a debtor one or more of the provisions contained in paragraphs (a)(6) through (a)(16) of this section if PBGC, in consultation with its legal counsel, determines that any provision is not legally required given the collection remedies to be applied to a particular debt.
(c)
Respond to debtors; comply with FCCS.
PBGC should respond promptly
to communications from debtors and comply with other FCCS provisions applicable to the administrative collection of debts.
See
31 CFR part 901.
§ 4903.6
How will PBGC add interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs to a debt owed to PBGC?
(a)
Assessment and notice.
PBGC will assess interest, penalties and administrative costs on PBGC debts in accordance with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3717, 31 CFR 901.9 and other applicable requirements. Administrative costs, including the costs of processing and handling a delinquent debt, will be determined by PBGC. PBGC will explain in the notice to the debtor how interest, penalties, costs, and other charges are assessed, unless the requirements are included in a contract or other legally binding agreement.
(b)
Waiver of interest, penalties, and administrative costs.
Unless otherwise required by law, regulation, or contract, PBGC will not charge interest if the amount due on the debt is paid within 30 days of the date from which the interest accrues.
See
31 U.S.C. 3717(d). To the extent permitted by law, PBGC may waive interest, penalties, and administrative costs, or any portion thereof, in appropriate circumstances consistent with the FCCS.
(c)
Accrual during suspension of debt collection.
In most cases, interest, penalties and administrative costs will continue to accrue during any period when collection has been suspended for any reason (for example, when the debtor has requested a hearing). PBGC may suspend accrual of any or all of these charges in appropriate circumstances consistent with the FCCS.
§ 4903.7
When will PBGC allow a debtor to pay a debt owed to PBGC in installments instead of a lump sum?
If a debtor is financially unable to pay the debt in a lump sum, PBGC may accept payment of a debt in regular installments, in accordance with the provisions of 31 CFR 901.8.
§ 4903.8
When will PBGC compromise a debt owed to PBGC?
If PBGC cannot collect the full amount of a debt owed to PBGC, PBGC may compromise the debt in accordance with the provisions of 31 CFR part 902.
§ 4903.9
When will PBGC suspend or terminate debt collection on a debt owed to PBGC?
If, after pursuing all appropriate means of collection, PBGC determines that a debt owed to PBGC is uncollectible, PBGC may suspend or terminate debt collection activity in accordance with the provisions of 31 CFR part 903. Termination of debt collection activity by PBGC does not discharge the indebtedness.
§ 4903.10
When will PBGC transfer a debt owed to PBGC to the Treasury Department's Financial Management Service for collection?
(a) PBGC will transfer a debt owed to PBGC that is more than 180 days delinquent to the Financial Management Service for debt collection services, a process known as “cross-servicing.”
See
31 U.S.C. 3711(g) and 31 CFR 285.12. PBGC may transfer debts owed to PBGC that are delinquent 180 days or less to the Financial Management Service in accordance with the procedures described in 31 CFR 285.12. The Financial Management Service takes appropriate action to collect or compromise the transferred PBGC debt, or to suspend or terminate collection action thereon, in accordance with the statutory and regulatory requirements and authorities applicable to the debt owed to PBGC and the collection action to be taken. See 31 CFR 285.12(b) and 285.12(c)(2). Appropriate action can include, but is not limited to, contact with the debtor, referral of the debt owed to PBGC to the Treasury Offset Program, private collection agencies, or the Department of Justice; reporting of the debt to credit bureaus, and/or administrative wage garnishment.
(b) At least 60 days prior to transferring a debt owed to PBGC to the Financial Management Service, PBGC will send notice to the debtor as required by § 4903.5 of this part. PBGC will certify to the Financial Management Service that the debt is valid, delinquent, legally enforceable, and that there are no legal bars to collection. In addition, PBGC will certify its compliance with all applicable due process and other requirements as described in
this part and other Federal laws. See 31 CFR 285.12(i) regarding the certification requirement.
(c) As part of its debt collection process, the Financial Management Service uses the Treasury Offset Program to collect debts owed to PBGC by administrative and tax refund offset.
See
31 CFR 285.12(g). Under the Treasury Offset Program, before a Federal payment is disbursed, the Financial Management Service compares the name and taxpayer identification number (TIN) of the payee with the names and TINs of debtors that have been submitted by Federal agencies and states to the Treasury Offset Program database. If there is a match, the Financial Management Service (or, in some cases, another Federal disbursing agency) offsets all or a portion of the Federal payment, disburses any remaining payment to the payee, and pays the offset amount to the creditor agency. Federal payments eligible for offset include, but are not limited to, income tax refunds, salary, travel advances and reimbursements, retirement and vendor payments, and Social Security and other benefit payments.
§ 4903.11
How will PBGC use administrative offset (offset of non-tax Federal payments) to collect a debt owed to PBGC?
(a)
Centralized administrative offset through the Treasury Offset Program.
(1) In most cases, the Financial Management Service uses the Treasury Offset Program to collect debts owed to PBGC by the offset of Federal payments.
See
§ 4903.10(c) of this part. If not already transferred to the Financial Management Service under § 4903.10 of this part, PBGC will refer debt over 180 days delinquent to the Treasury Offset Program for collection by centralized administrative offset.
See
31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(6); 31 CFR part 285, subpart A; and 31 CFR 901.3(b). PBGC may refer to the Treasury Offset Program for offset any debt owed to PBGC that has been delinquent for 180 days or less.
(2) At least 60 days prior to referring a debt owed to PBGC to the Treasury Offset Program, in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, PBGC will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 4903.5 of this part. PBGC will certify to the Financial Management Service, that the debt is valid, delinquent, and legally enforceable, and that there are no legal bars to collection by offset. In addition, PBGC will certify its compliance with the requirements in this part.
(b)
Non-centralized administrative offset for debts owed to PBGC.
(1) When centralized administrative offset through the Treasury Offset Program is not available or appropriate, PBGC may collect past-due, legally enforceable debts owed to PBGC through non-centralized administrative offset. See 31 CFR 901.3(c). In these cases, PBGC may offset a payment internally or make an offset request directly to a Federal payment agency.
(2) At least 30 days prior to offsetting a payment internally or requesting a Federal payment agency to offset a payment, PBGC will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 4903.5 of this part. When referring a debt owed to PBGC for offset under this paragraph (b), PBGC will certify that the debt is valid, delinquent, and legally enforceable, and that there are no legal bars to collection by offset. In addition, PBGC will certify its compliance with these regulations concerning administrative offset.
See
31 CFR 901.3(c)(2)(ii).
(c)
Administrative review.
The notice described in § 4903.5 of this part will explain to the debtor how to request an administrative review of PBGC's determination that the debtor owes a debt to PBGC and how to present evidence that the debt is not delinquent or legally enforceable. In addition to challenging the existence and amount of the debt owed to PBGC, the debtor may seek a review of the terms of repayment. In most cases, PBGC will provide administrative review based upon the written record, including documentation provided by the debtor. PBGC may provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the debtor requests reconsideration of the debt owed to PBGC, and PBGC determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence. Unless otherwise required by law, an oral
hearing under this section is not required to be a formal evidentiary hearing. PBGC will carefully document all significant matters discussed at the hearing. PBGC may suspend collection through administrative offset and/or other collection actions pending the resolution of a debtor's dispute.
(d)
Procedures for expedited offset.
Under the circumstances described in 31 CFR 901.3(b)(4)(iii), PBGC may offset against a payment to be made to the debtor prior to sending a notice to the debtor, as described in § 4903.5 of this part, or completing the procedures described in paragraph (b)(2) and (c) of this section. PBGC will give the debtor notice and an opportunity for review as soon as practicable and promptly refund any money ultimately found not to have been owed to the Government.
§ 4903.12
How will PBGC use tax refund offset to collect a debt owed to PBGC?
(a)
Tax refund offset.
In most cases, the Financial Management Service uses the Treasury Offset Program to collect debts owed to PBGC by the offset of tax refunds and other Federal payments.
See
§ 4903.10(c) of this part. If not already transferred to the Financial Management Service under § 4903.10 of this part, PBGC will refer to the Treasury Offset Program any past-due, legally enforceable debt for collection by tax refund offset.
See
26 U.S.C. 6402(d), 31 U.S.C. 3720A and 31 CFR 285.2.
(b)
Notice.
At least 60 days prior to referring a debt owed to the Treasury Offset Program, PBGC will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 4903.5 of this part. PBGC will certify to the Financial Management Service's Treasury Offset Program that the debt is past due and legally enforceable in the amount submitted, and that the PBGC has made reasonable efforts to obtain payment of the debt as described in 31 CFR 285.2(d). In addition, PBGC will certify its compliance with all applicable due process and other requirements described in this part and other Federal laws.
See
31 U.S.C. 3720A(b) and 31 CFR 285.2.
(c)
Administrative review.
The notice described in § 4903.5 of this part will provide the debtor with at least 60 days prior to the initiation of tax refund offset to request an administrative review as described in § 4903.11(c) of this part. PBGC may suspend collection through tax refund offset and/or other collection actions pending the resolution of the debtor's dispute.
§ 4903.13
How will PBGC offset a Federal employee's salary to collect a debt owed to PBGC?
(a)
Federal salary offset.
(1) Salary offset is used to collect debts owed to the United States or PBGC by Federal employees. If a Federal employee owes PBGC a debt, PBGC may offset the employee's Federal salary to collect the debt in the manner described in this section. For information on how a Federal agency other than PBGC may collect debt from the salary of a PBGC employee, see §§ 4903.21 and 4903.22, subpart C, of this part.
(2) Nothing in this part requires PBGC to collect a debt in accordance with the provisions of this section if Federal law allows other means to collect.
See,
for example, 5 U.S.C. 5705 (travel advances not used for allowable travel expenses are recoverable from the employee or his estate by setoff against accrued pay and other means) and 5 U.S.C. 4108 (recovery of training expenses).
(3) PBGC may use the administrative wage garnishment procedure described in § 4903.14 of this part to collect from an individual's non-Federal wages a debt owed to PBGC.
(b)
Centralized salary offset through the Treasury Offset Program.
As described in § 4903.10(a) of this part, PBGC will refer debts owed to PBGC to the Financial Management Service for collection by administrative offset, including salary offset, through the Treasury Offset Program. When possible, PBGC will attempt salary offset through the Treasury Offset Program before applying the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section.
See
5 CFR 550.1108 and 550.1109.
(c)
Non-centralized salary offset for debts owed to PBGC.
When centralized salary offset through the Treasury Offset Program is not available or appropriate, PBGC may collect delinquent debts owed to PBGC through non-centralized salary offset.
See
5 CFR
550.1109. In these cases, PBGC may offset a payment internally or make a request directly to a Federal payment agency to offset a salary payment to collect a delinquent debt owed to PBGC by a Federal employee. Thirty (30) days prior to offsetting internally or requesting a Federal agency to offset a salary payment, PBGC will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 4903.5 of this part. When referring a debt owed to PBGC for offset, PBGC will certify to the payment agency that the debt is valid, delinquent and legally enforceable in the amount stated, and there are no legal bars to collection by salary offset. In addition, PBGC will certify that all due process and other prerequisites to salary offset have been met. See 5 U.S.C. 5514, 31 U.S.C. 3716(a), and this section for a description of the due process and other prerequisites for salary offset.
(d)
When prior notice not required.
PBGC is not required to provide prior notice to an employee when the following adjustments are made by PBGC to a PBGC employee's pay:
(1) Any adjustment to pay arising out of any employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over 4 pay periods or less;
(2) A routine intra-agency adjustment of pay that is made to correct an overpayment of pay attributable to clerical or administrative errors or delays in processing pay documents, if the overpayment occurred within the 4 pay periods preceding the adjustment, and, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the individual is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the adjustment and the point of contact for contesting such adjustment; or
(3) Any adjustment to collect a debt amounting to $50 or less, if, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the individual is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the adjustment and a point of contact for contesting such adjustment.
(e)
Administrative review
—(1)
Request for administrative review.
A Federal employee who has received a notice that his or her debt will be collected by means of salary offset may request administrative review concerning the existence or amount of the debt owed to PBGC. The Federal employee also may request administrative review concerning the amount proposed to be deducted from the employee's pay each pay period. The employee must send any request for administrative review in writing to the office designated in the notice described in § 4903.5.
See
§ 4903.5(a)(11). The request must be received by the designated office on or before the 15th day following the employee's receipt of the notice. The employee must sign the request and specify whether an oral hearing is requested. If an oral hearing is requested, the employee must explain why the matter cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence alone. All travel expenses incurred by the Federal employee in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the employee.
See
31 CFR 901.3(a)(7).
(2)
Failure to submit timely request for administrative review.
If the employee fails to submit a request for administrative review within the time period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, salary offset may be initiated. However, PBGC may accept a late request for administrative review if the employee can show that the late request was the result of circumstances beyond the employee's control or because of a failure to receive actual notice of the filing deadline.
(3)
Reviewing official.
PBGC must obtain the services of a reviewing official who is not under the supervision or control of the Director of the PBGC. PBGC may enter into interagency support agreements with other agencies to provide reviewing officials.
(4)
Notice of administrative review.
After the employee requests administrative review, the designated reviewing official will inform the employee of the form of the review to be provided. For oral hearings, the notice will set forth the date, time and location of the hearing. For determinations based on review of written records, the notice will notify the employee of the date by which he or she should submit written arguments to the designated reviewing official. The reviewing official will give
the employee reasonable time to submit documentation in support of the employee's position. The reviewing official will schedule a new hearing date if requested by both parties. The reviewing official will give both parties reasonable notice of the time and place of a rescheduled hearing.
(5)
Oral hearing.
The reviewing official will conduct an oral hearing if the official determines that the matter cannot be resolved by review of documentary evidence alone. The hearing need not take the form of an evidentiary hearing, but may be conducted in a manner determined by the reviewing official, including but not limited to:
(i) Informal conferences (in person or electronically) with the reviewing official, in which the employee and agency representative will be given a reasonable opportunity to present evidence, witnesses and argument;
(ii) Informal meetings with an interview of the employee by the reviewing official; or
(iii) Formal written submissions, with an opportunity for oral presentation.
(6)
Determination based on review of written record.
If the reviewing official determines that an oral hearing is not necessary, the official will make the determination based upon a review of the available written record, including any documentation submitted by the employee in support of his or her position.
See
31 CFR 901.3(a)(7).
(7)
Failure to appear or submit documentary evidence.
In the absence of good cause shown (for example, excused illness), if the employee fails to appear at an oral hearing or fails to submit documentary evidence as required for administrative review, the employee will have waived the right to administrative review, and salary offset may be initiated. Further, the employee will have been deemed to admit the existence and amount of the debt owed to PBGC as described in the notice of intent to offset. If PBGC's representative fails to appear at an oral hearing, the reviewing official will proceed with the hearing as scheduled, and make his or her determination based upon the oral testimony presented and the documentary evidence submitted by both parties.
(8)
Burden of proof.
PBGC will have the initial burden to prove the existence and amount of the debt owed to PBGC. Thereafter, if the employee disputes the existence or amount of the debt, the employee must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that no such debt exists or that the amount of the debt is incorrect. In addition, the employee may present evidence that the proposed terms of the repayment schedule are unlawful, would cause a financial hardship to the employee, or that collection of the debt may not be pursued due to operation of law.
(9)
Record.
The reviewing official will maintain a summary record of any hearing provided by this part. Witnesses will testify under oath or affirmation in oral hearings. See 31 CFR 901.3(a)(7).
(10)
Date of decision.
The reviewing official will issue a written opinion stating the official's decision, based upon documentary evidence and information developed during the administrative review, as soon as practicable after the review, but not later than 60 days after the date on which the request for review was received by PBGC. If the employee (or the parties jointly) requests a delay in the proceedings, the deadline for the decision may be postponed by the number of days by which the review was postponed. When a decision is not timely rendered, PBGC will waive interest and penalties applied to the debt owed to PBGC for the period beginning with the date the decision is due and ending on the date the decision is issued.
(11)
Content of decision.
The written decision will include:
(i) A statement of the facts presented to support the origin, nature, and amount of the debt owed to PBGC;
(ii) The reviewing official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and
(iii) The terms of any repayment schedules, if applicable.
(12)
Final agency action.
The reviewing official's decision will be final.
(f)
Waiver not precluded.
Nothing in this part precludes an employee from requesting waiver of an overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584 or 8346(b), 32 U.S.C. 716, or other statutory authority.
PBGC may grant such waivers when it would be against equity and good conscience or not in the United States' best interest to collect such debts, in accordance with those authorities, 5 CFR 550.1102(b)(2).
(g)
Salary offset process
—(1)
Determination of disposable pay.
PBGC will implement salary offset when requested to do so by PBGC, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, or another agency, as described in § 4903.21 of this part. If the debtor is not employed by PBGC, the agency employing the debtor will determine the amount of the employee's disposable pay and will implement salary offset upon request.
(2)
When salary offset begins.
Deductions will begin within three official pay periods following receipt of the creditor agency's request for offset or after a decision has been issued following a request for a hearing.
(3)
Amount of salary offset.
The amount to be offset from each salary payment will be up to 15 percent of a debtor's disposable pay, subject to the requirements of 15 U.S.C. 1673, as follows:
(i) If the amount of the debt is equal to or less than 15 percent of the disposable pay, such debt generally will be collected in a lump sum payment;
(ii) Installment deductions will be made over a period of no greater than the anticipated period of employment. An installment deduction will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount, or the creditor agency has determined that smaller deductions are appropriate based on the employee's ability to pay.
(4)
Final salary payment.
After the employee has separated either voluntarily or involuntarily from the payment agency, the payment agency may make a lump sum deduction exceeding 15 percent of disposable pay from any final salary or other payments pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 in order to satisfy a debt owed to PBGC.
(h)
Payment agency's responsibilities.
(1) As required by 5 CFR 550.1109, if the employee separates from the payment agency from which PBGC has requested salary offset, the payment agency must certify the total amount of its collection and notify PBGC and the employee of the amounts collected. If the payment agency knows that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement Fund and Disability Fund, the Federal Employee Retirement System, or other similar payments, it must provide written notification to the agency responsible for making such payments that the debtor owes a debt to PBGC, the amount of the debt, and that PBGC has complied with the provisions of this section. PBGC must submit a properly certified claim to the agency responsible for making such payments before the collection can be made.
(2) If the employee is already separated from employment and all payments due from his or her former payment agency have been made, PBGC may request that money due and payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement Fund and Disability Fund, the Federal Employee Retirement System, or other similar funds, be administratively offset to collect the debt. Generally, PBGC will collect such monies through the Treasury Offset Program as described in § 4903.10(c) of this part.
(3) When an employee transfers to another agency, PBGC should resume collection with the employee's new payment agency in order to continue salary offset.
§ 4903.14
How will PBGC use administrative wage garnishment to collect a debt owed to PBGC from a debtor's wages?
(a) PBGC is authorized to collect debts owed to PBGC from an individual debtor's wages by means of administrative wage garnishment in accordance with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720D and 31 CFR 285.11. This part adopts and incorporates all of the provisions of 31 CFR 285.11 concerning administrative wage garnishment, including the hearing procedures described in 31 CFR 285.11(f). PBGC may use administrative wage garnishment to collect a delinquent debt unless the debtor is making timely payments under an agreement to pay the debt in installments (
see
§ 4903.7 of this part). Thirty (30) days prior to initiating an
administrative wage garnishment, PBGC will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 4903.5 of this part, including the requirements of § 4903.5(a)(10) of this part. For debts referred to the Financial Management Service under § 4903.10 of this part, PBGC may authorize the Financial Management Service to send a notice informing the debtor that administrative wage garnishment will be initiated and how the debtor may request a hearing as described in § 4903.5(a)(10) of this part. If a debtor makes a timely request for a hearing, administrative wage garnishment will not begin until a hearing is held and a decision is sent to the debtor. PBGC will determine whether the matter requires an oral hearing or if a determination based upon review of the written record is sufficient. PBGC will provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when it determines that the issues in dispute cannot be resolved by a review of the documentary evidence.
See
31 CFR 285.11(f)(1)-(4). Even if a debtor's hearing request is not timely, PBGC may suspend collection by administrative wage garnishment in accordance with the provisions of 31 CFR 285.11(f)(5). All travel expenses incurred by the debtor in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the debtor.
(b) This section does not apply to Federal salary offset, the process by which PBGC collects debts owed to PBGC from the salaries of Federal employees (
see
§ 4903.13 of this part).
§ 4903.15
How will PBGC report debts owed to PBGC to credit bureaus?
PBGC will report delinquent debts owed to PBGC to credit bureaus in accordance with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3711(e), 31 CFR 901.4, and the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-129, “Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-tax Receivables.” At least 60 days prior to reporting a delinquent debt to a consumer reporting agency, PBGC will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 4903.5 of this part. PBGC may authorize the Financial Management Service to report to credit bureaus those delinquent debts owed to the PBGC that have been transferred to the Financial Management Service under § 4903.10 of this part.
§ 4903.16
How will PBGC refer debts owed to PBGC to private collection agencies?
PBGC will transfer delinquent debts owed to PBGC to the Financial Management Service to obtain debt collection services provided by private collection agencies. See § 4903.10 of this part.
§ 4903.17
When will PBGC refer debts owed to PBGC to the Department of Justice?
PBGC may initiate litigation pursuant to 29 U.S.C. 1302 with delinquent debts on which aggressive collection activity has been taken in accordance with this part and that should not be compromised, and on which collection activity should not be suspended or terminated. Alternatively, PBGC may refer debts owed to PBGC having a principal balance over $100,000, or such higher amount as authorized by the Attorney General, to the Department of Justice for approval of any compromise of a debt or suspension or termination of collection activity. See §§ 4903.8 and 4903.9 of this part; 31 CFR 902.1, 903.1, and part 904. PBGC may authorize the Financial Management Service to refer to the Department of Justice for litigation those delinquent debts that have been transferred to the Financial Management Service under § 4903.10 of this part.
§ 4903.18
Will a debtor who owes a debt to PBGC or another Federal agency, and persons controlled by or controlling such debtors, be ineligible for Federal loan assistance, grants, cooperative agreements, or other sources of Federal funds?
(a) Delinquent debtors are ineligible for and barred from obtaining Federal loans or loan insurance or guaranties. As required by 31 U.S.C. 3720B and 31 CFR 901.6, PBGC will not extend financial assistance in the form of a loan, loan guarantee, or loan insurance to any person delinquent on a debt owed to a Federal agency. PBGC may issue standards under which it may determine that persons controlled by or controlling such delinquent debtors are similarly ineligible in accordance with
31 CFR 285.13(c)(2). This prohibition does not apply to disaster loans. PBGC may extend credit after the delinquency has been resolved.
See
31 CFR 285.13.
(b) This section does not apply to loans provided to multi-employer pension plans pursuant to 29 U.S.C. 1431, 29 CFR 4261.1 and 4281.47.
(c) A debtor who has a judgment lien against the debtor's property for a debt to the United States is not eligible to receive grants, loans or funds directly or indirectly from the United States until the judgment is paid in full or otherwise satisfied. This prohibition does not apply to funds to which the debtor is entitled as beneficiary. PBGC may promulgate regulations to allow for waivers of this ineligibility.
See
28 U.S.C. 3201(e).
§ 4903.19
How does a debtor request a special review based on a change in circumstances such as catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability?
(a)
Material change in circumstances.
A debtor who owes a debt to PBGC may, at any time, request a special review by PBGC of the amount of any offset, administrative wage garnishment, or voluntary payment, based on materially changed circumstances beyond the control of the debtor such as, but not limited to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability.
(b)
Inability to pay.
For purposes of this section, in determining whether an involuntary or voluntary payment would prevent the debtor from meeting essential subsistence expenses (e.g., costs incurred for food, housing, clothing, transportation, and medical care), the debtor must submit a detailed statement and supporting documents for the debtor, his or her spouse, and dependents, indicating:
(1) Income from all sources;
(2) Assets;
(3) Liabilities;
(4) Number of dependents;
(5) Expenses for food, housing, clothing, and transportation;
(6) Medical expenses;
(7) Exceptional expenses, if any; and
(8) Any additional materials and information that PBGC may request relating to ability or inability to pay the amount(s) currently required.
(c)
Alternative payment arrangement.
If the debtor requests a special review under this section, the debtor must submit an alternative proposed payment schedule and a statement to PBGC, with supporting documents, showing why the current offset, garnishment or repayment schedule imposes an extreme financial hardship on the debtor. PBGC will evaluate the statement and documentation and determine whether the current offset, garnishment, or repayment schedule imposes extreme financial hardship on the debtor. PBGC will notify the debtor in writing of such determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset, garnishment, or payment schedule. If the special review results in a revised offset, garnishment, or repayment schedule, PBGC will notify the appropriate Federal agency or other persons about the new terms.
§ 4903.20
Will PBGC issue a refund if money is erroneously collected on a debt?
PBGC will promptly refund to a debtor any amount collected on a debt owed to PBGC when the debt is waived or otherwise found not to be owed to the United States, or as otherwise required by law.

# Subpart C—Procedures for Offset of PBGC Payments To Collect Debts Owed to Other Federal Agencies
§ 4903.21
How do other Federal agencies use the offset process to collect debts from payments issued by PBGC?
(a)
Offset of PBGC payments to collect debts owed to other Federal agencies.
(1) In most cases, Federal agencies submit debts to the Treasury Offset Program to collect delinquent debts from payments issued by PBGC and other Federal agencies, a process known as “centralized offset.” When centralized offset is not available or appropriate, any Federal agency may ask PBGC (when acting as a “payment agency”) to collect a debt owed to such agency by offsetting funds payable to a debtor by PBGC, including salary payments issued to PBGC employees. This section and § 4903.21 of this subpart C
apply when a Federal agency asks PBGC to offset a payment issued by PBGC to a person who owes a debt to the United States.
(2) This subpart C does not apply to debts owed to PBGC.
See
§§ 4903.11 through 4903.13 of this part for offset procedures applicable to debts owed to PBGC.
(3) This subpart C does not apply to the collection of non-PBGC debts through tax refund offset. See 31 CFR 285.2 for tax refund offset procedures.
(4) Benefits paid by PBGC generally will not be offset, subject to limited exceptions (e.g., in certain fiduciary breach situations).
(b)
Administrative offset (including salary offset); certification.
PBGC will initiate a requested offset only upon receipt of written certification from the creditor agency that the debtor owes the past-due, legally enforceable debt in the amount stated, and that the creditor agency has fully complied with all applicable due process and other requirements contained in 31 U.S.C. 3716, 5 U.S.C. 5514, and the creditor agency's regulations, as applicable. Offsets will continue until the debt is paid in full or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the creditor agency.
(c)
Where a creditor agency makes requests for offset.
Requests for offset under this section must be sent to PBGC, ATTN: Chief Financial Officer, 445 12th Street SW, Washington, DC 20024-2101.
(d)
Incomplete certification.
PBGC will return an incomplete debt certification to the creditor agency with notice that the creditor agency must comply with paragraph (b) of this section before action will be taken to collect a debt from a payment issued by PBGC.
(e)
Review.
PBGC is not authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.
(f)
When PBGC will not comply with offset request.
PBGC will comply with the offset request of another agency unless PBGC determines, in consultation with that agency, that the offset would not be in the best interests of the United States, or would otherwise be contrary to law.
(g)
Multiple debts.
When two or more creditor agencies are seeking offsets from payments made to the same person, or when two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, PBGC may determine the order in which the debts will be collected or whether one or more debts should be collected by offset simultaneously.
(h)
Priority of debts owed to PBGC.
For purposes of this section, debts owed to PBGC generally take precedence over debts owed to other agencies. PBGC may determine whether to pay debts owed to other agencies before paying a debt owed to PBGC. PBGC will determine the order in which the debts will be collected based on the best interests of the United States.
[75 FR 68205, Nov. 5, 2010, as amended at 87 FR 57825, Sept. 22, 2022]
§ 4903.22
What does PBGC do upon receipt of a request to offset the salary of a PBGC employee to collect a debt owed by the employee to another Federal agency?
(a)
Notice to a PBGC employee.
When PBGC receives proper certification of a debt owed by one of its employees, PBGC will send a written notice to the employee indicating that a certified debt claim has been received from the creditor agency, the amount of the debt claimed to be owed by the creditor agency, the date deductions from salary will begin, and the amount of such deductions. PBGC will begin deductions from the employee's pay at the next officially established pay interval.
(b)
Amount of deductions from a PBGC employee's salary.
The amount deducted under § 4903.21(b) of this part will be the lesser of the amount of the debt certified by the creditor agency or an amount up to 15 percent of the debtor's disposable pay so long as that amount does not exceed limitations imposed by 15 U.S.C. 1673. Deductions will continue until PBGC knows that the debt is paid in full or until otherwise instructed by the creditor agency. Alternatively, the amount offset may be an amount agreed upon, in writing, by the debtor and the creditor agency.
See
§ 4903.13(g) (salary offset process).
(c)
When the debtor is no longer employed by PBGC
—(1)
Offset of final and
subsequent payments.
If a PBGC employee retires or resigns or if his or her employment ends before collection of the debt is complete, PBGC will continue to offset, under 31 U.S.C. 3716, up to 100 percent of an employee's subsequent payments until the debt is paid or otherwise resolved. Such payments include a debtor's final salary payment, lump-sum leave payment, and other payments payable to the debtor by PBGC.
See
31 U.S.C. 3716 and 5 CFR 550.1104(l) and 550.1104(m).
(2)
Notice to the creditor agency.
If the employee is separated from PBGC before the debt is paid in full, PBGC will certify to the creditor agency the total amount of its collection. If PBGC knows that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, Federal Employee Retirement System, or other similar payments, PBGC will provide written notice to the agency making such payments that the debtor owes a debt (including the amount) and that the provisions of 5 CFR 550.1109 have been fully complied with. The creditor agency is responsible for submitting a certified claim to the agency responsible for making such payments before collection may begin. Generally, creditor agencies will collect such monies through the Treasury Offset Program as described in § 4903.10(c) of this part.
(3)
Notice to the debtor.
PBGC will provide to the debtor a copy of any notices sent to the creditor agency under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(d)
When the debtor transfers to another Federal agency
—(1)
Notice to the creditor agency.
If the debtor transfers to another Federal agency before the debt is paid in full, PBGC will notify the creditor agency and will certify the total amount of its collection on the debt. PBGC will provide a copy of the certification to the creditor agency. The creditor agency is responsible for submitting a certified claim to the debtor's new employing agency before collection may begin.
(2)
Notice to the debtor.
PBGC will provide to the debtor a copy of any notices and certifications sent to the creditor agency under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(e)
Request for hearing official.
PBGC will provide a hearing official upon the creditor agency's request with respect to a PBGC employee.
See
5 CFR 550.1107(a).

§ 4905.1
Purpose and scope.
(a)
Purpose.
This part sets forth the rules and procedures to be followed when a PBGC employee or former employee is requested or served with compulsory process to appear as a witness or produce documents in a proceeding in which the PBGC is not a party, if such appearance arises out of, or is related to, his or her employment with the PBGC. It provides a centralized decisionmaking mechanism for responding to such requests and compulsory process.
(b)
Scope.
(1) This part applies when, in a judicial, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding, a PBGC employee or former employee is requested or served with compulsory process to provide testimony concerning information acquired in the course of performing official duties or because of official status and/or to produce material acquired in the course of performing official duties or contained in PBGC files.
(2) This part does not apply to:
(i) Proceedings in which the PBGC is a party;
(ii) Congressional requests or subpoenas for testimony or documents; or
(iii) Appearances by PBGC employees in proceedings that do not arise out of, or relate to, their employment with PBGC (e.g., outside activities that are engaged in consistent with applicable standards of ethical conduct).
§ 4905.2
Definitions.
For purposes of this part:
Appearance
means testimony or production of documents or other material, including an affidavit, deposition, interrogatory, declaration, or other required written submission.
Compulsory process
means any subpoena, order, or other demand of a court or other authority (e.g., an administrative agency or a state or local legislative body) for the appearance of a PBGC employee or former employee.
Employee
means any officer or employee of the PBGC, including a special government employee.
Proceeding
means any proceeding before any federal, state, or local court; federal, state, or local agency; state or local legislature; or other authority responsible for administering regulatory requirements or adjudicating disputes or controversies, including arbitration, mediation, and other similar proceedings.
Special government employee
means an employee of the PBGC who is retained, designated, appointed or employed to perform, with or without compensation, for not to exceed one hundred and thirty days during any three hundred and sixty-five consecutive days, temporary duties either on a full-time or intermittent basis (18 U.S.C. 202).
§ 4905.3
General.
No PBGC employee or former employee may appear in any proceeding to which this part applies to testify and/or produce documents or other material unless authorized under this part.
§ 4905.4
Appearances by PBGC employees.
(a) Whenever a PBGC employee or former employee is requested or served with compulsory process to appear in a proceeding to which this part applies, he or she will promptly notify the General Counsel.
(b) The General Counsel or his or her designee will authorize an appearance by a PBGC employee or former employee if, and to the extent, he or she determines that such appearance is in the interest of the PBGC.
(1) In determining whether an appearance is in the interest of the PBGC, the General Counsel or his or her designee will consider relevant factors, including:
(i) What, if any, objective of the PBGC (and, where relevant, any federal agency, if the United States is a party) would be promoted by the appearance;
(ii) Whether the appearance would unnecessarily interfere with the employee's official duties;
(iii) Whether the appearance would result in the appearance of improperly favoring one litigant over another; and
(iv) Whether the appearance is appropriate under applicable substantive and procedural rules.
(2) If the General Counsel or his or her designee concludes that compulsory process is essentially a request for PBGC record information, it will be treated as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, as amended, in accordance with part 4901 of this chapter, except to the extent that the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, and part 4902 of this chapter govern disclosure of a record maintained on an individual.
(c) If, in response to compulsory process in a proceeding to which this part applies, the General Counsel or his or her designee has not authorized an appearance by the return date, the employee or former employee shall appear at the stated time and place (unless advised by the General Counsel or his or her designee that process either was not validly issued or served or has been withdrawn), accompanied by a PBGC attorney, produce a copy of this part of the regulations, and respectfully decline to provide any testimony or produce any documents or other material. When the demand is under consideration, the employee shall respectfully request that the court or other authority stay the demand pending the employee's receipt of instructions from the General Counsel.
§ 4905.5
Requests for authenticated copies of PBGC records.
The PBGC will grant requests for authenticated copies of PBGC records, for purposes of admissibility under 28 U.S.C. 1733 and Rule 44 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for records that are to be disclosed pursuant to this part or part 4901 of this chapter. Appropriate fees will be charged for
providing authenticated copies of PBGC records, in accordance with part 4901, subpart D, of this chapter.
§ 4905.6
Penalty.
A PBGC employee who testifies or produces documents or other material in violation of a provision of this part of the regulations shall be subject to disciplinary action.

No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of handicap, be subjected to discrimination in employment under any program or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally-conducted programs or activities.
§§ 4907.141-4907.148
[Reserved]
§ 4907.149
Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.
Except as otherwise provided in § 4907.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.
§ 4907.150
Program accessibility: Existing facilities.
(a)
General.
The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—
(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;
(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or
(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 4907.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
(b)
Methods
—(1)
General.
The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate
accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.
(2)
Historic preservation programs.
In meeting the requirements of § 4907.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 4907.150 (a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—
(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;
(ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or
(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
(c)
Time period for compliance.
The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.
(d)
Transition plan.
In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987 a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—
(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;
(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;
(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and
(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.
§ 4907.151
Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.
Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.
§§ 4907.152-4907.159
[Reserved]
§ 4907.160
Communications.
(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.
(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.
(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall
give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.
(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.
(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.
(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.
(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 4907.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
