# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

(a) After being informed by the Commission that a record system contains a record pertaining to him or her, an individual may request the Commission to disclose that record in the manner described in this section. Each request for the disclosure of a record or a copy of it shall be addressed to the system manager identified in the notice describing the systems of records, either in person or by filing the request pursuant to 11 CFR 100.19(g). Requests may be made by specifically authorized agents or by parents or guardians of individuals.
(b) Each individual requesting the disclosure of a record or copy of a record shall furnish the following information with his or her request:
(1) The name of the record system containing the record;
(2) Proof as described in paragraph (c) of this section that he or she is the individual to whom the requested record relates;

If the individual appears before a notary, he or she shall submit adequate proof of identification in the form of a drivers license, birth certificate, passport or other identification acceptable to the notary. If the statement is witnessed, it shall include a sentence above the witnesses' signatures that they personally know the individual or that the individual has submitted proof of his or her identification to their satisfaction. In any case in which, because of the extreme sensitivity of the record sought to be seen or copied, the Commission determines that the identification is not adequate, it may request the individual to submit additional proof of identification.
(2) If the request is made in person, the requestor shall submit proof of identification similar to that described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, acceptable to the Commission. The individual may have a person of his or her
own choosing accompany him or her when the record is disclosed.
[41 FR 43064, Sept. 29, 1976, as amended at 50 FR 50778, Dec. 12, 1985; 82 FR 60852, Dec. 26, 2017; 89 FR 213, Jan. 2, 2024]
§ 1.5
Disclosure of requested information to individuals.
(a) Upon submission of proof of identification as required by § 1.4, the Commission shall allow the individual to see and/or obtain a copy of the requested record or shall send a copy of the record to the individual by registered mail. If the individual requests to see the record, the Commission may make the record available either at the location where the record is maintained or at a place more suitable to the requestor, if possible. The record shall be made available as soon as possible but in no event later than 15 days after proof of identification.
(b) The Commission must furnish each record requested by an individual under this part in a form intelligible to that individual.
(c) If the Commission denies access to a record to an individual, he or she shall be advised of the reason for the denial and advised of the right to judicial review.
(d) Upon request, an individual will be provided access to the accounting of disclosures from his or her record under the same procedures as provided above and in § 1.4.

Special procedure: Medical records. [Reserved]
§ 1.7
Request for correction or amendment to record.
(a) Any individual who has reviewed a record pertaining to him or her that was furnished under this part, may request the Commission to correct or amend all or any part of that record.
(b) Each individual requesting a correction or amendment shall send the request to the Commission through the person who furnished the record.
(c) Each request for a correction or amendment of a record shall contain the following information:
(1) The name of the individual requesting the correction or amendment;
(2) The name of the system of records in which the record sought to be amended is maintained;
(3) The location of the system of records from which the individual record was obtained;
(4) A copy of the record sought to be amended or corrected or a sufficiently detailed description of that record;
(5) A statement of the material in the record that the individual desires to correct or amend;
(6) A statement of the basis for the requested correction or amendment including any material that the individual can furnish to substantiate the reasons for the correction or amendment sought.
§ 1.8
Agency review of request for correction or amendment of record.
(a) The Commission shall, not later than ten (10) days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) after the receipt of the request for a correction or amendment of a record under § 1.7, acknowledge receipt of the request and inform the individual whether information is required before the correction or amendment can be considered.
(b) If no additional information is required, within ten (10) days from receipt of the request, the Commission shall either make the requested correction or amendment or notify the individual of its refusal to do so, including in the notification the reasons for the refusal, and the appeal procedures provided in § 1.9.
(c) The Commission shall make each requested correction or amendment to a record if that correction or amendment will tend to negate inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete matter in the record.
(d) The Commission shall inform prior recipients of any amendment or correction or notation of dispute of such individual's record if an accounting of the disclosure was made. The individual may request a list of prior recipients if an accounting of the disclosure was made.
§ 1.9
Appeal of initial adverse agency determination on amendment or correction.
(a) Any individual whose request for a correction or amendment has been denied in whole or in part, may appeal that decision to the Commissioners no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the adverse decision is rendered.
(b) The appeal shall be in writing and shall contain the following information:
(1) The name of the individual making the appeal;
(2) Identification of the record sought to be amended;
(3) The record system in which that record is contained;
(4) A short statement describing the amendment sought; and
(5) The name and location of the agency official who initially denied the correction or amendment.
(c) Not later than thirty (30) days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) after the date on which the Commission receives the appeal, the Commissioners shall complete their review of the appeal and make a final decision thereon. However, for good cause shown, the Commissioners may extend that thirty (30) day period. If the Commissioners extend the period, the individual requesting the review shall be promptly notified of the extension and the anticipated date of a decision.
(d) After review of an appeal, the Commission shall send a written notice to the requestor containing the following information:
(1) The decision and, if the denial is upheld, the reasons for the decision;
(2) The right of the requestor to institute a civil action in a Federal District Court for judicial review of the decision; and
(3) The right of the requestor to file with the Commission a concise statement setting forth the reasons for his or her disagreement with the Commission denial of the correction or amendment. The Commission shall make this statement available to any person to whom the record is later disclosed, together with a brief statement, if appropriate, of the Commission's reasons for denying the requested correction or amendment. The Commission shall also send a copy of the statement to prior recipients of the individual's record if an accounting of the disclosures was made.
§ 1.10
Disclosure of record to person other than the individual to whom it pertains.
(a) Any individual who desires to have a record covered by this part disclosed to or mailed to another person may designate such person and authorize such person to act as his or her agent for that specific purpose. The authorization shall be in writing, signed by the individual and notarized or witnessed as provided in § 1.4(c).
(b) The parent of any minor individual or the legal guardian of any individual who has been declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be incompetent, due to physical or mental incapacity or age, may act on behalf of that individual in any matter covered by this part. A parent or guardian who desires to act on behalf of such an individual shall present suitable evidence of parentage or guardianship, by birth certificate, certified copy of a court order, or similar documents, and proof of the individual's identity in a form that complies with § 1.4(c) of this part.
(c) An individual to whom a record is to be disclosed in person, pursuant to this part may have a person of his or her own choosing accompany him or her when the record is disclosed.
§ 1.11
Fees.
(a) The Commission shall not charge an individual for the costs of making a search for a record or the costs of reviewing the record. When the Commission makes a copy of a record as a necessary part of the process of disclosing the record to an individual, the Commission shall not charge the individual for the cost of making that copy.
(b) If an individual requests the Commission to furnish a copy of the record, the Commission shall charge the individual for the costs of making the copy. The fee that the Commission has established for making a copy is ten cents ($.10) per page.

§ 1.14
Specific exemptions.
(a) No individual, under the provisions of these regulations, shall be entitled to access to materials compiled in its systems of records identified as FEC audits and investigations (FEC 2) or FEC compliance actions (FEC 3). These exempted systems relate to the Commission's power to exercise exclusive civil jurisdiction over the enforcement of the Act under 52 U.S.C. 30107(a)(6) and (e); and to defend itself in actions filed against it under 52 U.S.C. 30107(a)(6). Further the Commission has a duty to investigate violations of the Act under 52 U.S.C. 30109(a)(2); to conduct audits and investigations pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30111(b), 26 U.S.C. 9007 and 9038; and to refer apparent violations of the Act to the Attorney General or other law enforcement authorities under 52 U.S.C. 30109(a)(5) and 30107(a)(9). Information contained in FEC systems 2 and 3 contain the working papers of the Commission staff and form the basis for either civil and/or criminal proceedings pursuant to the exercise of the powers and duties of the Commission. These materials must be protected until such time as they are subject to public access under the provision of 52 U.S.C. 30109(a)(4)(B) or 5 U.S.C. 552, or other relevant statutes.
(b)(1) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), records contained in FEC 12, Office of Inspector General Investigative Files, are exempt from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a, except subsections (b), (c) (1) and (2), (e)(4) (A) through (F), (e) (6), (7), (9), (10), and (11) and (f) , and the corresponding provisions of 11 CFR part 1, to the extent this system of records relates in any way to the enforcement of criminal laws.
(2) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), FEC 12, Office of Inspector General Investigative Files, is exempt from 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f), and the corresponding provisions of 11 CFR part 1, to the extent the system of records consists of investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, except for material that falls within the exemption included in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(c) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to the extent that application of the subsection would deny any individual any right, privilege or benefit to which he or she would otherwise be entitled to receive.

(d) Members of the public attending open Commission meetings may use small electronic sound recorders to record the meeting, but the use of other electronic recording equipment and cameras requires advance notice to and coordination with the Commission's Press Officer.
§ 2.4
Exempted meetings.
(a)
Meetings required by statute to be closed.
Meetings concerning matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statutes which require public withholding in such a manner as to leave no discretion for the Commission on the issue, or which establish particular types of matters to be withheld, shall be closed to public observation in accordance with the procedures of 11 CFR 2.5.
(1) As required by 52 U.S.C. 30109(a)(12), all Commission meetings, or portions of meetings, pertaining to any notification or investigation that a violation of the Act has occurred, shall be closed to the public.
(2) For the purpose of this section,
any notification or investigation that a violation of the Act has occurred
includes, but is not limited to, determinations pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30109, the issuance of subpoenas, discussion of referrals to the Department of Justice, or consideration of any other matter related to the Commission's enforcement activity, as set forth in 11 CFR part 111.
(b)
Meetings closed by Commission determination.
Except as provided in 11 CFR 2.4(c), the requirement of open meetings will not apply where the Commission finds, in accordance with 11 CFR 2.5, that an open meeting or the release of information is likely to result in the disclosure of:
(1) Matters that relate solely to the Commission's internal personnel decisions, or internal rules and practices;
(i) This provision includes, but is not limited to, matters relating to Commission policies on working conditions, or materials prepared predominantly for internal use, the disclosure of which would risk circumvention of Commission regulations; but
(ii) This provision does not include discussions or materials regarding employees' dealings with the public, such
as personnel manuals or Commission directives setting forth job functions or procedures;
(2) Financial or commercial information obtained from any person which is privileged or confidential;
(3) Matters which involve the consideration of a proceeding of a formal nature by the Commission against a specific person or the formal censure of any person;
(4) Information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
(5) Investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, or information which if written would be contained in such records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or information would:
(i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings,
(ii) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication,
(iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,
(iv) Disclose the identity of a confidential source,
(v) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or
(vi) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel;
(6) Information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to have a considerable adverse effect on the implementation of a proposed Commission action, as long as the Commission has not already disclosed the content or nature of its proposed action, or is not required by law to disclose it prior to final action; or
(7) Matters that specifically concern the Commission's participation in a civil action or proceeding, or an arbitration, or involving a determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing.
(c) Nothwithstanding the applicability of any exemptions set forth in 11 CFR 2.4(b), the Commission may determine that the public interest requires a meeting to be open.
[50 FR 39972, Oct. 1, 1985, as amended at 75 FR 31, Jan. 4, 2010; 79 FR 77844, Dec. 29, 2014]
§ 2.5
Procedures for closing meetings.
(a)
General.
No meeting or portion of a meeting may be closed to the public observation under this section unless a majority of the Commissioners votes to take such action. The closing of one portion of a meeting shall not justify closing any other portion of a meeting.
(b)
Certification.
Each time the Commission votes to close a meeting, the General Counsel shall publicly certify that, in his or her opinion, each item on the agenda may properly be closed to public observation. The certification shall state each relevant exemption provision. The original copy of the certification shall be attached to, and preserved with, the statement required by 11 CFR 2.5(d).
(c)
Voting procedures.
(1) No meeting need be held to consider closing a meeting. The Commission may vote to close a meeting or any portion thereof by using its notation vote procedures.
(i) A separate vote shall be taken with respect to each item on an agenda proposed to be closed in whole or in part pursuant to 11 CFR 2.4, or with respect to any information proposed to be withheld under 11 CFR 2.4.
(ii) A single vote may be taken with respect to a particular matter to be discussed in a series of closed meetings, or with respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting in the series is scheduled to be held no more than 30 days after the initial meeting.
(iii) This section shall not affect the Commission's practice of setting dates for closed meetings more than 30 days in advance of such meetings.
(2) The Commission Secretary shall record the vote of each Commissioner participating in the vote. No proxies, written or otherwise, shall be counted.
(3)(i) A Commissioner may object to a recommendation to close the discussion of a particular matter or may assert a claim of exemption for a matter scheduled to be discussed in an open meeting. Such objection or assertion will be discussed by the Commission at the next scheduled closed meeting, to determine whether the matter in question should be discussed in a closed meeting.
(ii) An
objection for the record only
will not cause the objection to be placed on any agenda.
(d)
Public statement of vote.
(1) If the Commission votes to close a meeting,
or any portion thereof, under this section, it shall make publicly available within 24 hours a written statement of the vote. The written statement shall contain:
(i) A citation to the provision(s) of 11 CFR 2.4 under which the meeting was closed to public observation and an explanation of why the specific discussion comes within the cited exemption(s);
(ii) The vote of each Commissioner participating in the vote;
(iii) A list of the names of all persons expected to attend the closed meeting and their affiliation. For purposes of this section, affiliation means title or position, and name of employer, and in the case of a representative, the name of the person represented. In the case of Commission employees, the statement will reflect, through the use of titles rather than individual names, that the Commissioners, specified division heads and their staff will attend; and
(iv) The signature of the Commission Secretary.
(2) The original copy of the statement shall be maintained by the Commission Secretary. A copy shall be posted on a public bulletin board located in the Commission's Public Records Office.
(e)
Public request to close a meeting.
A person whose interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting may request that the Commission close that portion to the public for any of the reasons referred to in 11 CFR 2.4. The following procedures shall apply to such requests:
(1) The request must be made in writing and shall be directed to the Chairman of the Commission.
(2) The request shall identify the provisions of 11 CFR 2.4 under which the requestor seeks to close all or a portion of the meeting.
(3) A recorded vote to close the meeting or a portion thereof shall be taken.
(4) Requests made under this section shall become part of the official record of the underlying matter and shall be disclosed in accordance with 11 CFR 2.6 on completion of the matter.
(5) If the Commission decides to approve a request to close, the Commission will then follow the procedures for closing a meeting set forth in 11 CFR 2.5 (a) through (d).
[50 FR 39972, Oct. 1, 1985, as amended at 65 FR 9206, Feb. 24, 2000]
§ 2.6
Transcripts and recordings.
(a) The Commission Secretary shall maintain a complete transcript or electronic recording adequate to record fully the proceedings of each meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to public observation. An electronic recording of a meeting shall be coded, or other records shall be kept in a manner adequate to identify each speaker.
(b)(1) In the case of any meeting closed pursuant to 11 CFR 2.4(b), as the last item of business, the Commission will determine which, if any, portions of the electronic recording or transcript and which if any, items of information withheld under 11 CFR 2.5 contain information which should be withheld pursuant to 11 CFR 2.4.
(2) Portions of transcripts or recordings determined to be outside the scope of any exemptions under 11 CFR 2.6(b)(1) shall be promptly made available to the public through the Commission's Public Records Office at a cost sufficient to cover the Commission's actual cost of duplication or transcription. Requests for such copies shall be made and processed in accordance with the provisions of 11 CFR part 5.
(3) Portions of transcripts or electronic recordings not made available immediately pursuant to 11 CFR 2.6(b)(1), and portions of transcripts or recordings withheld pursuant to 11 CFR 2.4(a), will be made available on request when the relevant exemptions no longer apply. Such materials shall be requested and processed under the provisions of 11 CFR 2.6(b)(2).
(c) A complete verbatim copy of the transcript or a complete electronic recording of each meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public, shall be maintained by the Commission Secretary in confidential files of the Commission, for a minimum of two years subsequent to such meeting, or a minimum of one year after the conclusion of any agency proceeding with respect to which the meeting, or portion of the
meeting, was held, whichever occurs later.
[50 FR 39972, Oct. 1, 1985, as amended at 75 FR 31, Jan. 4, 2010]
§ 2.7
Announcement of meetings and schedule changes.
(a)(1) In the case of each meeting, the Commission shall publicly announce and shall submit such announcement for publication in the
Federal Register
at least seven days prior to the day on which the meeting is to be called to order. The Commission Secretary shall also forward a copy of such announcement for posting in the Commission's Public Records Office.
(2) Announcements made under this section shall contain the following information:
(i) The date of the meeting;
(ii) The place of the meeting;
(iii) The subject matter of the meeting;
(iv) Whether the meeting is to be open or closed to the public; and
(v) The name and telephone number of the official designated by the agency to respond to requests for information about the meeting.
(b) The public announcement and submission for publication shall be made when required by 11 CFR 2.7(a) in the case of every Commission meeting unless a majority of the Commissioners decide by recorded vote that Commission business requires that the meeting be called at an earlier date, in which case the Commission shall make at the earliest practicable time, the announcement required by this section and a concurrent submission for publication of that announcement in the
Federal Register.
(c) The time or place of a meeting may be changed following the public announcement required by 11 CFR 2.7 (a) or (b) only if the Commission announces the change at the earliest practicable time.
(d) The subject matter of a meeting, or the determination of the Commission to open or close a meeting, or portions of a meeting, to the public may be changed following the public announcement required by 11 CFR 2.7 (a) or (b) only if:

(2) The Commission publicly announces the change and the vote of each member upon the change at the earliest practicable time. Immediately following this announcement, the Commission shall submit for publication in the
Federal Register
a notice containing the information required by 11 CFR 2.7(a)(2), including a description of any change from the earlier published notice.

§ 4.1
Definitions.
As used in this part:
(a)
Commission
means the Federal Election Commission, established by the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended.
(b)
Commissioner
means an individual appointed to the Federal Election Commission pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30106(a).
(c)
Request
means to seek the release of records under 5 U.S.C. 552.
(d)
Requestor
is any person who submits a request to the Commission.
(e)
Act
means the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended by the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974, 1976, and 1979, and unless specifically excluded, includes chapters 95 and 96 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 relating to public financing of Federal elections.
(f)
Public Disclosure and Media Relations Division
of the Commission is that division which is responsible for, among other things, the processing of requests for public access to records which are submitted to the Commission pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30108(d), 30109(a)(4)(B)(ii), and 30111(a).
(g)
Direct costs
means those expenditures which the Commission actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requestors, reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating equipment. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses such as the cost of space and heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored.
(h)
Search
means all time spent reviewing, manually or by automated means, Commission records for the purpose of locating those records that are responsive to a FOIA request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents. Search time does not include review of material in order to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure.
(i)
Review
means the process of examining a document located in response to a commercial use request to determine whether any portion of the document located is exempt from disclosure. Review also refers to processing any document for disclosure,
i.e.
, doing all that is necessary to excise exempt portions of the document and otherwise prepare the document for release. Review does not include time spent by the Commission resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.
(j)
Duplication
means the process of making a copy of a document necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Examples of the form such copies can take include, but are not limited to, paper copy, audio-visual materials, or digital storage device.
(k)
Commercial use
means a purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requestor or the person on whose behalf the request is made. The Commission's determination as to whether documents are being requested for a commercial use will be based on the purpose for which the documents are being requested. Where the Commission has reasonable cause to doubt the use for which the requestor claims to have made the request or where that use is not clear from the request itself, the Commission will seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.
(l)
Educational institution
means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.
(m)
Non-commercial scientific institution
means an organization that is not operated on a commercial basis, as that term is defined in paragraph (k) of this section, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.
(n)
Representative of the news media
means a person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include, but are not limited to, television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can
qualify as disseminators of news, as defined in this paragraph) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. A freelance journalist may be regarded as working for a news organization and therefore considered a representative of the news media if that person can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication by that news organization, even though that person is not actually employed by that organization. The best means by which a freelance journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication by a news organization is by having a publication contract with that news organization. When no such contract is present, the Commission will look to the freelance journalist's past publication record in making this determination.
(o)
Record
and any other term used in this part in reference to information includes any information that would be a Commission record subject to the requirements of this part when maintained by the Commission in any format, including an electronic format.
[44 FR 33368, June 8, 1979, as amended at 45 FR 31291, May 13, 1980; 52 FR 39212, Oct. 21, 1987; 65 FR 9206, Feb. 24, 2000; 79 FR 77844, Dec. 29, 2014; 81 FR 92439, Dec. 23, 2016; 89 FR 213, Jan. 2, 2024]
§ 4.2
Policy on disclosure of records.
(a) The Commission will make the fullest possible disclosure of records to the public, consistent with the rights of individuals to privacy, the rights of persons contracting with the Commission with respect to trade secret and commercial or financial information entitled to confidential treatment, and the need for the Commission to promote free internal policy deliberations and to pursue its official activities without undue disruption.
(b) All Commission records shall be available to the public unless they are specifically exempt under this part.
(c) To carry out this policy, the Commission shall designate a Freedom of Information Act Officer.
§ 4.3
Scope.
The regulations in this part implement the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, with respect to the availability of records for inspection and copying.
[44 FR 33368, June 8, 1979, as amended at 45 FR 31291, May 13, 1980]
§ 4.4
Availability of records.
(a) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), the Commission shall make the following materials available for public inspection in an electronic format:
(1) Statements of policy and interpretation which have been adopted by the Commission;
(2) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public;
(3) Opinions of Commissioners rendered in enforcement cases, General Counsel's Reports and non-exempt 52 U.S.C. 30109 investigatory materials shall be placed on the public record of the Agency no later than 30 days from the date on which all respondents are notified that the Commission has voted to close such an enforcement file;
(4) Copies of all records, regardless of form or format, which have been released to any person under this paragraph (a) and;
(i) Which, because of the nature of their subject matter, the agency determines have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records, or
(ii) Which have been requested three or more times; and
(5) A general index of the records referred to in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(b) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3), the Commission shall make available, upon proper request, all non-exempt Agency records, or portions of records, not previously made public pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1) and (a)(2).
(c) The Commission shall maintain and make available for public inspection in an electronic format current indexes and supplements providing identifying information regarding any matter issued, adopted, or promulgated after April 15, 1975, as required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(C) and (E). These indexes and supplements shall be published and made available on at least a quarterly basis for public distribution unless the Commission determines by
Notice in the
Federal Register
that publication would be unnecessary, impracticable, or not feasible due to budgetary considerations. Nevertheless, copies of any index or supplement shall be made available upon request at a cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication.
(d) The Freedom of Information Act and the provisions of this part apply only to existing records; they do not require the creation of new records.
(e) If documents or files contain both disclosable and nondisclosable information, the nondisclosable information will be deleted and the disclosable information released unless the disclosable portions cannot be reasonably segregated from the other portions in a manner which will allow meaningful information to be disclosed.
(f) All records created in the process of implementing provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552 will be maintained by the Commission in accordance with the authority granted by General Records Schedule 14, approved by the National Archives and Records Service of the General Services Administration.
(g) The Commission encourages the public to explore the information available on the Commission's website, located at
http://www.fec.gov.
The site includes a Commission publication,
Availability of FEC Information,
which provides a detailed listing of the types of documents available from the FEC, including those available under FOIA, and directions on how to locate and obtain them.
(h) The Commission will withhold information under this section only if the Commission reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in § 4.5(a); or disclosure is prohibited by law. The Commission will consider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever it determines that full disclosure of a requested record is not possible, and the Commission will take reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information.
[44 FR 33368, June 8, 1979, as amended at 45 FR 31291, May 13, 1980; 65 FR 9206, Feb. 24, 2000; 79 FR 77844, Dec. 29, 2014; 89 FR 213, Jan. 2, 2024; 89 FR 35687, May 2, 2024]
§ 4.5
Categories of exemptions.
(a) No requests under 5 U.S.C. 552 shall be denied release unless the record contains, or its disclosure would reveal, matters that are:
(1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;
(2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Commission;
(3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, provided that such statute (A) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;
(4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person which are privileged or confidential. Such information includes confidential business information which concerns or relates to the trade secrets, processes, operations, style of work, or apparatus, or to the production, sales, shipments, purchases, transfers, identification of customers, inventories, or amount of source of income, profits, losses, or expenditures of any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other organization, if the disclosure is likely to have the effect of either impairing the Commission's ability to obtain such information as is necessary to perform its statutory functions, or causing substantial harm to the competitive position of the person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other organization from which the information was obtained, unless the Commission is required by law to disclose such information. These procedures shall be used for submitting business information in confidence:
(i) A request for confidential treatment shall be addressed to the Chief FOIA Officer and filed pursuant to 11 CFR 100.19(g), and shall indicate clearly on the envelope or subject line, or in a similarly prominent location, that it is a request for confidential treatment.
(ii) With each submission of, or offer to submit, business information which a submitter desires to be treated as
confidential under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the submitter shall provide the following, which may be disclosed to the public: (A) A written description of the nature of the subject information, and a justification for the request for its confidential treatment, and (B) a certification in writing under oath that substantially identical information is not available to the public.
(iii) Approval or denial of requests shall be made only by the Chief FOIA Officer or his or her designees. A denial shall be in writing, shall specify the reason therefore, and shall advise the submitter of the right to appeal to the Commission.
(iv) For good cause shown, the Commission may grant an appeal from a denial by the Chief FOIA Officer or his or her designee if the appeal is filed within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the denial. An appeal shall be addressed to the Chief FOIA Officer and filed pursuant to 11 CFR 100.19(g) and shall clearly indicate that it is a confidential submission appeal. An appeal will be decided within twenty (20) days after its receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) unless an extension, stated in writing with the reasons therefore, has been provided the person making the appeal.
(v) Any business information submitted in confidence and determined to be entitled to confidential treatment shall be maintained in confidence by the Commission and not disclosed except as required by law. In the event that any business information submitted to the Commission is not entitled to confidential treatment, the submitter will be permitted to withdraw the tender unless it is the subject of a request under the Freedom of Information Act or of judicial discovery proceedings.
(vi) Since enforcement actions under 52 U.S.C. 30109 are confidential by statute, the procedures outlined in § 4.5(a)(4) (i) thru (v) are not applicable.
(5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the Commission, provided that the deliberative process privilege shall not apply to records created 25 years or more before the date on which the records were requested.
(6) Personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
(7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information:
(i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;
(ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;
(iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
(iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;
(v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or
(vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.
(b) Whenever a request is made which involves access to records described in 11 CFR 4.5(a)(7); and
(1) The investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of criminal law; and
(2) There is reason to believe that—
(i) The subject of the investigation or proceeding is not aware of its pendency; and
(ii) Disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;
The agency may, during only such time as that circumstance continues, treat the records as not subject to the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act.
(c) Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt. The amount of information deleted shall be indicated on the released portion of the record, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by an exemption in paragraph (a) of this section under which the deletion is made. If technically feasible, the amount of the information deleted shall be indicated at the place in the record where such deletion is made.
(d) If a requested record is one of another government agency or deals with subject matter to which a government agency other than the Commission has exclusive or primary responsibility, the request for such a record shall be promptly referred by the Commission to that agency for disposition or guidance as to disposition.
(e) Nothing in this part authorizes withholding of information or limiting the availability of records to the public, except as specifically provided in this part; nor is this part authority to withhold information from Congress.

§ 4.6
Discretionary release of exempt records.
The Commission may, in its discretion, release requested records despite the applicability of the exemptions in § 4.5(a), if it determines that it is in the public interest and that the rights of third parties would not be prejudiced.
§ 4.7
Requests for records.
(a) [Reserved]
(b)(1) Requests for copies of records pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act shall be addressed to the Chief FOIA Officer and filed pursuant to 11 CFR 100.19(g). The request shall reasonably describe the records sought with sufficient specificity with respect to names, dates, and subject matter, to permit the records to be located. A requester will be promptly advised if the records cannot be located on the basis of the description given and that further identifying information must be provided before the request can be satisfied.
(2) Requests for Commission records and copies thereof shall specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) of the response. The Commission shall accommodate requesters as to form or format if the record is readily available in that form or format. When requesters do not specify the form or format of the response, the Commission shall respond in the form or format in which the document is most accessible to the Commission.
(c) The Commission shall determine within twenty working days after receipt of a request, or twenty working days after an appeal is granted, whether to comply with such request, unless in unusual circumstances the time is extended or subject to § 4.9(f)(3), which governs advance payments. The Commission shall immediately notify the requester of such determination, the reasons therefor, and the right of the requester to seek assistance from the FOIA Public Liaison for the Commission and to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services. In the event the time is extended, the requester shall be notified of the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be made, but in no case shall the extended time exceed ten working days. An extension may be made if it is—
(1) Necessary to locate records or transfer them from physically separate facilities; or
(2) Necessary to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a large quantity of separate and distinct records which are the subject of a single request; or
(3) Necessary for consultation with another agency which has a substantial interest in the determination of the request, or with two or more components
of the Commission which have a substantial subject matter interest therein.
(d) If the Commission determines that an extension of time greater than ten working days is necessary to respond to a request satisfying the “unusual circumstances” specified in paragraph (c) of this section, the Commission shall so notify the requester and give the requester an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed within the time limit prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, or arrange with the Commission an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request.
(e) The Commission may aggregate and process as a single request requests by the same requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, if the Commission reasonably believes that the requests actually constitute a single request that would otherwise satisfy the unusual circumstances specified in paragraph (c) of this section, and the requests involve clearly related matters.
(f) The Commission uses a multitrack system to process requests under the Freedom of Information Act that is based on the amount of work and/or time involved in processing requests. Requests for records are processed in the order they are received within each track. Upon receipt of a request for records, the Commission shall determine which track is appropriate for the request. The Commission may contact requesters whose requests do not appear to qualify for the fastest tracks and provide such requesters the opportunity to limit their requests so as to qualify for a faster track. Requesters who believe that their requests qualify for the fastest tracks and who wish to be notified if the Commission disagrees may so indicate in the request and, where appropriate and feasible, shall also be given an opportunity to limit their requests.
(g) The Commission shall consider requests for the expedited processing of requests in cases where the requester demonstrates a compelling need for such processing.
(1) The term compelling need means:
(i) That a failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or
(ii) With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal government activity.
(2) Requesters for expedited processing must include in their requests a statement setting forth the basis for the claim that a “compelling need” exists for the requested information, certified by the requester to be true and correct to the best of his or her knowledge and belief.
(3) The Commission shall determine whether to grant a request for expedited processing and notify the requester of such determination within ten days of receipt of the request. Denials of requests for expedited processing may be appealed as set forth in § 4.8. The Commission shall expeditiously determine any such appeal. As soon as practicable, the Commission shall process the documents responsive to a request for which expedited processing is granted.
(h) Any person denied access to records by the Commission shall be notified immediately giving reasons therefor, and notified of the right of such person to appeal such adverse determination to the Commission within 90 days from the date of the adverse determination and the right of such person to seek dispute resolution services from the FOIA Public Liaison for the Commission or the Office of Government Information Services.
(i) The date of receipt of a request under this part shall be the date on which the FOIA Officer actually receives the request.
(j) The FOIA Public Liaison is responsible for reducing delays, increasing transparency and understanding of the status of requests, and assisting in the resolution of disputes. The FOIA Public Liaison may be contacted at the
address identified in the definition of “Commission” in § 1.2 of this chapter.

§ 4.8
Mediation services and appeal of denial.
(a) Any person who has been notified pursuant to § 4.7(h) of this part that his/her request for inspection of a record or for a copy has been denied, or who has received no response within twenty working days (or within such extended period as is permitted under § 4.7(c) of this part) after the request has been received by the Commission, may appeal the adverse determination or the failure to respond by requesting the Commission to direct that the record be made available.
(b) The appeal request shall be in writing, shall clearly and prominently state on the envelope or subject line, or in a similarly prominent location, “FOIA Appeal”, and shall identify the record in the form in which it was originally requested.
(c) The appeal request should be addressed to the Chief FOIA Officer and filed pursuant to 11 CFR 100.19(g).
(d) The requestor may state facts and cite legal or other authorities as he/she deems appropriate in support of the appeal request.
(e) For good cause shown, the Commission may disclose a record which is subject to one of the exemptions listed in § 4.5 of this part.
(f) The Commission will make a determination with respect to any appeal within twenty days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) after receipt of the appeal (or within such extended period as is permitted under § 4.7(c) of this part). If on appeal, the denial of the request for a record or a copy is in whole or in part upheld, the Commission shall advise the requestor of the denial and shall notify him/her of the provisions for judicial review of that determination as set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4).
(g) Because of the risk of misunderstanding inherent in oral communications, the Commission will not entertain any appeal from an alleged denial or failure to comply with an oral request. Any person who has orally requested a copy of a record that he/she believes to have been improperly denied should resubmit the request in writing as set forth in § 4.7.
(h) The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) offers non-compulsory, non-binding mediation services to help resolve FOIA disputes as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. A requester may contact OGIS at: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001; email:
ogis@nara.gov

§ 4.9
Fees.
(a)
Exceptions to fee charges
—(1)
General.
Except for a commercial use requester, the Commission will not charge a fee to any requester for the first two hours of search time and the first 100 pages of duplication in response to any FOIA request.
(2)
Definition of pages.
For purposes of this paragraph, the word
pages
refers to paper copies of a standard agency size which will normally be 8
1/2
″ × 11″ or 8
1/2
″ × 14″. Thus, while a requester would not be entitled to 100 free digital storage devices, for example, a requester would be entitled to 100 free pages of a computer printout.
(3)
Minimum charge.
The Commission will not charge a fee to any requester when the allowable direct cost of that FOIA request is equal to or less than the Commission's cost of routinely collecting and processing a FOIA request fee.
(5)
Time limit for compliance.
(i) The Commission will not charge a fee under this section to any requester if the Commission does not comply with the time limits in § 4.7(c) or § 4.8(f).
(ii) If the Commission has determined that unusual circumstances (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(iii) and
§ 4.7(c)(1) through (3)) apply and the Commission provided timely written notification to the requester in accordance with § 4.7(c), a failure to comply with the time limit is excused for an additional 10 days. If the Commission fails to comply with the extended time limit, the Commission may not assess any search fees or, where applicable, duplication fees.
(iii) If the Commission has determined that unusual circumstances apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the Commission may charge search fees or, where applicable, duplication fees, if the Commission has provided timely written notification to the requester in accordance with § 4.7(c) and the Commission has discussed with the requester via written mail, electronic mail, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with § 4.7(d).
(iv) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.
(b)
Fee reduction or waiver
—(1) The Commission will consider requests for the reduction or waiver of any fees assessed pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section if it determines, either as a result of its own motion or in response to a written submission by the requester, that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and that disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
(2) A request for a reduction or waiver of fees shall be made in writing by the FOIA requestor; shall accompany the relevant FOIA request so as to be considered timely; and shall include a specific explanation as to why the fee for that FOIA request should be reduced or waived, applying the standard stated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to the facts of that particular request. In addition, the explanation shall include: the requester's (and user's, if the requester and the user are different persons or entities) identity, qualifications and expertise in the subject area, and ability and intention to disseminate the information to the public; and a discussion of any commercial or personal benefit that the requestor (and user, if the requestor and user are different persons or entities) expects as a result of disclosure, including whether the information disclosed would be resold in any form at a fee above actual cost.
(c)
Fees to be charged.
(1) The FOIA services provided by the Commission in response to a FOIA request for which the requestor will be charged will depend upon the category of the requestor. The categories of FOIA requestors are as follows:
(i)
Commercial use requestors.
A requestor of documents for commercial use will be assessed reasonable standard charges for the full allowable direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release and duplicating the records sought, according to the Commission's schedule of fees for those services as set forth at paragraph (c)(4) of this section. A commercial use requestor is not entitled to two hours of free search time nor 100 free pages of duplication of documents.
(ii)
Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requestors.
The Commission will provide documents to requestors in this category for the cost of duplication of the records provided by the Commission in response to the request, according to the Commission's schedule of fees as set forth at paragraph (c)(4) of this section, excluding charges for the first 100 pages of duplication. Requestors in this category will not be charged for search time. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requestors must show that the request is being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research.
(iii)
Requestors who are representatives of the news media.
The Commission will provide documents to requestors in
this category for the cost of duplication of the records provided by the Commission in response to the request, according to the Commission's schedule of fees as set forth at paragraph (c)(4) of this section, excluding charges for the first 100 pages of duplication. Requestors in this category will not be charged for search time. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, the requestor must meet the criteria listed at 11 CFR 4.1(n) and his or her request must not be made for a commercial use. A request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requestor shall not be considered to be a request that is for a commercial use.
(iv)
All other requestors.
The Commission will charge requestors who do not fit into any of the categories listed in paragraph (c)(1)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this section the full direct costs of searching for and duplicating records in response to the request, according to the Commission's schedule of fees as set forth at paragraph (c)(4) of this section, excluding charges for the first two hours of search time and the first 100 pages of duplication. Requests from persons for records about themselves will continue to be treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, which permit fees only for duplication.
(2) The Commission may assess fees for the full allowable direct costs of searching for documents in response to a request even if the Commission fails to locate any documents which are responsive to that request and, in the case of commercial use requestors, of reviewing documents located in response to a request which the Commission determines are exempt from disclosure.
(3) If the Commission estimates that search or duplication charges are likely to exceed $25.00, it will notify the requestor of the estimated amount of the fee unless the requestor has indicated in advance a willingness to pay a fee as high as that estimated by the Commission. Through this notification, the Commission will offer the requestor the opportunity to confer with Commission staff to reformulate the original request in order to meet the requestor's needs at a lower cost.
(4) For a paper photocopy of a record, the fee will be $.07 per page, which has been calculated to include staff time. For other forms of duplication, including copies produced by computer, the Commission will charge the direct costs, including staff time and the actual cost of any digital storage device provided. The Commission will charge $7.50 for certification of a document. The Commission will not charge a fee for ordinary packaging and mailing of records requested. When a request for special mailing or delivery services is received the Commission will package the records requested. The requestor shall make all arrangements for pick-up and delivery of the requested materials. The requestor shall pay all costs associated with special mailing or delivery services directly to the courier or mail service.
(5) The Commission will advise the requestor of the identity of any private contractor who will perform the duplication services. If fees are charged for such services, they shall be made payable to that private contractor and shall be forwarded to the Commission.
(d)
Interest charges.
FOIA requestors should pay fees within 30 days following the day on which the invoice for that request was sent to the requestor. If the invoice is unpaid on the 31st day following the day on which the invoice was sent, the Commission will begin assessing interest charges, which will accrue from the date the invoice was mailed. Interest will be charged at a rate that is equal to the average investment rate for the Treasury tax and loan accounts for the 12-month period ending on September 30 of each year, rounded to the nearest whole percentage point, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717. The accrual of interest will be stayed by the Commission's receipt of the fee, even if the fee has not yet been processed.
(e)
Aggregating requests.
A requestor may not file multiple requests, each seeking portions of a document or documents, in order to avoid payment of fees. When the Commission reasonably believes that a FOIA requestor or group of requestors acting in concert is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the
Commission will aggregate any such requests and charge the appropriate fees. In making this determination, the Commission will consider the time period in which the requests have occurred, the relationship of the requestors, and the subject matter of the requests.
(f)
Advance payments.
The Commission will require a requestor to make an advance payment,
i.e.
, a payment before work is commenced or continued on a request, when:
(1) The Commission estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requestor may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250. In such a case, the Commission will notify the requestor of the likely cost and, where the requestor has a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees, obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment, or in the case of a requestor with no FOIA fee payment history, the Commission will require an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated charges; or
(2) A requestor has previously failed to pay a fee in a timely fashion (
i.e.
, within 30 days of the date of the billing). In such a case, the Commission may require that the requestor pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest or demonstrate that the fee has been paid and make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the Commission begins to process a new request or a pending request from that requestor.
(3) If the provisions of paragraph (f) (1) or (2) of this section apply, the administrative time limits prescribed in 11 CFR 4.7(c) will begin only after the Commission has received the payments or the requestor has made acceptable arrangements to make the payments required by paragraph (f) (1) or (2) of this section.

§ 5.6
Fees.
(a) Fees may be charged for copies of records which are furnished to a requester under this part and for the staff time spent in locating and reproducing such records at the rate of $.05 per page for paper copies, including paper copies from microfilm; $4.50 per half hour of staff time after the first half hour; and $7.50 for certification of a document. Such fees shall not exceed the Commission's direct cost of processing requests for those records computed on the basis of the actual number of copies produced and the staff time expended in fulfilling the particular request.
(b) In the event the anticipated fees for all pending requests from the same requester exceed $25.00, records will not be searched, nor copies furnished, until the requester pays, or makes acceptable arrangements to pay, the total amount due. If any fee is not precisely ascertainable, an estimate will be made by the Commission and the requester will be required to forward the fee so estimated. In the event any advance payment differs from the actual fee, an appropriate adjustment will be made at the time the copies are made available by the Commission.
(c) The Commission may reduce or waive payments of fees hereunder if it determines that such waiver or reduction is in the public interest because the furnishing of the requested information to the particular requester involved can be considered as primarily benefiting the general public as opposed to primarily benefiting the person or organization requesting the information.

[Reserved]
§ 6.130
General prohibitions against discrimination.

(ii) Afford a qualified handicapped person an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others;

(vi) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate as a member of planning or advisory boards; or
(vii) Otherwise limit a qualified handicapped person in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving the aid, benefit, or service.
(2) The Commission may not deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate in programs or activities that are not separate or different, despite the existence of permissibly separate or different programs or activities.
(3) The Commission may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration the purpose or effect of which would—
(i) Subject qualified handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap;
(ii) Defeat or substantially impair accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with respect to handicapped persons; or
(iii) Perpetuate the discrimination of another agency.
(4) The Commission may not, in determining the site or location of a facility, make selections the purpose or effect of which would—

(ii) Defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with respect to handicapped persons.
(5) The Commission, in the selection of procurement contractors, may not use criteria that subject qualified handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap.

However, the programs or activities of entities that are certified by the Commission are not, themselves, covered by this part.
(c) The exclusion of nonhandicapped persons from the benefits of a program limited by Federal statute or Executive order to handicapped persons or the exclusion of a specific class of handicapped persons from a program limited by Federal statute or Executive Order to a different class of handicapped persons is not prohibited by this part.
(d) The Commission will administer programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped persons.
§§ 6.131-6.139
[Reserved]
§ 6.140
Employment.
No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of handicap, be subjected to discrimination in employment under any program or activity conducted by the Commission. The definitions, requirements, and procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), as established in 29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or activities.
§§ 6.141-6.148
[Reserved]
§ 6.149
Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.
Except as otherwise provided in 11 CFR 6.150 and 11 CFR 6.151, no qualified handicapped person shall be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the Commission because its facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons.
§ 6.150
Program accessibility; Existing facilities.
(a)
General.
The Commission will operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—
(1) Necessarily require the Commission to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;
(2) Require the Commission to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. The Commission has the burden of proving that compliance with 11 CFR 6.150(a) would result in such alterations or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Commission after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Commission will take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such a burden but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
(b)
Methods.
The Commission may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The Commission is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The Commission, in making alterations to existing buildings, will meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157) and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the Commission will give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.
(c)
Time period for compliance.
The Commission will comply with the obligations established under this section within sixty days of the effective date of this part except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes will be made within three years of the effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.
(d)
Transition plan.
In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the Commission will develop, within six months of the effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The plan will be developed with the assistance of interested persons, including handicapped persons and organizations representing handicapped persons. A copy of the transition plan will be made available for public inspection. The plan will, at a minimum—
(1) Identify physical obstacles in the Commission's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;
(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;
(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period;
(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan; and
(5) Identify the persons or groups with whose assistance the plan was prepared.
§ 6.151
Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.
Each building or part of a building that is constucted or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the Commission shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act, 42 U.S.C. 4151-4157, as established
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.
§§ 6.152-6.159
[Reserved]
§ 6.160
Communications.
(a) The Commission will take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.
(1) The Commission will furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the Commission.
(i) In determination what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the Commission will give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.
(ii) The Commission need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.
(2) Where the Commission communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunications devices for deaf persons (TDD's), or equally effective telecommunication systems will be used.
(b) The Commission will ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.
(c) The Commission will provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.
(d) The Commission will take appropriate steps to provide handicapped persons with information regarding their section 504 rights under the Commission's programs of activities.
(e) This section does not require the Commission to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. The Commission has the burden of proving that compliance with this section would result in such alterations or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Commission after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Commission will take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such a burden but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

§ 8.1
Purpose and scope.
This part prescribes standards and procedures under which the Commission will collect and dispose of certain debts owed to the United States, as described in 11 CFR 8.2. The regulations in this part implement the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, 31 U.S.C. 3701, 3711, and 3716-3720A, as amended; and the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 31 CFR parts 900-904.

§ 8.2
Debts that are covered.
(a) The procedures covered by this part apply to debts that are either owed by current and former Commission employees, or arise from the provision of goods or services by contractors or vendors doing business with the Commission.
(b) The procedures covered by this part do not apply to any of the following debts:

(3) Debts based in whole or in part on conduct in violation of the antitrust laws.
(4) Debts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(6) Debts that have become subject to salary offset under 5 U.S.C. 5514.
§ 8.3
Administrative collection of claims.
(a) The Commission shall act to collect all claims or debts. These collection activities will be undertaken promptly and follow up action will be taken as appropriate in accordance with 31 CFR 901.1.
(b) The Commission may take any and all appropriate collection actions authorized and required by the Debt Collection Act of 1982, as amended by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, 31 U.S.C. 3701
et seq.
The U.S. Department of the Treasury regulations at 31 CFR 285.2, 285.4, 285.7 and 285.11, and the Federal Claims Collection Standards issued jointly by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of the Treasury at 31 CFR parts 900-904 also apply. The Commission has adopted these regulations by cross-reference.
(c) The Commission will refer to the Dept. of Treasury all debt that has been delinquent for more than 180 days, and may refer to the Dept. of Treasury any debt that has been delinquent for 180 days or less. On behalf of the Commission, the U.S. Department of the Treasury will attempt to collect the debt, in accordance with the statutory and regulatory requirements and authorities applicable to the debt and action. This may include referral to another debt collection center, a private collection contractor, or the Department of Justice for litigation.
See
31 CFR 285.12 (Transfer of debts to Treasury for collection). This requirement does not apply to any debt that:
(1) Is in litigation or foreclosure;
(2) Will be disposed of under an approved asset sale program;
(3) Has been referred to a private collection contractor for a period of time acceptable to the U.S. Department of the Treasury; or
(4) Will be collected under internal offset procedures within three years after the debt first became delinquent.
(d) The U.S. Department of the Treasury is authorized to charge a fee for services rendered regarding referred or transferred debts. The Commission will add the fee to the debt as an administrative cost, in accordance with 11 CFR 8.5.
§ 8.4
Bankruptcy claims.
When the Commission learns that a bankruptcy petition has been filed by a debtor, before proceeding with further collection action, the Commission will take any necessary action in accordance with the provision of 31 CFR 901.2(h).
§ 8.5
Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.

(b) The Commission shall waive collection of interest and administrative costs on a debt or any portion of the debt that is paid in full within thirty
days after the date on which the interest begins to accrue.
(c) The Commission may waive collection of interest, penalties, and administrative costs if it:
(1) Determines that collection is against equity and good conscience or not in the best interest of the United States, including when an administrative offset or installment agreement is in effect; or
(2) Determines that waiver is appropriate under the criteria for compromise of debts set forth at 31 CFR 902.2(a).
(d) The Commission is authorized to impose interest and related charges on debts not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717, in accordance with common law.

(E) In the case of a communication appearing on a television broadcast station or network, where the Congressional district or State lies entirely within the station's or network's Grade B broadcast contour, that the population of the Congressional district or State is 50,000 or more; or

(ii) Cable or satellite television viewership is determined by multiplying the number of subscribers within a Congressional district or State, or a part thereof, as appropriate, by the current national average household size, as determined by the Bureau of the Census.
(iii) A determination that a communication can be received by 50,000 or more persons based on the application of the formula at paragraph (b)(7)(i)(G) or (H) of this section shall create a rebuttable presumption that may be overcome by demonstrating that—

# Source:
67 FR 50585, Aug. 5, 2002, unless otherwise noted.
§ 100.51
Scope.
(a) The term
contribution
includes the payments, services, or other things of value described in this subpart.
(b) For the purpose of this subpart, a contribution or payment made by an individual shall not be attributed to any other individual, unless otherwise specified by that other individual in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(k).
§ 100.52
Gift, subscription, loan, advance or deposit of money.
(a) A gift, subscription, loan (except for a loan made in accordance with 11 CFR 100.82 and 100.83), advance, or deposit of money or anything of value made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office is a contribution.
(b) For purposes of this section, the term
loan
includes a guarantee, endorsement, and any other form of security.
(1) A loan that exceeds the contribution limitations of 52 U.S.C. 30116 and 11 CFR part 110 shall be unlawful whether or not it is repaid.
(2) A loan is a contribution at the time it is made and is a contribution to the extent that it remains unpaid. The aggregate amount loaned to a candidate or committee by a contributor, when added to other contributions from that individual to that candidate or committee, shall not exceed the contribution limitations set forth at 11 CFR part 110. A loan, to the extent it is repaid, is no longer a contribution.
(3) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, a loan is a contribution by each endorser or guarantor. Each endorser or guarantor shall be deemed to have contributed that portion of the total amount of the loan for which he or she agreed to be liable in a written agreement. Any reduction in the unpaid balance of the loan shall reduce proportionately the amount endorsed or guaranteed by each endorser or guarantor in such written agreement. In the event that such agreement does not stipulate the portion of the loan for which each endorser or guarantor is liable, the loan shall be considered a loan by each endorser or guarantor in the same proportion to the unpaid balance that each endorser or guarantor bears to the total number of endorsers or guarantors.
(4) A candidate may obtain a loan on which his or her spouse's signature is required when jointly owned assets are used as collateral or security for the loan. The spouse shall not be considered a contributor to the candidate's campaign if the value of the candidate's share of the property used as collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the loan that is used for the candidate's campaign.
(5) If a political committee makes a loan to any person, such loan shall be subject to the limitations of 11 CFR part 110. Repayment of the principal amount of such loan to such political committee shall not be a contribution by the debtor to the lender committee. Such repayment shall be made with funds that are subject to the prohibitions of 11 CFR 110.20 and part 114. The payment of interest to such committee by the debtor shall be a contribution only to the extent that the interest paid exceeds a commercially reasonable rate prevailing at the time the loan is made. All payments of interest shall be made from funds subject to the prohibitions of 11 CFR 110.20 and part 114.
(c) For purposes of this section, the term
money
includes currency of the United States or of any foreign nation, checks, money orders, or any other negotiable instruments payable on demand.
(d)(1) For purposes of this section, the term
anything of value
includes all in-kind contributions. Unless specifically exempted under 11 CFR part 100, subpart C, the provision of any goods or services without charge or at a charge that is less than the usual and normal charge for such goods or services is a contribution. Examples of such goods or services include, but are not limited to: Securities, facilities, equipment, supplies, personnel, advertising services, membership lists, and
mailing lists. If goods or services are provided at less than the usual and normal charge, the amount of the in-kind contribution is the difference between the usual and normal charge for the goods or services at the time of the contribution and the amount charged the political committee.
(2) For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section,
usual and normal charge for goods
means the price of those goods in the market from which they ordinarily would have been purchased at the time of the contribution; and usual and normal charge for any services, other than those provided by an unpaid volunteer, means the hourly or piecework charge for the services at a commercially reasonable rate prevailing at the time the services were rendered.

§ 100.53
Attendance at a fundraiser or political event.
The entire amount paid to attend a fundraiser or other political event and the entire amount paid as the purchase price for a fundraising item sold by a political committee is a contribution.
§ 100.54
Compensation for personal services.
The payment by any person of compensation for the personal services of another person if those services are rendered without charge to a political committee for any purpose, except for legal and accounting services provided under 11 CFR 100.85 and 100.86, is a contribution. No compensation is considered paid to any employee under any of the following conditions:
(a)
Paid on an hourly or salaried basis.
If an employee is paid on an hourly or salaried basis and is expected to work a particular number of hours per period, no contribution results if the employee engages in political activity during what would otherwise be a regular work period, provided that the taken or released time is made up or completed by the employee within a reasonable time.
(b)
Paid on commission or piecework basis.
No contribution results where an employee engages in political activity during what would otherwise be normal working hours if the employee is paid on a commission or piecework basis, or is paid only for work actually performed and the employee's time is considered his or her own to use as he or she sees fit.
(c)
Vacation or earned leave time.
No contribution results where the time used by the employee to engage in political activity is bona fide, although compensable, vacation time or other earned leave time.
[67 FR 50585, Aug. 5, 2002, as amended at 81 FR 34863, June 1, 2016]
§ 100.55
Extension of credit.
The extension of credit by any person is a contribution unless the credit is extended in the ordinary course of the person's business and the terms are substantially similar to extensions of credit to nonpolitical debtors that are of similar risk and size of obligation. If a creditor fails to make a commercially reasonable attempt to collect the debt, a contribution will result. (See 11 CFR 116.3 and 116.4.) If a debt owed by a political committee is forgiven or settled for less than the amount owed, a contribution results unless such debt is settled in accordance with the standards set forth at 11 CFR 116.3 and 116.4.
§ 100.56
Office building or facility for national party committees.
A gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value to a national party committee for the purchase or construction of an office building or facility is a contribution.

(i) The amount of the loan(s) obtained the basis of such funds does not exceed the amount of pledged funds;

Combining contributions with other payments.
A contributor may write a check or authorize a credit card or electronic payment that represents both a contribution and payment of dues or other fees. The combined payment must be made from the contributor's personal account or on a non-repayable corporate drawing account of the individual contributor. Under a payroll deduction plan, an employer may make a payment on behalf of its employees to a union or its agent that represents a combined payment of voluntary contributions to the union's separate segregated fund and union dues or other employee deductions.

If any expenditure is made from the account, other than a transfer of funds to an affiliated committee, the account shall be considered a depository of the recipient committee and all activity of that account shall be reported; or
(B) Deposit the contributions collected into the collecting agent's treasury account. The collecting agent shall keep separate records of all receipts and deposits that represent contributions to the separate segregated fund and, in the case of cash contributions, the collecting agent shall make separate deposits of such funds; or
(C) Deposit the contributions collected into an account otherwise established solely for State or local election activity. The collecting agent shall keep separate records of all receipts and deposits that represent contributions to the separate segregated fund; or
(D) In the case of cash contributions, transmit the contributions to the separate segregated fund in the form of money orders or cashier's checks.
(5)
Contributor information.
The collecting agent shall comply with the requirements of 11 CFR 102.8 regarding transmittal of contributions and contributor information to the separate segregated fund, except that if contributions of $50 or less are received at a mass collection, a record shall be kept of the date, the total amount collected, and the name of the function at which the collection was made.
(6)
Retention of records.
The collecting agent shall retain all records of contribution deposits and transmittals under this section for a period of three years and shall make these records available to the Commission on request. The separate segregated fund
shall keep a record of all transmittals of contributions received from collecting agents under this section, and shall retain these records for a period of three years.

§ 102.9
Accounting for contributions and expenditures (52 U.S.C. 30102(c)).

(a) An account shall be kept by any reasonable accounting procedure of all contributions received by or on behalf of the political committee.
(1) For contributions in excess of $50, such account shall include the name and address of the contributor and the date of receipt and amount of such contribution.
(2) For contributions from any person whose contributions aggregate more than $200 during a calendar year, such account shall include the identification of the person, and the date of receipt and amount of such contribution.
(3) For contributions from a political committee, such account shall include the identification of the political committee and the date of receipt and amount of such contribution.
(4) In addition to the account to be kept under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for contributions in excess of $50, the treasurer of a political committee or an agent authorized by the treasurer shall maintain a record of each contribution received. A record of a contribution by check or written instrument must contain an image of that instrument. A record of the receipt of a contribution must include sufficient information to associate that contribution with its deposit in the political committee's campaign depository, such as, for example, a batch number.
(b)(1) An account shall be kept of all disbursements made by or on behalf of the political committee. Such account shall consist of a record of:
(i) The name and address of every person to whom any disbursement is made;
(ii) The date, amount, and purpose of the disbursement; and
(iii) If the disbursement is made for a candidate, the name and office (including State and congressional district, if any) sought by that candidate.

purpose
has the same meaning given the term at 11 CFR 104.3(b)(3)(i)(A).
(2) In addition to the account to be kept under 11 CFR 102.9(b)(1), a receipt or invoice from the payee or a canceled check or record of electronic transfer to the payee shall be obtained and kept for each disbursement in excess of $200 by or on behalf of, the committee, except that credit card transactions, shall be documented in accordance with 11 CFR 102.9(b)(2)(ii) and disbursements by share draft or check drawn on a credit union account shall be documented in accordance with 11 CFR 102.9(b)(2)(iii).
(i)(A) For purposes of 11 CFR 102.9(b)(2),
payee
means the person who provides the goods or services to the committee or agent thereof in return for payment, except for an advance of $500 or less for travel and subsistence to an individual who will be the recipient of the goods or services.

(d) In performing recordkeeping duties, the treasurer or his or her authorized agent shall use his or her best efforts to obtain, maintain and submit the required information and shall keep a complete record of such efforts. If there is a showing that best efforts have been made, any records of a committee shall be deemed to be in compliance with this Act. With regard to the
requirements of 11 CFR 102.9(b)(2) concerning receipts, invoices and cancelled checks, the treasurer will not be deemed to have exercised best efforts to obtain, maintain and submit the records unless he or she has made at least one written effort per transaction to obtain a duplicate copy of the invoice, receipt, or cancelled check.
(e)(1) If the candidate, or his or her authorized committee(s), receives contributions that are designated for use in connection with the general election pursuant to 11 CFR 110.1(b) prior to the date of the primary election, such candidate or such committee(s) shall use an acceptable accounting method to distinguish between contributions received for the primary election and contributions received for the general election. Acceptable accounting methods include, but are not limited to:
(i) The designation of separate accounts for each election, caucus or convention; or
(ii) The establishment of separate books and records for each election.
(2) Regardless of the method used under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an authorized committee's records must demonstrate that, prior to the primary election, recorded cash on hand was at all times equal to or in excess of the sum of general election contributions received less the sum of general election disbursements made.
(3) If a candidate is not a candidate in the general election, any contributions made for the general election shall be refunded to the contributors, redesignated in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(b)(5) or 110.2(b)(5), or reattributed in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(k)(3), as appropriate.
(f) The treasurer shall maintain the records required by 11 CFR 110.1(l), concerning designations, redesignations, reattributions, and the dates of contributions. If the treasurer does not maintain these records, 11 CFR 110.1(l)(5) shall apply.

§ 102.14
Names of political committees (52 U.S.C. 30102(e)(4) and (5)).

§ 102.16
Notice: Solicitation of contributions (52 U.S.C. 30120).
Each political committee shall comply with the notice requirements for solicitation of contributions set forth at 11 CFR 110.11.
§ 102.17
Joint fundraising by committees other than separate segregated funds.
(a)
General.
Nothing in this section shall supersede 11 CFR part 300, which prohibits any person from soliciting, receiving, directing, transferring, or spending any non-Federal funds, or from transferring Federal funds for Federal election activities.
(1)(i) Political committees may engage in joint fundraising with other political committees or with unregistered committees or organizations. The participants in a joint fundraising effort under this section shall either establish a separate committee or select a participating committee, to act as fundraising representative for all participants. The fundraising representative shall be a reporting political committee and an authorized committee of each candidate for federal office participating in the joint fundraising activity. If the participants establish a separate committee to act as the fundraising representative, the separate committee shall not be a participant in any other joint fundraising effort, but the separate committee may conduct more than one joint fundraising effort for the participants.
(ii) The participants may hire a commercial fundraising firm or other agent to assist in conducting the joint fundraising activity. In that case, however, the fundraising representative shall still be responsible for ensuring that the recordkeeping and reporting requirements set forth in this section are met.
(2) The procedures in 11 CFR 102.17(c) will govern all joint fundraising activity conducted under this section. The participants in joint fundraising activity may include political party committees (whether or not they are political committees under 11 CFR 100.5), candidate committees, multicandidate committees, and unregistered organizations which do not qualify as collecting agents under 11 CFR 102.6(b).
(3) A fundraising representative conducting joint fundraising under this section is distinguished from an unregistered organization acting as a collecting agent under 11 CFR 102.6(b). If a separate segregated fund or an unregistered organization qualifies and acts as a collecting agent under 11 CFR 102.6(b), the provisions of 11 CFR 102.17 will not apply to that fundraising activity.
(b)
Fundraising representatives
—(1)
Separate fundraising committee as fundraising representative.
Participating committees may establish a separate political committee to act as fundraising representative for all participants. This separate committee shall be a reporting political committee and shall collect contributions, pay fundraising costs from gross proceeds and from funds advanced by participants, and disburse net proceeds to each participant.
(2)
Participating committee as fundraising representative.
All participating
committees may select one participant to act as fundraising representative for all participants. The fundraising representative must be a political committee as defined in 11 CFR 100.5. The fundraising representative and any other participating committees may collect contributions; however, all contributions received by other participants shall be forwarded to the fundraising representative as required by 11 CFR 102.8. The fundraising representative shall pay fundraising costs from gross proceeds and from funds advanced by participants and shall disburse net proceeds to each participant.
(3)
Funds advanced for fundraising costs.
(i) Except as provided in 11 CFR 102.17(b) (3)(ii) and (iii), the amount of funds advanced by each participant for fundraising costs shall be in proportion to the allocation formula agreed upon under 11 CFR 102.17 (c)(1).
(ii) A participant may advance more than its proportionate share of the fundraising costs, however, the amount advanced which is in excess of the participant's proportionate share shall not exceed the amount that participant could legally contribute to the remaining participants.
See
11 CFR 102.12(c)(2) and part 110.
(iii) If all the participants are affiliated under 11 CFR 110.3 or if the participants are all party committees of the same political party, there is no limit on the amount a participant may advance for fundraising costs on behalf of the other participants.
(c)
Joint fundraising procedures.
The requirements of 11 CFR 102.17(c)(1) through (8) shall govern joint fundraising activity conducted under this section.
(1)
Written agreement.
The participants in a joint fundraising activity shall enter into a written agreement, whether or not all participants are political committees under 11 CFR 100.5. The written agreement shall identify the fundraising representative and shall state a formula for the allocation of fundraising proceeds. The formula shall be stated as the amount or percentage of each contribution received to be allocated to each participant. The fundraising representative shall retain the written agreement for a period of three years and shall make it available to the Commission on request.
(2)
Fundraising notice.
In addition to any notice required under 11 CFR 110.11, a joint fundraising notice shall be included with every solicitation for contributions.
(i) This notice shall include the following information:
(A) The names of all committees participating in the joint fundraising activity whether or not such committees are political committees under 11 CFR 100.5; and
(B) The allocation formula to be used for distributing joint fundraising proceeds; and
(C) A statement informing contributors that, notwithstanding the stated allocation formula, they may designate their contributions for a particular participant or participants; and
(D) A statement informing contributors that the allocation formula may change if a contributor makes a contribution which would exceed the amount that contributor may give to any participant.
(ii) In the following situations, the notice shall include the following additional information:
(A) If one or more participants engage in the joint fundraising activity solely to satisfy outstanding debts, a statement informing contributors that the allocation formula may change if a participant receives sufficient funds to pay its outstanding debts; and
(B) If one or more participants can lawfully accept contributions that are prohibited under the Act, a statement informing contributors that contributions from prohibited sources will be distributed only to those participants that can accept them.
(3)
Separate depository account.
(i) The participants or the fundraising representative shall establish a separate depository account to be used solely for the receipt and disbursement of the joint fundraising proceeds. All contributions deposited into the separate depository account must be permissible under the Act. Each political committee shall amend its Statement of Organization to reflect the account as an additional depository. If one or more participants can lawfully accept contributions that are prohibited under
the Act, the participants may either establish a second depository account for contributions received from prohibited sources or they may forward such contributions directly to the nonfederal participants.
(ii) The fundraising representative shall deposit all joint fundraising proceeds in the separate depository account within ten days of receipt as required by 11 CFR 103.3. The fundraising representative may delay distribution of the fundraising proceeds to the participants until all contributions are received and all expenses are paid.
(iii) For contribution reporting and limitation purposes, the date of receipt of a contribution by a participating political committee is the date that the contribution is received by the fundraising representative. The fundraising representative shall report contributions in the reporting period in which they are received. Participating political committees shall report joint fundraising proceeds in accordance with 11 CFR 102.17(c)(8) when such funds are received from the fundraising representative.
(4)
Recordkeeping requirements.
(i) The fundraising representative and participating committees shall screen all contributions received to insure that the prohibitions and limitations of 11 CFR parts 110 and 114 are observed. Participating political committees shall make their contributor records available to the fundraising representative to enable the fundraising representative to carry out its duty to screen contributions.
(ii) The fundraising representative shall collect and retain contributor information with regard to gross proceeds as required under 11 CFR 102.8 and shall also forward such information to participating political committees. The fundraising representative shall also keep a record of the total amount of contributions received from prohibited sources, if any, and of all transfers of prohibited contributions to participants that can accept them.
(iii) The fundraising representative shall retain the records required under 11 CFR 102.9 regarding fundraising disbursements for a period of three years. Commercial fundraising firms or agents shall forward such information to the fundraising representative.
(5)
Contribution limitations.
Except to the extent that the contributor has previously contributed to any of the participants, a contributor may make a contribution to the joint fundraising effort which contribution represents the total amount that the contributor could contribute to all of the participants under the applicable limits of 11 CFR 110.1 and 110.2.
(6)
Allocation of gross proceeds.
(i) The fundraising representative shall allocate proceeds according to the formula stated in the fundraising agreement. If distribution according to the allocation formula extinguishes the debts of one or more participants and results in a surplus for those participants or if distribution under the formula results in a violation of the contribution limits of 11 CFR 110.1(a), the fundraising representative may reallocate the excess funds. Reallocation shall be based upon the remaining participants' proportionate shares under the allocation formula. If reallocation results in a violation of a contributor's limit under 11 CFR 110.1, the fundraising representative shall return to the contributor the amount of the contribution that exceeds the limit.
(ii) Designated contributions which exceed the contributor's limit to the designated participant under 11 CFR part 110 may not be reallocated by the fundraising representative absent the prior written permission of the contributor.
(iii) If any participants can lawfully accept contributions from sources prohibited under the Act, any such contributions that are received are not required to be distributed according to the allocation formula.
(7)
Allocation of expenses and distribution of net proceeds.
(i) If participating committees are not affiliated as defined in 11 CFR 110.3 prior to the joint fundraising activity and are not committees of the same political party;
(A) After gross contributions are allocated among the participants under 11 CFR 102.17(c)(6), the fundraising representative shall calculate each participant's share of expenses based on the percentage of the total receipts each participant had been allocated. If
contributions from sources prohibited under the Act have been received and distributed under 11 CFR 102.17(c)(6)(iii), those contributions need not be included in the total receipts for the purpose of allocating expenses under this section. To calculate each participant's net proceeds, the fundraising representative shall subtract the participant's share of expenses from the amount that participant has been allocated from gross proceeds.
(B) A participant may only pay expenses on behalf of another participant subject to the contribution limits of 11 CFR part 110.
(C) The expenses from a series of fundraising events or activities shall be allocated among the participants on a per-event basis regardless of whether the participants change or remain the same throughout the series.
(ii) If participating committees are affiliated as defined in 11 CFR 110.3 prior to the joint fundraising activity or if participants are party committees of the same political party, expenses need not be allocated among those participants. Payment of such expenses by an unregistered committee or organization on behalf of an affiliated political committee may cause the unregistered organization to become a political committee.
(iii) Payment of expenses may be made from gross proceeds by the fundraising representative.
(8)
Reporting of receipts and disbursements
—(i)
Reporting receipts.
(A) The fundraising representative shall report all funds received in the reporting period in which they are received. The fundraising representative shall report the total amount of contributions received from prohibited sources during the reporting period, if any, as a memo entry. Each Schedule A filed by the fundraising representative under this section shall clearly indicate that the contributions reported on that schedule represent joint fundraising proceeds.
(B) After distribution of net proceeds, each participating political committee shall report its share of net proceeds received as a transfer-in from the fundraising representative. Each participating political committee shall also file a memo Schedule A itemizing its share of gross receipts as contributions from original contributors to the extent required under 11 CFR 104.3(a).
(ii)
Reporting disbursements.
The fundraising representative shall report all disbursements in the reporting period in which they are made.

§ 103.1
Notification of the commission.
Each committee shall notify the Commission of the campaign depository(ies) it has designated, pursuant to 11 CFR 101.1 and 103.2.
§ 103.2
Depositories (52 U.S.C. 30102(h)(1)).
Each political committee shall designate one or more State banks, federally chartered depository institutions (including a national bank), or depository institutions the depositor accounts of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, or the National Credit Union Administration, as its campaign depository or depositories. One or more depositories may be established in one or more States. Each political committee shall maintain at least one checking account or transaction account at one of its depositories. Additional accounts may be established at each depository.
§ 103.3
Deposit of receipts and disbursements (52 U.S.C. 30102(h)(1)).
(a)(1) All receipts by a political committee shall be deposited in account(s) established pursuant to 11 CFR 103.2, except that any contribution may be,
within 10 days of the treasurer's receipt, returned to the contributor without being deposited. The treasurer of the committee shall be responsible for making such deposits. All deposits shall be made within 10 days of the treasurer's receipt. Contributions deposited in a merchant account of a payment processor described in 11 CFR 102.8(d) in the ordinary course of that payment processor's business are not receipts by the committee, but are, instead, contributions to be forwarded by that payment processor under 11 CFR 102.8.
(2) A committee shall make all disbursements by check or similar draft, including electronic transfer, from an account at its designated campaign depository, except for expenditures of $100 or less made from a petty cash fund maintained pursuant to 11 CFR 102.11. Funds may be transferred from the depository for investment purposes, but shall be returned to the depository before such funds are used to make expenditures.
(b) The treasurer shall be responsible for examining all contributions received for evidence of illegality and for ascertaining whether contributions received, when aggregated with other contributions from the same contributor, exceed the contribution limitations of 11 CFR 110.1 or 110.2.
(1) Contributions that present genuine questions as to whether they were made by corporations, labor organizations, foreign nationals, or Federal contractors may be, within ten days of the treasurer's receipt, either deposited into a campaign depository under 11 CFR 103.3(a) or returned to the contributor. If any such contribution is deposited, the treasurer shall make his or her best efforts to determine the legality of the contribution. The treasurer shall make at least one written or oral request for evidence of the legality of the contribution. Such evidence includes, but is not limited to, a written statement from the contributor explaining why the contribution is legal, or a written statement by the treasurer memorializing an oral communication explaining why the contribution is legal. If the contribution cannot be determined to be legal, the treasurer shall, within thirty days of the treasurer's receipt of the contribution, refund the contribution to the contributor.
(2) If the treasurer in exercising his or her responsibilities under 11 CFR 103.3(b) determined that at the time a contribution was received and deposited, it did not appear to be made by a corporation, labor organization, foreign national or Federal contractor, or made in the name of another, but later discovers that it is illegal based on new evidence not available to the political committee at the time of receipt and deposit, the treasurer shall refund the contribution to the contributor within thirty days of the date on which the illegality is discovered. If the political committee does not have sufficient funds to refund the contribution at the time the illegality is discovered, the political committee shall make the refund from the next funds it receives.
(3) Contributions which on their face exceed the contribution limitations set forth in 11 CFR 110.1 or 110.2, and contributions which do not appear to be excessive on their face, but which exceed the contribution limits set forth in 11 CFR 110.1 or 110.2 when aggregated with other contributions from the same contributor, and contributions which cannot be accepted under the net debts outstanding provisions of 11 CFR 110.1(b)(3) and 110.2(b)(3) may be either deposited into a campaign depository under 11 CFR 103.3(a) or returned to the contributor. If any such contribution is deposited, the treasurer may request redesignation or reattribution of the contribution by the contributor in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(b), 110.1(k) or 110.2(b), as appropriate. If a redesignation or reattribution is not obtained, the treasurer shall, within sixty days of the treasurer's receipt of the contribution, refund the contribution to the contributor.
(4) Any contribution which appears to be illegal under 11 CFR 103.3(b) (1) or (3), and which is deposited into a campaign depository shall not be used for any disbursements by the political committee until the contribution has been determined to be legal. The political committee must either establish a
separate account in a campaign depository for such contributions or maintain sufficient funds to make all such refunds.
(5) If a contribution which appears to be illegal under 11 CFR 103.3(b) (1) or (3) is deposited in a campaign depository, the treasurer shall make and retain a written record noting the basis for the appearance of illegality. A statement noting that the legality of the contribution is in question shall be included in the report noting the receipt of the contribution. If a contribution is refunded to the contributor because it cannot be determined to be legal, the treasurer shall note the refund on the report covering the reporting period in which the refund is made.

Use of pseudonyms.
(1) To determine whether the names and addresses of its contributors are being used in violation of 11 CFR 104.15 to solicit contributions or for commercial purposes, a political committee may submit up to ten (10) pseudonyms on each report filed.
(2) For purposes of this section, a pseudonym is a wholly fictitious name which does not represent the name of an actual contributor to a committee.
(3) If a committee uses pseudonyms it shall subtract the total dollar amount of the fictitious contributions from the total amount listed as a memo entry on line 11(a) of the Detailed Summary page,
Unitemized contributions from individual persons other than political committees.
Thus, the committee will, for this purpose only, be overstating the amount of itemized contributions received and understating the amount of unitemized contributions received.

(g)
Building funds.
(1) A political party committee must report gifts, subscriptions, loans, advances, deposits of money, or anything of value that are used by the political party committee's Federal accounts to defray the costs of construction or purchase of the committee's office building. See 11 CFR 300.35. Such a receipt is a contribution subject to the limitations and prohibitions of the Act and reportable as a contribution, regardless of whether the contributor has designated the funds or things of value for such purpose and regardless of whether such funds are deposited in a separate Federal account dedicated to that purpose.
(2) Gifts, subscriptions, loans, advances, deposits of money, or anything
of value that are donated to a non-Federal account of a State or local party committee and are used by that party committee for the purchase or construction of its office building are not contributions subject to the reporting requirements of the Act. The reporting of such funds or things of value is subject to State law.
(3) Gifts, subscriptions, loans, advances, deposits of money, or anything of value that are used by a national committee of a political party to defray the costs of construction or purchase of the national committee's office building are contributions subject to the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section.

—(1)
Independent expenditures aggregating less than $10,000 in a calendar year.
For each election in which a political committee makes independent expenditures, the political committee shall aggregate its independent expenditures made in each calendar year to determine its reporting obligation. When a committee makes independent expenditures aggregating less than $10,000 for an election in any calendar year, up to and including the 20th day before an election, the committee must report those independent expenditures on Schedule E of the applicable FEC Form, at the time of its regular reports in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3, 104.5, and 104.9.
(2)
Independent expenditures aggregating $10,000 or more in a calendar year.

When a committee makes independent expenditures aggregating $10,000 or more for an election in any calendar year, up to and including the 20th day before an election, it must report those independent expenditures on Schedule E of the applicable FEC Form. Political committees must ensure that the Commission receives these reports by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard/Daylight Time on the second day following the date on which a communication that constitutes an independent expenditure is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated. Each time subsequent independent expenditures relating to the same election aggregate an additional $10,000 or more, the political committee must ensure that the Commission receives a new 48-hour report of the subsequent independent expenditures by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard/Daylight Time on the second day following the date on which the communication is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated. (
See
paragraph (f) of this section for aggregation.) Each 48-hour report must contain the information required by 11 CFR 104.3(b)(3)(vii) indicating whether the independent expenditure is made in support of, or in opposition to, the candidate involved. In addition to other permissible means of filing, a political committee may file the 48-hour reports under this section by any of the means permissible under 11 CFR 100.19(d)(3).
(c)
Reports of independent expenditures made less than 20 days, but more than 24 hours before the day of an election.
Political committees must ensure that the Commission receives reports of independent expenditures aggregating $1,000 or more with respect to a given election, after the 20th day, but more than 24 hours before 12:01 a.m. of the day of the election, by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard/Daylight Time on the day following the date on which a communication is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated. Each time subsequent independent expenditures relating to the same election aggregate an additional $1,000 or more, the political committee must ensure that the Commission receives a new 24-hour report of the subsequent independent expenditures by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard/Daylight Time on the day following the date on which a communication that constitutes an independent expenditure is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated. (See paragraph (f) of this section for aggregation.) Each 24-hour report shall contain the information required by 11 CFR 104.3(b)(3)(vii) indicating whether the independent expenditure is made in support of, or in opposition to, the candidate involved. Political committees may file reports under this section by any of the means permissible under 11 CFR 100.19(d)(3).
(d)
Verification.
Political committees must verify reports of independent expenditures filed under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section by one of the methods stated in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section. Any report verified under either of these methods shall be treated for all purposes (including penalties for perjury) in the same manner as a document verified by signature.
(1) For reports filed on paper (e.g., by hand-delivery, U.S. Mail or facsimile machine), the treasurer of the political committee that made the independent expenditure must certify, under penalty of perjury, the independence of the expenditure by handwritten signature immediately following the certification required by 11 CFR 104.3(b)(3)(vii).
(2) For reports filed by electronic mail, the treasurer of the political committee that made the independent expenditure shall certify, under penalty of perjury, the independence of the expenditure by electronic signature immediately following the certification required by 11 CFR 104.3(b)(3)(vii).
(e)
Where to file.
Reports of independent expenditures under this section and 11 CFR 109.10(b) shall be filed as follows:
(1) For independent expenditures in support of, or in opposition to, a candidate for President or Vice President: with the Commission and the Secretary of State for the State in which the expenditure is made.
(2) For independent expenditures in support of, or in opposition to, a candidate for the U.S. Senate or the House
of Representatives: With the Commission and the Secretary of State for the State in which the candidate is seeking election.
(3) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section, political committees and other persons shall not be required to file reports of independent expenditures with the Secretary of State if that State has obtained a waiver under 11 CFR 108.1(b).
(f)
Aggregating independent expenditures for reporting purposes.
(1) For purposes of determining whether 24-hour and 48-hour reports must be filed in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and 11 CFR 109.10(c) and (d), aggregations of independent expenditures must be calculated as of the first date on which a communication that constitutes an independent expenditure is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated, and as of the date that any such communication with respect to the same election is subsequently publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated. Every person must include in the aggregate total all disbursements during the calendar year for independent expenditures, and all enforceable contracts, either oral or written, obligating funds for disbursements during the calendar year for independent expenditures, where those independent expenditures are made with respect to the same election for Federal office.
(2) For purposes of determining whether 24-hour or 48-hour reports must be filed in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and 11 CFR 109.10(c) and (d), if the independent expenditure is made in support of or opposition to a candidate in a presidential primary election and is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated in six or more states but does not refer to any particular state, the date of the election is the date of the next upcoming presidential primary election among the presidential primary elections to be held in the states in which the independent expenditure is publicly distributed or disseminated.

§ 104.7
Best efforts (52 U.S.C. 30102(i)).
(a) When the treasurer of a political committee shows that best efforts have been used to obtain, maintain and submit the information required by the Act for the political committee, any report of such committee shall be considered in compliance with the Act.
(b) With regard to reporting the identification as defined at 11 CFR 100.12 of each person whose contribution(s) to the political committee and its affiliated political committees aggregate in excess of $200 in a calendar year (or in an election cycle in the case of an authorized committee) (pursuant to 11 CFR 104.3(a)(4)), the treasurer and the political committee will only be deemed to have exercised best efforts to obtain, maintain and report the required information if:
(1)(i) All written solicitations for contributions include a clear request for the contributor's full name, mailing address, occupation and name of employer, and include an accurate statement of Federal law regarding the collection and reporting of individual contributor identifications.
(A) The following are examples of acceptable statements for unauthorized committees, but are not the only allowable statements: “Federal law requires us to use our best efforts to collect and report the name, mailing address, occupation and name of employer of individuals whose contributions exceed $200 in a calendar year;”
and “To comply with Federal law, we must use best efforts to obtain, maintain, and submit the name, mailing address, occupation and name of employer of individuals whose contributions exceed $200 per calendar year.”
(B) The following are examples of acceptable statements for authorized committees, but are not the only allowable statements: “Federal law requires us to use our best efforts to collect and report the name, mailing address, occupation and name of employer of individuals whose contributions exceed $200 in an election cycle;” and “To comply with Federal law, we must use best efforts to obtain, maintain, and submit the name, mailing address, occupation and name of employer of individuals whose contributions exceed $200 per election cycle.”
(ii) The request and statement shall appear in a clear and conspicuous manner on any response material included in a solicitation. The request and statement are not clear and conspicuous if they are in small type in comparison to the solicitation and response materials, or if the printing is difficult to read or if the placement is easily overlooked.
(2) For each contribution received aggregating in excess of $200 per calendar year (or per election cycle, in the case of an authorized committee) which lacks required contributor information, such as the contributor's full name, mailing address, occupation or name of employer, the treasurer makes at least one effort after the receipt of the contribution to obtain the missing information. Such effort shall consist of either a written request sent to the contributor or an oral request to the contributor documented in writing. The written or oral request must be made no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the contribution. The written or oral request shall not include material on any other subject or any additional solicitation, except that it may include language solely thanking the contributor for the contribution. The request must clearly ask for the missing information, and must include the statement set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Written requests must include this statement in a clear and conspicuous manner. If the request is written, it shall be accompanied by a pre-addressed return post card or envelope for the response material;
(3) The treasurer reports all contributor information not provided by the contributor, but in the political committee's possession, or in its connected organization's possession, regarding contributor identifications, including information in contributor records, fundraising records and previously filed reports, in the same two-year election cycle in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3; and
(4)(i) If any of the contributor information is received after the contribution has been disclosed on a regularly scheduled report, the political committee shall either:
(A) File with its next regularly scheduled report, an amended memo Schedule A listing all contributions for which contributor identifications have been received during the reporting period covered by the next regularly scheduled report together with the dates and amounts of the contribution(s) and an indication of the previous report(s) to which the memo Schedule A relates; or
(B) File on or before its next regularly scheduled reporting date, amendments to the report(s) originally disclosing the contribution(s), which include the contributor identifications together with the dates and amounts of the contribution(s).
(ii) Amendments must be filed for all reports that cover the two-year election cycle in which the contribution was received and that disclose itemizable contributions from the same contributor. However, political committees are not required to file amendments to reports covering previous election cycles.

(A) The first part of the memo entry shall disclose all of the information for the contribution as it was originally reported on Schedule B;
(B) The second part of the memo entry shall disclose all of the information for the contribution as it was redesignated by the contributing political committee, including the election for which the contribution was redesignated and the date on which the redesignation was made.
(3) If an itemized contribution is reattributed by the contributor(s) in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(k), the treasurer shall report the reattribution in a memo entry on Schedule A of the report covering the reporting period in which the reattribution is received. The memo entry for each reattributed contribution shall be reported in the following manner—
(i) The first part of the memo entry shall disclose all of the information for the contribution as it was originally reported on Schedule A;
(ii) The second part of the memo entry shall disclose all of the information for the contribution as it was reattributed by the contributors, including the date on which the reattribution was received.

This information shall include the donating individual's or entity's name, mailing address, occupation or type of business, and the date of receipt and amount of any such donation. If a donor's name is known to have changed since an earlier donation reported during the calendar year, the exact name or address previously used shall be noted with the first reported donation from that donor subsequent to the name change. The memo entry shall also include, where applicable, the information required by paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.
(f) For reports covering activity on or before December 31, 2002, national party committees shall also disclose in a memo Schedule A information about each individual, committee, corporation, labor organization, or other entity that donates an aggregate amount in excess of $200 in a calendar year to the committee's building fund account(s).

For allocated expenditures, the committee must report the amount of each in-kind contribution, independent expenditure, or coordinated expenditure attributed to each candidate. If a payment also includes amounts attributable to one or more non-Federal candidates, and is made by a State, district, or local party committee with separate Federal and non-Federal accounts, and is not for a Federal election activity, then the payment shall be made according to the procedures set forth in 11 CFR 106.7(f), but shall be reported pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, as follows:

If the transfer includes funds for the allocable costs of more than one program or activity, the State, district, or local party committee must itemize the transfer, showing the amounts designated for each program or activity conducted on behalf of one or more clearly identified Federal candidates and one or more clearly identified non-Federal candidates.

Such a computer printout or screen capture shall constitute conclusive evidence that the reporting committee has consulted such websites and not found the name of the person sought, but shall not be the exclusive means by which the reporting committee may provide evidence that it has consulted such websites and not found the name of the person sought.
(iii) A reporting committee shall be subject to the reporting requirement under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if it had actual knowledge that, at the time a contribution was forwarded or received, the person whose name is sought was required to be listed on any registration or report described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.

§ 106.1
Allocation of expenses between candidates.
(a)
General rule.
(1) Expenditures, including in-kind contributions, independent expenditures, and coordinated expenditures made on behalf of more than one clearly identified Federal candidate shall be attributed to each such candidate according to the benefit reasonably expected to be derived. For example, in the case of a publication or broadcast communication, the attribution shall be determined by the proportion of space or time devoted to each candidate as compared to the total space or time devoted to all candidates. In the case of a fundraising program or event where funds are collected by one committee for more than one clearly identified candidate, the attribution shall be determined by the proportion of funds received by each candidate as compared to the total receipts by all candidates. In the case of a phone bank, the attribution shall be determined by the number of questions or statements devoted to each candidate as compared to the total number of questions or statements devoted to all candidates. These methods shall also be used to allocate payments involving both expenditures on behalf of one or more clearly identified Federal candidates and disbursements on behalf of one or more clearly identified non-Federal candidates.
(2) An expenditure made on behalf of more than one clearly identified Federal candidate shall be reported pursuant to 11 CFR 104.10(a) or 104.17(a), as appropriate. A payment that also includes amounts attributable to one or more non-Federal candidates, and that is made by a political committee with separate Federal and non-Federal accounts, shall be made according to the procedures set forth in 11 CFR 106.6(e) or 106.7(f), but shall be reported pursuant to 11 CFR 104.10(a) or 104.17(a). If a
State, district, or local party committee's payment on behalf of both a Federal candidate and a non-Federal candidate is for a Federal election activity, only Federal funds may be used for the entire payment. For Federal election activities, the provisions of 11 CFR 300.33 and 104.17(a) will apply to payments attributable to candidates.
(b) An authorized expenditure made by a candidate or political committee on behalf of another candidate shall be reported as a contribution in-kind (transfer) to the candidate on whose behalf the expenditure was made, except that expenditures made by party committees pursuant to § 109.32 or 109.33 need only be reported as an expenditure.
(c)
Exceptions:
(1) Expenditures for rent, personnel, overhead, general administrative, fund-raising, and other day-to-day costs of political committees need not be attributed to individual candidates, unless these expenditures are made on behalf of a clearly identified candidate and the expenditure can be directly attributed to that candidate.
(2) Expenditures for educational campaign seminars, for training of campaign workers, and for registration or get-out-the-vote drives of committees need not be attributed to individual candidates unless these expenditures are made on behalf of a clearly identified candidate, and the expenditure can be directly attributed to that candidate.
(3) Payments made for the cost of certain voter registration and get-out-the-vote activities conducted by State or local party organizations on behalf of any Presidential or Vice-Presidential candidate(s) are exempt from the definition of a contribution or an expenditure under 11 CFR 100.89 and 100.149. If the State or local party organization includes references to any candidate(s) seeking nomination or election to the House of Representatives or Senate of the United States the portion of the cost of such activities allocable to such candidate(s) shall be considered a contribution to or an expenditure on behalf of such candidate(s), unless such reference is incidental to the overall activity. If such reference is incidental to the overall activity, such costs shall not be considered a contribution to or expenditure on behalf of any candidate(s).
(d) For purposes of this section,
clearly identified
shall have the same meaning as set forth at 11 CFR 100.17.
(e) State, district, and local party committees, separate segregated funds, and nonconnected committees that make mixed Federal/non-Federal payments for activities other than an activity entailing an expenditure for a Federal candidate and disbursement for a non-Federal candidate, or that make mixed Federal/Levin fund payments, shall allocate those expenses in accordance with 11 CFR 106.6, 106.7, or 300.33, as appropriate.

General
—(1) This section applies to Presidential primary candidates receiving or expecting to receive federal matching funds pursuant to 11 CFR parts 9031
et seq.
The expenditures described in 11 CFR 106.2(b)(2) shall be allocated to a particular State if incurred by a candidate's authorized committee(s) for the purpose of influencing the nomination of that candidate for the office of President with respect to that State. An expenditure shall not necessarily be allocated to the State in which the expenditure is incurred or paid. In the event that the Commission disputes the candidate's allocation or claim of exemption for a particular expense, the candidate shall demonstrate, with supporting records, that his or her proposed method of allocation or claim of exemption was reasonable. Expenditures required to be allocated to the primary election under 11 CFR 9034.4(e) shall also be allocated to particular states in accordance with this section.
(2) Disbursements made prior to the time an individual becomes a candidate for the purpose of determining whether
that individual should become a candidate pursuant to 11 CFR 100.72(a) and 100.131(a),
i.e.
, payments for testing the waters, shall be allocable expenditures under this section if the individual becomes a candidate.
(b)

(2)
Specific allocation methods.
Expenditures that fall within the categories listed below shall be allocated based on the following methods. The method used to allocate a category of expenditures shall be based on consistent data for each State to which an allocation is made.

Print media.
Except for expenditures exempted under 11 CFR 106.2(b)(2)(i) (E) and (F), allocation of expenditures for the publication and distribution of newspaper, magazine and other types of printed advertisements distributed in more than one State shall be made using relative circulation percentages in each State or an estimate thereof.

(B)
Broadcast media.
Except for expenditures exempted under 11 CFR 106.2(b)(2)(i) (E) and (F), expenditures for radio, television and similar types of advertisements purchased in a particular media market that covers more than one State shall be allocated to each State in proportion to the estimated audience.

(E)
National advertising.
Expenditures incurred for advertisements on national networks, national cable or in publications distributed nationwide need not be allocated to any State.

Expenditures for mass mailings of more than 500 pieces to addresses in the same State, and expenditures for shipping campaign materials to a State, including pins, bumperstickers, handbills, brochures, posters and yardsigns, shall be allocated to that State. For purposes of this section,
mass mailing
includes newsletters and other materials in which the content of the materials is substantially identical. Records supporting the committee's allocations under this section shall include: For each mass mailing, records showing the total number of pieces mailed and the number mailed to each state or zip code; and, for other campaign materials acquired for use outside the State of purchase, records relating to any shipping costs incurred for transporting these items to each State.

(B)
Overhead expenditures of regional offices.
Except for expenditures exempted under 11 CFR 106.2(b)(2)(iii)(C), overhead expenditures of a committee regional office or any committee office with responsibilities in two or more States shall be allocated to the State holding the next primary election, caucus or convention in the region. The committee shall maintain records to demonstrate that an office operated on a regional basis.

Inter-state calls are not included in “telephone service base charges.” Overhead expenditures also include the costs of temporary offices established while the candidate is traveling in the State or in the final weeks before the primary election, as well as expenses paid by campaign staff and subsequently reimbursed by the committee, such as miscellaneous supplies, copying, printing and telephone expenses. See 11 CFR 116.5.

§ 106.3
Allocation of expenses between campaign and non-campaign related travel.
(a) This section applies to allocation for expenses between campaign and non-campaign related travel with respect to campaigns of candidates for Federal office, other than Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates who receive federal funds pursuant to 11 CFR part 9005 or 9036. (See 11 CFR 9004.7 and 9034.7) All expenditures for campaign-related travel paid for by a candidate from a campaign account or by his or her authorized committees or by any other political committee shall be reported.
(b)(1) Travel expenses paid for by a candidate from personal funds, or from a source other than a political committee, shall constitute reportable expenditures if the travel is campaign-related.
(2) Where a candidate's trip involves both campaign-related and non-campaign-related stops, the expenditures allocable for campaign purposes are reportable, and are calculated on the actual cost-per-mile of the means of transportation actually used, starting at the point of origin of the trip, via every campaign-related stop and ending at the point of origin.
(3) Where a candidate conducts any campaign-related activity in a stop, the stop is a campaign-related stop and travel expenditures made are reportable. Campaign-related activity shall not include any incidental contacts.
(c)(1) Where an individual, other than a candidate, conducts campaign-related activities on a trip, the portion of the trip attributed to each candidate shall be allocated on a reasonable basis.
(2) Travel expenses of a candidate's spouse and family are reportable as expenditures only if the spouse or family members conduct campaign-related activities.
(d) Costs incurred by a candidate for the United States Senate or House of Representatives for travel between Washington, DC, and the State or district in which he or she is a candidate need not be reported herein unless the costs are paid by a candidate's authorized committee(s), or by any other political committee(s).
(e) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the reportable expenditure for a candidate who uses government accommodations for travel that is campaign-related is the rate for comparable accommodations. The reportable expenditure for a candidate who uses a government conveyance for travel that is campaign-related is the applicable rate for a comparable commercial conveyance set forth in 11 CFR 100.93(e). In the case of a candidate authorized by law or required by national security to be accompanied by staff and equipment, the allocable expenditures are the costs of facilities sufficient to accommodate the party, less authorized or required personnel and equipment. If such a trip includes both campaign and noncampaign stops, equivalent costs are calculated in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

§ 106.4
Allocation of polling expenses.
(a) The purchase of opinion poll results by a candidate or a candidate's authorized political committee or
agent is an expenditure by the candidate. Regarding the purchase of opinion poll results for the purpose of determining whether an individual should become a candidate, see 11 CFR 100.131(a).
(b) The purchase of opinion poll results by a political committee or other person not authorized by a candidate to make expenditures and the subsequent acceptance of the poll results by a candidate or a candidate's authorized political committee or agent or by another unauthorized political committee is a contribution in-kind by the purchaser to the candidate or other political committee and an expenditure by the candidate or other political committee. Regarding the purchase of opinion poll results for the purpose of determining whether an individual should become a candidate, see 11 CFR 100.72(a). The poll results are accepted by a candidate or other political committee if the candidate or the candidate's authorized political committee or agent or the other unauthorized political committee—
(1) Requested the poll results before their receipt;
(2) Uses the poll results; or
(3) Does not notify the contributor that the results are refused.
(c) The acceptance of any part of a poll's results which part, prior to receipt, has been made public without any request, authorization, prearrangement, or coordination by the candidate-receipient or political committee-recipient, shall not be treated as a contribution in-kind and expenditure under paragraph (b) of this section.
(d) The purchase of opinion poll results by an unauthorized political committee for its own use, in whole or in part, is an overhead expenditure by the political committee under § 106.1(c)(1) to the extent of the benefit derived by the committee.
(e) The amount of a contribution under paragraph (b) of this section or of any expenditure under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section attributable to each candidate-recipient or political committee-recipient shall be—
(1) That share of the overall cost of the poll which is allocable to each candidate (including State and local candidates) or political committee, based upon the cost allocation formula of the polling firm from which the results are purchased. Under this method the size of the sample, the number of computer column codes, the extent of computer tabulations, and the extent of written analysis and verbal consultation, if applicable, may be used to determine the shares; or
(2) An amount computed by dividing the overall cost of the poll equally among candidates (including State and local candidates) or political committees receiving the results; or
(3) A proportion of the overall cost of the poll equal to the proportion that the number of question results received by the candidate or political committee bears to the total number of question results received by all candidates (including State and local candidates) and political committees; or
(4) An amount computed by any other method which reasonably reflects the benefit derived.
(f) The first candidate(s) or committee(s) receiving poll results under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section and any candidate or political committee receiving poll results under paragraph (b) of this section within 15 days after receipt by the initial recipient(s) shall compute the amount of the contribution in-kind and the expenditure as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
(g) The amount of the contribution and expenditure reported by a candidate or a political committee receiving poll results under paragraph (b) of this section more than 15 days after receipt of such poll results by the initial recipient(s) shall be—
(1) If the results are received during the period 16 to 60 days following receipt by the initial recipient(s), 50 percent of the amount allocated to an initial recipient of the same results;
(2) If the results are received during the period 61 to 180 days after receipt by the initial recipient(s), 5 percent of the amount allocated to an initial recipient of the same results;
(3) If the results are received more than 180 days after receipt by the initial recipient(s), no amount need be allocated.
(h) A contributor of poll results under paragraph (b) of this section shall maintain records sufficient to support the valuation of the contribution(s) in-kind and shall inform the candidate-recipient(s) or political committee-recipient(s) of the value of the contribution(s).

Disbursements from Federal and non-Federal accounts.
National party committees that make disbursements in connection with Federal and non-Federal elections shall make those disbursements entirely from funds subject to the prohibitions and limitations of the Act, or from accounts established pursuant to 11 CFR 102.5.

Costs to be allocated.
National party committees that make disbursements in connection with Federal and non-Federal elections shall allocate expenses according to this section for the following categories of activity:
(i) Administrative expenses including rent, utilities, office supplies, and salaries, except for such expenses directly attributable to a clearly identified candidate;

(b)
National party committees other than Senate or House campaign committees; fixed percentages for allocating administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives
—(1)
General rule.
Each national party committee other than a Senate or House campaign committee shall allocate a fixed percentage of its administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, to its Federal and non-Federal account(s) each year. These percentages shall differ according to whether or not the allocable expenses were incurred in a presidential election year. Such committees shall allocate the costs of each combined Federal and non-Federal fundraising program or event according to paragraph (f) of this section, with no fixed percentages required.
(2)
Fixed percentages according to type of election year.
National party committees other than the Senate or House campaign committees shall allocate their administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives according to paragraphs (b)(2) (i) and (ii) as follows:
(i)
Presidential election years.
In presidential election years, national party committees other than the Senate or House campaign committees shall allocate to their Federal accounts at least
65% each of their administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives.
(ii)
Non-presidential election years.
In all years other than presidential election years, national party committees other than the Senate or House campaign committees shall allocate to their Federal accounts at least 60% each of their administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives.
(c)
Senate and House campaign committees of a national party; method and minimum Federal percentage for allocating administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives
—(1)
Method for allocating administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives.
Subject to the minimum percentage set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, each Senate or House campaign committee of a national party shall allocate its administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, according to the funds expended method, described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) as follows:
(i) Under this method, expenses shall be allocated based on the ratio of Federal expenditures to total Federal and non-Federal disbursements made by the committee during the two-year Federal election cycle. This ratio shall be estimated and reported at the beginning of each Federal election cycle, based upon the committee's Federal and non-Federal disbursements in a prior comparable Federal election cycle or upon the committee's reasonable prediction of its disbursements for the coming two years. In calculating its Federal expenditures, the committee shall include only amounts contributed to or otherwise spent on behalf of specific federal candidates. Calculation of total Federal and non-Federal disbursements shall also be limited to disbursements for specific candidates, and shall not include overhead or other generic costs.
(ii) On each of its periodic reports, the committee shall adjust its allocation ratio to reconcile it with the ratio of actual Federal and non-Federal disbursements made, to date. If the non-Federal account has paid more than its allocable share, the committee shall transfer funds from its Federal to its non-Federal account, as necessary, to reflect the adjusted allocation ratio. The committee shall make note of any such adjustments and transfers on its periodic reports, submitted pursuant to 11 CFR 104.5.
(2)
Minimum Federal percentage for administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives.
Regardless of the allocation ratio calculated under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, each Senate or House campaign committee of a national party shall allocate to its Federal account at least 65% each of its administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives each year. If the committee's own allocation calculation under paragraph (c)(1) of this section yields a Federal share greater than 65%, then the higher percentage shall be applied. If such calculation yields a Federal share lower than 65%, then the committee shall report its calculated ratio according to 11 CFR 104.10(b), and shall apply the required minimum Federal percentage.
(3)
Allocation of fundraising costs.
Senate and House campaign committees shall allocate the costs of each combined Federal and non-Federal fundraising program or event according to paragraph (f) of this section, with no minimum percentages required.
(d)-(e) [Reserved]
(f)
National party committees; method for allocating direct costs of fundraising.
(1) If Federal and non-Federal funds are collected by one committee through a joint activity, that committee shall allocate its direct costs of fundraising, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, according to the funds received method. Under this method, the committee shall allocate its fundraising costs based on the ratio of funds received into its Federal account to its total receipts from each fundraising program or event. This ratio shall be estimated prior to each such program or event based upon the committee's reasonable prediction of its Federal and non-Federal revenue from that program or event, and shall be noted in the committee's report for the period in which the first disbursement for such program or event occurred, submitted pursuant 11 CFR 104.5. Any disbursements for fundraising costs made prior to the actual program or event
shall be allocated according to this estimated ratio.
(2) No later than the date 60 days after each fundraising program or event from which both Federal and non-Federal funds are collected, the committee shall adjust the allocation ratio for that program or event to reflect the actual ratio of funds received. If the non-Federal account has paid more than its allocable share, the committee shall transfer funds from its Federal to its non-Federal account, as necessary, to reflect the adjusted allocation ratio. If the Federal account has paid more than its allocable share, the committee shall make any transfers of funds from its non-federal to its federal account to reflect the adjusted allocation ratio within the 60-day time period established by this paragraph. The committee shall make note of any such adjustments and transfers in its report for any period in which a transfer was made, and shall also report the date of the fundraising program or event that serves as the basis for the transfer. In the case of a telemarketing or direct mail campaign, the date for purposes of this paragraph is the last day of the telemarketing campaign, or the day on which the final direct mail solicitations are mailed.

(ii) Funds transferred from a committee's non-Federal account to its Federal account or its allocation account are subject to the following requirements:
(A) For each such transfer, the committee must itemize in its reports the allocable activities for which the transferred funds are intended to pay, as required by 11 CFR 104.10(b)(3); and
(B) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, such funds may not be transferred more than 10 days before or more than 60 days after the payments for which they are designated are made.

[68 FR 451, Jan. 3, 2003, as amended at 71 FR 33208, June 8, 2006]
§ 109.21
What is a “coordinated communication”?
(a)
Definition.
A communication is coordinated with a candidate, an authorized committee, a political party committee, or an agent of any of the foregoing when the communication:
(1) Is paid for, in whole or in part, by a person other than that candidate, authorized committee, or political party committee;
(2) Satisfies at least one of the content standards in paragraph (c) of this section; and
(3) Satisfies at least one of the conduct standards in paragraph (d) of this section.
(b)
Treatment as an in-kind contribution and expenditure; Reporting
—(1)
General rule.
A payment for a coordinated communication is made for the purpose of influencing a Federal election, and is an in-kind contribution under 11 CFR 100.52(d) to the candidate, authorized committee, or political party committee with whom or which it is coordinated, unless excepted under 11 CFR part 100, subpart C, and must be reported as an expenditure made by that candidate, authorized committee, or political party committee under 11 CFR 104.13, unless excepted under 11 CFR part 100, subpart E.
(2)
In-kind contributions resulting from conduct described in paragraphs (d)(4) or (d)(5) of this section.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the candidate, authorized committee, or political party committee with whom or which a communication is coordinated does not receive or accept an in-kind contribution, and is not required to report an expenditure, that results from conduct described in paragraphs (d)(4) or (d)(5) of this section, unless the candidate, authorized committee, or political party committee engages in conduct described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section.
(3)
Reporting of coordinated communications.
A political committee, other than a political party committee, that makes a coordinated communication must report the payment for the communication as a contribution made to the candidate or political party committee with whom or which it was coordinated and as an expenditure in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(b)(1)(v). A candidate, authorized committee, or political party committee with whom or which a communication paid for by another person is coordinated must report the usual and normal value of the communication as an in-kind contribution in accordance with 11 CFR 104.13, meaning that it must report the amount of the payment as a receipt under 11 CFR 104.3(a) and as an expenditure under 11 CFR 104.3(b).
(c)
Content standards.
Each of the types of content described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this section satisfies the content standard of this section.
(1) A communication that is an electioneering communication under 11 CFR 100.29.
(2) A public communication, as defined in 11 CFR 100.26, that disseminates, distributes, or republishes, in whole or in part, campaign materials prepared by a candidate or the candidate's authorized committee, unless the dissemination, distribution, or republication is excepted under 11 CFR 109.23(b). For a communication that satisfies this content standard, see paragraph (d)(6) of this section.
(3) A public communication, as defined in 11 CFR 100.26, that expressly advocates, as defined in 11 CFR 100.22, the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for Federal office.
(4) A public communication, as defined in 11 CFR 100.26, that satisfies paragraph (c)(4)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section:
(i)
References to House and Senate candidates.
The public communication refers to a clearly identified House or Senate candidate and is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated in the clearly identified candidate's jurisdiction 90 days or fewer before the clearly identified candidate's general, special, or runoff election, or primary or preference election, or nominating convention or caucus.
(ii)
References to Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates.
The public communication refers to a clearly identified Presidential or Vice Presidential candidate and is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated in a jurisdiction during the period of time beginning 120 days before the clearly identified candidate's primary or preference election in that jurisdiction, or nominating convention or caucus in that jurisdiction, up to and including the day of the general election.
(iii)
References to political parties.
The public communication refers to a political party, does not refer to a clearly identified Federal candidate, and is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated in a jurisdiction in which one or more candidates of that political party will appear on the ballot.
(A) When the public communication is coordinated with a candidate and it is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated in that candidate's jurisdiction, the time period in paragraph (c)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section that would apply to a communication containing a reference to that candidate applies;
(B) When the public communication is coordinated with a political party committee and it is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated during the two-year election cycle ending on the date of a regularly scheduled non-Presidential general election, the time period in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section applies;
(C) When the public communication is coordinated with a political party committee and it is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated during the two-year election cycle ending on the date of a Presidential general election, the time period in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section applies.
(iv)
References to both political parties and clearly identified Federal candidates.
The public communication refers to a political party and a clearly identified Federal candidate, and is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated in a jurisdiction in which one or more candidates of that political party will appear on the ballot.
(A) When the public communication is coordinated with a candidate and it is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated in that candidate's jurisdiction, the time period in paragraph (c)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section that would apply to a communication containing a reference to that candidate applies;
(B) When the public communication is coordinated with a political party committee and it is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated in the clearly identified candidate's jurisdiction, the time period in paragraph (c)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section that would apply to a communication containing only a reference to that candidate applies;
(C) When the public communication is coordinated with a political party committee and it is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated outside the clearly identified candidate's jurisdiction, the time period in paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(B) or (C) of this section that would apply to a communication containing only a reference to a political party applies.
(5) A public communication, as defined in 11 CFR 100.26, that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy. For purposes of this section, a communication is the functional equivalent of express advocacy if it is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a clearly identified Federal candidate.
(d)
Conduct standards.
Any one of the following types of conduct satisfies the conduct standard of this section whether or not there is agreement or formal collaboration, as defined in paragraph (e) of this section:
(1)
Request or suggestion.
(i) The communication is created, produced, or distributed at the request or suggestion of a candidate, authorized committee, or political party committee; or
(ii) The communication is created, produced, or distributed at the suggestion of a person paying for the communication and the candidate, authorized committee, or political party committee assents to the suggestion.
(2)

production, or distribution of the communication was obtained from a publicly available source. A candidate, authorized committee, or political party committee is materially involved in decisions regarding:
(i) The content of the communication;

(6)
Dissemination, distribution, or republication of campaign material.
A communication that satisfies the content standard of paragraph (c)(2) of this section or 11 CFR 109.37(a)(2)(i) shall only satisfy the conduct standards of paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section on the basis of conduct by the candidate, the candidate's authorized committee, or the agents of any of the foregoing, that occurs after the original preparation of the campaign materials that are disseminated, distributed, or republished. The conduct standards of paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section may also apply to such communications as provided in those paragraphs.

(g)
Safe harbor for endorsements and solicitations by Federal candidates.
(1) A public communication in which a candidate for Federal office endorses another candidate for Federal or non-Federal office is not a coordinated communication with respect to the endorsing Federal candidate unless the public communication promotes, supports, attacks, or opposes the endorsing candidate or another candidate who seeks election to the same office as the endorsing candidate.
(2) A public communication in which a candidate for Federal office solicits funds for another candidate for Federal or non-Federal office, a political committee, or organizations as permitted by 11 CFR 300.65, is not a coordinated communication with respect to the soliciting Federal candidate unless the public communication promotes, supports, attacks, or opposes the soliciting candidate or another candidate who seeks election to the same office as the soliciting candidate.
(h)
Safe harbor for establishment and use of a firewall.
The conduct standards in paragraph (d) of this section are not met if the commercial vendor, former employee, or political committee has established and implemented a firewall
that meets the requirements of paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section. This safe harbor provision does not apply if specific information indicates that, despite the firewall, information about the candidate's or political party committee's campaign plans, projects, activities, or needs that is material to the creation, production, or distribution of the communication was used or conveyed to the person paying for the communication.
(1) The firewall must be designed and implemented to prohibit the flow of information between employees or consultants providing services for the person paying for the communication and those employees or consultants currently or previously providing services to the candidate who is clearly identified in the communication, or the candidate's authorized committee, the candidate's opponent, the opponent's authorized committee, or a political party committee; and

(i)
Safe harbor for commercial transactions.
A public communication in which a Federal candidate is clearly identified only in his or her capacity as the owner or operator of a business that existed prior to the candidacy is not a coordinated communication with respect to the clearly identified candidate if:

§ 109.37
What is a “party coordinated communication”?
(a)
Definition.
A political party communication is coordinated with a candidate, a candidate's authorized committee, or agent of any of the foregoing, when the communication satisfies the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of this section.
(1) The communication is paid for by a political party committee or its agent.
(2) The communication satisfies at least one of the content standards described in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(iii) of this section.
(i) A public communication that disseminates, distributes, or republishes, in whole or in part, campaign materials prepared by a candidate, the candidate's authorized committee, or an agent of any of the foregoing, unless the dissemination, distribution, or republication is excepted under 11 CFR 109.23(b). For a communication that satisfies this content standard, see 11 CFR 109.21(d)(6).
(ii) A public communication that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for Federal office.
(iii) A public communication, as defined in 11 CFR 100.26, that satisfies paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section:
(A)
References to House and Senate candidates.
The public communication refers to a clearly identified House or Senate candidate and is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated in the clearly identified candidate's jurisdiction 90 days or fewer
before the clearly identified candidate's general, special, or runoff election, or primary or preference election, or nominating convention or caucus.
(B)
References to Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates.
The public communication refers to a clearly identified Presidential or Vice Presidential candidate and is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated in a jurisdiction during the period of time beginning 120 days before the clearly identified candidate's primary or preference election in that jurisdiction, or nominating convention or caucus in that jurisdiction, up to and including the day of the general election.
(3) The communication satisfies at least one of the conduct standards in 11 CFR 109.21(d)(1) through (d)(6), subject to the provisions of 11 CFR 109.21(e), (g), and (h). A candidate's response to an inquiry about that candidate's positions on legislative or policy issues, but not including a discussion of campaign plans, projects, activities, or needs, does not satisfy any of the conduct standards in 11 CFR 109.21(d)(1) through (d)(6). Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the candidate with whom a party coordinated communication is coordinated does not receive or accept an in-kind contribution, and is not required to report an expenditure that results from conduct described in 11 CFR 109.21(d)(4) or (d)(5), unless the candidate, authorized committee, or an agent of any of the foregoing, engages in conduct described in 11 CFR 109.21(d)(1) through (d)(3).
(b)
Treatment of a party coordinated communication.
A payment by a political party committee for a communication that is coordinated with a candidate, and that is not otherwise exempted under 11 CFR part 100, subpart C or E, must be treated by the political party committee making the payment as either:
(1) An in-kind contribution for the purpose of influencing a Federal election under 11 CFR 100.52(d) to the candidate with whom it was coordinated, which must be reported under 11 CFR part 104; or
(2) A coordinated party expenditure pursuant to coordinated party expenditure authority under 11 CFR 109.32 in connection with the general election campaign of the candidate with whom it was coordinated, which must be reported under 11 CFR part 104.

Scope.
This section applies to all contributions made by any person as defined in 11 CFR 100.10, except multicandidate political committees as defined in 11 CFR 100.5(e)(3) or entities
and individuals prohibited from making contributions under 11 CFR 110.20 and 11 CFR parts 114 and 115.

(iii) In every odd numbered year, the Commission will publish in the

(2) For purposes of this section,
with respect to any election
means—
(i) In the case of a contribution designated in writing by the contributor for a particular election, the election so designated. Contributors to candidates are encouraged to designate their contributions in writing for particular elections.
See
11 CFR 110.1(b)(4).
(ii) In the case of a contribution not designated in writing by the contributor for a particular election, the next election for that Federal office after the contribution is made.
(3)(i) A contribution designated in writing for a particular election, but made after that election, shall be made only to the extent that the contribution does not exceed net debts outstanding from such election. To the extent that such contribution exceeds net debts outstanding, the candidate or the candidate's authorized political committee shall return or deposit the contribution within ten days from the date of the treasurer's receipt of the contribution as provided by 11 CFR 103.3(a), and if deposited, then within sixty days from the date of the treasurer's receipt the treasurer shall take the following action, as appropriate:
(A) Refund the contribution using a committee check or similar draft, including electronic transfer; or
(B) Obtain a written redesignation by the contributor for another election in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(b)(5); or
(C) Obtain a written reattribution to another contributor in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(k)(3).
If the candidate is not a candidate in the general election, all contributions made for the general election shall be either returned or refunded to the contributors or redesignated in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(b)(5), or reattributed in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(k)(3), as appropriate.

net debts outstanding
means the total amount of unpaid debts and obligations incurred with respect to an election, including the estimated cost of raising funds to liquidate debts incurred with respect to the election and, if the candidate's authorized committee terminates or if the candidate will not be a candidate for the next election, estimated necessary costs associated with termination of political activity, such as the costs of complying with the post-election requirements of the Act and other necessary administrative costs associated with winding down the campaign, including office space rental, staff salaries and office supplies, less the sum of:
(A) The total cash on hand available to pay those debts and obligations, including: currency; balances on deposit in banks, savings and loan institutions, and other depository institutions; traveler's checks; certificates of deposit; treasury bills; and any other committee investments valued at fair market value; and

collectibility of those credits, refunds, returns, or receivables.
(iii) The amount of the net debts outstanding shall be adjusted as additional funds are received and expenditures are made. The candidate and his or her authorized political committee(s) may accept contributions made after the date of the election if:

(B) Such contributions do not exceed the adjusted amount of net debts outstanding on the date the contribution is received; and
(C) Such contributions do not exceed the contribution limitations in effect on the date of such election.

(4) For purposes of this section, a contribution shall be considered to be designated in writing for a particular election if—
(i) The contribution clearly indicates the particular election with respect to which the contribution;
(ii) The contribution is accompanied by a writing, signed by the contributor, which clearly indicates the particular election with respect to which the contribution is made; or
(iii) The contribution is redesignated in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(b)(5).
(5)(i) The treasurer of an authorized political committee may request a written redesignation of a contribution by the contributor for a different election if—

(B) The contribution was designated in writing for a particular election and the contribution was made after that election and the contribution cannot be accepted under the net debts outstanding provisions of 11 CFR 110.1(b)(3);
(C) The contribution was not designated in writing for a particular election, and the contribution exceeds the limitation on contributions set forth in 11 CFR 110.1(b)(1); or
(D) The contribution was not designated in writing for a particular election, and the contribution was received after the date of an election for which there are net debts outstanding on the date the contribution is received.

(
1
) The treasurer of the recipient authorized political committee requests that the contributor provide a written redesignation of the contribution and informs the contributor that the contributor may request the refund of the contribution as an alternative to providing a written redesignation; and
(
2
) Within sixty days from the date of the treasurer's receipt of the contribution, the contributor provides the treasurer with a written redesignation of the contribution for another election, which is signed by the contributor.
(B) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section or any other provision of this section, the treasurer of the recipient authorized political committee may treat all or part of the amount of the contribution that exceeds the contribution limits in paragraph (b)(1) of this section as made with respect to the general election, provided that:
(
1
) The contribution was made before the primary election;
(
2

(
3
) The contribution would exceed the limitation on contributions set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if it were treated as a contribution made for the primary election;

that the contributor may request a refund of the contribution; and

(C) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section or any other provision of this section, the treasurer of the recipient authorized political committee may treat all or part of the amount of the contribution that exceeds the contribution limits in paragraph (b)(1) of this section as made with respect to the primary election, provided that:
(
1
) The contribution was made after the primary election but before the general election;
(
2
) The contribution was not designated for a particular election;
(
3
) The contribution would exceed the limitation on contributions set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if it were treated as a contribution made for the general election;
(
4
) Such redesignation would not cause the contributor to exceed any of the limitations on contributions set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;
(
5
) The contribution does not exceed the committee's net debts outstanding for the primary election;
(
6
) The treasurer of the recipient authorized political committee notifies the contributor of how the contribution was redesignated and that the contributor may request a refund of the contribution; and
(
7
) Within sixty days from the date of the treasurer's receipt of the contribution, the treasurer shall provide notification required in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(C)(6) of this section to the contributor by any written method.
(iii) A contribution redesignated for another election shall not exceed the limitations on contributions made with respect to that election. A contribution redesignated for a previous election shall be subject to the requirements of 11 CFR 110.1(b)(3) regarding net debts outstanding.
(6) For the purposes of this section, a contribution shall be considered to be made when the contributor relinquishes control over the contribution. A contributor shall be considered to relinquish control over the contribution when it is delivered by the contributor to the candidate, to the political committee, or to an agent of the political committee.

(ii) Any person who is prohibited from making contributions or expenditures in connection with an election for Federal office shall be prohibited from acting as a conduit for contributions earmarked to candidates or their authorized committees. The provisions of this section shall not restrict the ability of an organization or committee to serve as a collecting agent for a separate segregated fund pursuant to 11 CFR 102.6.
(iii) Any person who receives an earmarked contribution shall forward such earmarked contribution to the candidate or authorized committee in accordance with 11 CFR 102.8, except that—

For each earmarked contribution forwarded in the form of the contributor's check or other written instrument, the information specified in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) (A) through (C) of this section shall be disclosed as a memo entry on the appropriate schedules of receipts and disbursements attached to the conduit's or intermediary's report, or shall be disclosed in writing, as appropriate.

(2) If a conduit or intermediary exercises any direction or control over the choice of the recipient candidate, the earmarked contribution shall be considered a contribution by both the original contributor and the conduit or intermediary. If the conduit or intermediary exercises any direction or control over the choice of the recipient candidate, the report filed by the conduit or intermediary and the report filed by the recipient candidate or authorized committee shall indicate that the earmarked contribution is made by both the original contributor and the conduit or intermediary, and that the entire amount of the contribution is attributed to each.

# Source:
65 FR 31794, May 19, 2000, unless otherwise noted.
§ 111.30
When will subpart B apply?
Subpart B applies to violations of the reporting requirements of 52 U.S.C. 30104(a) committed by political committees and their treasurers that relate to the reporting periods that begin on or after July 14, 2000, and that end on or before the date specified by 52 U.S.C. 30109(a)(4)(C)(v). This subpart, however, does not apply to reports that relate to reporting periods that end between January 1, 2014, and January 21, 2014.
[79 FR 3303, Jan. 21, 2014, as amended at 79 FR 77848, Dec. 29, 2014]
§ 111.31
Does this subpart replace subpart A of this part for violations of the reporting requirements of 52 U.S.C. 30104(a)?
(a) No; §§ 111.1 through 111.8 and 111.20 through 111.24 shall apply to all compliance matters. This subpart will apply, rather than §§ 111.9 through 111.19, when the Commission, on the basis of information ascertained by the Commission in the normal course of carrying out its supervisory responsibilities, and when appropriate, determines that the compliance matter should be subject to this subpart. If the Commission determines that the violation should not be subject to this subpart, then the violation will be subject to all sections of subpart A of this part.
(b) Subpart B will apply to compliance matters resulting from a complaint filed pursuant to 11 CFR 111.4 through 111.7 if the complaint alleges a violation of 52 U.S.C. 30104(a). If the complaint alleges violations of any other provision of any statute or regulation over which the Commission has jurisdiction, subpart A will apply to the alleged violations of these other provisions.
[65 FR 31794, May 19, 2000, as amended at 79 FR 77848, Dec. 29, 2014]
§ 111.32
How will the Commission notify respondents of a reason to believe finding and a proposed civil money penalty?
If the Commission determines, by an affirmative vote of at least four (4) of its members, that it has reason to believe that a respondent has violated 52 U.S.C. 30104(a), the Chairman or Vice-Chairman shall notify such respondent of the Commission's finding. The written notification shall set forth the following:
(a) The alleged factual and legal basis supporting the finding including the type of report that was due, the filing deadline, the actual date filed (if filed), and the number of days the report was late (if filed);
(b) The applicable schedule of penalties;
(c) The number of times the respondent has been assessed a civil money penalty under this subpart during the current two-year election cycle and the prior two-year election cycle;
(d) The amount of the proposed civil money penalty based on the schedules of penalties set forth in 11 CFR 111.43 or 111.44; and
(e) An explanation of the respondent's right to challenge both the reason to believe finding and the proposed civil money penalty.

(2) The Commission improperly calculated the civil money penalty; or
(3) The respondent used best efforts to file in a timely manner in that:

The reviewing officer may request supplemental information from the respondent and/or the Commission staff. The respondent shall submit the supplemental information to the reviewing officer within a time specified
by the reviewing officer. The reviewing officer will be entitled to draw an adverse inference from the failure by the respondent to submit the supplemental information.
(c) All records required to be submitted by the respondents pursuant to this section and § 111.35 should be submitted in the form of affidavits or declarations.
(d) If the Commission staff, after the respondent files a written response pursuant to § 111.35, forwards any additional documents pertaining to the matter to the reviewing officer for his or her examination, the reviewing officer shall also furnish a copy of the records to the respondents.
(e) Upon completion of the review, the reviewing officer shall forward a written recommendation to the Commission along with all records required under this section and 11 CFR 111.32 and 111.35.

This response may not raise any arguments not raised in the respondent's original written response or not directly responsive to the reviewing officer's recommendation.
[65 FR 31794, May 19, 2000, as amended at 89 FR 218, Jan. 2, 2024]
§ 111.37
What will the Commission do once it receives the respondent's written response and the reviewing officer's recommendation?
(a) If the Commission, after having found reason to believe and after reviewing the respondent's written response and the reviewing officer's recommendation, determines by an affirmative vote of at least four (4) of its members, that the respondent has violated 52 U.S.C. 30104(a) and the amount of the civil money penalty, the Commission shall authorize the reviewing officer to notify the respondent in writing of its final determination.
(b) If the Commission, after reviewing the reason to believe finding, the respondent's written response, and the reviewing officer's written recommendation, determines by an affirmative vote of at least four (4) of its members, that no violation has occurred (either because the Commission had based its reason to believe finding on a factual error or because the respondent used best efforts to file in a timely manner) or otherwise terminates its proceedings, the Commission shall authorize the reviewing officer to notify the respondent in writing of its final determination.
(c) The Commission will modify the proposed civil money penalty only if the respondent is able to demonstrate that the amount of the proposed civil money penalty was calculated on an incorrect basis.
(d) When the Commission makes a final determination under this section, the statement of reasons for the Commission action will, unless otherwise indicated by the Commission, consist of the reasons provided by the reviewing officer for the recommendation, if approved by the Commission, although statements setting forth additional or different reasons may also be issued. If the reviewing officer's recommendation is modified or not approved, the Commission will indicate the grounds for its action and one or more statements of reasons may be issued.

The civil money penalty for a respondent who does not have any previous violations will not exceed the level of activity in the report.
(c) If the respondent fails to file a required report and the Commission cannot calculate the level of activity under paragraph (d) of this section, then the civil money penalty shall be $9,725.
(d)
Definitions.
For this section only, the following definitions will apply:
(1)
Election Sensitive Reports
means third quarter reports due on October 15th before the general election (for all committees required to file this report except committees of candidates who do not participate in that general election); monthly reports due October 20th before the general election (for all committees required to file this report except committees of candidates who do not participate in that general election); and pre-election reports for primary, general, and special elections under 11 CFR 104.5.
(2)
Estimated level of activity
means:
(i) For an authorized committee, total receipts and disbursements reported in the current two-year election cycle divided by the number of reports filed to date covering the activity in the current two-year election cycle. If the respondent has not filed a report covering activity in the current two-year election cycle, estimated level of activity for an authorized committee means total receipts and disbursements reported in the prior two-year election cycle divided by the number of reports filed covering the activity in the prior two-year election cycle.
(ii)(A) For an unauthorized committee, estimated level of activity is calculated as follows: [(Total receipts and disbursements reported in the current two-year cycle)—(Transfers received from non-Federal account(s) as reported on Line 18(a) of FEC Form 3X Disbursements for the non-Federal share of operating expenditures attributable to allocated Federal/non-Federal activity as reported on Line 21(a)(ii) of FEC Form 3X)] ÷ Number of reports filed to date covering the activity in the current two-year election cycle.
(B) If the unauthorized committee has not filed a report covering activity in the current two-year election cycle, the estimated level of activity is calculated as follows: [(Total receipts and disbursements reported in the prior two-year election cycle)—(Transfers received from non-Federal account(s) as reported on Line 18(a) of FEC Form 3X Disbursements for the non-Federal share of operating expenditures attributable to allocated Federal/non-Federal activity as reported on Line 21(a)(ii) of FEC Form 3X)] ÷ Number of reports filed covering the activity in the prior two-year election cycle.
(3)
Level of activity
means:
(i) For an authorized committee, the total amount of receipts and disbursements for the period covered by the late report. If the report is not filed, the level of activity is the estimated level of activity as set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.
(ii) For an unauthorized committee, the total amount of receipts and disbursements for the period covered by the late report minus the total of: Transfers received from non-Federal account(s) as reported on Line 18(a) of FEC Form 3X and disbursements for the non-Federal share of operating expenditures attributable to allocated Federal/non-Federal activity as reported on Line 21(a)(ii) of FEC Form 3X for the period covered by the late report. If the report is not filed, the level of activity is the estimated level of activity as set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.
(4)
Number of previous violations
means all prior final civil money penalties assessed under this subpart during the current two-year election cycle and the prior two-year election cycle.
(e) For purposes of the schedules of penalties in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section,
(1) Reports that are not election sensitive reports are considered to be filed late if they are filed after their due dates but within thirty (30) days of their due dates. These reports are considered to be not filed if they are filed after thirty (30) days of their due dates or not filed at all.
(2) Election sensitive reports are considered to be filed late if they are filed after their due dates but prior to four (4) days before the primary election for pre-primary reports, prior to four (4) days before the special election for pre-special election reports, or prior to four (4) days before the general election for all other election sensitive reports. These reports are considered to be not filed if they are not filed prior to four (4) days before the primary election for pre-primary reports, prior to four (4) days before the special election for pre-special election reports or prior to four (4) days before the general election for all other election sensitive reports.

Definitions (52 U.S.C. 30114).
When used in this part—
(a)
Funds donated. Funds donated
means all funds, including, but not limited to, gifts, loans, advances, credits or deposits of money which are donated
for the purpose of supporting the activities of a Federal or State officeholder; but does not mean funds appropriated by Congress, a State legislature, or another similar public appropriating body, or personal funds of the officeholder donated to an account containing only those personal funds.
(b)
Office account.
Office account means an account established for the purposes of supporting the activities of a Federal or State officeholder which contains campaign funds and funds donated, but does not include an account used exclusively for funds appropriated by Congress, a State legislature, or another similar public appropriating body, or an account of the officeholder which contains only the personal funds of the officeholder.
(c)
Federal officeholder. Federal officeholder
means an individual elected to or serving in the office of President or Vice President of the United States; or a Senator or a Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, the Congress of the United States.
(d)
State officeholder. State officeholder
means an individual elected to or serving in any elected public office within a State of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or any subdivision thereof.
(e) [Reserved]
(f)
Qualified Member. Qualified Member
means an individual who was serving as a Senator or Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, Congress, on January 8, 1980.
(g)
Personal use. Personal use
means any use of funds in a campaign account of a present or former candidate to fulfill a commitment, obligation or expense of any person that would exist irrespective of the candidate's campaign or duties as a Federal officeholder.
(1)(i) Personal use includes but is not limited to the use of funds in a campaign account for any item listed in paragraphs (g)(1)(i)(A) through (J) of this section:
(A) Household food items or supplies.
(B) Funeral, cremation or burial expenses except those incurred for a candidate (as defined in 11 CFR 100.3) or an employee or volunteer of an authorized committee whose death arises out of, or in the course of, campaign activity.
(C) Clothing, other than items of
de minimis
value that are used in the campaign, such as campaign “T-shirts” or caps with campaign slogans.
(D) Tuition payments, other than those associated with training campaign staff.
(E) Mortgage, rent or utility payments—
(
1
) For any part of any personal residence of the candidate or a member of the candidate's family; or
(
2
) For real or personal property that is owned by the candidate or a member of the candidate's family and used for campaign purposes, to the extent the payments exceed the fair market value of the property usage.
(F) Admission to a sporting event, concert, theater or other form of entertainment, unless part of a specific campaign or officeholder activity.
(G) Dues, fees or gratuities at a country club, health club, recreational facility or other nonpolitical organization, unless they are part of the costs of a specific fundraising event that takes place on the organization's premises.
(H) Salary payments to a member of the candidate's family, unless the family member is providing
bona fide
services to the campaign. If a family member provides
bona fide
services to the campaign, any salary payment in excess of the fair market value of the services provided is personal use.
(I) [Reserved]
(J) A vacation.
(ii) The Commission will determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether other uses of funds in a campaign account fulfill a commitment, obligation or expense that would exist irrespective of the candidate's campaign or duties as a Federal officeholder, and therefore are personal use. Examples of such other uses include:
(A) Legal expenses;
(B) Meal expenses;
(C) Travel expenses, including subsistence expenses incurred during travel. If a committee uses campaign funds to pay expenses associated with travel that involves both personal activities and campaign or officeholder-related activities, the incremental expenses that result from the personal activities are personal use, unless the person(s)
benefiting from this use reimburse(s) the campaign account within thirty days for the amount of the incremental expenses, and
(D) Vehicle expenses, unless they are a
de minimis
amount. If a committee uses campaign funds to pay expenses associated with a vehicle that is used for both personal activities beyond a
de minimis
amount and campaign or officeholder-related activities, the portion of the vehicle expenses associated with the personal activities is personal use, unless the person(s) using the vehicle for personal activities reimburse(s) the campaign account within thirty days for the expenses associated with the personal activities.
(2)
Charitable donations.
Donations of campaign funds or assets to an organization described in section 170(c) of Title 26 of the United States Code are not personal use, unless the candidate receives compensation from the organization before the organization has expended the entire amount donated for purposes unrelated to his or her personal benefit.
(3)
Transfers of campaign assets.
The transfer of a campaign committee asset is not personal use so long as the transfer is for fair market value. Any depreciation that takes place before the transfer must be allocated between the committee and the purchaser based on the useful life of the asset.
(4)
Gifts.
Gifts of nominal value and donations of a nominal amount made on a special occasion such as a holiday, graduation, marriage, retirement, or death are not personal use, unless made to a member of the candidate's family.
(5)
Political or officially connected expenses.
The use of campaign funds for an expense that would be a political expense under the rules of the United States House of Representatives or an officially connected expense under the rules of the United States Senate is not personal use to the extent that the expense is an expenditure under subpart D of part 100 or an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in connection with the duties of a holder of Federal office. Any use of funds that would be personal use under paragraph (g)(1) of this section will not be considered an expenditure under subpart D of part 100 or an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in connection with the duties of a holder of Federal office.
(6)
Candidate compensation.
(i) A Federal officeholder, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, must not receive compensation as a candidate from campaign funds.
(ii) The use of campaign funds by a candidate's principal campaign committee to pay compensation to the candidate is not personal use, provided that the compensation does not exceed the lesser of: 50% of the minimum annual salary paid to a Member of the United States House of Representatives under 2 U.S.C. 4501, and the average annual income that the candidate earned during the most recent five calendar years in which the candidate earned income prior to becoming a candidate. The committee must calculate compensation, minimum annual salary, and average annual income at the daily rate, rounded to the nearest dollar.
(iii) For the purposes of this paragraph,
compensation
means direct payments to the candidate unless the payments are otherwise permitted by law, such as candidate expense reimbursements and candidate loan repayments under 11 CFR part 116.
(iv) The candidate's principal campaign committee must reduce the maximum amount of candidate compensation permissible under this paragraph (g)(6) by the amount of any earned income the candidate receives from any other source after filing a Statement of Candidacy under 11 CFR 101.1(a).
(v)(A) Compensation shall not accrue or be paid to a candidate before the date the candidate files a Statement of Candidacy with the Commission.
See
11 CFR 101.1(a).
(B) A candidate's principal campaign committee may pay the candidate compensation from campaign funds up to 20 days after the candidate wins the general election, general election runoff, special election, or special election runoff, or otherwise ceases to be a candidate, such as by losing an election or withdrawing from the race.
(vi) Any principal campaign committee seeking to settle debts for less than the full value may not pay compensation to the candidate or settle or
satisfy a debt to a candidate for compensation.
(vii) The candidate must provide evidence of earned income from the relevant years upon the request of the Commission. Any such evidence of earned income must be maintained and preserved for three years after the report disclosing the disbursement is filed, pursuant to 11 CFR 102.9 and 104.14(b).
(7)
Third party payments.
Notwithstanding that the use of funds for a particular expense would be a personal use under this section, payment of that expense by any person other than the candidate or the campaign committee shall be a contribution under subpart B of part 100 to the candidate unless the payment would have been made irrespective of the candidacy. Examples of payments considered to be irrespective of the candidacy include, but are not limited to, situations where—
(i) The payment is a donation to a legal expense trust fund established in accordance with the rules of the United States Senate or the United States House of Representatives;
(ii) The payment is made from funds that are the candidate's personal funds as defined in 11 CFR 100.33, including an account jointly held by the candidate and a member of the candidate's family;
(iii) Payments for that expense were made by the person making the payment before the candidate became a candidate. Payments that are compensation shall be considered contributions unless—
(A) The compensation results from
bona fide
employment that is genuinely independent of the candidacy;
(B) The compensation is exclusively in consideration of services provided by the employee as part of this employment; and
(C) The compensation does not exceed the amount of compensation which would be paid to any other similarly qualified person for the same work over the same period of time.

Members of the candidate's family.
For the purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, the candidate's family includes:
(i) The spouse of the candidate;

(iv) A person who shares a residence with the candidate.

Recordkeeping.
For those uses of campaign funds described in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) and (g)(1)(ii) of this section that involve both personal use and either campaign or office-holder use, a contemporaneous log or other record must be kept to document the dates and expenses related to the personal use of the campaign funds. The log must be updated whenever campaign funds are used for personal expenses, as described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, rather than for campaign or office-holder expenses. The log or other record must also be maintained and preserved for 3 years after the report disclosing the disbursement is filed, pursuant to 11 CFR 102.9 and 104.14(b).
(10)
Candidate and federal officeholder security.
The use of campaign funds to pay for the reasonable costs of security measures for a federal candidate, federal officeholder, member of their family, and employees—as defined in 26 CFR 31.3401(c)-1)—of the candidate's campaign or the federal officeholder's office, is not personal use, so long as the security measures address ongoing dangers or threats that would not exist irrespective of the individual's status or duties as a federal candidate or federal officeholder. Disbursements for security measures must be for the usual and normal charge for such goods or services.
Usual and normal charge
means, in the case of goods, the price of those goods in the market in which they are ordinarily purchased, and, in the case of services, the hourly or piecework charge for the services at a commercially reasonable rate prevailing at the time the services were rendered. Examples of such security measures include, but are not limited to:
(i) Non-structural security devices, such as security hardware, locks, alarm systems, motion detectors, and security camera systems;
(ii) Structural security devices, such as wiring, lighting, gates, doors, and fencing, so long as such devices are intended solely to provide security and not to improve the property or increase its value;
(iii) Security personnel and services that are bona fide, legitimate, and professional; and
(iv) Cybersecurity software, devices, and services.

§ 114.2
Prohibitions on contributions, expenditures and electioneering communications.
(a) National banks and corporations organized by authority of any law of Congress are prohibited from making a contribution, as defined in 11 CFR 114.1(a), in connection with any election to any political office, including local, State and Federal offices, or in connection with any primary election or political convention or caucus held to select candidates for any political office, including any local, State or Federal office. National banks and corporations organized by authority of any law of Congress are prohibited from making expenditures as defined in 11 CFR 114.1(a) for communications to those outside the restricted class expressly advocating the election or defeat of one or more clearly identified candidate(s) or the candidates of a clearly identified political party, with respect to an election to any political office, including any local, State, or Federal office.
(1) Such national banks and corporations may engage in the activities permitted by 11 CFR part 114, except to the extent that such activity constitutes a contribution, expenditure, or electioneering communication or is foreclosed by provisions of law other than the Act.
(2) The provisions of 11 CFR part 114 apply to the activities of a national bank, or a corporation organized by any law of Congress, in connection with local, State and Federal elections.
(b) Any corporation whatever or any labor organization is prohibited from making a contribution as defined in 11 CFR part 100, subpart B.

Carey
v.
FEC,
791 F. Supp. 2d 121 (D.D.C. 2011), corporations and labor organizations may make contributions to nonconnected political committees that make only independent expenditures, or to separate accounts maintained by nonconnected political committees for making only independent expenditures, notwithstanding 11 CFR 114.2(b) and 11 CFR 114.10(a). The Commission has not conducted a rulemaking in response to these cases.
(c) Disbursements by corporations and labor organizations for the election-related activities described in 11 CFR 114.3 and 114.4 will not cause those activities to be contributions when coordinated with any candidate, candidate's agent, candidate's authorized committee(s) or any party committee to the extent permitted in those sections. Coordination beyond that described in 11 CFR 114.3 and 114.4 shall not cause subsequent activities directed at the restricted class to be considered contributions. However, such coordination may be considered evidence that could negate the independence of subsequent communications to those outside the restricted class by the corporation, labor organization or its separate segregated fund, and could result in an in-kind contribution.
See
11 CFR 100.16 regarding independent expenditures and coordination with candidates.
(d) A candidate, political committee, or other person is prohibited from knowingly accepting or receiving any contribution prohibited by this section.
(e) No officer or director of any corporation or any national bank, and no officer of any labor organization shall consent to any contribution or expenditure by the corporation, national bank, or labor organization prohibited by this section.
(f)
Facilitating the making of contributions.
(1) Corporations and labor organizations (including officers, directors or other representatives acting as agents of corporations and labor organizations) are prohibited from facilitating the making of contributions to candidates or political committees, other than to the separate segregated funds of the corporations and labor organizations. Facilitation means using corporate or labor organization resources or facilities to engage in fundraising activities in connection with any federal election, such as activities which go beyond the limited exemptions set forth in 11 CFR part 100, subparts B and C, part 100, subparts D and E, 114.9(a) through (c) and 114.13. A corporation does not facilitate the making of a contribution to a candidate or political
committee if it provides goods or services in the ordinary course of its business as a commercial vendor in accordance with 11 CFR part 116 at the usual and normal charge.
(2) Examples of facilitating the making of contributions include but are not limited to—
(i) Fundraising activities by corporations (except commercial vendors) or labor organizations that involve—
(A) Officials or employees of the corporation or labor organization ordering or directing subordinates or support staff (who therefore are not acting as volunteers) to plan, organize or carry out the fundraising project as a part of their work responsibilities using corporate or labor organization resources, unless the corporation or labor organization receives advance payment for the fair market value of such services;
(B) Failure to reimburse a corporation or labor organization within a commercially reasonable time for the use of corporate facilities described in 11 CFR 114.9(d) in connection with such fundraising activities;
(C) Using a corporate or labor organization list of customers, clients, vendors or others who are not in the restricted class to solicit contributions or distribute invitations to the fundraiser, unless the corporation or labor organization receives advance payment for the fair market value of the list;
(D) Using meeting rooms that are not customarily made available to clubs, civic or community organizations or other groups; or
(E) Providing catering or other food services operated or obtained by the corporation or labor organization, unless the corporation or labor organization receives advance payment for the fair market value of the services;
(ii) Providing materials for the purpose of transmitting or delivering contributions, such as stamps, envelopes addressed to a candidate or political committee other than the corporation's or labor organization's separate segregated fund, or other similar items which would assist in transmitting or delivering contributions, but not including providing the address of the candidate or political committee;
(iii) Soliciting contributions earmarked for a candidate that are to be collected and forwarded by the corporation's or labor organizations's separate segregated fund, except to the extent such contributions also are treated as contributions to and by the separate segregated fund; or
(iv) Using coercion, such as the threat of a detrimental job action, the threat of any other financial reprisal, or the threat of force, to urge any individual to make a contribution or engage in fundraising activities on behalf of a candidate or political committee.
(3) Facilitating the making of contributions does not include the following activities if conducted by a separate segregated fund—
(i) Any activity specifically permitted under 11 CFR 110.1, 110.2, or 114.5 through 114.8, including soliciting contributions to a candidate or political committee, and making in kind contributions to a candidate or political committee; and
(ii) Collecting and forwarding contributions earmarked to a candidate in accordance with 11 CFR 110.6.
(4) Facilitating the making of contributions also does not include the following activities if conducted by a corporation or labor organization—
(i) Enrolling members of a corporation's or labor organization's restricted class in a payroll deduction plan or check-off system which deducts contributions from dividend or payroll checks to make contributions to the corporation's or labor organization's separate segregated fund or an employee participation plan pursuant to 11 CFR 114.11;
(ii) Soliciting contributions to be sent directly to candidates if the solicitation is directed to the restricted class,
see
11 CFR 114.1(a)(2)(i); and
(iii) Soliciting contributions earmarked for a candidate that are to be collected and forwarded by the corporation's or labor organization's separate segregated fund, to the extent such contributions also are treated as contributions to and by the separate segregated fund.
(5) Facilitating the making of contributions also does not include the provision of incidental services by a
corporation to collect and forward contributions from its employee stockholders and executive and administrative personnel to the separate segregated fund of a trade association of which the corporation is a member, including collection through a payroll deduction or check-off system, pursuant to 11 CFR 114.8(e)(4).

Communications containing express advocacy which may be made to the restricted class include, but are not limited to, the examples set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section.
(1)
Publications.
Printed material expressly advocating the election or defeat of one or more clearly identified candidate(s) or candidates of a clearly identified political party may be distributed by a corporation or by a labor organization to its restricted class, provided that:
(i) The material is produced at the expense of the corporation or labor organization; and
(ii) The material constitutes a communication of the views of the corporation or the labor organization, and is not the republication or reproduction, in whole or in part, of any broadcast, transcript or tape or any written, graphic, or other form of campaign materials prepared by the candidate, his or her campaign committees, or their authorized agents. A corporation or labor organization may, under this section, use brief quotations from speeches or other materials of a candidate that demonstrate the candidate's position as part of the corporation's or labor organization's expression of its own views.
(2)
Candidate and party appearances.
(i) A corporation may allow a candidate, candidate's representative or party representative to address its restricted class at a meeting, convention or other function of the corporation, but is not required to do so. A labor organization may allow a candidate or party representative to address its restricted class at a meeting, convention, or other function of the labor organization, but is not required to do so. A corporation or labor organization may bar other candidates for the same office or a different office and their representatives, and representatives of other parties addressing the restricted class. A corporation or labor organization may allow the presence of employees outside the restricted class of the corporation or labor organization who are necessary to administer the meeting, other guests of the corporation or labor organization who are being honored or speaking or participating in the event, and representatives of the news media.
(ii) The candidate, candidate's representative or party representative
may ask for contributions to his or her campaign or party, or ask that contributions to the separate segregated fund of the corporation or labor organization be designated for his or her campaign or party. The incidental solicitation of persons outside the corporation's or labor organization's restricted class who may be present at the meeting as permitted by this section will not be a violation of 11 CFR part 114. The candidate's representative or party representative (other than an officer, director or other representative of a corporation or official, member or employee of a labor organization) or the candidate, may accept contributions before, during or after the appearance at the meeting, convention or other function of the corporation or labor organization.
(iii) The corporation or labor organization may suggest that members of its restricted class contribute to the candidate or party committee, but the collection of contributions by any officer, director or other representative of the corporation or labor organization before, during, or after the appearance while at the meeting, is an example of a prohibited facilitation of contributions under 11 CFR 114.2(f).
(iv) If the corporation or labor organization permits more than one candidate for the same office, or more than one candidate's representative or party representative, to address its restricted class, and permits the news media to cover or carry an appearance by one candidate or candidate's representative or party representative, the corporation or labor organization shall also permit the news media to cover or carry the appearances by the other candidate(s) for that office, or the other candidates' representatives or party representatives. If the corporation or labor organization permits a representative of the news media to cover or carry a candidate or candidate's representative or party representative appearance, the corporation or labor organization shall provide all other representatives of the news media with equal access for covering or carrying that appearance. Equal access is provided by—
(A) Providing advance information regarding the appearance to the representatives of the news media whom the corporation or labor organization customarily contacts and other representatives of the news media upon request; and
(B) Allowing all representatives of the news media to cover or carry the appearance, through the use of pooling arrangements if necessary.
(3)
Phone banks.
A corporation or a labor organization may establish and operate phone banks to communicate with its restricted class, urging them to register and/or vote for a particular candidate or candidates, or to register with a particular political party.
(4)
Registration and get-out-the-vote drives.
(i) A corporation or labor organization may conduct voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives aimed at its restricted class, except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section. Voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives include providing transportation to the place of registration and to the polls. Such drives may include communications containing express advocacy, such as urging individuals to register with a particular party or to vote for a particular candidate or candidates.
(ii) Disbursements for a voter registration or get-out-the-vote drive conducted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section are not contributions or expenditures if the drive is nonpartisan.
See
52 U.S.C. 30118(b)(2)(B). A drive is nonpartisan if it is conducted so that information and other assistance regarding registering or voting, including transportation and other services offered, is not withheld or refused on the basis of support for or opposition to particular candidates or a particular political party.
(iii) A corporation or labor organization may make disbursements to conduct voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives that are aimed at its restricted class and that do not qualify as nonpartisan under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, provided that the disbursements do not constitute coordinated expenditures as defined in 11 CFR 109.20, coordinated communications as defined in 11 CFR 109.21, or contributions as defined in 11 CFR part
100, subpart B.

§ 114.5
Separate segregated funds.
(a)
Voluntary contributions to a separate segregated fund.
(1) A separate segregated fund is prohibited from making a contribution or expenditure by utilizing money or anything of value secured by physical force, job discrimination, financial reprisals, or the threat of force, job discrimination, or financial reprisal; or by dues, fees, or other monies required as a condition of membership in a labor organization or as a condition of employment or by monies obtained in any commercial transaction. For purposes of this section, fees or monies paid as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership or employment are monies required as a condition of membership or employment even though they are refundable upon request of the payor.
(2) A guideline for contributions may be suggested by a corporation or a labor organization, or the separate segregated fund of either, provided that the person soliciting or the solicitation informs the persons being solicited—
(i) That the guidelines are merely suggestions; and
(ii) That an individual is free to contribute more or less than the guidelines suggest and the corporation or labor organization will not favor or disadvantage anyone by reason of the amount of their contribution or their decision not to contribute.
A corporation or labor organization or the separate segregated fund of either may not enforce any guideline for contributions.
(3) Any person soliciting an employee or member for a contribution to a separate segregated fund must inform such employee or member of the political purposes of the fund at the time of the solicitation.
(4) Any persons soliciting an employee or member for a contribution to a separate segregated fund must inform the employee or member at the time of such solicitation of his or her right to refuse to so contribute without any reprisal.
(5) Any written solicitation for a contribution to a separate segregated fund which is addressed to an employee or member must contain statements which comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) (3) and (4) of this section, and if a guideline is suggested, statements which comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(b)
Use of treasury monies.
Corporations, labor organizations, membership organizations, cooperatives, or corporations without capital stock may use general treasury monies, including monies obtained in commercial transactions and dues monies or membership fees, for the establishment, administration, and solicitation of contributions to its separate segregated fund. A corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock may not use the establishment, administration, and solicitation process as a means of exchanging treasury monies for voluntary contributions.
(1) A contributor may not be paid for his or her contribution through a bonus, expense account, or other form of direct or indirect compensation.
(2) A corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock may, subject to the provisions of 39 U.S.C. 3005 and chapter 61, title 18, United States Code, utilize a raffle or other fundraising device which involves a prize, so long as State law permits and the prize is not disproportionately valuable. Dances, parties, and other types of entertainment may also be used as fundraising devices. When using raffles or entertainment to raise funds, a reasonable practice to follow is for the separate segregated fund to reimburse the corporation or labor organization for costs which exceed one-third of the money contributed.
(3) If the separate segregated fund pays any solicitation or other administrative expense from its own account,
which expense could be paid for as an administrative expense by the collecting agent, the collecting agent may reimburse the separate segregated fund no later than 30 calendar days after the expense was paid by the separate segregated fund.
(c)
Membership in separate segregated funds.
(1) A separate segregated fund established by a corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock may provide that persons who contribute a certain amount to its separate segregated fund will become
members
of its separate segregated fund, so long as—
(i) The fund accepts contributions of all amounts, subject to the limitations of part 110;
(ii) Subject to paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, nothing of value may be given in return for or in the course of membership;
(iii) The fund may use membership status for intangible privileges such as allowing members only to choose the candidates to whom the fund will contribute.
(2) The fact that the separate segregated fund of a corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock is a
membership group
does not provide the corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock with any greater right of communication or solicitation than the corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock is otherwise granted under this part.
(d)
Control of funds.
A corporation, membership organization, cooperative, corporation without capital stock, or labor organization may exercise control over its separate segregated fund.
(e)
Disclosure.
Separate segregated funds are subject to the following disclosure requirements:
(1) A corporation or labor organization is not required to report any payment made or obligation incurred which is not a contribution or expenditure, as defined in § 114.1(a), except those reporting requirements specifically set forth in this section.
(2) A membership organization or corporation is not required to report the cost of any communication to its members or stockholders or executive or administrative personnel, if such membership organization or corporation is not organized primarily for the purpose of influencing the nomination for election, or election, of any person to Federal office, except that—
(i) The costs incurred by a membership organization, including a labor organization, or by a corporation, directly attributable to a communication expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate (other than a communication primarily devoted to subjects other than the express advocacy of the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate) shall, if those costs exceed $2,000 per election, be reported in accordance with 11 CFR 100.134(a); and
(ii) The amounts paid or incurred for legal or accounting services rendered to or on behalf of a candidate or political committee solely for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the provisions of the Act or chapter 95 or 96 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 paid by a corporation or labor organization which is the regular employer of the individual rendering such services, shall be reported in accordance with the provisions of part 104.
(3) A separate segregated fund is subject to all other disclosure requirements of political committees as set forth in part 104.
(f)
Contribution limits.
Separate segregated funds are subject to the contribution limitations for political committees set forth in part 110. (See particularly § 110.3).
(g)
Solicitations.
Except as specifically provided in §§ 114.6, 114.7, and 114.8, a corporation and/or its separate segregated fund or a labor organization and/or its separate segregated fund is subject to the following limitations on solicitations:
(1) A corporation or a separate segregated fund established by a corporation is prohibited from soliciting contributions to such fund from any person other than its stockholders and
their families and its executive or administrative personnel and their families. A corporation may solicit the executive or administrative personnel of its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and affiliates and their families. For purposes of this section, the factors set forth at 11 CFR 100.5(g)(4) shall be used to determine whether an organization is an affiliate of a corporation.
(2) A labor organization, or a separate segregated fund established by a labor organization is prohibited from soliciting contributions to such a fund from any person other than its members and executive or administrative personnel, and their families.
(h)
Accidental or inadvertent solicitation.
Accidental or inadvertent solicitation by a corporation or labor organization, or the separate segregated fund of either, of persons apart from and beyond those whom it is permitted to solicit will not be deemed a violation, provided that such corporation or labor organization or separate segregated fund has used its best efforts to comply with the limitations regarding the persons it may solicit and that the method of solicitation is corrected forthwith after the discovery of such erroneous solicitation.
(i)
Communications paid for with voluntary contributions.
A separate segregated fund may, using voluntary contributions, communicate with the general public, except that such communications may not solicit contributions to a separate segregated fund established by a corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock, unless such solicitation is permitted under paragraph (g) of this section.
(j)
Acceptance of contributions.
A separate segregated fund may accept contributions from persons otherwise permitted by law to make contributions.
(k)
Availability of methods.
Any corporation, including its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and affiliates, that uses a method of soliciting voluntary contributions or facilitating the making of voluntary contributions from its stockholders or executive or administrative personnel and their families, shall make that method available to a labor organization representing any members working for the corporation, its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and affiliates for soliciting voluntary contributions or facilitating the making of voluntary contributions from its members and their families. Such method shall be made available on the written request of the labor organization and at a cost sufficient only to reimburse the corporation for the expenses incurred thereby. For example—
(1) If a corporation, including its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, or affiliates utilizes a payroll deduction plan, check-off system, or other plan which deducts contributions from the dividend or payroll checks of stockholders or executive or administrative personnel, the corporation shall, upon written request of the labor organization, make that method available to members of the labor organization working for the corporation, its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, or affiliates, who wish to contribute to the separate segregated fund of the labor organization representing any members working for the corporation, or any of its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, or affiliates. The corporation shall make the payroll deduction plan available to the labor organization at a cost sufficient only to reimburse the corporation for the actual expenses incurred thereby.
(2) If a corporation uses a computer for addressing envelopes or labels for a solicitation to its stockholders or executive or administrative personnel, the corporation shall, upon written request, program the computer to enable the labor organization to solicit its members. The corporation shall charge the labor organization a cost sufficient only to reimburse the corporation for the actual expenses incurred in programming the computers and the allocated cost of employee time relating to the work, and the materials used.
(3) If a corporation uses corporate facilities, such as a company dining room or cafeteria, for meetings of stockholders or executive or administrative personnel at which solicitations are made, the corporation shall upon written request of the labor organization allow that labor organization to use existing corporate facilities for meetings
to solicit its members. The labor organization shall be required to reimburse the corporation for any actual expenses incurred thereby, such as any increase in the overhead to the corporation and any cost involved in setting up the facilities.
(4) If a corporation uses no method to solicit voluntary contributions or to facilitate the making of voluntary contributions from stockholders or executive or administrative personnel, it is not required by law to make any method available to the labor organization for its members. The corporation and the labor organization may agree upon making any lawful method available even though such agreement is not required by the Act.
(5) The availability of methods of twice yearly solicitations is subject to the provisions of § 114.6(e).
(l)
Methods permitted by law to labor organizations.
Notwithstanding any other law, any method of soliciting voluntary contributions or of facilitating the making of voluntary contributions to a separate segregated fund established by a corporation, permitted by law to corporations with regard to stockholders and executive or administrative personnel, shall also be permitted to labor organizations with regard to their members and executive or administrative personnel.

(iii) Provide the corporation, labor organization, or the separate segregated fund of either with any information pertaining to persons who have not contributed.

(5) Notwithstanding the prohibitions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the custodian may be employed by the separate segregated fund as its treasurer and may handle all of its contributions, provided that the custodian preserves the anonymity of the contributors as required by this section. The custodian shall file the required reports with the Federal Election Commission.

(ii) If the corporation does not wish to disclose the names and addresses of stockholders or employees, the corporation shall make the names and addresses of stockholders and employees available to an independent mailing service which shall be retained to
make the mailing for
both
the corporation and the labor organization for any mailings under this section.
(iii) If the corporation makes no solicitation of employees under this section during the calendar year, the corporation is not required to make any method or any names and addresses available to any labor organization.

§ 114.8
Trade associations.
(a)
Definition.
A trade association is generally a membership organization of persons engaging in a similar or related line of commerce, organized to promote and improve business conditions in that line of commerce and not to engage in a regular business of a kind ordinarily carried on for profit, and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any member.
(b)
Prohibition.
Nothing in this section waives the prohibition on contributions by corporations which are members of a trade association.
(c)
Limitations.
A trade association or a separate segregated fund established by a trade association may solicit contributions from the stockholders and executive or administrative personnel of the member corporations of such trade association and the families of such stockholders and personnel if—
(1) The member corporation involved has separately and specifically approved the solicitations; and
(2) The member corporation has not approved a solicitation by any other trade association for the same calendar year.
(d)
Separate and specific approval.
(1) The member corporation must knowingly and specifically approve any solicitation for a trade association, whether the solicitation is done by the trade association, its separate segregated fund, or the corporation or any of its personnel, for contributions to the trade association's separate segregated fund.
(2) A record of each approved request received by a trade association or its separate segregated fund shall be maintained by the trade association or its fund for three years from the year for which the approval is given.
(3) The request for approval may contain a record of solicitation materials which will be used if approval is granted. Such a solicitation must specifically indicate the requirement of approval and the limitation of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and approval must be granted to the trade association or its separate segregated fund prior to the time any solicitation is made of the stockholders or executive or administrative personnel by the trade association, its separate segregated fund, or by the corporation for contributions to the separate segregated fund of the trade association. (The request for approval may be sent to the representatives of the corporation with whom the trade association normally conducts the association's activities.)
(4) A separate authorization specifically allowing a trade association to solicit its corporate member's stockholders, and executive or administrative personnel applies through the calendar year for which it is designated. A separate authorization by the corporate member must be designated for each year during which the solicitation is to occur. This authorization may be requested and may also be received prior to the calendar year in which the solicitation is to occur.
(5) In its request to a member corporation, a trade association may indicate that it intends to solicit, for example, a limited class of the executive or administrative personnel of the member corporation, or only the executive or administrative personnel but not the stockholders of the member corporation. Moreover, in its approval, a member corporation may similarly limit any solicitation by the trade association or its separate segregated fund. In any event, a member corporation, once it has approved any solicitation—even to a limited extent—of its personnel or stockholders by a trade association or its separate segregated fund, is precluded from approving any such solicitation by another trade association or its separate segregated
fund and the corporation and its personnel are precluded from soliciting the corporation's executive or administrative personnel or stockholders on behalf of another trade association or its separate segregated fund.
(e)
Solicitation.
(1) After a trade association has obtained the approval required in paragraph (c) of this section, there is no limit on the number of times the trade association or its separate segregated fund may solicit the persons approved by the member corporation during the calendar year to which the approval applies. The member corporation may, however, in its approval limit the number of times solicitations may be made.
(2) A member corporation which grants permission to a trade association to solicit is in no way restricted in its rights under § 114.5(g) to solicit its stockholders or executive or administrative personnel and their families for contributions to the corporation's own separate segregated fund.
(3) There is no limitation on the method of soliciting voluntary contributions or the method of facilitating the making of voluntary contributions which a trade association may use.
(4) A corporation may provide incidental services to collect and forward contributions from its employee stockholders and executive and administrative personnel to the separate segregated fund of a trade association of which the corporation is a member, including a payroll deduction or check-off system, upon written request of the trade association. Any corporation that provides such incidental services, and the corporation's subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and affiliates, shall make those incidental services available to a labor organization representing any members working for the corporation or the corporation's subsidiaries, branches, divisions, or affiliates, upon written request of the labor organization and at a cost sufficient only to reimburse the corporation or the corporation's subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and affiliates, for the expenses incurred thereby.
(5) A trade association and/or its separate segregated fund is subject to the provisions of § 114.5(a).
(f)
Solicitation of a subsidiary corporation.
If a parent corporation is a member of the trade association but its subsidiary is not, the trade association or its separate segregated fund may only solicit the parent's executive or administrative personnel and their families and the parent's stockholders and their families; it may not solicit the subsidiary's executive or administrative personnel or stockholders or their families. If a subsidiary is a member of the trade association but the parent corporation is not, the trade association or its separate segregated fund may only solicit the subsidiary's executive or administrative personnel and their families and the subsidiary's stockholders and their families; it may not solicit the parent's executive or administrative personnel or stockholders or their families. If both parent and subsidiary are members of the trade association, the executive or administrative personnel and their families and the stockholders and their families of each may be solicited.
(g)
Federations of trade associations.
(1) A federation of trade associations is an organization representing trade associations involved in the same or allied line of commerce. Such a federation may, subject to the following limitations, solicit the members of the federation's regional, State or local affiliates or members, provided that all of the political committees established, financed, maintained or controlled by the federation and its regional, State, or local affiliates or members are considered one political committee for the purposes of the limitations in §§ 110.1 and 110.2. The factors set forth at § 100.5(g)(4) shall be used to determine whether an entity is a regional, State or local affiliate of a federation of trade associations.
(i) The federation and its member associations may engage in a joint solicitation; or
(ii) The member association may delegate its solicitation rights to the federation.
(2) A federation is subject to the provisions of this section when soliciting the stockholders and executive or administrative personnel of the corporate members of its member associations.
(h)
Communications other than solicitations.
A trade association may make communications, other than solicitations, to its members and their families under the provisions of § 114.3. When making communications to a member which is a corporation, the trade association may communicate with the representatives of the corporation with whom the trade association normally conducts the association's activities.
(i)
Trade association employees.
(1) A trade association may communicate with its executive or administrative personnel and their families under the provisions of § 114.3; a trade association may communicate with its other employees under the provisions of § 114.4.
(2) A trade association may solicit its executive or administrative personnel and their families under the provisions of § 114.5(g); a trade association may solicit its other employees under the provisions of § 114.6.

facilities of a labor organization for individual volunteer activity in connection with a Federal election and will be required to reimburse the labor organization only to the extent that the overhead or operating costs of the labor organization are increased. A labor organization may not condition the availability of its facilities on their being used for political activity, or on support for or opposition to any particular candidate or political party. As used in this paragraph,
occasional, isolated, or incidental use
generally means—
(i) When used by employees during working hours, an amount of activity during any particular work period which does not prevent the employee from completing the normal amount of work which that employee usually carries out during such work period; or

The separate segregated fund of a corporation or a labor organization may pay the employer's share of fringe benefits, and such payment would be a contribution in-kind to the candidate. An employee or member may, out of unreimbursed personal funds, assure the continuity of his or her fringe benefits during absence from work for political campaigning, and such payment would not be a contribution in-kind.
(2) Service credit for periods of leave-without-pay is not considered compensation for purposes of this section if the employer normally gives identical treatment to employees placed on leave-without-pay for nonpolitical purposes.

§ 116.2
Debts owed by terminating committees, ongoing committees, and authorized committees.
(a)
Terminating committees.
A terminating committee may settle outstanding debts provided that the terminating committee files a debt settlement plan and the requirements of 11 CFR 116.7 are satisfied. The Commission will review each debt settlement plan filed to determine whether or not the terminating committee appears to have complied with the requirements set forth in this part, and whether or not the proposed debt settlement plan would result in an apparent violation of the Act or the Commission's regulations.
(b)
Ongoing committees.
Ongoing committees shall not settle any outstanding debts for less than the entire amount owed, but may request a Commission determination that such debts are not payable under 11 CFR 116.9, and may resolve disputed debts under 11 CFR 116.10. Creditors may forgive debts owed by ongoing committees under the limited circumstances provided in 11 CFR 116.8.
(c)
Authorized committees.
(1) An authorized committee shall not settle any outstanding debts for less than the entire amount owed if any other authorized committee of the same candidate has permissible funds available to pay part or all of the amount outstanding. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3), of this section, an authorized committee shall not terminate under 11 CFR 102.3 if—
(i) It has any outstanding debts or obligations; or
(ii) It has any funds or assets available to pay part or all of the outstanding debts or obligations owed by another authorized committee of the same candidate and that other authorized committee is unable to pay such debts or obligations.
(2) No transfers of funds may be made from a candidate's authorized committee to another authorized committee of the same candidate if the transferor committee has net debts outstanding at the time of the transfer under the formula described in 11 CFR 110.1(b)(3)(ii).
(3) An authorized committee that qualifies as a terminating committee may assign debts to another authorized committee of the same candidate to the extent permitted under applicable state law provided that the authorized committee assigning the debts has no cash on hand or assets available to pay any part of the outstanding debts, and provided that the authorized committee assigning the debts was not organized to further the candidate's campaign in an election not yet held. If a Presidential candidate elects to receive federal funds pursuant to 11 CFR part 9001
et seq.
or 11 CFR part 9031
et seq.,
the authorized committee(s) of the Presidential candidate shall not assign debts or receive assigned debts until after the authorized committee(s) or the Presidential candidate has made all required repayments pursuant to 11 CFR parts 9007 and 9038 and has paid all civil penalties pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30109. An authorized committee that has assigned all its outstanding debts may terminate if—
(i) The authorized committee that has assigned the debts otherwise qualifies for termination under 11 CFR 102.3; and
(ii) The authorized committee that received the assigned debts notifies the Commission in writing that it has assumed the obligation to pay the entire amount owed and that it has assumed the obligation to report the debts, and any contributions received for retirement of the assigned debts, in accordance with 11 CFR part 104. The assigned debts shall be disclosed on a separate schedule of debts and obligations attached to the authorized committee's reports. Contributions received for retirement of the assigned debts shall be disclosed on a separate schedule of receipts attached to the authorized committee's reports.
See
11 CFR 110.1 (b)(3) and (b)(4) and 110.2 (b)(3) and (b)(4). The authorized committee that has assigned the debts shall notify each creditor in writing of the assignment no later than thirty days before the assignment takes effect and shall include the name and address of the authorized committee that will receive the assigned debts.

§ 116.3
Extensions of credit by commercial vendors.
(a)
Unincorporated vendor.
A commercial vendor that is not a corporation may extend credit to a candidate, a political committee or another person on behalf of a candidate or political committee. An extension of credit will not be considered a contribution to the candidate or political committee provided that the credit is extended in the ordinary course of the commercial vendor's business and the terms are substantially similar to extensions of credit to nonpolitical debtors that are of similar risk and size of obligation.
(b)
Incorporated vendor.
A corporation in its capacity as a commercial vendor
may extend credit to a candidate, a political committee or another person on behalf of a candidate or political committee provided that the credit is extended in the ordinary course of the corporation's business and the terms are substantially similar to extensions of credit to nonpolitical debtors that are of similar risk and size of obligation.
(c)
Ordinary course of business.
In determining whether credit was extended in the ordinary course of business, the Commission will consider—
(1) Whether the commercial vendor followed its established procedures and its past practice in approving the extension of credit;
(2) Whether the commercial vendor received prompt payment in full if it previously extended credit to the same candidate or political committee; and
(3) Whether the extension of credit conformed to the usual and normal practice in the commercial vendor's trade or industry.
(d)
Extension of credit by regulated industries.
The Commission may rely on the regulations prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Department of Transportation on behalf of the Civil Aeronautics Board, issued pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30141 and any other regulations prescribed by other Federal agencies to determine whether extensions of credit by the entities regulated by those Federal agencies were made in the ordinary course of business.

§ 116.4

(a)
Unincorporated vendor.
A commercial vendor that is not a corporation may forgive or settle a debt incurred by a candidate, a political committee or another person on behalf of a candidate or political committee for less than the entire amount owed on the debt. The amount forgiven will not be considered a contribution by the commercial vendor to the candidate or political committee if—
(1) The amount forgiven is exempted from the definition of contribution in 11 CFR part 100, subpart C; or
(2) The commercial vendor has treated the debt in a commercially reasonable manner and the requirements of 11 CFR 116.7 or 116.8, as appropriate, are satisfied.
(b)
Incorporated vendor.
A corporation may not forgive or settle a debt incurred by a candidate, a political committee or another person on behalf of a candidate or political committee for less than the entire amount owed on the debt unless—
(1) The amount forgiven is exempted from the definition of contribution in 11 CFR part 100, subpart C; or
(2) The corporation has treated the debt in a commercially reasonable manner and the requirements of 11 CFR 116.7 or 116.8, as appropriate, are satisfied.
(c)
Reasonable efforts by a political committee.
A debt or obligation owed by a candidate or a political committee may be totally forgiven (
see
11 CFR 116.8), or settled (
see
11 CFR 116.7), provided that—
(1) The amount forgiven is exempted from the definition of contribution in 11 CFR part 100, subpart C; or
(2) The candidate and the political committee have undertaken all reasonable efforts to satisfy the outstanding debt and the requirements of 11 CFR 116.7 or 116.8, as appropriate, including the submission of the information specified in those sections and Commission review, are satisfied.
(d)
Commercially reasonable.
The Commission will determine that a debt settlement between a political committee and a commercial vendor is commercially reasonable if—
(1) The initial extension of credit was made in accordance with 11 CFR 116.3;
(2) The candidate or political committee has undertaken all reasonable efforts to satisfy the outstanding debt. Such efforts may include, but are not limited to, the following—
(i) Engaging in fundraising efforts;
(ii) Reducing overhead and administrative costs; and
(iii) Liquidating assets; and
(3) The commercial vendor has pursued its remedies as vigorously as it would pursue its remedies against a
nonpolitical debtor in similar circumstances. Such remedies may include, but are not limited to, the following—
(i) Oral and written requests for payment;
(ii) Withholding delivery of additional goods or services until overdue debts are satisfied;
(iii) Imposition of additional charges or penalties for late payment;
(iv) Referral of overdue debts to a commercial debt collection service; and
(v) Litigation.
(e)
Settlement or forgiveness not required.
The provisions of this part shall not be construed to require a commercial vendor to forgive or settle the debt for less than the entire amount owed.
(f)
Reporting.
The political committee shall continue to report the debt in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(d) and 104.11 until the Commission has completed a review of the debt settlement plan pursuant to 11 CFR 116.7(f) or until the Commission has completed a review of the request to forgive the debt pursuant to 11 CFR 116.8, or until the political committee pays the debt, whichever occurs first.

(b)
Treatment as contributions.
The payment by an individual from his or her personal funds, including a personal credit card, for the costs incurred in providing goods or services to, or obtaining goods or services that are used by or on behalf of, a candidate or a political committee is a contribution unless the payment is exempted from the definition of contribution under 11 CFR 100.79. If the payment is not exempted under 11 CFR 100.79, it shall be considered a contribution by the individual unless—
(1) The payment is for the individual's transportation expenses incurred while traveling on behalf of a candidate or political committee of a political party or for usual and normal subsistence expenses incurred by an individual, other than a volunteer, while traveling on behalf of a candidate or political committee of a political party; and
(2) The individual is reimbursed within sixty days after the closing date of the billing statement on which the charges first appear if the payment was made using a personal credit card, or within thirty days after the date on which the expenses were incurred if a personal credit card was not used. For purposes of this section, the closing date shall be the date indicated on the billing statement which serves as the cutoff date for determining which charges are included on that billing statement. In addition, “subsistence expenses” include only expenditures for personal living expenses related to a particular individual traveling on committee business, such as food or lodging.
(c)
Treatment as debts.
A political committee shall treat the obligation arising from a payment described in paragraph (b) of this section as an outstanding debt until reimbursed.

The individual and the political committee may agree to the total forgiveness of the debt (
See
11 CFR 116.8) or a settlement of the debt for less than the entire amount owed (
See
11 CFR 116.7), provided that the requirements of 11 CFR 116.7 or 116.8, as appropriate, including the submission of the information specified in these sections and Commission review, are satisfied. The provisions of this part shall not be construed to require the individual to forgive or settle the debt for less than the entire amount owed.

§ 116.6
Salary payments owed to employees.
(a)
Treatment as debts or volunteer services.
If a political committee does not pay an employee for services rendered to the political committee in accordance with an employment contract or a formal or informal agreement to do so, the unpaid amount either may be treated as a debt owed by the political committee to the employee or, provided that the employee signs a written statement agreeing to be considered a volunteer, converted to a volunteer services arrangement under 11 CFR 100.74. The unpaid amount shall not be treated as a contribution under 11 CFR part 100, subparts B and C.

(1) The terms of the initial extension of credit and a description of the terms under which the creditor has extended credit to nonpolitical debtors of similar risk and size of obligation;
(2) A description of the efforts made by the candidate or the ongoing committee to satisfy the debt;
(3) A description of the remedies pursued by the creditor to obtain payment of the debt and a comparison to the remedies customarily pursued by the creditor in similar circumstances involving nonpolitical debtors; and
(4) An indication that the creditor has forgiven other debts involving nonpolitical debtors in similar circumstances, if any.
(c)
Commission review.
Upon the Commission's request, the ongoing committee or the creditor shall provide such additional information as the Commission may require to review the creditor's request. The Commission will review each request to forgive a debt to determine whether the candidate, the ongoing committee, and the creditor have complied with the requirements of 11 CFR part 116, and whether or not the forgiveness of the debt would result in an apparent violation of the Act or the Commission's regulations.
[55 FR 26386, June 27, 1990, as amended at 89 FR 218, Jan. 2, 2024]
§ 116.9
Creditors that cannot be found or that are out of business.
(a)
General requirements.
A political committee may request that the Commission determine that a debt owed to a creditor is not payable for purposes of the Act if the debt has been outstanding for at least twenty-four months, and the requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, as appropriate, have been satisfied, and—
(1) The creditor has gone out of business and no other entity has a right to be paid the amount owed; or
(2) The political committee has exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to locate the creditor and has been unable to do so.
Reasonable diligence in attempting to locate the creditor
means the political committee has attempted to ascertain the current address, telephone number, and email address, and has attempted to contact the creditor by registered or certified mail, and either in person, by telephone, or by email.
(b)
Terminating committees.
If the political committee making the request is a terminating committee, the terminating committee shall include the request in a debt settlement plan filed with the Commission, and shall demonstrate that the requirements of 11 CFR 116.3, 116.5 or 116.6, as appropriate, and 116.9(a) are satisfied. The terminating committee shall continue to disclose the debt on its schedules of outstanding debts and obligations until the Commission has completed its review of the debt settlement plan pursuant to 11 CFR 116.7(f) and has determined that the debt is not payable for purposes of the Act.
(c)
Ongoing committees.
If the political committee making the request is an ongoing committee, the ongoing committee shall make the request in writing and shall demonstrate that the requirements of 11 CFR 116.3, 116.5 or 116.6, as appropriate, and 116.9(a) are satisfied. The Commission will review the request to determine whether the ongoing committee and the creditor have complied with the requirements of 11 CFR part 116, and to determine whether reporting the debt as not payable would result in an apparent violation of the Act or the Commission's regulations. The ongoing committee shall continue to disclose the debt on its schedules of outstanding debts and obligations until the Commission has completed its review of the request and has determined that the debt is not payable for purposes of the Act.
(d)
Reporting.
Upon notification that the Commission has determined that the debt is not payable for purposes of the Act, the political committee may list the debt as not payable on the next due report. Notwithstanding 11 CFR 104.11, the debt does not have to be included in subsequent reports unless the status of the debt changes. The presence of a debt that the Commission has determined is not payable shall not bar the political committee from terminating its registration pursuant to 11 CFR 102.3.
[55 FR 26386, June 27, 1990, as amended at 89 FR 218, Jan. 2, 2024]
§ 116.10
Disputed debts.
(a)
Reporting disputed debts.
A political committee shall report a disputed debt in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(d) and 104.11 if the creditor has provided something of value to the political committee. Until the dispute is resolved, the political committee shall disclose on the appropriate reports any amounts paid to the creditor, any amount the political committee admits it owes and the amount the creditor claims is owed. The political committee may also note on the appropriate reports that the disclosure of the disputed debt does not constitute an admission of liability or a waiver of any claims the political committee may have against the creditor. (
See also
11 CFR 9035.1(a)(2) regarding the effect of disputed debts on a candidate's expenditure limitations under 11 CFR part 9035.)
(b)
Disputed debts owed by terminating committees.
If a terminating committee and a creditor have been unable to resolve a disputed debt, and the terminating committee files a debt settlement plan covering other debts or other creditors, the terminating committee shall include in the debt settlement plan a brief description as to the nature of the dispute and the status of the terminating committee's efforts to resolve the dispute. The debt settlement plan need not include a signed affidavit from the creditor involved in the dispute pursuant to 11 CFR 116.7(e)(2).

Federal Register,
to advise interested persons and to invite their participation.
(d) The Commission will not consider the merits of the petition before the expiration of the comment period on the Notice of Availability.

means to ask, request, or recommend, explicitly or implicitly, that another person make a contribution, donation, transfer of funds, or otherwise provide anything of value. A solicitation is an oral or written communication that, construed as reasonably understood in the context in which it is made, contains a clear message asking, requesting, or recommending that another person make a contribution, donation, transfer of funds, or otherwise provide anything of value. A solicitation may be made directly or indirectly. The context includes the conduct of persons involved in the communication. A solicitation does not include mere statements of political support or mere guidance as to the applicability of a particular law or regulation.
(1) The following types of communications constitute solicitations:
(i) A communication that provides a method of making a contribution or donation, regardless of the communication. This includes, but is not limited to, providing a separate card, envelope, or reply device that contains an address to which funds may be sent and allows contributors or donors to indicate the dollar amount of their contribution or donation to the candidate, political committee, or other organization.
(ii) A communication that provides instructions on how or where to send contributions or donations, including providing a phone number specifically dedicated to facilitating the making of contributions or donations. However, a communication does not, in and of itself, satisfy the definition of “to solicit” merely because it includes a mailing address or phone number that is not specifically dedicated to facilitating the making of contributions or donations.
(iii) A communication that identifies a website address where the web page displayed is specifically dedicated to facilitating the making of a contribution or donation, or automatically redirects the Internet user to such a
page, or exclusively displays a link to such a page. However, a communication does not, in and of itself, satisfy the definition of “to solicit” merely because it includes the address of a web page that is not specifically dedicated to facilitating the making of a contribution or donation.
(2) The following statements constitute solicitations:
(i) “Please give $100,000 to Group X.”
(ii) “It is important for our State party to receive at least $100,000 from each of you in this election.”
(iii) “Group X has always helped me financially in my elections. Keep them in mind this fall.”
(iv) “X is an effective State party organization; it needs to obtain as many $100,000 donations as possible.”
(v) “Giving $100,000 to Group X would be a very smart idea.”
(vi) “Send all contributions to the following address * * *.”
(vii) “I am not permitted to ask for contributions, but unsolicited contributions will be accepted at the following address * * *.”
(viii) “Group X is having a fundraiser this week; you should go.”
(ix) “You have reached the limit of what you may contribute directly to my campaign, but you can further help my campaign by assisting the State party.”
(x) A candidate hands a potential donor a list of people who have contributed to a group and the amounts of their contributions. The candidate says, “I see you are not on the list.”
(xi) “I will not forget those who contribute at this crucial stage.”
(xii) “The candidate will be very pleased if we can count on you for $10,000.”
(xiii) “Your contribution to this campaign would mean a great deal to the entire party and to me personally.”
(xiv) Candidate says to potential donor: “The money you will help us raise will allow us to communicate our message to the voters through Labor Day.”
(xv) “I appreciate all you've done in the past for our party in this State. Looking ahead, we face some tough elections. I'd be very happy if you could maintain the same level of financial support for our State party this year.”
(xvi) The head of Group X solicits a contribution from a potential donor in the presence of a candidate. The donor asks the candidate if the contribution to Group X would be a good idea and would help the candidate's campaign. The candidate nods affirmatively.
(3) The following statements do not constitute solicitations:
(i) During a policy speech, the candidate says: “Thank you for your support of the Democratic Party.”
(ii) At a ticket-wide rally, the candidate says: “Thank you for your support of my campaign.”
(iii) At a Labor Day rally, the candidate says: “Thank you for your past financial support of the Republican Party.”
(iv) At a GOTV rally, the candidate says: “Thank you for your continuing support.”
(v) At a ticket-wide rally, the candidate says: “It is critical that we support the entire Democratic ticket in November.”
(vi) A Federal officeholder says: “Our Senator has done a great job for us this year. The policies she has vigorously promoted in the Senate have really helped the economy of the State.”
(vii) A candidate says: “Thanks to your contributions we have been able to support our President, Senator and Representative during the past election cycle.”
(n)
To direct.
For the purposes of part 300,
to direct
means to guide, directly or indirectly, a person who has expressed an intent to make a contribution, donation, transfer of funds, or otherwise provide anything of value, by identifying a candidate, political committee or organization, for the receipt of such funds, or things of value. The contribution, donation, transfer, or thing of value may be made or provided directly or through a conduit or intermediary. Direction does not include merely providing information or guidance as to the applicability of a particular law or regulation.
(o)
Individual holding Federal office. Individual holding Federal office
means an individual elected to or serving in the office of President or Vice President of the United States; or a Senator

A State, district, or local committee of a political party must itself raise the Federal component of an expenditure or disbursement allocated between Federal funds and Levin funds under 11 CFR 300.32 and 300.33.
(2) A State, district, or local committee of a political party that makes an expenditure or disbursement of Federal funds for Federal election activities must demonstrate through a reasonable accounting method approved by the Commission (including any method embedded in software provided or approved by the Commission) that the Federal funds used to make the expenditure or disbursement do not include Federal funds transferred to the committee in violation of this section. Alternatively, a State, district, or local committee of a political party may establish a separate Federal account into which the committee deposits only Federal funds raised by the committee itself, and from which all expenditures or disbursement of Federal funds for Federal election activities are made.
(b)
Levin funds.
Levin funds must be raised solely by the State, district, or local committee of a political party that expends or disburses the funds. A State, district, or local committee of a political party must not use as Levin funds any funds transferred or otherwise provided to the committee by:
(1) Any other State, district, or local committee of any political party, any officer or agent acting on behalf of such a committee, or any entity directly or indirectly established, financed, maintained or controlled by such a committee; or,
(2) The national committee of any political party (including a national congressional campaign committee of a political party), any officer or agent acting on behalf of such a committee, or any entity directly or indirectly established, financed, maintained, or controlled by such a committee.

Office buildings.
(a)
General provision.
For the purchase or construction of its office building, a State or local party committee may spend Federal funds or non-Federal funds that are not subject to the limitations, prohibitions, and
disclosure provisions of the Act, so long as such funds are not contributed or donated by a foreign national.
See
52 U.S.C. 30121. If non-Federal funds are used, they are subject to State law. An office building must not be purchased or constructed for the purpose of influencing the election of any candidate in any particular election for Federal office. For purposes of this section, the term
local party committee
shall include a
district party committee.
(b)
Application of State law.
Non-Federal funds received by a State or local party committee that are spent for the purchase or construction of its office building are subject to State law as set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1)
Non-Federal account.
If a State or local party committee uses non-Federal funds, Federal law does not preempt or supersede State law as to the source of funds used, the permissibility of the disbursements, or the reporting of the receipt and disbursement of such funds, except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.
(2)
Levin funds.
Levin funds may be used for the purchase or construction of a State or local party committee office building, if permitted by State law.
(c)
Leasing a portion of the party office building.
A State or local party committee may lease a portion of its office building to others to generate income at the usual and normal charge. If the building is purchased or constructed in whole or in part with non-Federal funds, all rental income shall be deposited in the committee's non-Federal account and used only for non-Federal purposes. Such rental income and its use must also comply with State law. If the building is purchased or constructed solely with Federal funds, the rental income may be deposited in the Federal account. The receipt of such funds shall be reported in compliance with 11 CFR 104.3(a)(4)(vi).
(d)
Transitional Provisions for State Party Building or Facility Account.
Up to and including November 5, 2002, the State committee of a political party may accept funds into its party office building or facility account, established pursuant to repealed 2 U.S.C. 431(8)(B)(viii), designated for the purchase or construction of an office building. Starting on November 6, 2002, the funds in the account may not be used for Federal account or Levin account purposes, but may be used for any non-Federal purposes, as permitted under State law.

A payment of Federal funds for Federal election activity that refers to a clearly identified Federal candidate and that meets the criteria of 11 CFR 100.140, 100.147, or 100.149 (

In the report covering the period in which each transfer occurred, the committee must explain in a memo entry the allocated disbursement to which the transfer relates and the date on which the transfer was made.
