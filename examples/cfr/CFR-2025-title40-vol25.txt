refers to title 40, part 136, section 1.

# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

5
Because the MF technique usually yields low and variable recovery from chlorinated wastewaters, the Most Probable Number method will be required to resolve any controversies.
6
Tests must be conducted to provide organism enumeration (density). Select the appropriate configuration of tubes/filtrations and dilutions/volumes to account for the quality, character, consistency, and anticipated organism density of the water sample.
7
When the MF method has been used previously to test waters with high turbidity, large numbers of noncoliform bacteria, or samples that may contain organisms stressed by chlorine, a parallel test should be conducted with a multiple-tube technique to demonstrate applicability and comparability of results.
8
To assess the comparability of results obtained with individual methods, it is suggested that side-by-side tests be conducted across seasons of the year with the water samples routinely tested in accordance with the most current
Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater
or EPA alternate test procedure (ATP) guidelines.

The multiple-tube fermentation test is used in 9221B.2-2014. Lactose broth may be used in lieu of lauryl tryptose broth (LTB), if at least 25 parallel tests are conducted between this broth and LTB using the water samples normally tested, and this comparison demonstrates that the false-positive rate and false-negative rate for total coliform using lactose broth is less than 10 percent. No requirement exists to run the completed phase on 10 percent of all total coliform-positive tubes on a seasonal basis.
13
These tests are collectively known as defined enzyme substrate tests.

After prior enrichment in a presumptive medium for total coliform using 9221B.2-2014, all presumptive tubes or bottles showing any amount of gas, growth or acidity within 48 h ± 3 h of incubation shall be submitted to 9221F-2014. Commercially available EC-MUG media or EC media supplemented in the laboratory with 50 µg/mL of MUG may be used.

16
Samples shall be enumerated by the multiple-tube or multiple-well procedure. Using multiple-tube procedures, employ an appropriate tube and dilution configuration of the sample as needed and report the Most Probable Number (MPN). Samples tested with Colilert® may be enumerated with the multiple-well procedures, Quanti-Tray® or Quanti-Tray®/2000 and the MPN calculated from the table provided by the manufacturer.
17
Colilert-18® is an optimized formulation of the Colilert® for the determination of total coliforms and
E. coli
that provides results within 18 h of incubation at 35 °C rather than the 24 h required for the Colilert® test and is recommended for marine water samples.

To use Colilert-18® to assay for fecal coliforms, the incubation temperature is 44.5 ± 0.2 °C, and a water bath incubator is used.
29
On a monthly basis, at least ten blue colonies from positive samples must be verified using Lauryl Tryptose Broth and EC broth, followed by count adjustment based on these results; and representative non-blue colonies should be verified using Lauryl Tryptose Broth. Where possible, verifications should be done from randomized sample sources.
30
On a monthly basis, at least ten sheen colonies from positive samples must be verified using lauryl tryptose broth and brilliant green lactose bile broth, followed by count adjustment based on these results; and representative non-sheen colonies should be verified using lauryl tryptose broth. Where possible, verifications should be done from randomized sample sources.
31
Subject coliform positive samples determined by 9222 B-2015 or other membrane filter procedure to 9222 I-2015 using NA-MUG media.
32
Verification of colonies by incubation of BHI agar at 10 ± 0.5 °C for 48 ± 3 h is optional. As per the Errata to the 23rd Edition of
Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater
“Growth on a BHI agar plate incubated at 10 ± 0.5 °C for 48 ± 3 h is further verification that the colony belongs to the genus
Enterococcus.”
33
9221F. 2-2014 allows for simultaneous detection of
E. coli
and thermotolerant fecal coliforms by adding inverted vials to EC-MUG; the inverted vials collect gas produced by thermotolerant fecal coliforms.

For the determination of total metals (which are equivalent to total recoverable metals) the sample is not filtered before processing. A digestion procedure is required to solubilize analytes in suspended material and to break down organic-metal complexes (to convert the analyte to a detectable form for colorimetric analysis). For non-platform graphite furnace atomic absorption determinations, a digestion using nitric acid (as specified in Section 4.1.3 of Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes) is required prior to analysis. The procedure used should subject the sample to gentle acid refluxing, and at no time should the sample be taken to dryness. For direct aspiration flame atomic absorption (FLAA) determinations, a combination acid (nitric and hydrochloric acids) digestion is preferred, prior to analysis. The approved total recoverable digestion is described as Method 200.2 in Supplement I of “Methods for the Determination of Metals in Environmental Samples” EPA/600R-94/111, May 1994, and is reproduced in EPA Methods 200.7, 200.8, and 200.9 from the same Supplement. However, when using the gaseous hydride technique or for the determination of certain elements such as antimony, arsenic, selenium, silver, and tin by non-EPA graphite furnace atomic absorption methods, mercury by cold vapor atomic absorption, the noble metals and titanium by FLAA, a specific or modified sample digestion procedure may be required, and, in all cases the referenced method write-up should be consulted for specific instruction and/or cautions. For analyses using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), the direct current plasma (DCP) technique or EPA spectrochemical techniques (platform furnace AA, ICP-AES, and ICP-MS), use EPA Method 200.2 or an approved alternate procedure (e.g., CEM microwave digestion, which may be used with certain analytes as indicated in this table IB); the total recoverable digestion procedures in EPA Methods 200.7, 200.8, and 200.9 may be used for those respective methods. Regardless of the digestion procedure, the results of the analysis after digestion procedure are reported as “total” metals.
5
Copper sulfate or other catalysts that have been found suitable may be used in place of mercuric sulfate.
6
Manual distillation is not required if comparability data on representative effluent samples are on file to show that this preliminary distillation step is not necessary; however, manual distillation will be required to resolve any controversies. In general, the analytical method should be consulted regarding the need for distillation. If the method is not clear, the laboratory may compare a minimum of 9 different sample matrices to evaluate the need for distillation. For each matrix, a matrix spike and matrix spike duplicate are analyzed both with and without the distillation step (for a total of 36 samples, assuming 9 matrices). If results are comparable, the laboratory may dispense with the distillation step for future analysis. Comparable is defined as
20% RPD for all tested matrices). Alternatively, the two populations of spike recovery percentages may be compared using a recognized statistical test.

test method which measures “total 5-day BOD.” The addition of the nitrification inhibitor is not a procedural option but must be included to report the CBOD
5
parameter. A discharger whose permit requires reporting the traditional BOD
5
may not use a nitrification inhibitor in the procedure for reporting the results. Only when a discharger's permit specifically states CBOD

is required can the permittee report data using a nitrification inhibitor.

Approved methods for the analysis of silver in industrial wastewaters at concentrations of 1 mg/L and above are inadequate where silver exists as an inorganic halide. Silver halides such as the bromide and chloride are relatively insoluble in reagents such as nitric acid but are readily soluble in an aqueous buffer of sodium thiosulfate and sodium hydroxide to pH of 12. Therefore, for levels of silver above 1 mg/L, 20 mL of sample should be diluted to 100 mL by adding 40 mL each of 2 M Na

and NaOH. Standards should be prepared in the same manner. For levels of silver below 1 mg/L the approved method is satisfactory.
30
The use of EDTA decreases method sensitivity. Analysts may omit EDTA or replace with another suitable complexing reagent provided that all method-specified quality control acceptance criteria are met.
31
For samples known or suspected to contain high levels of silver (e.g., in excess of 4 mg/L), cyanogen iodide should be used to keep the silver in solution for analysis. Prepare a cyanogen iodide solution by adding 4.0 mL of concentrated NH
4
OH, 6.5 g of KCN, and 5.0 mL of a 1.0 N solution of I
2
to 50 mL of reagent water in a volumetric flask and dilute to 100.0 mL. After digestion of the sample, adjust the pH of the digestate to
7 to prevent the formation of HCN under acidic conditions. Add 1 mL of the cyanogen iodide solution to the sample digestate and adjust the volume to 100 mL with reagent water (NOT acid). If cyanogen iodide is added to sample digestates, then silver standards must be prepared that contain cyanogen iodide as well. Prepare working standards by diluting a small volume of a silver stock solution with water and adjusting the pH
7 with NH
4
OH. Add 1 mL of the cyanogen iodide solution and let stand 1 hour. Transfer to a 100-mL volumetric flask and dilute to volume with water.

58
Unless otherwise stated, if the language of this table specifies a sample digestion and/or distillation “followed by” analysis with a method, approved digestion and/or distillation are required prior to analysis.
59
Samples analyzed for available cyanide using OI Analytical method OIA-1677-09 or ASTM method D6888-16 that contain particulate matter may be filtered only after the ligand exchange reagents have been added to the samples, because the ligand exchange process converts complexes containing available cyanide to free cyanide, which is not removed by filtration. Analysts are further cautioned to limit the time between the addition of the ligand exchange reagents and sample filtration to no more than 30 minutes to preclude settling of materials in samples.
60
Analysts should be aware that pH optima and chromophore absorption maxima might differ when phenol is replaced by a substituted phenol as the color reagent in Berthelot Reaction (“phenol-hypochlorite reaction”) colorimetric ammonium determination methods. For example, when phenol is used as the color reagent, pH optimum and wavelength of maximum absorbance are about 11.5 and 635 nm, respectively—see, Patton, C.J. and S.R. Crouch. March 1977.

Each laboratory may establish its own control limits by performing at least 25 glucose-glutamic acid (GGA) checks over several weeks or months and calculating the mean and standard deviation. The laboratory may then use the mean ± 3 standard deviations as the control limit for future GGA checks. However, GGA acceptance criteria can be no wider than 198 ± 30.5 mg/L for BOD
5
. GGA acceptance criteria for CBOD must be either 198 ± 30.5 mg/L, or the lab may develop control charts under the following conditions: dissolved oxygen uptake from the seed contribution is between 0.6-1.0 mg/L; control charts are performed on at least 25 GGA checks with three standard deviations from the derived mean; the RSD must not exceed 7.5%; and any single GGA value cannot be less than 150 mg/L or higher than 250 mg/L.

Method 624.1 may be used for quantitative determination of acrolein and acrylonitrile, provided that the laboratory has documentation to substantiate the ability to detect and quantify these analytes at levels necessary to comply with any associated regulations. In addition, the use of sample introduction techniques other than simple purge-and-trap may be required. QC acceptance criteria from Method 603 should be used when analyzing samples for acrolein and acrylonitrile in the absence of such criteria in Method 624.1.
5
Method 625.1 may be extended to include benzidine, hexachlorocyclopentadiene, N-nitrosodimethylamine, N-nitrosodi-
n
-propylamine, and N-nitrosodiphenylamine. However, when they are known to be present, Methods 605, 607, and 612, or Method 1625B, are preferred methods for these compounds. Method 625.1 may be applied to 2,3,7,8-Tetrachloro-dibenzo-
p
-dioxin for screening purposes only.

Each analyst must make an initial, one-time demonstration of their ability to generate acceptable precision and accuracy with Methods 601-603, 1624B, and 1625B in accordance with procedures in Section 8.2 of each of these methods. Additionally, each laboratory, on an on-going basis must spike and analyze 10% (5% for Methods 624.1 and 625.1 and 100% for methods 1624B and 1625B) of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality in accordance with Sections 8.3 and 8.4 of these methods. When the recovery of any parameter falls outside the quality control (QC) acceptance criteria in the pertinent method, analytical results for that parameter in the unspiked sample are suspect. The results should be reported but cannot be used to demonstrate regulatory compliance. If the method does not contain QC acceptance criteria, control limits of ±three standard deviations around the mean of a minimum of five replicate measurements must be used. These quality control requirements also apply to the Standard Methods, ASTM Methods, and other methods cited.

Each analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of their ability to generate acceptable precision and accuracy with Methods 608.3 and 625.1 in accordance with procedures given in Section 8.2 of each of these methods. Additionally, each laboratory, on an on-going basis, must spike and analyze 10% of all samples analyzed with Method 608.3 or 5% of all samples analyzed with Method 625.1 to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality in accordance with Sections 8.3 and 8.4 of these methods. When the recovery of any parameter falls outside the warning limits, the analytical results for that parameter in the unspiked sample are suspect. The results should be reported, but cannot be used to demonstrate regulatory compliance. These quality control requirements also apply to the Standard Methods, ASTM Methods, and other methods cited.

Tests must be conducted to provide organism enumeration (density). Select the appropriate configuration of tubes/filtrations and dilutions/volumes to account for the quality, character, consistency, and anticipated organism density of the water sample.
6
When the MF method has not been used previously to test waters with high turbidity, large numbers of noncoliform bacteria, or samples that may contain organisms stressed by chlorine, a parallel test should be conducted with a multiple-tube technique to demonstrate applicability and comparability of results.
7
To assess the comparability of results obtained with individual methods, it is suggested that side-by-side tests be conducted across seasons of the year with the water samples routinely tested in accordance with the most current
Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater
or EPA alternate test procedure (ATP) guidelines.

The multiple-tube fermentation test is used in 9221B.3-2014. Lactose broth may be used in lieu of lauryl tryptose broth (LTB), if at least 25 parallel tests are conducted between this broth and LTB using the water samples normally tested, and this comparison demonstrates that the false-positive rate and false-negative rate for total coliform using lactose broth is less than 10 percent. No requirement exists to run the completed phase on 10 percent of all total coliform-positive tubes on a seasonal basis.
11
These tests are collectively known as defined enzyme substrate tests.
12
After prior enrichment in a presumptive medium for total coliform using 9221B.3-2014, all presumptive tubes or bottles showing any amount of gas, growth or acidity within 48 h ± 3 h of incubation shall be submitted to 9221F-2014. Commercially available EC-MUG media or EC media supplemented in the laboratory with 50 µg/mL of MUG may be used.
13
Samples shall be enumerated by the multiple-tube or multiple-well procedure. Using multiple-tube procedures, employ an appropriate tube and dilution configuration of the sample as needed and report the Most Probable Number (MPN). Samples tested with Colilert® may be enumerated with the multiple-well procedures, Quanti-Tray® or Quanti-Tray®/2000, and the MPN calculated from the table provided by the manufacturer.
14
Colilert-18® is an optimized formulation of the Colilert® for the determination of total coliforms and
E. coli
that provides results within 18 h of incubation at 35 °C, rather than the 24 h required for the Colilert® test and is recommended for marine water samples.

(c) Under certain circumstances, the Director may establish limitations on the discharge of a parameter for which there is no test procedure in this part or in 40 CFR parts 405 through 499. In these instances the test procedure shall be specified by the Director.
(d) Under certain circumstances, the Administrator may approve additional alternate test procedures for nationwide use, upon recommendation by the Alternate Test Procedure Program Coordinator, Washington, DC.
(e) Sample preservation procedures, container materials, and maximum allowable holding times for parameters are cited in Tables IA, IB, IC, ID, IE, IF, IG, and IH are prescribed in Table II. Information in the table takes precedence over information in specific methods or elsewhere. Any person may apply for a change from the prescribed preservation techniques, container materials, and maximum holding times applicable to samples taken from a specific discharge. Applications for such limited use changes may be made by letters to the Regional Alternative Test Procedure (ATP) Program Coordinator or the permitting authority in the Region in which the discharge will occur. Sufficient data should be provided to assure such changes in sample preservation, containers or holding times do not adversely affect the integrity of the sample. The Regional ATP Coordinator or permitting authority will review the application and then notify the applicant and the appropriate State agency of approval or rejection of the use of the alternate test procedure. A decision to approve or deny any request on deviations from the prescribed Table II requirements will be made within 90 days of receipt of the application by the Regional Administrator. An analyst may not modify any sample preservation and/or holding time requirements of an approved method unless the requirements of this section are met.

Except where noted in this Table II and the method for the parameter, preserve each grab sample within 15 minutes of collection. For a composite sample collected with an automated sample (e.g., using a 24-hour composite sample; see 40 CFR 122.21(g)(7)(i) or 40 CFR part 403, appendix E), refrigerate the sample at ≤6 °C during collection unless specified otherwise in this Table II or in the method(s). For a composite sample to be split into separate aliquots for preservation and/or analysis, maintain the sample at ≤6 °C, unless specified otherwise in this Table II or in the method(s), until collection, splitting, and preservation is completed. Add the preservative to the sample container prior to sample collection when the preservative will not compromise the integrity of a grab sample, a composite sample, or aliquot split from a composite sample within 15 minutes of collection. If a composite measurement is required but a composite sample would compromise sample integrity, individual grab samples must be collected at prescribed time intervals (e.g., 4 samples over the course of a day, at 6-hour intervals). Grab samples must be analyzed separately and the concentrations averaged. Alternatively, grab samples may be collected in the field and composited in the laboratory if the compositing procedure produces results equivalent to results produced by arithmetic averaging of results of analysis of individual grab samples. For examples of laboratory compositing procedures, see EPA Method 1664 Rev. A (oil and grease) and the procedures at 40 CFR 141.24(f)(14)(iv) and (v) (volatile organics).

When any sample is to be shipped by common carrier or sent via the U.S. Postal Service, it must comply with the Department of Transportation Hazardous Materials Regulations (49 CFR part 172). The person offering such material for transportation is responsible for ensuring such compliance. For the preservation requirement of Table II, the Office of Hazardous Materials, Materials Transportation Bureau, Department of Transportation has determined that the Hazardous Materials Regulations do not apply to the following materials: Hydrochloric acid (HCl) in water solutions at concentrations of 0.04% by weight or less (pH about 1.96 or greater; Nitric acid (HNO
3
) in water solutions at concentrations of 0.15% by weight or less (pH about 1.62 or greater); Sulfuric acid (H
2
SO
4
) in water solutions at concentrations of 0.35% by weight or less (pH about 1.15 or greater); and Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in water solutions at concentrations of 0.080% by weight or less (pH about 12.30 or less).

Samples should be analyzed as soon as possible after collection. The times listed are the maximum times that samples may be held before the start of analysis and still be considered valid. Samples may be held for longer periods only if the permittee or monitoring laboratory have data on file to show that, for the specific types of samples under study, the analytes are stable for the longer time, and has received a variance from the Regional ATP Coordinator under § 136.3(e). For a grab sample, the holding time begins at the time of collection. For a composite sample collected with an automated sampler (e.g., using a 24-hour composite sampler; see 40 CFR 122.21(g)(7)(i) or 40 CFR part 403, appendix E), the holding time begins at the time of the end of collection of the composite sample. For a set of grab samples composited in the field or laboratory, the holding time begins at the time of collection of the last grab sample in the set. Some samples may not be stable for the maximum time period given in the table. A permittee or monitoring laboratory is obligated to hold the sample for a shorter time if it knows that a shorter time is necessary to maintain sample stability. See § 136.3(e) for details. The date and time of collection of an individual grab sample is the date and time at which the sample is collected. For a set of grab samples to be composited, and that are all collected on the same calendar date, the date of collection is the date on which the samples are collected. For a set of grab samples to be composited, and that are collected across two calendar dates, the date of collection is the dates of the two days; e.g., November 14-15. For a composite sample collected automatically on a given date, the date of collection is the date on which the sample is collected. For a composite sample collected automatically, and that is collected across two calendar dates, the date of collection is the dates of the two days; e.g., November 14-15. For static-renewal toxicity tests, each grab or composite sample may also be used to prepare test solutions for renewal at 24 h, 48 h, and/or 72 h after first use, if stored at 0-6 °C, with minimum head space.
5
ASTM D7365-09a (15) specifies treatment options for samples containing oxidants (e.g., chlorine) for cyanide analyses. Also, Section 9060A of
Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater
(23rd edition) addresses dechlorination procedures for microbiological analyses.
6
Sampling, preservation and mitigating interferences in water samples for analysis of cyanide are described in ASTM D7365-09a (15). There may be interferences that are not mitigated by the analytical test methods or D7365-09a (15). Any technique for removal or suppression of interference may be employed, provided the laboratory demonstrates that it more accurately measures cyanide through quality control measures described in the analytical test method. Any removal or suppression technique not described in D7365-09a (15) or the analytical test method must be documented along with supporting data.
7
For dissolved metals, filter grab samples within 15 minutes of collection and before adding preservatives. For a composite sample collected with an automated sampler (e.g., using a 24-hour composite sampler; see 40 CFR 122.21(g)(7)(i) or 40 CFR part 403, appendix E), filter the sample within 15 minutes after completion of collection and before adding preservatives. If it is known or suspected that dissolved sample integrity will be compromised during collection of a composite sample collected automatically over time (e.g., by interchange of a metal between dissolved and suspended forms), collect and filter grab samples to be composited (footnote 2) in place of a composite sample collected automatically.
8
Guidance applies to samples to be analyzed by GC, LC, or GC/MS for specific compounds.
9
If the sample is not adjusted to pH 2, then the sample must be analyzed within seven days of sampling.
10
The pH adjustment is not required if acrolein will not be measured. Samples for acrolein receiving no pH adjustment must be analyzed within 3 days of sampling.
11
When the extractable analytes of concern fall within a single chemical category, the specified preservative and maximum holding times should be observed for optimum safeguard of sample integrity (
i.e.,
use all necessary preservatives and hold for the shortest time listed). When the analytes of concern fall within two or more chemical categories, the sample may be preserved by cooling to ≤6 °C, reducing residual chlorine with 0.008% sodium thiosulfate, storing in the dark, and adjusting the pH to 6-9; samples preserved in this manner may be held for seven days before extraction and for forty days after extraction. Exceptions to this optional preservation and holding time procedure are noted in footnote 5 (regarding the requirement for thiosulfate reduction), and footnotes 12, 13 (regarding the analysis of benzidine).
12
If 1,2-diphenylhydrazine is likely to be present, adjust the pH of the sample to 4.0 ± 0.2 to prevent rearrangement to benzidine.
13
Extracts may be stored up to 30 days at
0 °C.
14
For the analysis of diphenylnitrosamine, add 0.008% Na
2
S

O
3
and adjust pH to 7-10 with NaOH within 24 hours of sampling.
15
The pH adjustment may be performed upon receipt at the laboratory and may be omitted if the samples are extracted within 72 hours of collection. For the analysis of aldrin, add 0.008% Na
2
S

O

.
16
Place sufficient ice with the samples in the shipping container to ensure that ice is still present when the samples arrive at the laboratory. However, even if ice is present when the samples arrive, immediately measure the temperature of the samples and confirm that the preservation temperature maximum has not been exceeded. In the isolated cases where it can be documented that this holding temperature cannot be met, the permittee can be given the option of on-site testing or can request a variance. The request for a variance should include supportive data which show that the toxicity of the effluent samples is not reduced because of the increased holding temperature. Aqueous samples must not be frozen. Hand-delivered samples used on the day of collection do not need to be cooled to 0 to 6 °C prior to test initiation.
17
Samples collected for the determination of trace level mercury (
100 ng/L) using EPA Method 1631 must be collected in tightly-capped fluoropolymer or glass bottles and preserved with BrCl or HCl solution within 48 hours of sample collection. The time to preservation may be extended to 28 days if a sample is oxidized in the sample bottle. A sample collected for dissolved trace level mercury should be filtered in the laboratory within 24 hours of the time of collection. However, if circumstances preclude overnight shipment, the sample should be filtered in a designated clean area in the field in accordance with procedures given in Method 1669. If sample integrity will not be maintained by shipment to and filtration in the laboratory, the sample must be filtered in a designated clean area in the field within the time period necessary to maintain sample integrity. A sample that has been collected for determination of total or dissolved trace level mercury must be analyzed within 90 days of sample collection.
18
Aqueous samples must be preserved at ≤6 °C, and should not be frozen unless data demonstrating that sample freezing does not adversely impact sample integrity is maintained on file and accepted as valid by the regulatory authority. Also, for purposes of NPDES monitoring, the specification of “≤ °C” is used in place of the “4 °C” and “
4 °C” sample temperature requirements listed in some methods. It is not necessary to measure the sample temperature to three significant figures (1/100th of 1 degree); rather, three significant figures are specified so that rounding down to 6 °C may not be used to meet the ≤6 °C requirement. The preservation temperature does not apply to samples that are analyzed immediately (less than 15 minutes).
19
An aqueous sample may be collected and shipped without acid preservation. However, acid must be added at least 24 hours before analysis to dissolve any metals that adsorb to the container walls. If the sample must be analyzed within 24 hours of collection, add the acid immediately (see footnote 2). Soil and sediment samples do not need to be preserved with acid. The allowances in this footnote supersede the preservation and holding time requirements in the approved metals methods.
20
To achieve the 28-day holding time, use the ammonium sulfate buffer solution specified in EPA Method 218.6. The allowance in this footnote supersedes preservation and holding time requirements in the approved hexavalent chromium methods, unless this supersession would compromise the measurement, in which case requirements in the method must be followed.
21
Holding time is calculated from time of sample collection to elution for samples shipped to the laboratory in bulk and calculated from the time of sample filtration to elution for samples filtered in the field.
22
Sample analysis should begin as soon as possible after receipt; sample incubation must be started no later than 8 hours from time of collection.
23
For fecal coliform samples for sewage sludge (biosolids) only, the holding time is extended to 24 hours for the following sample types using either EPA Method 1680 (LTB-EC) or 1681 (A-1): Class A composted, Class B aerobically digested, and Class B anaerobically digested.
24
The immediate filtration requirement in orthophosphate measurement is to assess the dissolved or bio-available form of orthophosphorus (
i.e.,
that which passes through a 0.45-micron filter), hence the requirement to filter the sample immediately upon collection (
i.e.,
within 15 minutes of collection).

§ 136.6
Method modifications and analytical requirements.
(a)
Definitions of terms used in this section
—(1)
Analyst
means the person or laboratory using a test procedure (analytical method) in this part.
(2)
Chemistry of the method
means the reagents and reactions used in a test procedure that allow determination of the analyte(s) of interest in an environmental sample.
(3)
Determinative technique
means the way in which an analyte is identified and quantified (e.g., colorimetry, mass spectrometry).
(4)
Equivalent performance
means that the modified method produces results that meet or exceed the QC acceptance criteria of the approved method.
(5)
Method-defined analyte
means an analyte defined solely by the method used to determine the analyte. Such an analyte may be a physical parameter, a parameter that is not a specific chemical, or a parameter that may be comprised of a number of substances. Examples of such analytes include temperature, oil and grease, total suspended solids, total phenolics, turbidity, chemical oxygen demand, and biochemical oxygen demand.
(6)
QC
means “quality control.”
(b)
Method modifications.
(1) If the underlying chemistry and determinative technique in a modified method are essentially the same as an approved Part 136 method, then the modified method is an equivalent and acceptable alternative to the approved method provided the requirements of this section are met. However, those who develop or use a modification to an approved (Part 136) method must document that the performance of the modified method, in the matrix to which the modified method will be applied, is equivalent to the performance of the approved method. If such a demonstration cannot be made and documented, then the modified method is not an acceptable alternative to the approved method. Supporting documentation must, if applicable, include the routine initial demonstration of capability and ongoing QC including determination of precision and accuracy, detection limits, and matrix spike recoveries. Initial demonstration of capability typically includes analysis of four replicates of a mid-level standard and a method detection limit study. Ongoing quality control typically includes method blanks, mid-level laboratory control samples, and matrix spikes (QC is as specified in the method). The method is considered equivalent if the quality control requirements in the reference method are achieved. Where the laboratory is using a vendor-supplied method, it is the QC criteria in the reference method, not the vendor's method, that must be met to show equivalency. Where a sample preparation step is required (
i.e.,
digestion, distillation), QC tests are to be run using standards treated in the same way as the samples. The method user's Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) must clearly document the modifications made to the reference method. Examples of allowed method modifications are listed in this section. If the method user is uncertain whether a method modification is allowed, the Regional ATP Coordinator or Director should be contacted for approval
prior
to implementing the modification. The method user should also complete necessary performance checks to verify that acceptable performance is achieved with the method modification
prior
to analyses of compliance samples.
(2)
Requirements.
The modified method must meet or exceed performance of the approved method(s) for the analyte(s) of interest, as documented by meeting the initial and ongoing quality control requirements in the method.
(i)
Requirements for establishing equivalent performance.
If the approved method contains QC tests and QC acceptance criteria, the modified method must use these QC tests and the modified method must meet the QC acceptance criteria with the following conditions:
(A) The analyst may only rely on QC tests and QC acceptance criteria in a
method if it includes wastewater matrix QC tests and QC acceptance criteria (e.g., matrix spikes) and both initial (start-up) and ongoing QC tests and QC acceptance criteria.
(B) If the approved method does not contain QC tests and QC acceptance criteria or if the QC tests and QC acceptance criteria in the method do not meet the requirements of this section, then the analyst must employ QC tests published in the “equivalent” of a Part 136 method that has such QC, or the essential QC requirements specified at 136.7, as applicable. If the approved method is from a compendium or VCSB and the QA/QC requirements are published in other parts of that organization's compendium rather than within the Part 136 method then that part of the organization's compendium must be used for the QC tests.
(C) In addition, the analyst must perform ongoing QC tests, including assessment of performance of the modified method on the sample matrix (e.g., analysis of a matrix spike/matrix spike duplicate pair for every twenty samples), and analysis of an ongoing precision and recovery sample (e.g., laboratory fortified blank or blank spike) and a blank with each batch of 20 or fewer samples.
(D) If the performance of the modified method in the wastewater matrix or reagent water does not meet or exceed the QC acceptance criteria, the method modification may not be used.
(ii)
Requirements for documentation.
The modified method must be documented in a method write-up or an addendum that describes the modification(s) to the approved method prior to the use of the method for compliance purposes. The write-up or addendum must include a reference number (e.g., method number), revision number, and revision date so that it may be referenced accurately. In addition, the organization that uses the modified method must document the results of QC tests and keep these records, along with a copy of the method write-up or addendum, for review by an auditor.
(3)
Restrictions.
An analyst may not modify an approved Clean Water Act analytical method for a method-defined analyte. In addition, an analyst may not modify an approved method if the modification would result in measurement of a different form or species of an analyte. Changes in method procedures are not allowed if such changes would alter the defined chemistry (
i.e.,
method principle) of the unmodified method. For example, phenol method 420.1 or 420.4 defines phenolics as ferric iron oxidized compounds that react with 4-aminoantipyrine (4-AAP) at pH 10 after being distilled from acid solution. Because total phenolics represents a group of compounds that all react at different efficiencies with 4-AAP, changing test conditions likely would change the behavior of these different phenolic compounds. An analyst may not modify any sample collection, preservation, or holding time requirements of an approved method. Such modifications to sample collection, preservation, and holding time requirements do not fall within the scope of the flexibility allowed at § 136.6. Method flexibility refers to modifications of the analytical procedures used for identification and measurement of the analyte only and does not apply to sample collection, preservation, or holding time procedures, which may only be modified as specified in § 136.3(e).
(4)
Allowable changes.
Except as noted under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, an analyst may modify an approved test procedure (analytical method) provided that the underlying reactions and principles used in the approved method remain essentially the same, and provided that the requirements of this section are met. If equal or better performance can be obtained with an alternative reagent, then it is allowed. A laboratory wishing to use these modifications must demonstrate acceptable method performance by performing and documenting all applicable initial demonstration of capability and ongoing QC tests and meeting all applicable QC acceptance criteria as described in § 136.7. Some examples of the allowed types of changes, provided the requirements of this section are met include:
(i) Changes between manual method, flow analyzer, and discrete instrumentation.
(ii) Changes in chromatographic columns or temperature programs.
(iii) Changes between automated and manual sample preparation, such as digestions, distillations, and extractions; in-line sample preparation is an acceptable form of automated sample preparation for CWA methods.
(iv) In general, ICP-MS is a sensitive and selective detector for metal analysis; however isobaric interference can cause problems for quantitative determination, as well as identification based on the isotope pattern. Interference reduction technologies, such as collision cells or reaction cells, are designed to reduce the effect of spectroscopic interferences that may bias results for the element of interest. The use of interference reduction technologies is allowed, provided the method performance specifications relevant to ICP-MS measurements are met.
(v) The use of EPA Method 200.2 or the sample preparation steps from EPA Method 1638, including the use of closed-vessel digestion, is allowed for EPA Method 200.8, provided the method performance specifications relevant to the ICP-MS are met.
(vi) Changes in pH adjustment reagents. Changes in compounds used to adjust pH are acceptable as long as they do not produce interference. For example, using a different acid to adjust pH in colorimetric methods.
(vii) Changes in buffer reagents are acceptable provided that the changes do not produce interferences.
(viii) Changes in the order of reagent addition are acceptable provided that the change does not alter the chemistry and does not produce an interference. For example, using the same reagents, but adding them in different order, or preparing them in combined or separate solutions (so they can be added separately), is allowed, provided reagent stability or method performance is equivalent or improved.
(ix) Changes in calibration range (provided that the modified range covers any relevant regulatory limit and the method performance specifications for calibration are met).
(x) Changes in calibration model. (A) Linear calibration models do not adequately fit calibration data with one or two inflection points. For example, vendor-supplied data acquisition and processing software on some instruments may provide quadratic fitting functions to handle such situations. If the calibration data for a particular analytical method routinely display quadratic character, using quadratic fitting functions may be acceptable. In such cases, the minimum number of calibrators for second order fits should be six, and in no case should concentrations be extrapolated for instrument responses that exceed that of the most concentrated calibrator. Examples of methods with nonlinear calibration functions include chloride by SM4500-Cl-E-1997, hardness by EPA Method 130.1, cyanide by ASTM D6888 or OIA1677, Kjeldahl nitrogen by PAI-DK03, and anions by EPA Method 300.0.
(B) As an alternative to using the average response factor, the quality of the calibration may be evaluated using the Relative Standard Error (RSE). The acceptance criterion for the RSE is the same as the acceptance criterion for Relative Standard Deviation (RSD), in the method. RSE is calculated as:
ER18MY12.000
Where:
x′
i
= Calculated concentration at level i
x
i
= Actual concentration of the calibration level i
n = Number of calibration points
p = Number of terms in the fitting equation (average = 1, linear = 2, quadratic = 3)
(C) Using the RSE as a metric has the added advantage of allowing the same numerical standard to be applied to the calibration model, regardless of the form of the model. Thus, if a method states that the RSD should be ≤20% for the traditional linear model through the origin, then the RSE acceptance limit can remain ≤20% as well. Similarly, if a method provides an RSD acceptance limit of ≤15%, then that same figure can be used as the acceptance limit for the RSE. The RSE may be used as an alternative to correlation coefficients and coefficients of determination for evaluating calibration curves for any of the methods at part 136. If the method includes a numerical criterion for the RSD, then the same numerical value is used for the RSE. Some older methods do not include any criterion for the calibration curve—for these methods, if RSE is used the value should be ≤20%. Note that the use of the RSE is included as an alternative to the use of the correlation coefficient as a measure of the suitability of a calibration curve. It is not necessary to evaluate both the RSE and the correlation coefficient.
(xi) Changes in equipment such as equipment from a vendor different from the one specified in the method.
(xii) The use of micro or midi distillation apparatus in place of macro distillation apparatus.
(xiii) The use of prepackaged reagents.
(xiv) The use of digital titrators and methods where the underlying chemistry used for the determination is similar to that used in the approved method.
(xv) Use of selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode for analytes that cannot be effectively analyzed in full-scan mode and reach the required sensitivity. False positives are more of a concern when using SIM analysis, so at a minimum, one quantitation and two qualifying ions must be monitored for each analyte (unless fewer than three ions with intensity greater than 15% of the base peak are available). The ratio of each of the two qualifying ions to the quantitation ion must be evaluated and should agree with the ratio observed in an authentic standard within ±20 percent. Analyst judgment must be applied to the evaluation of ion ratios because the ratios can be affected by co-eluting compounds present in the sample matrix. The signal-to-noise ratio of the least sensitive ion should be at least 3:1. Retention time in the sample should match within 0.05 minute of an authentic standard analyzed under identical conditions. Matrix interferences can cause minor shifts in retention time and may be evident as shifts in the retention times of the internal standards. The total scan time should be such that a minimum of eight scans are obtained per chromatographic peak.
(xvi) Changes are allowed in purge-and-trap sample volumes or operating conditions. Some examples are:
(A) Changes in purge time and purge-gas flow rate. A change in purge time and purge-gas flow rate is allowed provided that sufficient total purge volume is used to achieve the required minimum detectible concentration and calibration range for all compounds. In general, a purge rate in the range 20-200 mL/min and a total purge volume in the range 240-880 mL are recommended.
(B) Use of nitrogen or helium as a purge gas, provided that the required sensitivities for all compounds are met.
(C) Sample temperature during the purge state. Gentle heating of the sample during purging (e.g., 40 °C) increases purging efficiency of hydrophilic compounds and may improve sample-to-sample repeatability because all samples are purged under precisely the same conditions.
(D) Trap sorbent. Any trap design is acceptable, provided that the data acquired meet all QC criteria.
(E) Changes to the desorb time. Shortening the desorb time (e.g., from4 minutes to 1 minute) may not affect compound recoveries, and can shorten overall cycle time and significantly reduce the amount of water introduced to the analytical system, thus improving the precision of analysis, especially for water-soluble analytes. A desorb time of four minutes is recommended, however a shorter desorb time may be used, provided that all QC specifications in the method are met.
(F) Use of water management techniques is allowed. Water is always collected on the trap along with the analytes and is a significant interference for analytical systems (GC and GC/MS). Modern water management techniques (e.g., dry purge or condensation points) can remove moisture from the sample stream and improve analytical performance.
(xvii) If the characteristics of a wastewater matrix prevent efficient recovery of organic pollutants and prevent the method from meeting QC requirements, the analyst may attempt to resolve the issue by adding salts to the sample, provided that such salts do not react with or introduce the target pollutant into the sample (as evidenced by the analysis of method blanks, laboratory control samples, and spiked samples that also contain such salts), and that all requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section are met. Samples having residual chlorine or other halogen must be dechlorinated prior to the addition of such salts.
(xviii) If the characteristics of a wastewater matrix result in poor sample dispersion or reagent deposition on equipment and prevent the analyst from meeting QC requirements, the analyst may attempt to resolve the issue by adding a inert surfactant that does not affect the chemistry of the method, such as Brij-35 or sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), provided that such surfactant does not react with or introduce the target pollutant into the sample (as evidenced by the analysis of method blanks, laboratory control samples, and spiked samples that also contain such surfactant) and that all requirements of paragraph (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section are met. Samples having residual chlorine or other halogen must be dechlorinated prior to the addition of such surfactant.
(xix) The use of gas diffusion (using pH change to convert the analyte to gaseous form and/or heat to separate an analyte contained in steam from the sample matrix) across a hydrophobic semi-permeable membrane to separate the analyte of interest from the sample matrix may be used in place of manual or automated distillation in methods for analysis such as ammonia, total cyanide, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and total phenols. These procedures do not replace the digestion procedures specified in the approved methods and must be used in conjunction with those procedures.
(xx) Changes in equipment operating parameters such as the monitoring wavelength of a colorimeter or the reaction time and temperature as needed to achieve the chemical reactions defined in the unmodified CWA method. For example, molybdenum blue phosphate methods have two absorbance maxima, one at about 660 nm and another at about 880 nm. The former is about 2.5 times less sensitive than the latter. Wavelength choice provides a cost-effective, dilution-free means to increase sensitivity of molybdenum blue phosphate methods.
(xxi) Interchange of oxidants, such as the use of titanium oxide in UV-assisted automated digestion of TOC and total phosphorus, as long as complete oxidation can be demonstrated.
(xxii) Use of an axially viewed torch with Method 200.7.
(xxiii) When analyzing metals by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, and stabilized temperature graphite furnace atomic absorption, closed-vessel microwave digestion of wastewater samples is allowed as alternative heating source for Method 200.2—“Sample Preparation Procedure for Spectrochemical Determination of Total Recoverable Elements” for the following elements: Aluminum, antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, boron, cadmium, calcium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, potassium, selenium, silver, sodium, thallium, tin, titanium, vanadium, zinc, provided the performance specifications in the relevant determinative method are met. (Note that this list does not include Mercury.) Each laboratory determining total recoverable metals is required to operate a formal quality control (QC) program. The minimum requirements include initial demonstration of capability, method detection limit (MDL), analysis of reagent blanks, fortified blanks, matrix spike samples, and blind proficiency testing samples, as continuing quality control checks on performance.
The laboratory is required to maintain performance records on file that define the quality of the data generated.
(c) The permittee must notify their permitting authority of the intent to use a modified method. Such notification should be of the form “Method xxx has been modified within the flexibility allowed in 40 CFR 136.6.” The permittee may indicate the specific paragraph of § 136.6 allowing the method modification. Specific details of the modification need not be provided, but must be documented in the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and maintained by the analytical laboratory that performs the analysis.
[77 FR 29810, May 18, 2012, as amended at 82 FR 40875, Aug. 28, 2017; 86 FR 27260, May 19, 2021]
§ 136.7
Quality assurance and quality control.
The permittee/laboratory shall use suitable QA/QC procedures when conducting compliance analyses with any part 136 chemical method or an alternative method specified by the permitting authority. These QA/QC procedures are generally included in the analytical method or may be part of the methods compendium for approved Part 136 methods from a consensus organization. For example, Standard Methods contains QA/QC procedures in the Part 1000 section of the Standard Methods Compendium. The permittee/laboratory shall follow these QA/QC procedures, as described in the method or methods compendium. If the method lacks QA/QC procedures, the permittee/laboratory has the following options to comply with the QA/QC requirements:

1.2 This is a purge and trap gas chromatographic (GC) method applicable to the determination of the compounds listed above in municipal and industrial discharges as provided under 40 CFR 136.1. When this method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for any or all of the compounds above, compound identifications should be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. This method describes analytical conditions for a second gas chromatographic column that can be used to confirm measurements made with the primary column. Method 624 provides gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative and quantitative confirmation of results for most of the parameters listed above.
1.3 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 12.1)
1
for each parameter is listed in Table 1. The MDL for a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.
1.4 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.
1.5 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the operation of a purge and trap system and a gas chromatograph and in the interpretation of gas chromatograms. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.

# 2. Summary of Method
2.1 An inert gas is bubbled through a 5-mL water sample contained in a specially-designed purging chamber at ambient temperature. The halocarbons are efficiently transferred from the aqueous phase to the vapor phase. The vapor is swept through a sorbent trap where the halocarbons are trapped. After purging is completed, the trap is heated and backflushed with the inert gas to desorb the halocarbons onto a gas chromatographic column. The gas chromatograph is temperature programmed to separate the halocarbons which are then detected with a halide-specific detector.
2 3
2.2 The method provides an optional gas chromatographic column that may be helpful in resolving the compounds of interest from interferences that may occur.

# 3. Interferences
3.1 Impurities in the purge gas and organic compounds outgassing from the plumbing ahead of the trap account for the majority of contamination problems. The analytical system must be demonstrated to be free from contamination under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3. The use of non-Teflon plastic tubing, non-Teflon thread sealants, or flow controllers with rubber components in the purge and trap system should be avoided.
3.2 Samples can be contaminated by diffusion of volatile organics (particularly fluorocarbons and methylene chloride) through the septum seal ilto the sample during shipment and storage. A field reagent blank prepared from reagent water and carried through the sampling and handling protocol can serve as a check on such contamination.
3.3 Contamination by carry-over can occur whenever high level and low level samples are sequentially analyzed. To reduce carry-over, the purging device and sample syringe must be rinsed with reagent water between sample analyses. Whenever an unusually concentrated sample is encountered, it should be followed by an analysis of reagent water to check for cross contamination. For samples containing large amounts of water-soluble materials, suspended solids, high boiling compounds or high organohalide levels, it may be necessary to wash out the purging device with a detergent solution, rinse it with distilled water, and then dry it in a 105 °C oven between analyses. The trap and other parts of the system are also subject to contamination; therefore, frequent bakeout and purging of the entire system may be required.

# 4. Safety
4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not
been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified
4 6
for the information of the analyst.
4.2 The following parameters covered by this method have been tentatively classified as known or suspected, human or mammalian carcinogens: carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, and vinyl chloride. Primary standards of these toxic compounds should be prepared in a hood. A NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be worn when the analyst handles high concentrations of these toxic compounds.

# 5. Apparatus and Materials
5.1 Sampling equipment, for discrete sampling.
5.1.1 Vial—25-mL capacity or larger, equipped with a screw cap with a hole in the center (Pierce #13075 or equivalent). Detergent wash, rinse with tap and distilled water, and dry at 105 °C before use.
5.1.2 Septum—Teflon-faced silicone (Pierce #12722 or equivalent). Detergent wash, rinse with tap and distilled water, and dry at 105 °C for 1 h before use.
5.2 Purge and trap system—The purge and trap system consists of three separate pieces of equipment: a purging device, trap, and desorber. Several complete systems are now commercially available.
5.2.1 The purging device must be designed to accept 5-mL samples with a water column at least 3 cm deep. The gaseous head space between the water column and the trap must have a total volume of less than 15 mL. The purge gas must pass through the water column as finely divided bubbles with a diameter of less than 3 mm at the origin. The purge gas must be introduced no more than 5 mm from the base of the water column. The purging device illustrated in Figure 1 meets these design criteria.
5.2.2 The trap must be at least 25 cm long and have an inside diameter of at least 0.105 in. The trap must be packed to contain the following minimum lengths of adsorbents: 1.0 cm of methyl silicone coated packing (Section 6.3.3), 7.7 cm of 2,6-diphenylene oxide polymer (Section 6.3.2), 7.7 cm of silica gel (Section 6.3.4), 7.7 cm of coconut charcoal (Section 6.3.1). If it is not necessary to analyze for dichlorodifluoromethane, the charcoal can be eliminated, and the polymer section lengthened to 15 cm. The minimum specifications for the trap are illustrated in Figure 2.
5.2.3 The desorber must be capable of rapidly heating the trap to 180 °C. The polymer section of the trap should not be heated higher than 180 °C and the remaining sections should not exceed 200 °C. The desorber illustrated in Figure 2 meets these design criteria.
5.2.4 The purge and trap system may be assembled as a separate unit or be coupled to a gas chromatograph as illustrated in Figures 3 and 4.
5.3 Gas chromatograph—An analytical system complete with a temperature programmable gas chromatograph suitable for on-column injection and all required accessories including syringes, analytical columns, gases, detector, and strip-chart recorder. A data system is recommended for measuring peak areas.
5.3.1 Column 1—8 ft long × 0.1 in. ID stainless steel or glass, packed with 1% SP-1000 on Carbopack B (60/80 mesh) or equivalent. This column was used to develop the method performance statements in Section 12. Guidelines for the use of alternate column packings are provided in Section 10.1.
5.3.2 Column 2—6 ft long × 0.1 in. ID stainless steel or glass, packed with chemically bonded n-octane on Porasil-C (100/120 mesh) or equivalent.
5.3.3 Detector—Electrolytic conductivity or microcoulometric detector. These types of detectors have proven effective in the analysis of wastewaters for the parameters listed in the scope (Section 1.1). The electrolytic conductivity detector was used to develop the method performance statements in Section 12. Guidelines for the use of alternate detectors are provided in Section 10.1.
5.4 Syringes—5-mL glass hypodermic with Luerlok tip (two each), if applicable to the purging device.
5.5 Micro syringes—25-µL, 0.006 in. ID needle.
5.6 Syringe valve—2-way, with Luer ends (three each).
5.7 Syringe—5-mL, gas-tight with shut-off valve.
5.8 Bottle—15-mL, screw-cap, with Teflon cap liner.
5.9 Balance—Analytical, capable of accurately weighing 0.0001 g.

# 6. Reagents
6.1 Reagent water—Reagent water is defined as a water in which an interferent is not observed at the MDL of the parameters of interest.
6.1.1 Reagent water can be generated by passing tap water through a carbon filter bed containing about 1 lb of activated carbon (Filtrasorb-300, Calgon Corp., or equivalent).
6.1.2 A water purification system (Millipore Super-Q or equivalent) may be used to generate reagent water.
6.1.3 Reagent water may also be prepared by boiling water for 15 min. Subsequently, while maintaining the temperature at 90 °C, bubble a contaminant-free inert gas through the water for 1 h. While still hot, transfer the water to a narrow mouth screw-cap bottle and seal with a Teflon-lined septum and cap.
6.2 Sodium thiosulfate—(ACS) Granular.
6.3 Trap Materials:
6.3.1 Coconut charcoal—6/10 mesh sieved to 26 mesh, Barnabey Cheney, CA-580-26 lot # M-2649 or equivalent.
6.3.2 2,6-Diphenylene oxide polymer—Tenax, (60/80 mesh), chromatographic grade or equivalent.
6.3.3 Methyl silicone packing—3% OV-1 on Chromosorb-W (60/80 mesh) or equivalent.
6.3.4 Silica gel—35/60 mesh, Davison, grade-15 or equivalent.
6.4 Methanol—Pesticide quality or equivalent.
6.5 Stock standard solutions—Stock standard solutions may be prepared from pure standard materials or purchased as certified solutions. Prepare stock standard solutions in methanol using assayed liquids or gases as appropriate. Because of the toxicity of some of the organohalides, primary dilutions of these materials should be prepared in a hood. A NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be used when the analyst handles high concentrations of such materials.
6.5.1 Place about 9.8 mL of methanol into a 10-mL ground glass stoppered volumetric flask. Allow the flask to stand, unstoppered, for about 10 min or until all alcohol wetted surfaces have dried. Weigh the flask to the learest 0.1 mg.
6.5.2 Add the assayed reference material:
6.5.2.1 Liquid—Using a 100 µL syringe, immediately add two or more drops of assayed reference material to the flask, then reweigh. Be sure that the drops fall directly into the alcohol without contacting the neck of the flask.
6.5.2.2 Gases—To prepare standards for any of the six halocarbons that boil below 30 °C (bromomethane, chloroethane, chloromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, vinyl chloride), fill a 5-mL valved gas-tight syringe with the reference standard to the 5.0-mL mark. Lower the needle to 5 mm above the methanol meniscus. Slowly introduce the reference standard above the surface of the liquid (the heavy gas will rapidly dissolve into the methanol).
6.5.3 Reweigh, dilute to volume, stopper, then mix by inverting the flask several times. Calculate the concentration in µg/µL from the net gain in weight. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight can be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock standard. Commercially prepared stock standards can be used at any concentration if they are certified by the malufacturer or by an independent source.
6.5.4 Transfer the stock standard solution into a Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottle. Store, with minimal headspace, at −10 to −20 °C and protect from light.
6.5.5 Prepare fresh standards weekly for the six gases and 2-chloroethylvinyl ether. All other standards must be replaced after one month, or sooner if comparison with check standards indicates a problem.
6.6 Secondary dilution standards—Using stock standard solutions, prepare secondary dilution standards in methanol that contain the compounds of interest, either singly or mixed together. The secondary dilution standards should be prepared at concentrations such that the aqueous calibration standards prepared in Section 7.3.1 or 7.4.1 will bracket the working range of the analytical system. Secondary dilution standards should be stored with minimal headspace and should be checked frequently for signs of degradation or evaporation, especially just prior to preparing calibration standards from them.
6.7 Quality control check sample concentrate—See Section 8.2.1.

# 7. Calibration
7.1 Assemble a purge and trap system that meets the specifications in Section 5.2. Condition the trap overnight at 180 °C by backflushing with an inert gas flow of at least 20 mL/min. Condition the trap for 10 min once daily prior to use.
7.2 Connect the purge and trap system to a gas chromatograph. The gas chromatograph must be operated using temperature and flow rate conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1. Calibrate the purge and trap-gas chromatographic system using either the external standard technique (Section 7.3) or the internal standard technique (Section 7.4).
7.3 External standard calibration procedure:
7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a miminum of three concentration levels for each parameter by carefully adding 20.0 µL of one or more secondary dilution standards to 100, 500, or 1000 µL of reagent water. A 25-µL syringe with a 0.006 in. ID needle should be used for this operation. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 1) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector. These aqueous standards can be stored up to 24 h, if held in sealed vials with zero headspace as described in Section 9.2. If not so stored, they must be discarded after 1 h.
7.3.2 Analyze each calibration standard according to Section 10, and tabulate peak height or area responses versus the concentration in the standard. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to concentration (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (
10% relative standard deviation, RSD), linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.
7.4 Internal standard calibration procedure—To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can be suggested that is applicable to all samples. The compounds recommended for use as surrogate spikes in Section 8.7 have been used successfully as internal standards, because of their generally unique retention times.
7.4.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest as described in Section 7.3.1.
7.4.2 Prepare a spiking solution containing each of the internal standards using the procedures described in Sections 6.5 and 6.6. It is recommended that the secondary dilution standard be prepared at a concentration of 15 µg/mL of each internal standard compound. The addition of 10 µL of this standard to 5.0 mL of sample or calibration standard would be equivalent to 30 µg/L.
7.4.3 Analyze each calibration standard according to Section 10, adding 10 µL of internal standard spiking solution directly to the syringe (Section 10.4). Tabulate peak height or area responses against concentration for each compound and internal standard, and calculate response factors (RF) for each compound using Equation 1.
EC15NO91.094

where:
A
s
= Response for the parameter to be measured.

If the RF value over the working range is a constant (
10% RSD), the RF can be assumed to be invariant and the average RF can be used for calculations. Alternatively, the results can be used to plot a calibration curve of response ratios, A

, vs. RF.
7.5 The working calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be verified on each working day by the measurement of a QC check sample.
7.5.1 Prepare the QC check sample as described in Section 8.2.2.
7.5.2 Analyze the QC check sample according to Section 10.
7.5.3 For each parameter, compare the response (Q) with the corresponding calibration acceptance criteria found in Table 2. If the responses for all parameters of interest fall within the designated ranges, analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual Q falls outside the range, proceed according to Section 7.5.4.

# Note:
The large number of parameters in Table 2 present a substantial probability that one or more will not meet the calibration acceptance criteria when all parameters are analyzed.
7.5.4 Repeat the test only for those parameters that failed to meet the calibration acceptance criteria. If the response for a parameter does not fall within the range in this second test, a new calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be prepared for that parameter according to Section 7.3 or 7.4.

# 8. Quality Control
8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.
8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.
8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Section 10.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.
8.1.3 Each day, the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that
interferences from the analytical system are under control.
8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.
8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.
8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.
8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.
8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each parameter of interest at a concentration of 10 µg/mL in methanol. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.
8.2.2 Prepare a QC check sample to contain 20 µg/L of each parameter by adding 200 µL of QC check sample concentrate to 100 mL of reagent water.
8.2.3 Analyze four 5-mL aliquots of the well-mixed QC check sample according to Section 10.
8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X
) in µg/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in µg/L, for each parameter of interest using the four results.
8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X
with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively, found in Table 2. If s and X
for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X
falls outside the range for accuracy, then the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter.

# Note:
The large number of parameters in Table 2 present a substantial probability that one or more will fail at least one of the acceptance criteria when all parameters are analyzed.
8.2.6 When one or more of the parameters tested fail at least one of the acceptance criteria, the analyst must proceed according to Section 8.2.6.1 or 8.2.6.2.
8.2.6.1 Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with Section 8.2.3.
8.2.6.2 Beginning with Section 8.2.3, repeat the test only for those parameters that failed to meet criteria. Repeated failure, however, will confirm a general problem with the measurement system. If this occurs, locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all compounds of interest beginning with Section 8.2.3.
8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.
8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:
8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at 20 µg/L or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.2 Analyze one 5-mL sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second 5-mL sample aliquot with 10 µL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100(A−B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.
8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1.
7
If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than 20 µg/L, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 2, or optional QC acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of
a parameter: (1) Calculate accuracy (X′) using the equation in Table 3, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S′) using the equation in Table 3, substituting X′ for X
; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X′/T)±2.44(100 S′/T)%.
7
8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.
8.4 If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.

# Note:
The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory. If the entire list of parameters in Table 2 must be measured in the sample in Section 8.3, the probability that the analysis of a QC check standard will be required is high. In this case the QC check standard should be routinely analyzed with the spiked sample.
8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 10 µL of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 5 mL of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.
8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P
s
) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.
8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (P
s
) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.
8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P
) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (s
p
). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P
−2s
p
to P
+ 2s
p
. If p
= 90% and s
p
= 10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).
8.6 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as gas chromatography with a dissimilar column, specific element detector, or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.
8.7 The analyst should monitor both the performance of the analytical system and the effectiveness of the method in dealing with each sample matrix by spiking each sample, standard, and reagent water blank with surrogate halocarbons. A combination of bromochloromethane, 2-bromo-1-chloropropane, and 1,4-dichlorobutane is recommended to encompass the range of the temperature program used in this method. From stock standard solutions prepared as in Section 6.5, add a volume to give 750 µg of each surrogate to 45 mL of reagent water contained in a 50-mL volumetric flask, mix and dilute to volume for a concentration of 15 ng/µL. Add 10 µL of this surrogate spiking solution directly into the 5-mL syringe with every sample and reference standard analyzed. Prepare a fresh surrogate spiking solution on a weekly basis. If the internal standard calibration procedure is being used, the surrogate compounds may be added directly to the internal standard spiking solution (Section 7.4.2).

# 9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling
9.1 All samples must be iced or refrigerated from the time of collection until analysis. If the sample contains free or combined chlorine, add sodium thiosulfate preservative (10 mg/40 mL is sufficient for up to 5 ppm Cl
2
) to the empty sample bottle just prior to shipping to the sampling site. EPA Methods 330.4 and 330.5 may be used for measurement of residual chlorine.
8
Field test kits are available for this purpose.
9.2 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers having a total volume of at least 25 mL. Fill the sample bottle just to overflowing in such a manner that no air bubbles pass through the sample as the bottle is being filled. Seal the bottle so that no air bubbles are entrapped in it. If preservative has been added, shake vigorously for 1 min. Maintain the hermetic seal on the sample bottle until time of analysis.
9.3 All samples must be analyzed within 14 days of collection.

# 10. Procedure
10.1 Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are estimated retention times and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. An example of the separations achieved by Column 1 is shown in Figure 5. Other packed columns, chromatographic conditions, or detectors may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.
10.2 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.
10.3 Adjust the purge gas (nitrogen or helium) flow rate to 40 mL/min. Attach the trap inlet to the purging device, and set the purge and trap system to purge (Figure 3). Open the syringe valve located on the purging device sample introduction needle.
10.4 Allow the sample to come to ambient temperature prior to introducing it to the syringe. Remove the plunger from a 5-mL syringe and attach a closed syringe valve. Open the sample bottle (or standard) and carefully pour the sample into the syringe barrel to just short of overflowing. Replace the syringe plunger and compress the sample. Open the syringe valve and vent any residual air while adjusting the sample volume to 5.0 mL. Since this process of taking an aliquot destroys the validity of the sample for future analysis, the analyst should fill a second syringe at this time to protect against possible loss of data. Add 10.0 µL of the surrogate spiking solution (Section 8.7) and 10.0 µL of the internal standard spiking solution (Section 7.4.2), if applicable, through the valve bore, then close the valve.
10.5 Attach the syringe-syringe valve assembly to the syringe valve on the purging device. Open the syringe valves and inject the sample into the purging chamber.
10.6 Close both valves and purge the sample for 11.0 ±0.1 min at ambient temperature.
10.7 After the 11-min purge time, attach the trap to the chromatograph, adjust the purge and trap system to the desorb mode (Figure 4), and begin to temperature program the gas chromatograph. Introduce the trapped materials to the GC column by rapidly heating the trap to 180 °C while backflushing the trap with an inert gas between 20 and 60 mL/min for 4 min. If rapid heating of the trap cannot be achieved, the GC column must be used as a secondary trap by cooling it to 30 °C (subambient temperature, if poor peak geometry or random retention time problems persist) instead of the initial program temperature of 45 °C
10.8 While the trap is being desorbed into the gas chromatograph, empty the purging chamber using the sample introduction syringe. Wash the chamber with two 5-mL flushes of reagent water.
10.9 After desorbing the sample for 4 min, recondition the trap by returning the purge and trap system to the purge mode. Wait 15 s then close the syringe valve on the purging device to begin gas flow through the trap. The trap temperature should be maintained at 180 °C After approximately 7 min, turn off the trap heater and open the syringe valve to stop the gas flow through the trap. When the trap is cool, the next sample can be analyzed.
10.10 Identify the parameters in the sample by comparing the retention times of the peaks in the sample chromatogram with those of the peaks in standard chromatograms. The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound can be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weigh heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.
10.11 If the response for a peak exceeds the working range of the system, prepare a dilution of the sample with reagent water from the aliquot in the second syringe and reanalyze.

# 11. Calculations
11.1 Determine the concentration of individual compounds in the sample.
11.1.1 If the external standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the concentration of the parameter being measured from the peak response using the calibration curve or calibration factor determined in Section 7.3.2.
11.1.2 If the internal standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the concentration in the sample using the response factor (RF) determined in Section 7.4.3 and Equation 2.
Equation 2
EC15NO91.095
where:
A
s
= Response for the parameter to be measured.
A
is
= Response for the internal standard.
C
is
= Concentration of the internal standard.
11.2 Report results in µg/L without correction for recovery data. All QC data obtained should be reported with the sample results.

# 12. Method Performance
12.1 The method detection limit (MDL) is defined as the minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence that the value is above zero.
1
The MDL concentration listed in Table 1 were obtained using reagent water.
11
.
Similar results were achieved using representative wastewaters. The MDL actually achieved in a given analysis will vary depending on instrument sensitivity and matrix effects.
12.2 This method is recommended for use in the concentration range from the MDL to 1000 × MDL. Direct aqueous injection techniques should be used to measure concentration levels above 1000 × MDL.
12.3 This method was tested by 20 laboratories using reagent water, drinking water, surface water, and three industrial wastewaters spiked at six concentrations over the range 8.0 to 500 µg/L.
9
Single operator precision, overall precision, and method accuracy were found to be directly related to the concentration of the parameter and essentially independent of the sample matrix. Linear equations to describe these relationships are presented in Table 3.

1.2 This is a purge and trap gas chromatographic (GC) method applicable to the determination of the compounds listed above in municipal and industrial discharges as provided under 40 CFR 136.1. When this method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for any or all of the compounds above, compound identifications should be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. This method describes analytical conditions for a second gas chromatographic column that can be used to confirm measurements made with the primary column. Method 624 provides gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative and quantitative confirmation of results for all of the parameters listed above.
1.3 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 12.1)
1
for each parameter is listed in Table 1. The MDL for a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.
1.4 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.
1.5 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the operation of a purge and trap system and a gas chromatograph and in the interpretation of gas chromatograms. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.

# 2. Summary of Method
2.1 An inert gas is bubbled through a 5-mL water sample contained in a specially-designed purging chamber at ambient temperature. The aromatics are efficiently transferred from the aqueous phase to the vapor phase. The vapor is swept through a sorbent trap where the aromatics are trapped. After purging is completed, the trap is heated and backflushed with the inert gas to desorb the aromatics onto a gas chromatographic column. The gas chromatograph is temperature programmed to separate the aromatics which are then detected with a photoionization detector.
2 3
2.2 The method provides an optional gas chromatographic column that may be helpful in resolving the compounds of interest from interferences that may occur.

# 3. Interferences
3.1 Impurities in the purge gas and organic compounds outgassing from the plumbing ahead of the trap account for the majority of contamination problems. The analytical system must be demonstrated to be free from contamination under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3. The use of non-Teflon plastic tubing, non-Teflon thread sealants, or flow controllers with rubber components in the purge and trap system should be avoided.
3.2 Samples can be contaminated by diffusion of volatile organics through the septum seal into the sample during shipment and storage. A field reagent blank prepared from reagent water and carried through the sampling and handling protocol can serve as a check on such contamination.
3.3 Contamination by carry-over can occur whenever high level and low level samples are sequentially analyzed. To reduce carry-over, the purging device and sample syringe must be rinsed with reagent water between sample analyses. Whenever an unusually concentrated sample is encountered, it should be followed by an analysis of reagent water to check for cross contamination. For samples containing large amounts of water-soluble materials, suspended solids, high boiling compounds or high aromatic levels, it may be necessary to wash the purging device with a detergent solution, rinse it with distilled water, and then dry it in an oven at 105 °C between analyses. The trap and other parts of the system are also subject to contamination; therefore, frequent bakeout and purging of the entire system may be required.

# 4. Safety
4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety
are available and have been identified
4 6
for the information of the analyst.
4.2 The following parameters covered by this method have been tentatively classified as known or suspected, human or mammalian carcinogens: benzene and 1,4-dichlorobenzene. Primary standards of these toxic compounds should be prepared in a hood. A NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be worn when the analyst handles high concentrations of these toxic compounds.

# 5. Apparatus and Materials
5.1 Sampling equipment, for discrete sampling.

5.1.2 Septum—Teflon-faced silicone (Pierce #12722 or equivalent). Detergent wash, rinse with tap and distilled water, and dry at 105 °C for 1 h before use.
5.2 Purge and trap system—The purge and trap system consists of three separate pieces of equipment: A purging device, trap, and desorber. Several complete systems are now commercially available.
5.2.1 The purging device must be designed to accept 5-mL samples with a water column at least 3 cm deep. The gaseous head space between the water column and the trap must have a total volume of less than 15 mL. The purge gas must pass through the water column as finely divided bubbles with a diameter of less than 3 mm at the origin. The purge gas must be introduced no more than 5 mm from the base of the water column. The purging device illustrated in Figure 1 meets these design criteria.
5.2.2 The trap must be at least 25 cm long and have an inside diameter of at least 0.105 in.
5.2.2.1 The trap is packed with 1 cm of methyl silicone coated packing (Section 6.4.2) and 23 cm of 2,6-diphenylene oxide polymer (Section 6.4.1) as shown in Figure 2. This trap was used to develop the method performance statements in Section 12.
5.2.2.2 Alternatively, either of the two traps described in Method 601 may be used, although water vapor will preclude the measurement of low concentrations of benzene.
5.2.3 The desorber must be capable of rapidly heating the trap to 180 °C. The polymer section of the trap should not be heated higher than 180 °C and the remaining sections should not exceed 200 °C. The desorber illustrated in Figure 2 meets these design criteria.
5.2.4 The purge and trap system may be assembled as a separate unit or be coupled to a gas chromatograph as illustrated in Figures 3, 4, and 5.
5.3 Gas chromatograph—An analytical system complete with a temperature programmable gas chromatograph suitable for on-column injection and all required accessories including syringes, analytical columns, gases, detector, and strip-chart recorder. A data system is recommended for measuring peak areas.

5.3.2 Column 2—8 ft long × 0.1 in ID stainless steel or glass, packed with 5% 1,2,3-Tris(2-cyanoethoxy)propane on Chromosorb W-AW (60/80 mesh) or equivalent.
5.3.3 Detector—Photoionization detector (h-Nu Systems, Inc. Model PI-51-02 or equivalent). This type of detector has been proven effective in the analysis of wastewaters for the parameters listed in the scope (Section 1.1), and was used to develop the method performance statements in Section 12. Guidelines for the use of alternate detectors are provided in Section 10.1.

# 6. Reagents
6.1 Reagent water—Reagent water is defined as a water in which an interferent is not observed at the MDL of the parameters of interest.
6.1.1 Reagent water can be generated by passing tap water through a carbon filter bed containing about 1 lb of activated carbon (Filtrasorb-300, Calgon Corp., or equivalent).
6.1.2 A water purification system (Millipore Super-Q or equivalent) may be used to generate reagent water.
6.1.3 Reagent water may also be prepared by boiling water for 15 min. Subsequently, while maintaining the temperature at 90 °C, bubble a contaminant-free inert gas through the water for 1 h. While still hot, transfer the water to a narrow mouth screw-cap bottle and seal with a Teflon-lined septum and cap.
6.2 Sodium thiosulfate—(ACS) Granular.
6.3 Hydrochloric acid (1 + 1)—Add 50 mL of concentrated HCl (ACS) to 50 mL of reagent water.
6.4 Trap Materials:
6.4.1 2,6-Diphenylene oxide polymer—Tenax, (60/80 mesh), chromatographic grade or equivalent.
6.4.2 Methyl silicone packing—3% OV-1 on Chromosorb-W (60/80 mesh) or equivalent.
6.5 Methanol—Pesticide quality or equivalent.
6.6 Stock standard solutions—Stock standard solutions may be prepared from pure standard materials or purchased as certified solutions. Prepare stock standard solutions in methanol using assayed liquids. Because of the toxicity of benzene and 1,4-dichlorobenzene, primary dilutions of these materials should be prepared in a hood. A NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be used when the analyst handles high concentrations of such materials.
6.6.1 Place about 9.8 mL of methanol into a 10-mL ground glass stoppered volumetric flask. Allow the flask to stand, unstoppered, for about 10 min or until all alcohol wetted surfaces have dried. Weigh the flask to the nearest 0.1 mg.
6.6.2 Using a 100-µL syringe, immediately add two or more drops of assayed reference material to the flask, then reweigh. Be sure that the drops fall directly into the alcohol without contacting the neck of the flask.
6.6.3 Reweigh, dilute to volume, stopper, then mix by inverting the flask several times. Calculate the concentration in µg/µL from the net gain in weight. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight can be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock standard. Commercially prepared stock standards can be used at any concentration if they are certified by the manufacturer or by an independent source.
6.6.4 Transfer the stock standard solution into a Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottle. Store at 4 °C and protect from light.
6.6.5 All standards must be replaced after one month, or sooner if comparison with check standards indicates a problem.
6.7 Secondary dilution standards—Using stock standard solutions, prepare secondary dilution standards in methanol that contain the compounds of interest, either singly or mixed together. The secondary dilution standards should be prepared at concentrations such that the aqueous calibration standards prepared in Section 7.3.1 or 7.4.1 will bracket the working range of the analytical system. Secondary solution standards must be stored with zero headspace and should be checked frequently for signs of degradation or evaporation, especially just prior to preparing calibration standards from them.
6.8 Quality control check sample concentrate—See Section 8.2.1.

# 7. Calibration
7.1 Assemble a purge and trap system that meets the specifications in Section 5.2. Condition the trap overnight at 180 °C by backflushing with an inert gas flow of at least 20 mL/min. Condition the trap for 10 min once daily prior to use.
7.2 Connect the purge and trap system to a gas chromatograph. The gas chromatograph must be operated using temperature and flow rate conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1. Calibrate the purge and trap-gas chromatographic system using either the external standard technique (Section 7.3) or the internal standard technique (Section 7.4).
7.3 External standard calibration procedure:
7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter by carefully adding 20.0 µL of one or more secondary dilution standards to 100, 500, or 1000 mL of reagent water. A 25-µL syringe with a 0.006 in. ID needle should be used for this operation. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 1) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector. These aqueous standards must be prepared fresh daily.
7.3.2 Analyze each calibration standard according to Section 10, and tabulate peak height or area responses versus the concentration in the standard. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to concentration (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (
10% relative standard deviation, RSD), linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.
7.4 Internal standard calibration procedure—To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can be suggested that is applicable to all samples. The compound, α,α,α,-trifluorotoluene, recommended as a surrogate spiking compound in Section 8.7 has been used successfully as an internal standard.
7.4.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest as described in Section 7.3.1.
7.4.2 Prepare a spiking solution containing each of the internal standards using the procedures described in Sections 6.6 and 6.7. It is recommended that the secondary dilution standard be prepared at a concentration of 15 µg/mL of each internal standard compound. The addition of 10 µl of this
standard to 5.0 mL of sample or calibration standard would be equivalent to 30 µg/L.
7.4.3 Analyze each calibration standard according to Section 10, adding 10 µL of internal standard spiking solution directly to the syringe (Section 10.4). Tabulate peak height or area responses against concentration for each compound and internal standard, and calculate response factors (RF) for each compound using Equation 1.
RF = (A
s
)(C
is
(A
is

Equation 1
where:
A
s
= Response for the parameter to be measured.
A

= Response for the internal standard.
C
is

C
s
= Concentration of the parameter to be measured.
If the RF value over the working range is a constant (
10% RSD), the RF can be assumed to be invariant and the average RF can be used for calculations. Alternatively, the results can be used to plot a calibration curve of response ratios, A
s
/A
is
, vs. RF.
7.5 The working calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be verified on each working day by the measurement of a QC check sample.
7.5.1 Prepare the QC check sample as described in Section 8.2.2.
7.5.2 Analyze the QC check sample according to Section 10.
7.5.3 For each parameter, compare the response (Q) with the corresponding calibration acceptance criteria found in Table 2. If the responses for all parameters of interest fall within the designated ranges, analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual Q falls outside the range, a new calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be prepared for that parameter according to Section 7.3 or 7.4.

# 8. Quality Control
8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.
8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.
8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Section 10.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.
8.1.3 Each day, the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system are under control.
8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.
8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.
8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.
8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.
8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each parameter of interest at a concentration of 10 µg/mL in methanol. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.
8.2.2 Prepare a QC check sample to contain 20 µg/L of each parameter by adding 200 µL of QC check sample concentrate to 100 mL of reagant water.
8.2.3 Analyze four 5-mL aliquots of the well-mixed QC check sample according to Section 10.
8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X
) in µg/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in µg/L, for each parameter of interest using the four results.
8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X
with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively,
found in Table 2. If s and X
for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X
falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter.

# Note:
The large number of parameters in Table 2 present a substantial probability that one or more will fail at least one of the acceptance criteria when all parameters are analyzed.
8.2.6 When one or more of the parameters tested fail at least one of the acceptance criteria, the analyst must proceed according to Section 8.2.6.1 or 8.2.6.2.
8.2.6.1 Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with Section 8.2.3.
8.2.6.2 Beginning with Section 8.2.3, repeat the test only for those parameters that failed to meet criteria. Repeated failure, however, will confirm a general problem with the measurement system. If this occurs, locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all compounds of interest beginning with Section 8.2.3.
8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.
8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:
8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at 20 µg/L or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.2 Analyze one 5-mL sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second 5-mL sample aliquot with 10 µL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100(A−B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.
8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1.
7
If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than 20 µg/L, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 2, or optional QC acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of a parameter: (1) Calculate accuracy (X′) using the equation in Table 3, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S′) using the equation in Table 3, substituting X′ for X
; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X′/T) ±2.44(100 S′/T)%.
7
8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.
8.4 If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.

# Note:
The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory.
8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 10 µL of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 5 mL of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.
8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P
s
) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.
8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (P
s
) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.
8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P
)
and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (s
p
). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P
−2s
p
to P
+ 2s
p
. If P
= 90% and s
p
= 10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).
8.6 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as gas chromatography with a dissimilar column, specific element detector, or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.
8.7 The analyst should monitor both the performance of the analytical system and the effectiveness of the method in dealing with each sample matrix by spiking each sample, standard, and reagent water blank with surrogate compounds (e.g. α, α, α,-trifluorotoluene) that encompass the range of the temperature program used in this method. From stock standard solutions prepared as in Section 6.6, add a volume to give 750 µg of each surrogate to 45 mL of reagent water contained in a 50-mL volumetric flask, mix and dilute to volume for a concentration of 15 mg/µL. Add 10 µL of this surrogate spiking solution directly into the 5-mL syringe with every sample and reference standard analyzed. Prepare a fresh surrogate spiking solution on a weekly basis. If the internal standard calibration procedure is being used, the surrogate compounds may be added directly to the internal standard spiking solution (Section 7.4.2).

# 9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling
9.1 The samples must be iced or refrigerated from the time of collection until analysis. If the sample contains free or combined chlorine, add sodium thiosulfate preservative (10 mg/40 mL is sufficient for up to 5 ppm Cl
2
) to the empty sample bottle just prior to shipping to the sampling site. EPA Method 330.4 or 330.5 may be used for measurement of residual chlorine.
8
Field test kits are available for this purpose.
9.2 Collect about 500 mL of sample in a clean container. Adjust the pH of the sample to about 2 by adding 1 + 1 HCl while stirring. Fill the sample bottle in such a manner that no air bubbles pass through the sample as the bottle is being filled. Seal the bottle so that no air bubbles are entrapped in it. Maintain the hermetic seal on the sample bottle until time of analysis.
9.3 All samples must be analyzed within 14 days of collection.

# 10. Procedure
10.1 Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are estimated retention times and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. An example of the separations achieved by Column 1 is shown in Figure 6. Other packed columns, chromatographic conditions, or detectors may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.
10.2 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.
10.3 Adjust the purge gas (nitrogen or helium) flow rate to 40 mL/min. Attach the trap inlet to the purging device, and set the purge and trap system to purge (Figure 3). Open the syringe valve located on the purging device sample introduction needle.
10.4 Allow the sample to come to ambient temperature prior to introducing it to the syringe. Remove the plunger from a 5-mL syringe and attach a closed syringe valve. Open the sample bottle (or standard) and carefully pour the sample into the syringe barrel to just short of overflowing. Replace the syringe plunger and compress the sample. Open the syringe valve and vent any residual air while adjusting the sample volume to 5.0 mL. Since this process of taking an aliquot destroys the validity of the sample for future analysis, the analyst should fill a second syringe at this time to protect against possible loss of data. Add 10.0 µL of the surrogate spiking solution (Section 8.7) and 10.0 µL of the internal standard spiking solution (Section 7.4.2), if applicable, through the valve bore, then close the valve.
10.5 Attach the syringe-syringe valve assembly to the syringe valve on the purging device. Open the syringe valves and inject the sample into the purging chamber.
10.6 Close both valves and purge the sample for 12.0 ±0.1 min at ambient temperature.
10.7 After the 12-min purge time, disconnect the purging device from the trap. Dry the trap by maintaining a flow of 40 mL/min of dry purge gas through it for 6 min (Figure 4). If the purging device has no provision for bypassing the purger for this step, a dry purger should be inserted into the device to minimize moisture in the gas. Attach the trap to the chromatograph, adjust the purge and trap system to the desorb mode (Figure 5), and begin to temperature program the gas chromatograph. Introduce the trapped materials to the GC column by rapidly heating the trap to 180 °C while backflushing the trap with an inert gas between 20 and 60 mL/min for 4 min. If rapid heating of the trap cannot be achieved, the GC column must be used as
a secondary trap by cooling it to 30 °C (subambient temperature, if poor peak geometry and random retention time problems persist) instead of the initial program temperature of 50 °C.
10.8 While the trap is being desorbed into the gas chromatograph column, empty the purging chamber using the sample introduction syringe. Wash the chamber with two 5-mL flushes of reagent water.
10.9 After desorbing the sample for 4 min, recondition the trap by returning the purge and trap system to the purge mode. Wait 15 s, then close the syringe valve on the purging device to begin gas flow through the trap. The trap temperature should be maintained at 180 °C. After approximately 7 min, turn off the trap heater and open the syringe valve to stop the gas flow through the trap. When the trap is cool, the next sample can be analyzed.
10.10 Identify the parameters in the sample by comparing the retention times of the peaks in the sample chromatogram with those of the peaks in standard chromatograms. The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound can be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weigh heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.
10.11 If the response for a peak exceeds the working range of the system, prepare a dilution of the sample with reagent water from the aliquot in the second syringe and reanalyze.

# 11. Calculations
11.1 Determine the concentration of individual compounds in the sample.
11.1.1 If the external standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the concentration of the parameter being measured from the peak response using the calibration curve or calibration factor determined in Section 7.3.2.
11.1.2 If the internal standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the concentration in the sample using the response factor (RF) determined in Section 7.4.3 and Equation 2.
EC15NO91.096
Equation 2
where:
A
s
= Response for the parameter to be measured.
A
is
= Response for the internal standard.
C
is
= Concentration of the internal standard.
11.2 Report results in µg/L without correction for recovery data. All QC data obtained should be reported with the sample results.

# 12. Method Performance
12.1 The method detection limit (MDL) is defined as the minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence that the value is above zero.
1
The MDL concentrations listed in Table 1 were obtained using reagent water.
9
Similar results were achieved using representative wastewaters. The MDL actually achieved in a given analysis will vary depending on instrument sensitivity and matrix effects.
12.2 This method has been demonstrated to be applicable for the concentration range from the MDL to 100 × MDL.
9
Direct aqueous injection techniques should be used to measure concentration levels above 1000 × MDL.
12.3 This method was tested by 20 laboratories using reagent water, drinking water, surface water, and three industrial wastewaters spiked at six concentrations over the range 2.1 to 550 µg/L.
9
Single operator precision, overall precision, and method accuracy were found to be directly related to the concentration of the parameter and essentially independent of the sample matrix. Linear equations to describe these relationships are presented in Table 3.

1.2 This is a purge and trap gas chromatographic (GC) method applicable to the determination of the compounds listed above in municipal and industrial discharges as provided under 40 CFR 136.1. When this method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for either or both of the compounds above, compound identifications should be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. This method describes analytical conditions for a second gas chromatographic column that can be used to confirm measurements made with the primary column. Method 624 provides gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative and quantitative confirmation of results for the parameters listed above, if used with the purge and trap conditions described in this method.
1.3 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 12.1)
1
for each parameter is listed in Table 1. The MDL for a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.
1.4 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.
1.5 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the operation of a purge and trap system and a gas chromatograph and in the interpretation of gas chromatograms. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.

# 2. Summary of Method
2.1 An inert gas is bubbled through a 5-mL water sample contained in a heated purging chamber. Acrolein and acrylonitrile are transferred from the aqueous phase to the vapor phase. The vapor is swept through a sorbent trap where the analytes are trapped. After the purge is completed, the trap is heated and backflushed with the inert gas to desorb the compound onto a gas chromatographic column. The gas chromatograph is temperature programmed to separate the analytes which are then detected with a flame ionization detector.
2 3
2.2 The method provides an optional gas chromatographic column that may be helpful in resolving the compounds of interest from the interferences that may occur.

# 3. Interferences
3.1 Impurities in the purge gas and organic compound outgassing from the plumbing of the trap account for the majority of contamination problems. The analytical system must be demonstrated to be free from contamination under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3. The use of non-Teflon plastic tubing, non-Teflon thread sealants, or flow controllers with rubber components in the purge and trap system should be avoided.
3.2 Samples can be contaminated by diffusion of volatile organics through the septum seal into the sample during shipment and storage. A field reagent blank prepared from reagent water and carried through the sampling and handling protocol can serve as a check on such contamination.
3.3 Contamination by carry-over can occur whenever high level and low level samples are sequentially analyzed. To reduce carry-over, the purging device and sample syringe must be rinsed between samples with reagent water. Whenever an unusually concentrated sample is encountered, it should be followed by an analysis of reagent water to check for cross contamination. For samples containing large amounts of water-soluble materials, suspended solids, high boiling compounds or high analyte levels, it may be necessary to wash the purging device with a detergent solution, rinse it with distilled water, and then dry it in an oven at 105 °C between analyses. The trap and other parts of the system are also subject to contamination, therefore, frequent bakeout and purging of the entire system may be required.

# 4. Safety
4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this view point, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified
4 6
for the information of the analyst.

# 5. Apparatus and Materials
5.1 Sampling equipment, for discrete sampling.
5.1.1 Vial—25-mL capacity or larger, equipped with a screw cap with a hole in the center (Pierce #13075 or equivalent). Detergent wash, rinse with tap and distilled water, and dry at 105 °C before use.
5.1.2 Septum—Teflon-faced silicone (Pierce #12722 or equivalent). Detergent wash, rinse with tap and distilled water and dry at 105 °C for 1 h before use.
5.2 Purge and trap system—The purge and trap system consists of three separate pieces of equipment: a purging device, trap, and desorber. Several complete systems are now commercially available.
5.2.1 The purging device must be designed to accept 5-mL, samples with a water column at least 3 cm deep. The gaseous head space between the water column and the trap must have a total volume of less than 15 mL. The purge gas must pass through the water column as finely divided bubbles with a diameter of less than 3 mm at the origin. The purge gas must be introduced no more than 5 mm from the base of the water column. The purging device must be capable of being heated to 85 °C within 3.0 min after transfer of the sample to the purging device and being held at 85 ±2 °C during the purge cycle. The entire water column in the purging device must be heated. Design of this modification to the standard purging device is optional, however, use of a water bath is suggested.
5.2.1.1 Heating mantle—To be used to heat water bath.
5.2.1.2 Temperature controller—Equipped with thermocouple/sensor to accurately control water bath temperature to ±2 °C. The purging device illustrated in Figure 1 meets these design criteria.
5.2.2 The trap must be at least 25 cm long and have an inside diameter of at least 0.105 in. The trap must be packed to contain 1.0 cm of methyl silicone coated packing (Section 6.5.2) and 23 cm of 2,6-diphenylene oxide polymer (Section 6.5.1). The minimum specifications for the trap are illustrated in Figure 2.
5.2.3 The desorber must be capable of rapidly heating the trap to 180 °C, The desorber illustrated in Figure 2 meets these design criteria.
5.2.4 The purge and trap system may be assembled as a separate unit as illustrated in Figure 3 or be coupled to a gas chromatograph.
5.3 pH paper—Narrow pH range, about 3.5 to 5.5 (Fisher Scientific Short Range Alkacid No. 2, #14-837-2 or equivalent).
5.4 Gas chromatograph—An analytical system complete with a temperature programmable gas chromatograph suitable for on-column injection and all required accessories including syringes, analytical columns, gases, detector, and strip-chart recorder. A data system is recommended for measuring peak areas.
5.4.1 Column 1—10 ft long × 2 mm ID glass or stainless steel, packed with Porapak-QS (80/100 mesh) or equivalent. This column was used to develop the method performance statements in Section 12. Guidelines for the use of alternate column packings are provided in Section 10.1.
5.4.2 Column 2—6 ft long × 0.1 in. ID glass or stainless steel, packed with Chromosorb 101 (60/80 mesh) or equivalent.
5.4.3 Detector—Flame ionization detector. This type of detector has proven effective in the analysis of wastewaters for the parameters listed in the scope (Section 1.1), and was used to develop the method performance statements in Section 12. Guidelines for the use of alternate detectors are provided in Section 10.1.
5.5 Syringes—5-mL, glass hypodermic with Luerlok tip (two each).

5.8 Bottle—15-mL, screw-cap, with Teflon cap liner.
5.9 Balance—Analytical, capable of accurately weighing 0.0001 g.

# 6. Reagents
6.1 Reagent water—Reagent water is defined as a water in which an interferent is not observed at the MDL of the parameters of interest.
6.1.1 Reagent water can be generated by passing tap water through a carbon filter bed containing about 1 lb of activated carbon (Filtrasorb-300, Calgon Corp., or equivalent).
6.1.2 A water purification system (Millipore Super-Q or equivalent) may be used to generate reagent water.
6.1.3 Regent water may also be prepared by boiling water for 15 min. Subsequently, while maintaining the temperature at 90 °C, bubble a contaminant-free inert gas through the water for 1 h. While still hot, transfer the water to a narrow mouth screw-cap bottle and seal with a Teflon-lined septum and cap.
6.2 Sodium thiosulfate—(ACS) Granular.
6.3 Sodium hydroxide solution (10 N)—Dissolve 40 g of NaOH (ACS) in reagent water and dilute to 100 mL.
6.4 Hydrochloric acid (1 + 1)—Slowly, add 50 mL of concentrated HCl (ACS) to 50 mL of reagent water.
6.5 Trap Materials:
6.5.1 2,6-Diphenylene oxide polymer—Tenax (60/80 mesh), chromatographic grade or equivalent.
6.5.2 Methyl silicone packing—3% OV-1 on Chromosorb-W (60/80 mesh) or equivalent.
6.6 Stock standard solutions—Stock standard solutions may be prepared from pure standard materials or purchased as certified solutions. Prepare stock standard solutions in reagent water using assayed liquids. Since acrolein and acrylonitrile are lachrymators, primary dilutions of these compounds should be prepared in a hood. A NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be used when the analyst handles high concentrations of such materials.
6.6.1 Place about 9.8 mL of reagent water into a 10-mL ground glass stoppered volumetric flask. For acrolein standards the reagent water must be adjusted to pH 4 to 5. Weight the flask to the nearest 0.1 mg.
6.6.2 Using a 100-µL syringe, immediately add two or more drops of assayed reference material to the flask, then reweigh. Be sure that the drops fall directly into the water without contacting the neck of the flask.
6.6.3 Reweigh, dilute to volume, stopper, then mix by inverting the flask several times. Calculate the concentration in µg/µL from the net gain in weight. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight can be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock staldard. Optionally, stock standard solutions may be prepared using the pure standard material by volumetrically measuring the appropriate amounts and determining the weight of the material using the density of the material. Commercially prepared stock standards may be used at any concentration if they are certified by the manufactaurer or by an independent source.
6.6.4 Transfer the stock standard solution into a Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottle. Store at 4 °C and protect from light.
6.6.5 Prepare fresh standards daily.
6.7 Secondary dilution standards—Using stock standard solutions, prepare secondary dilution standards in reagent water that contain the compounds of interest, either singly or mixed together. The secondary dilution standards should be prepared at concentrations such that the aqueous calibration standards prepared in Section 7.3.1 or 7.4.1 will bracket the working range of the analytical system. Secondary dilution standards should be prepared daily and stored at 4 °C.
6.8 Quality control check sample concentrate—See Section 8.2.1.

# 7. Calibration
7.1 Assemble a purge and trap system that meets the specifications in Section 5.2. Condition the trap overnight at 180 °C by backflushing with an inert gas flow of at least 20 mL/min. Condition the trap for 10 min once daily prior to use.
7.2 Connect the purge and trap system to a gas chromatograph. The gas chromatograph must be operated using temperature and flow rate conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1. Calibrate the purge and trap-gas chromatographic system using either the external standard technique (Section 7.3) or the internal standard technique (Section 7.4).
7.3 External standard calibration procedure:
7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter by carefully adding 20.0 µL of one or more secondary dilution standards to 100, 500, or 1000 mL of reagent water. A 25-µL syringe with a 0.006 in. ID needle should be used for this operation. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector. These standards must be prepared fresh daily.
7.3.2 Analyze each calibration standard according to Section 10, and tabulate peak height or area responses versus the concentration of the standard. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to concentration (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (
10% relative standard deviation, RSD), linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.
7.4 Internal standard calibration procedure—To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can be suggested that is applicable to all samples.
7.4.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest as described in Section 7.3.1.
7.4.2 Prepare a spiking solution containing each of the internal standards using the procedures described in Sections 6.6 and 6.7. It is recommended that the secondary dilution standard be prepared at a concentration of 15 µg/mL of each internal standard compound. The addition of 10 µL of this standard to 5.0 mL of sample or calibration standard would be equivalent to 30 µg/L.
7.4.3 Analyze each calibration standard according to Section 10, adding 10 µL of internal standard spiking solution directly to the syringe (Section 10.4). Tabulate peak height or area responses against concentration for each compound and internal standard, and calculate response factors (RF) for each compound using Equation 1.

7.5 The working calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be verified on each working day by the measurement of a QC check sample.
7.5.1 Prepare the QC check sample as described in Section 8.2.2.
7.5.2 Analyze the QC check sample according to Section 10.
7.5.3 For each parameter, compare the response (Q) with the corresponding calibration acceptance criteria found in Table 2. If the responses for all parameters of interest fall within the designated ranges, analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual Q falls outside the range, a new calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be prepared for that parameter according to Section 7.3 or 7.4.

# 8. Quality Control
8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.
8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.
8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Section 10.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.
8.1.3 Each day, the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system are under control.
8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.
8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.
8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.
8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.
8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each parameter of interest at a concentration of 25 µg/mL in reagent water. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.
8.2.2 Prepare a QC check sample to contain 50 µg/L of each parameter by adding 200 µL of QC check sample concentrate to 100 mL of reagent water.
8.2.3 Analyze four 5-mL aliquots of the well-mixed QC check sample according to Section 10.
8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X
) in µg/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in µg/L, for each parameter using the four results.
8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X
with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively, found in Table 3. If s and X
for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If either s exceeds the precision limit or X
falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter. Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for each compound of interest.
8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to
ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.
8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:
8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at 50 µg/L or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.2 Analyze one 5-mL sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second 5-mL sample aliquot with 10 µL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100(A−B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.
8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 3. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1.
7
8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.
8.4 If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.

# Note:
The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory.
8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 10 µL of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 5 mL of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.
8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P
s
) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.
8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (P
s
) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 3. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.
8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P
) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (s
p
). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P
−2s
p
to P
+ 2s
p
. If P
= 90% and s
p
= 10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).
8.6 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as gas chromatography with a dissimilar column or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.

# 9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling
9.1 All samples must be iced or refrigerated from the time of collection until analysis. If the sample contains free or combined chlorine, add sodium thiosulfate preservative (10 mg/40 mL is sufficient for up to 5 ppm Cl
2
) to the empty sample bottle just prior to shipping to the sampling site. EPA Methods 330.4 and 330.5 may be used for measurement of residual chlorine.
8
Field test kits are available for this purpose.
9.2 If acrolein is to be analyzed, collect about 500 mL of sample in a clean glass container. Adjust the pH of the sample to 4 to 5 using acid or base, measuring with narrow range pH paper. Samples for acrolein analysis receiving no pH adjustment must be analyzed within 3 days of sampling.
9.3 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers having a total volume of at least 25 mL. Fill the sample bottle just to overflowing in such a manner that no air bubbles pass through the sample as the bottle is being filled. Seal the bottle so that no air bubbles are entrapped in it. If preservative has been added, shake vigorously for 1 min. Maintain the hermetic seal on the sample bottle until time of analysis.
9.4 All samples must be analyzed within 14 days of collection.

# 10. Procedure
10.1 Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are estimated retention times and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. An example of the separations achieved by Column 1 is shown in Figure 5. Other packed columns, chromatographic conditions, or detectors may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.
10.2 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.
10.3 Adjust the purge gas (nitrogen or helium) flow rate to 20 mL-min. Attach the trap inlet to the purging device, and set the purge and trap system to purge (Figure 3). Open the syringe valve located on the purging device sample introduction needle.
10.4 Remove the plunger from a 5-mL syringe and attach a closed syringe valve. Open the sample bottle (or standard) and carefully pour the sample into the syringe barrel to just short of overflowing. Replace the syringe plunger and compress the sample. Open the syringe valve and vent any residual air while adjusting the sample volume to 5.0 mL. Since this process of taking an aliquot destroys the validity of the sample for future analysis, the analyst should fill a second syringe at this time to protect against possible loss of data. Add 10.0 µL of the internal standard spiking solution (Section 7.4.2), if applicable, through the valve bore then close the valve.
10.5 Attach the syringe-syringe valve assembly to the syringe valve on the purging device. Open the syringe valves and inject the sample into the purging chamber.
10.6 Close both valves and purge the sample for 15.0 ±0.1 min while heating at 85 ±2 °C.
10.7 After the 15-min purge time, attach the trap to the chromatograph, adjust the purge and trap system to the desorb mode (Figure 4), and begin to temperature program the gas chromatograph. Introduce the trapped materials to the GC column by rapidly heating the trap to 180 °C while backflushing the trap with an inert gas between 20 and 60 mL/min for 1.5 min.
10.8 While the trap is being desorbed into the gas chromatograph, empty the purging chamber using the sample introduction syringe. Wash the chamber with two 5-mL flushes of reagent water.
10.9 After desorbing the sample for 1.5 min, recondition the trap by returning the purge and trap system to the purge mode. Wait 15 s then close the syringe valve on the purging device to begin gas flow through the trap. The trap temperature should be maintained at 210 °C. After approximately 7 min, turn off the trap heater and open the syringe valve to stop the gas flow through the trap. When the trap is cool, the next sample can be analyzed.
10.10 Identify the parameters in the sample by comparing the retention times of the peaks in the sample chromatogram with those of the peaks in standard chromatograms. The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound can be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weigh heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.

The MDL actually achieved in a given analysis will vary depending on instrument sensitivity and matrix effects.
12.2 This method is recommended for the concentration range from the MDL to 1,000 × MDL. Direct aqueous injection techniques should be used to measure concentration levels above 1,000 × MDL.
12.3 In a single laboratory (Battelle-Columbus), the average recoveries and standard deviations presented in Table 2 were obtained.

1.2 This is a flame ionization detector gas chromatographic (FIDGC) method applicable to the determination of the compounds listed above in municipal and industrial discharges as provided under 40 CFR 136.1. When this method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for any or all of the compounds above, compound identifications should be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. This method describes analytical conditions for derivatization, cleanup, and electron capture detector gas chromatography (ECDGC) that can be used to confirm measurements made by FIDGC. Method 625 provides gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative and quantitative confirmation of results for all of the parameters listed above, using the extract produced by this method.
1.3 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 14.1)
1
for each parameter is listed in Table 1. The MDL for a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix. The MDL listed in Table 1 for each parameter was achieved with a flame ionization detector (FID). The MDLs that were achieved when the derivatization cleanup and electron capture detector (ECD) were employed are presented in Table 2.
1.4 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.
1.5 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of a gas chromatograph and in the interpretation of gas chromatograms. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.

# 2. Summary of Method
2.1 A measured volume of sample, approximately 1-L, is acidified and extracted with methylene chloride using a separatory funnel. The methylene chloride extract is dried and exchanged to 2-propanol during concentration to a volume of 10 mL or less. The extract is separated by gas chromatography and the phenols are then measured with an FID.
2
2.2 A preliminary sample wash under basic conditions can be employed for samples having high general organic and organic base interferences.
2.3 The method also provides for a derivatization and column chromatography cleanup procedure to aid in the elimination of interferences.
2 3
The derivatives are analyzed by ECDGC.

# 3. Interferences
3.1 Method interferences may be caused by contaminants in solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware that lead to discrete artifacts and/or elevated baselines in gas chromatograms. All of these materials must be routinely demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3.
3.1.1 Glassware must be scrupulously cleaned.
4
Clean all glassware as soon as possible after use by rinsing with the last solvent used in it. Solvent rinsing should be followed by detergent washing with hot water, and rinses with tap water and distilled water. The glassware should then be drained dry, and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 °C for 15 to 30 min. Some thermally stable materials, such as PCBs, may not be eliminated by this treatment. Solvent rinses with acetone and pesticide quality hexane may be substituted for the muffle furnace heating. Thorough rinsing with such solvents usually eliminates PCB interference. Volumetric ware should not be heated in a muffle furnace. After drying and cooling, glassware should be sealed and stored in a clean environment to prevent any accumulation of dust or other contaminants. Store inverted or capped with aluminum foil.
3.1.2 The use of high purity reagents and solvents helps to minimize interference problems. Purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.
3.2 Matrix interferences may be caused by contaminants that are coextracted from the sample. The extent of matrix interferences will vary considerably from source to source, depending upon the nature and diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being sampled. The derivatization cleanup procedure in Section 12 can be used to overcome many of these interferences, but unique samples may require additional cleanup approaches to achieve the MDL listed in Tables 1 and 2.
3.3 The basic sample wash (Section 10.2) may cause significantly reduced recovery of phenol and 2,4-dimethylphenol. The analyst must recognize that results obtained under these conditions are minimum concentrations.

# 4. Safety
4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this mothod has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified
5 7
for the information of analyst.
4.2 Special care should be taken in handling pentafluorobenzyl bromide, which is a lachrymator, and 18-crown-6-ether, which is highly toxic.

# 5. Apparatus and Materials
5.1 Sampling equipment, for discrete or composite sampling.
5.1.1 Grab sample bottle—1-L or 1-qt, amber glass, fitted with a screw cap lined with Teflon. Foil may be substituted for Teflon if the sample is not corrosive. If amber bottles are not available, protect samples from light. The bottle and cap liner must be washed, rinsed with acetone or methylene chloride, and dried before use to minimize contamination.
5.1.2 Automatic sampler (optional)—The sampler must incorporate glass sample containers for the collection of a minimum of 250 mL of sample. Sample containers must be kept refrigerated at 4 °C and protected from light during compositing. If the sampler uses a peristaltic pump, a minimum length of compressible silicone rubber tubing may be
used. Before use, however, the compressible tubing should be thoroughly rinsed with methanol, followed by repeated rinsings with distilled water to minimize the potential for contamination of the sample. An integrating flow meter is required to collect flow proportional composites.
5.2 Glassware (All specifications are suggested. Catalog numbers are included for illustration only.):
5.2.1 Separatory funnel—2-L, with Teflon stopcock.

5.4 Water bath—Heated, with concentric ring cover, capable of temperature control (±2 °C). The bath should be used in a hood.
5.5 Balance—Analytical, capable of accurately weighting 0.0001 g.
5.6 Gas chromatograph—An analytical system complete with a temperature programmable gas chromatograph suitable for on-column injection and all required accessories including syringes, analytical columns, gases, detector, and strip-chart recorder. A data system is recommended for measuring peak areas.
5.6.1 Column for underivatized phenols—1.8 m long × 2 mm ID glass, packed with 1% SP-1240DA on Supelcoport (80/100 mesh) or equivalent. This column was used to develop the method performance statements in Section 14. Guidelines for the use of alternate column packings are provided in Section 11.1.
5.6.2 Column for derivatized phenols—1.8 m long × 2 mm ID glass, packed with 5% OV-17 on Chromosorb W-AW-DMCS (80/100 mesh) or equivalent. This column has proven effective in the analysis of wastewaters for derivatization products of the parameters listed in the scope (Section 1.1), and was used to develop the method performance statements in Section 14. Guidelines for the use of alternate column packings are provided in Section 11.1.
5.6.3 Detectors—Flame ionization and electron capture detectors. The FID is used when determining the parent phenols. The ECD is used when determining the derivatized phenols. Guidelines for the use of alternatve detectors are provided in Section 11.1.

(ACS, sp. gr. 1.84) to reagent water and dilute to 1 L.
6.8 Potassium carbonate—(ACS) Powdered.
6.9 Pentafluorobenzyl bromide (α-Bromopentafluorotoluene)—97% minimum purity.

# Note:
This chemical is a lachrymator. (See Section 4.2.)
6.10 18-crown-6-ether (1,4,7,10,13,16-Hexaoxacyclooctadecane)—98% minimum purity.

# Note:
This chemical is highly toxic.
6.11 Derivatization reagent—Add 1 mL of pentafluorobenzyl bromide and 1 g of 18-crown-6-ether to a 50-mL volumetric flask and dilute to volume with 2-propanol. Prepare fresh weekly. This operation should be carried out in a hood. Store at 4 °C and protect from light.
6.12 Acetone, hexane, methanol, methylene chloride, 2-propanol, toluene—Pesticide quality or equivalent.
6.13 Silica gel—100/200 mesh, Davison, grade-923 or equivalent. Activate at 130 °C overnight and store in a desiccator.
6.14 Stock standard solutions (1.00 µg/µL)—Stock standard solutions may be prepared from pure standard materials or purchased as certified solutions.
6.14.1 Prepare stock standard solutions by accurately weighing about 0.0100 g of pure material. Dissolve the material in 2-propanol
and dilute to volume in a 10-mL volumetric flask. Larger volumes can be used at the convenience of the analyst. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight can be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock standard. Commercially prepared stock standards can be used at any concentration if they are certified by the manufacturer or by an independent source.
6.14.2 Transfer the stock standard solutions into Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottles. Store at 4 °C and protect from light. Stock standard solutions should be checked frequently for signs of degradation or evaporation, especially just prior to preparing calibration standards from them.
6.14.3 Stock standard solutions must be replaced after six months, or sooner if comparison with check standards indicates a problem.
6.15 Quality control check sample concentrate—See Section 8.2.1.

# 7. Calibration
7.1 To calibrate the FIDGC for the analysis of underivatized phenols, establish gas chromatographic operating conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1. The gas chromatographic system can be calibrated using the external standard technique (Section 7.2) or the internal standard technique (Section 7.3).
7.2 External standard calibration procedure for FIDGC:
7.2.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask and diluting to volume with 2-propanol. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 1) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.
7.2.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 µl, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 11 and tabulate peak height or area responses against the mass injected. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to amount injected (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (
10% relative standard deviation, RSD), linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.
7.3 Internal standard calibration procedure for FIDGC—To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can be suggested that is applicable to all samples.
7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask. To each calibration standard, add a known constant amount of one or more internal standards, and dilute to volume with 2-propanol. One of the standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.
7.3.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 µL, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 11 and tabulate peak height or area responses against concentration for each compound and internal standard. Calculate response factors (RF) for each compound using Equation 1.

# RF = (A

# )(C

# (A

C

= Concentration of the parameter to be measured (µg/L).
If the RF value over the working range is a constant (
10% RSD), the RF can be assumed to be invariant and the average RF can be used for calculations. Alternatively, the results can be used to plot a calibration curve of response ratios, A
s
/A
is
, vs. RF.
7.4 The working calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be verified on each working day by the measurement of one or more calibration standards. If the response for any parameter varies from the predicted response by more than ±15%, a new calibration curve must be prepared for that compound.
7.5 To calibrate the ECDGC for the analysis of phenol derivatives, establish gas chromatographic operating conditions equivalent to those given in Table 2.
7.5.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask and diluting to volume with 2-propanol. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 2) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.
7.5.2 Each time samples are to be derivatized, simultaneously treat a 1-mL aliquot of each calibration standard as described in Section 12.
7.5.3 After derivatization, analyze 2 to 5 µL of each column eluate collected according to the method beginning in Section 12.8 and tabulate peak height or area responses against the calculated equivalent mass of underivatized phenol injected. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound.
7.6 Before using any cleanup procedure, the analyst must process a series of calibration standards through the procedure to validate elution patterns and the absence of interferences from the reagents.

# 8. Quality Control
8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.
8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.
8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Sections 10.6 and 11.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.
8.1.3 Before processing any samples the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system and glassware are under control. Each time a set of samples is extracted or reagents are changed a reagent water blank must be processed as a safeguard against laboratory contamination.
8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.
8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.
8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.
8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.
8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each parameter of interest at a concentration of 100 µg/mL in 2-propanol. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.
8.2.2 Using a pipet, prepare QC check samples at a concentration of 100 µg/L by adding 1.00 mL of QC check sample concentrate to each of four 1-L aliquots of reagent water.
8.2.3 Analyze the well-mixed QC check samples according to the method beginning in Section 10.
8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X
) in µg/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in µg/L, for each parameter using the four results.
8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X
with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively, found in Table 3. If s and X
for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X
falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter.

# Note:
The large number of parameters in Talbe 3 present a substantial probability that one or more will fail at least one of the acceptance criteria when all parameters are analyzed.
8.2.6 When one or more of the parameters tested fail at least one of the acceptance criteria, the analyst must proceed according to Section 8.2.6.1 or 8.2.6.2.
8.2.6.1 Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.
8.2.6.2 Beginning with Section 8.2.2, repeat the test only for those parameters that failed to meet criteria. Repeated failure, however, will confirm a general problem
with the measurement system. If this occurs, locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all compounds of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.
8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.
8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:
8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at 100 µg/L or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.1.3 If it is impractical to determine background levels before spiking (e.g., maximum holding times will be exceeded), the spike concentration should be (1) the regulatory concentration limit, if any, or, if none, (2) the larger of either 5 times higher than the expected background concentration or 100 µg/L.
8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second sample aliquot with 1.0 mL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100(A−B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.
8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 3. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1.
8
If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than 100 µg/L, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 3, or optional QC acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of a parameter: (1) Calculate accuracy (X′) using the equation in Table 4, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S′) using the equation in Table 4, substituting X′ for X
; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X′/T)±2.44(100 S′/T)%.
8
8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.
8.4 If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.

# Note:
The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory.
8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 1.0 mL of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 1 L of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.
8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P
s
) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.
8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (P
s
) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 3. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.
8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P
) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (s
p
). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P
−2s
p
to P
+ 2s
p
. If P
= 90% and s
p
= 10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).
8.6. It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When
doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as gas chromatography with a dissimilar column, specific element detector, or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.

# 9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling
9.1 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers. Conventional sampling practices
9
should be followed, except that the bottle must not be prerinsed with sample before collection. Composite samples should be collected in refrigerated glass containers in accordance with the requirements of the program. Automatic sampling equipment must be as free as possible of Tygon tubing and other potential sources of contamination.
9.2 All samples must be iced or refrigerated at 4 °C from the time of collection until extraction. Fill the sample bottles and, if residual chlorine is present, add 80 mg of sodium thiosulfate per liter of sample and mix well. EPA Methods 330.4 and 330.5 may be used for measurement of residual chlorine.
10
Field test kits are available for this purpose.
9.3 All samples must be extracted within 7 days of collection and completely analyzed within 40 days of extraction.

# 10. Sample Extraction
10.1 Mark the water meniscus on the side of sample bottle for later determination of sample volume. Pour the entire sample into a 2-L separatory funnel.
10.2 For samples high in organic content, the analyst may solvent wash the sample at basic pH as prescribed in Sections 10.2.1 and 10.2.2 to remove potential method interferences. Prolonged or exhaustive contact with solvent during the wash may result in low recovery of some of the phenols, notably phenol and 2,4-dimethylphenol. For relatively clean samples, the wash should be omitted and the extraction, beginning with Section 10.3, should be followed.
10.2.1 Adjust the pH of the sample to 12.0 or greater with sodium hydroxide solution.
10.2.2 Add 60 mL of methylene chloride to the sample by shaking the funnel for 1 min with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Discard the solvent layer. The wash can be repeated up to two additional times if significant color is being removed.
10.3 Adjust the sample to a pH of 1 to 2 with sulfuric acid.
10.4 Add 60 mL of methylene chloride to the sample bottle, seal, and shake 30 s to rinse the inner surface. Transfer the solvent to the separatory funnel and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for 2 min. with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Allow the organic layer to separate from the water phase for a minimum of 10 min. If the emulsion interface between layers is more than one-third the volume of the solvent layer, the analyst must employ mechanical techniques to complete the phase separation. The optimum technique depends upon the sample, but may include stirring, filtration of the emulsion through glass wool, centrifugation, or other physical methods. Collect the methylene chloride extract in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.
10.5 Add a second 60-mL volume of methylene chloride to the sample bottle and repeat the extraction procedure a second time, combining the extracts in the Erlenmeyer flask. Perform a third extraction in the same manner.
10.6 Assemble a Kuderna-Danish (K-D) concentrator by attaching a 10-mL concentrator tube to a 500-mL evaporative flask. Other concentration devices or techniques may be used in place of the K-D concentrator if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.
10.7 Pour the combined extract through a solvent-rinsed drying column containing about 10 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and collect the extract in the K-D concentrator. Rinse the Erlenmeyer flask and column with 20 to 30 mL of methylene chloride to complete the quantitative transfer.
10.8 Add one or two clean boiling chips to the evaporative flask and attach a three-ball Snyder column. Prewet the Snyder column by adding about 1 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 °C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water, and the entire lower rounded surface of the flask is bathed with hot vapor. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 15 to 20 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood with condensed solvent. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 1 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.
10.9 Increase the temperature of the hot water bath to 95 to 100 °C. Remove the Synder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of 2-propanol. A 5-mL syringe is recommended for this operation. Attach a two-ball micro-Snyder column to the concentrator tube and prewet the column by adding about 0.5 mL of 2-propanol to the top. Place the micro-K-D apparatus on the water bath so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete concentration in 5 to 10 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will
not flood. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 2.5 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min. Add an additional 2 mL of 2-propanol through the top of the micro-Snyder column and resume concentrating as before. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 0.5 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.
10.10 Remove the micro-Snyder column and rinse its lower joint into the concentrator tube with a minimum amount of 2-propanol. Adjust the extract volume to 1.0 mL. Stopper the concentrator tube and store refrigerated at 4 °C if further processing will not be performed immediately. If the extract will be stored longer than two days, it should be transferred to a Teflon-sealed screw-cap vial. If the sample extract requires no further cleanup, proceed with FIDGC analysis (Section 11). If the sample requires further cleanup, proceed to Section 12.
10.11 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to a 1000-mL graduated cylinder. Record the sample volume to the nearest 5 mL.

# 11. Flame Ionization Detector Gas Chromatography
11.1 Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are retention times and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. An example of the separations achieved by this column is shown in Figure 1. Other packed or capillary (open-tubular) columns, chromatographic conditions, or detectors may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.
11.2 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.
11.3 If the internal standard calibration procedure is used, the internal standard must be added to the sample extract and mixed thoroughly immediately before injection into the gas chromatograph.
11.4 Inject 2 to 5 µL of the sample extract or standard into the gas chromatograph using the solvent-flush technique.
11
Smaller (1.0 µL) volumes may be injected if automatic devices are employed. Record the volume injected to the nearest 0.05 µL, and the resulting peak size in area or peak height units.
11.5 Identify the parameters in the sample by comparing the retention times of the peaks in the sample chromatogram with those of the peaks in standard chromatograms. The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound may be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weigh heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.
11.6 If the response for a peak exceeds the working range of the system, dilute the extract and reanalyze.
11.7 If the measurement of the peak response is prevented by the presence of interferences, an alternative gas chromatographic procedure is required. Section 12 describes a derivatization and column chromatographic procedure which has been tested and found to be a practical means of analyzing phenols in complex extracts.

# 12. Derivatization and Electron Capture Detector Gas Chromatography
12.1 Pipet a 1.0-mL aliquot of the 2-propanol solution of standard or sample extract into a glass reaction vial. Add 1.0 mL of derivatizing reagent (Section 6.11). This amount of reagent is sufficient to derivatize a solution whose total phenolic content does not exceed 0.3 mg/mL.
12.2 Add about 3 mg of potassium carbonate to the solution and shake gently.
12.3 Cap the mixture and heat it for 4 h at 80 °C in a hot water bath.
12.4 Remove the solution from the hot water bath and allow it to cool.
12.5 Add 10 mL of hexane to the reaction flask and shake vigorously for 1 min. Add 3.0 mL of distilled, deionized water to the reaction flask and shake for 2 min. Decant a portion of the organic layer into a concentrator tube and cap with a glass stopper.
12.6 Place 4.0 g of silica gel into a chromatographic column. Tap the column to settle the silica gel and add about 2 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate to the top.
12.7 Preelute the column with 6 mL of hexane. Discard the eluate and just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, pipet onto the column 2.0 mL of the hexane solution (Section 12.5) that contains the derivatized sample or standard. Elute the column with 10.0 mL of hexane and discard the eluate. Elute the column, in order, with: 10.0 mL of 15% toluene in hexane (Fraction 1); 10.0 mL of 40% toluene in hexane (Fraction 2); 10.0 mL of 75% toluene in hexane (Fraction 3); and 10.0 mL of 15% 2-propanol in toluene (Fraction 4). All elution mixtures are prepared on a volume: volume basis. Elution patterns for the phenolic derivatives are shown in Table 2. Fractions may be combined as desired, depending upon the specific phenols of interest or level of interferences.
12.8 Analyze the fractions by ECDGC. Table 2 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are retention times and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. An example of the separations achieved by this column is shown in Figure 2.
12.9 Calibrate the system daily with a minimum of three aliquots of calibration standards, containing each of the phenols of interest that are derivatized according to Section 7.5.
12.10 Inject 2 to 5 µL of the column fractions into the gas chromatograph using the solvent-flush technique. Smaller (1.0 µL) volumes can be injected if automatic devices are employed. Record the volume injected to the nearest 0.05 µL, and the resulting peak size in area or peak height units. If the peak response exceeds the linear range of the system, dilute the extract and reanalyze.

# 13. Calculations
13.1 Determine the concentration of individual compounds in the sample analyzed by FIDGC (without derivatization) as indicated below.
13.1.1 If the external standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the amount of material injected from the peak response using the calibration curve or calibration factor determined in Section 7.2.2. The concentration in the sample can be calculated from Equation 2.

E = Volume of 2-propanol extract carried through derivatization in Section 12.1 (mL).
13.3 Report results in µg/L without correction for recovery data. All QC data obtained should be reported with the sample results.

# 14. Method Performance
14.1 The method detection limit (MDL) is defined as the minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence that the value is above zero.
1
The MDL concentrations listed in Tables 1 and 2 were obtained using reagent water.
12
Similar results were achieved using representative wastewaters. The MDL actually achieved in a given analysis will vary depending on instrument sensitivity and matrix effects.
14.2 This method was tested by 20 laboratories using reagent water, drinking water, surface water, and three industrial wastewaters spiked as six concentrations over the range 12 to 450 µg/L.
13
Single operator precision, overall precision, and method accuracy were found to be directly related to the concentration of the parameter and essentially independent of the sample matrix. Linear equations to describe these relationships for a flame ionization detector are presented in Table 4.

1.2 This is a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method applicable to the determination of the compounds listed above in municipal and industrial discharges as provided under 40 CFR 136.1. When this method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for the compounds above, identifications should be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. This method describes electrochemical conditions at a second potential which can be used to confirm measurements made with this method. Method 625 provides gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative and quantitative confirmation of results for the parameters listed above, using the extract produced by this method.
1.3 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 14.1)
1
for each parameter is
listed in Table 1. The MDL for a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of the interferences in the sample matrix.
1.4 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.
1.5 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of HPLC instrumentation and in the interpretation of liquid chromatograms. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.

# 2. Summary of Method
2.1 A measured volume of sample, approximately 1-L, is extracted with chloroform using liquid-liquid extractions in a separatory funnel. The chloroform extract is extracted with acid. The acid extract is then neutralized and extracted with chloroform. The final chloroform extract is exchanged to methanol while being concentrated using a rotary evaporator. The extract is mixed with buffer and separated by HPLC. The benzidine compounds are measured with an electrochemical detector.

2.2 The acid back-extraction acts as a general purpose cleanup to aid in the elimination of interferences.

# 3. Interferences
3.1 Method interferences may be caused by contaminants in solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware that lead to discrete artifacts and/or elevated baselines in chromatograms. All of these materials must be routinely demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3.
3.1.1 Glassware must be scrupulously cleaned.
3
Clean all glassware as soon as possible after use by rinsing with the last solvent used in it. Solvent rinsing should be followed by detergent washing with hot water, and rinses with tap water and distilled water. The glassware should then be drained dry, and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 °C for 15 to 30 min. Some thermally stable materials may not be eliminated by this treatment. Solvent rinses with acetone and pesticide quality hexane may be substituted for the muffle furnace heating. Volumetric ware should not be heated in a muffle furnace. After drying and cooling, glassware should be sealed and stored in a clean environment to prevent any accumulation of dust or other contaminants. Store inverted or capped with aluminum foil.
3.1.2 The use of high purity reagents and solvents helps to minimize interference problems. Purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.
3.2 Matrix interferences may be caused by contaminants that are co-extracted from the sample. The extent of matrix interferences will vary considerably from source to source, depending upon the nature and diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being sampled. The cleanup procedures that are inherent in the extraction step are used to overcome many of these interferences, but unique samples may require additional cleanup approaches to achieve the MDL listed in Table 1.
3.3 Some dye plant effluents contain large amounts of components with retention times closed to benzidine. In these cases, it has been found useful to reduce the electrode potential in order to eliminate interferences and still detect benzidine. (See Section 12.7.)

# 4. Safety
4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health harzard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified
4 6
for the information of the analyst.
4.2 The following parameters covered by this method have been tentatively classified as known or suspected, human or mammalian carcinogens: benzidine and 3,3′-dichlorobenzidine. Primary standards of these toxic compounds should be prepared in a hood. A NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be worn when the analyst handles high concentrations of these toxic compounds.
4.3 Exposure to chloroform should be minimized by performing all extractions and extract concentrations in a hood or other well-ventiliated area.

# 5. Apparatus and Materials
5.1 Sampling equipment, for discrete or composite sampling.
5.1.1 Grab sample bottle—1-L or 1-qt, amber glass, fitted with a screw cap lined with Teflon. Foil may be substituted for Teflon if the sample is not corrosive. If amber bottles are not available, protect samples from light. The bottle and cap liner must be washed, rinsed with acetone or methylene
chloride, and dried before use to minimize contamination.
5.1.2 Automatic sampler (optional)—The sampler must incorporate glass sample containers for the collection of a minimum of 250 mL of sample. Sample containers must be kept refrigerated at 4 °C and protected from light during compositing. If the sampler uses a peristaltic pump, a minimum length of compressible silicone rubber tubing may be used. Before use, however, the compressible tubing should be thoroughly rinsed with methanol, followed by repeated rinsings with distilled water to minimize the potential for contamination of the sample. An integrating flow meter is required to collect flow proportional composites.
5.2 Glassware (All specifications are suggested):
5.2.1 Separatory funnels—2000, 1000, and 250-mL, with Teflon stopcock.
5.2.2 Vials—10 to 15-mL, amber glass, with Teflon-lined screw cap.
5.2.3 Rotary evaporator.
5.2.4 Flasks—Round bottom, 100-mL, with 24/40 joints.
5.2.5 Centrifuge tubes—Conical, graduated, with Teflon-lined screw caps.
5.2.6 Pipettes—Pasteur, with bulbs.
5.3 Balance—Analytical, capable of accurately weighing 0.0001 g.
5.4 High performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC)—An analytical system complete with column supplies, high pressure syringes, detector, and compatible recorder. A data system is recommended for measuring peak areas and retention times.
5.4.1 Solvent delivery system—With pulse damper, Altex 110A or equivalent.
5.4.2 Injection valve (optional)—Waters U6K or equivalent.
5.4.3 Electrochemical detector—Bioanalytical Systems LC-2A with glassy carbon electrode, or equivalent. This detector has proven effective in the analysis of wastewaters for the parameters listed in the scope (Section 1.1), and was used to develop the method performance statements in Section 14. Guidelines for the use of alternate detectors are provided in Section 12.1.
5.4.4 Electrode polishing kit—Princeton Applied Research Model 9320 or equivalent.
5.4.5 Column—Lichrosorb RP-2, 5 micron particle diameter, in a 25 cm × 4.6 mm ID stainless steel column. This column was used to develop the method performance statements in Section 14. Guidelines for the use of alternate column packings are provided in Section 12.1.

# 6. Reagents
6.1 Reagent water—Reagent water is defined as a water in which an interferent is not observed at the MDL of the parameters of interest.
6.2 Sodium hydroxide solution (5 N)—Dissolve 20 g of NaOH (ACS) in reagent water and dilute to 100 mL.
6.3 Sodium hydroxide solution (1 M)—Dissolve 40 g of NaOH (ACS) in reagent water and dilute to 1 L.
6.4 Sodium thiosulfate—(ACS) Granular.
6.5 Sodium tribasic phosphate (0.4 M)—Dissolve 160 g of trisodium phosphate decahydrate (ACS) in reagent water and dilute to 1 L.
6.6 Sulfuric acid (1 + 1)—Slowly, add 50 mL of H
2
SO
4
(ACS, sp. gr. 1.84) to 50 mL of reagent water.
6.7 Sulfuric acid (1 M)—Slowly, add 58 mL of H
2
SO
4
(ACS, sp. gr. 1.84) to reagent water and dilute to 1 L.
6.8 Acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.7)—Dissolve 5.8 mL of glacial acetic acid (ACS) and 13.6 g of sodium acetate trihydrate (ACS) in reagent water which has been purified by filtration through a RO-4 Millipore System or equivalent and dilute to 1 L.
6.9 Acetonitrile, chloroform (preserved with 1% ethanol), methanol—Pesticide quality or equivalent.
6.10 Mobile phase—Place equal volumes of filtered acetonitrile (Millipore type FH filter or equivalent) and filtered acetate buffer (Millipore type GS filter or equivalent) in a narrow-mouth, glass container and mix thoroughly. Prepare fresh weekly. Degas daily by sonicating under vacuum, by heating and stirring, or by purging with helium.
6.11 Stock standard solutions (1.00 µg/µL)—Stock standard solutions may be prepared from pure standard materials or purchased as certified solutions.
6.11.1 Prepare stock standard solutions by accurately weighing about 0.0100 g of pure material. Dissolve the material in methanol and dilute to volume in a 10-mL volumetric flask. Larger volumes can be used at the convenience of the analyst. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight can be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock standard. Commercially prepared stock standards can be used at any concentration if they are certified by the manufacturer or by an independent source.
6.11.2 Transfer the stock standard solutions into Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottles. Store at 4 °C and protect from light. Stock standard solutions should be checked frequently for signs of degradation or evaporation, especially just prior to preparing calibration standards from them.
6.11.3 Stock standard solutions must be replaced after six months, or sooner if comparison with check standards indicates a problem.
6.12 Quality control check sample concentrate—See Section 8.2.1.

# 7. Calibration
7.1 Establish chromatographic operating conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1. The HPLC system can be calibrated using the external standard technique (Section 7.2) or the internal standard technique (Section 7.3).
7.2 External standard calibration procedure:
7.2.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask and diluting to volume with mobile phase. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 1) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.
7.2.2 Using syringe injections of 5 to 25 µL or a constant volume injection loop, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against the mass injected. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to amount injected (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (
10% relative standard deviation, RSD), linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.
7.3 Internal standard calibration procedure—To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can be suggested that is applicable to all samples.
7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask. To each calibration standard, add a known constant amount of one or more internal standards, and dilute to volume with mobile phase. One of the standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.
7.3.2 Using syringe injections of 5 to 25 µL or a constant volume injection loop, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against concentration for each compound and internal standard. Calculate response factors (RF) for each compound using Equation 1.

# RF = (A

# )(C
is

# (A

Equation 1
where:

A
is
= Response for the internal standard.
C
is
= Concentration of the internal standard (µg/L).
C
s
= Concentration of the parameter to be measured (µg/L).
If the RF value over the working range is a constant (
10% RSD), the RF can be assumed to be invariant and the average RF can be used for calculations. Alternatively, the results can be used to plot a calibration curve of response ratios, A
s
/A
is
, vs. RF.
7.4 The working calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be verified on each working day by the measurement of one or more calibration standards. If the response for any parameter varies from the predicted response by more than ±15%, a new calibration curve must be prepared for that compound. If serious loss of response occurs, polish the electrode and recalibrate.
7.5 Before using any cleanup procedure, the analyst must process a series of calibration standards through the procedure to validate elution patterns and the absence of interferences from the reagents.

# 8. Quality Control
8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.
8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.
8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Sections 10.9, 11.1, and 12.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.
8.1.3 Before processing any samples, the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system and glassware are under control. Each time a set of samples is extracted or reagents are changed, a reagent water blank must be processed as a safeguard against laboratory contamination.
8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.
8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.
8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.
8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.
8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing benzidine and/or 3,3′-dichlorobenzidine at a concentration of 50 µg/mL each in methanol. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.
8.2.2 Using a pipet, prepare QC check samples at a concentration of 50 µg/L by adding 1.00 mL of QC check sample concentrate to each of four 1-L-L aliquots of reagent water.
8.2.3 Analyze the well-mixed QC check samples according to the method beginning in Section 10.
8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X
) in µg/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in µg/L, for each parameter using the four results.
8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X
with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively, found in Table 2. If s and X
for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X
falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter. Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.
8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.
8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:
8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at 50 µg/L or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.1.3 If it is impractical to determine background levels before spiking (e.g., maximum holding times will be exceeded), the spike concentration should be (1) the regulatory concentration limit, if any; or, if none (2) the larger of either 5 times higher than the expected background concentration or 50 µg/L.
8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second sample aliquot with 1.0 mL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100(A−B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.
8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1.
7
If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than 50 µg/L, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 2, or optional QC acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of a parameter: (1) Calculate accuracy (X′) using the equation in Table 3, substituting
the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S′) using the equation in Table 3, substituting X′ for X
; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X′/T)±2.44(100 S′/T)%.
7
8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.
8.4 If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.

# Note:
The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory.
8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 1.0 mL of QC check sample concentrate (Sections 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 1 L of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.
8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P
s
) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.
8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (P
s
) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.
8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P
) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (s
p
). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P
−2s
p
to P
+ 2s
p
. If P
= 90% and s
p
= 10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).
8.6 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as HPLC with a dissimilar column, gas chromatography, or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.

# 9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling
9.1 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers. Conventional sampling practices
8
should be followed, except that the bottle must not be prerinsed with sample before collection. Composite samples should be collected in refrigerated glass containers in accordance with the requirements of the program. Automatic sampling equipment must be as free as possible of Tygon tubing and other potential sources of contamination.
9.2 All samples must be iced or refrigerated at 4 °C and stored in the dark from the time of collection until extraction. Both benzidine and 3,3′-dichlorobenzidine are easily oxidized. Fill the sample bottles and, if residual chlorine is present, add 80 mg of sodium thiosulfate per liter of sample and mix well. EPA Methods 330.4 and 330.5 may be used for measurement of residual chlorine.
9
Field test kits are available for this purpose. After mixing, adjust the pH of the sample to a range of 2 to 7 with sulfuric acid.
9.3 If 1,2-diphenylhydrazine is likely to be present, adjust the pH of the sample to 4.0 ±0.2 to prevent rearrangement to benzidine.
9.4 All samples must be extracted within 7 days of collection. Extracts may be held up to 7 days before analysis, if stored under an inert (oxidant free) atmosphere.
2
The extract should be protected from light.

# 10. Sample Extraction
10.1 Mark the water meniscus on the side of the sample bottle for later determination of sample volume. Pour the entire sample into a 2-L separatory funnel. Check the pH of the sample with wide-range pH paper and adjust to within the range of 6.5 to 7.5 with sodium hydroxide solution or sulfuric acid.
10.2 Add 100 mL of chloroform to the sample bottle, seal, and shake 30 s to rinse the inner surface. (Caution: Handle chloroform in a well ventilated area.) Transfer the solvent to the separatory funnel and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for 2 min with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Allow the organic layer to separate from the water phase for a minimum of 10 min. If the emulsion interface between layers is more than one-third the volume of the solvent layer, the analyst must employ mechanical techniques to complete the phase
separation. The optimum technique depends upon the sample, but may include stirring, filtration of the emulsion through glass wool, centrifugation, or other physical methods. Collect the chloroform extract in a 250-mL separatory funnel.
10.3 Add a 50-mL volume of chloroform to the sample bottle and repeat the extraction procedure a second time, combining the extracts in the separatory funnel. Perform a third extraction in the same manner.
10.4 Separate and discard any aqueous layer remaining in the 250-mL separatory funnel after combining the organic extracts. Add 25 mL of 1 M sulfuric acid and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for 2 min. Transfer the aqueous layer to a 250-mL beaker. Extract with two additional 25-mL portions of 1 M sulfuric acid and combine the acid extracts in the beaker.
10.5 Place a stirbar in the 250-mL beaker and stir the acid extract while carefully adding 5 mL of 0.4 M sodium tribasic phosphate. While monitoring with a pH meter, neutralize the extract to a pH between 6 and 7 by dropwise addition of 5 N sodium hydroxide solution while stirring the solution vigorously. Approximately 25 to 30 mL of 5 N sodium hydroxide solution will be required and it should be added over at least a 2-min period. Do not allow the sample pH to exceed 8.
10.6 Transfer the neutralized extract into a 250-mL separatory funnel. Add 30 mL of chloroform and shake the funnel for 2 min. Allow the phases to separate, and transfer the organic layer to a second 250-mL separatory funnel.
10.7 Extract the aqueous layer with two additional 20-mL aliquots of chloroform as before. Combine the extracts in the 250-mL separatory funnel.
10.8 Add 20 mL of reagent water to the combined organic layers and shake for 30 s.
10.9 Transfer the organic extract into a 100-mL round bottom flask. Add 20 mL of methanol and concentrate to 5 mL with a rotary evaporator at reduced pressure and 35 °C. An aspirator is recommended for use as the source of vacuum. Chill the receiver with ice. This operation requires approximately 10 min. Other concentration techniques may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.
10.10 Using a 9-in. Pasteur pipette, transfer the extract to a 15-mL, conical, screw-cap centrifuge tube. Rinse the flask, including the entire side wall, with 2-mL portions of methanol and combine with the original extract.
10.11 Carefully concentrate the extract to 0.5 mL using a gentle stream of nitrogen while heating in a 30 °C water bath. Dilute to 2 mL with methanol, reconcentrate to 1 mL, and dilute to 5 mL with acetate buffer. Mix the extract thoroughly. Cap the centrifuge tube and store refrigerated and protected from light if further processing will not be performed immediately. If the extract will be stored longer than two days, it should be transferred to a Teflon-sealed screw-cap vial. If the sample extract requires no further cleanup, proceed with HPLC analysis (Section 12). If the sample requires further cleanup, proceed to Section 11.
10.12 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to a 1,000-mL graduated cylinder. Record the sample volume to the nearest 5 mL.

# 11. Cleanup and Separation
11.1 Cleanup procedures may not be necessary for a relatively clean sample matrix. If particular circumstances demand the use of a cleanup procedure, the analyst first must demonstrate that the requirements of Section 8.2 can be met using the method as revised to incorporate the cleanup procedure.

# 12. High Performance Liquid Chromatography
12.1 Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the HPLC. Included in this table are retention times, capacity factors, and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. An example of the separations achieved by this HPLC column is shown in Figure 1. Other HPLC columns, chromatographic conditions, or detectors may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met. When the HPLC is idle, it is advisable to maintain a 0.1 mL/min flow through the column to prolong column life.
12.2 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.
12.3 If the internal standard calibration procedure is being used, the internal standard must be added to the sample extract and mixed thoroughly immediately before injection into the instrument.
12.4 Inject 5 to 25 µL of the sample extract or standard into the HPLC. If constant volume injection loops are not used, record the volume injected to the nearest 0.05 µL, and the resulting peak size in area or peak height units.
12.5 Identify the parameters in the sample by comparing the retention times of the peaks in the sample chromatogram with those of the peaks in standard chromatograms. The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound can be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weigh heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.
12.6 If the response for a peak exceeds the working range of the system, dilute the extract with mobile phase and reanalyze.
12.7 If the measurement of the peak response for benzidine is prevented by the presence of interferences, reduce the electrode potential to + 0.6 V and reanalyze. If the benzidine peak is still obscured by interferences, further cleanup is required.

# 13. Calculations
13.1 Determine the concentration of individual compounds in the sample.
13.1.1 If the external standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the amount of material injected from the peak response using the calibration curve or calibration factor determined in Section 7.2.2. The concentration in the sample can be calculated from Equation 2.

13.2 Report results in µg/L without correction for recovery data. All QC data obtained should be reported with the sample results.

# 14. Method Performance
14.1 The method detection limit (MDL) is defined as the minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence that the value is above zero.
1
The MDL concentrations listed in Table 1 were obtained using reagent water.
10
Similar results were achieved using representative wastewaters. The MDL actually achieved in a given analysis will vary depending on instrument sensitivity and matrix effects.
14.2 This method has been tested for linearity of spike recovery from reagent water and has been demonstrated to be applicable over the concentration range from 7 × MDL to 3000 × MDL.
10
14.3 This method was tested by 17 laboratories using reagent water, drinking water, surface water, and three industrial wastewaters spiked at six concentrations over the range 1.0 to 70 µg/L.
11
Single operator precision, overall precision, and method accuracy were found to be directly related to the concentration of the parameter and essentially independent of the sample matrix. Linear equations to describe these relationships are presented in Table 3.

1.2 This is a gas chromatographic (GC) method applicable to the determination of the compounds listed above in municipal and industrial discharges as provided under 40 CFR 136.1. When this method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for any or all of the compounds above, compound identifications should be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. This method describes analytical conditions for a second gas chromatographic column that can be used to confirm measurements made with the primary column. Method 625 provides gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative and quantitative confirmation of results for all of the parameters listed above, using the extract produced by this method.
1.3 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 14.1)
1
for each parameter is listed in Table 1. The MDL for a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.
1.4 The sample extraction and concentration steps in this method are essentially the same as in Methods 608, 609, 611, and 612. Thus, a single sample may be extracted to measure the parameters included in the scope of each of these methods. When cleanup is required, the concentration levels must be high enough to permit selecting aliquots, as necessary, to apply appropriate cleanup procedures. The analyst is allowed the latitude, under Section 12, to select chromatographic conditions appropriate for the simultaneous measurement of combinations of these parameters.
1.5 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.
1.6 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of a gas chromatograph and in the interpretation of gas chromatograms. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.

# 2. Summary of Method
2.1 A measured volume of sample, approximately 1-L, is extracted with methylene chloride using a separatory funnel. The methylene chloride extract is dried and exchanged to hexane during concentration to a volume of 10 mL or less. The extract is separated by gas chromatography and the phthalate esters are then measured with an electron capture detector.
2
2.2 Analysis for phthalates is especially complicated by their ubiquitous occurrence in the environment. The method provides Florisil and alumina column cleanup procedures to aid in the elimination of interferences that may be encountered.

# 3. Interferences
3.1 Method interferences may be caused by contaminants in solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware that lead to discrete artifacts and/or elevated baselines in gas chromatograms. All of these materials must be routinely demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3.
3.1.1 Glassware must be scrupulously cleaned.
3
Clean all glassware as soon as possible after use by rinsing with the last solvent used in it. Solvent rinsing should be followed by detergent washing with hot water, and rinses with tap water and distilled water. The glassware should then be drained dry, and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 °C for 15 to 30 min. Some thermally stable materials, such as PCBs, may not be eliminated by this treatment. Solvent rinses with acetone and pesticide quality hexane may be substituted for the muffle furnace heating. Thorough rinsing with such solvents usually eliminates PCB interference. Volumetric ware should not be heated in a muffle furnace. After drying and cooling, glassware should be sealed and stored in a clean environment to prevent any accumulation of dust or other contaminants. Store inverted or capped with aluminum foil.
3.1.2 The use of high purity reagents and solvents helps to minimize interference problems. Purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.
3.2 Phthalate esters are contaminants in many products commonly found in the laboratory. It is particularly important to avoid the use of plastics because phthalates are commonly used as plasticizers and are easily extracted from plastic materials. Serious phthalate contamination can result at any time, if consistent quality control is not practiced. Great care must be experienced to prevent such contamination. Exhaustive cleanup of reagents and glassware may be required to eliminate background phthalate contamination.
4 5
3.3 Matrix interferences may be caused by contaminants that are co-extracted from the sample. The extent of matrix interferences will vary considerably from source to source, depending upon the nature and diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being sampled. The cleanup procedures in Section 11 can be used to overcome many of these interferences, but unique samples may require additional cleanup approaches to achieve the MDL listed in Table 1.

# 4. Safety
4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified
6 8
for the information of the analyst.

# 5. Apparatus and Materials
5.1 Sampling equipment, for discrete or composite sampling.
5.1.1 Grab sample bottle—1-L or 1-qt, amber glass, fitted with a screw cap lined with Teflon. Foil may be substituted for Teflon if the sample is not corrosive. If amber bottles are not available, protect samples from light. The bottle and cap liner must be washed, rinsed with acetone or methylene chloride, and dried before use to minimize contamination.
5.1.2 Automatic sampler (optional)—The sampler must incorporate glass sample containers for the collection of a minimum of 250 mL of sample. Sample containers must be kept refrigerated at 4 °C and protected from light during compositing. If the sampler uses a peristaltic pump, a minimum length of compressible silicone rubber tubing may be used. Before use, however, the compressible tubing should be thoroughly rinsed with methanol, followed by repeated rinsings with distilled water to minimize the potential for contamination of the sample. An integrating flow meter is required to collect flow proportional composites.
5.2 Glassware (All specifications are suggested. Catalog numbers are included for illustration only).
5.2.1 Separatory funnel—2-L, with Teflon stopcock.
5.2.2 Drying column—Chromatographic column, approximately 400 mm long × 19 mm ID, with coarse frit filter disc.
5.2.3 Chromatographic column—300 mm long × 10 mm ID, with Teflon stopcock and coarse frit filter disc at bottom (Kontes K-420540-0213 or equivalent).
5.2.4 Concentrator tube, Kuderna-Danish—10-mL, graduated (Kontes K-570050-1025 or equivalent). Calibration must be checked at the volumes employed in the test. Ground glass stopper is used to prevent evaporation of extracts.

5.6 Gas chromatograph—An analytical system complete with gas chromatograph suitable for on-column injection and all required accessories including syringes, analytical columns, gases, detector, and strip-chart recorder. A data system is recommended for measuring peak areas.
5.6.1 Column 1—1.8 m long × 4 mm ID glass, packed with 1.5% SP-2250/1.95% SP-2401 Supelcoport (100/120 mesh) or equivalent. This column was used to develop the method performance statemelts in Section 14. Guidelines for the use of alternate column packings are provided in Section 12.1.
5.6.2 Column 2—1.8 m long × 4 mm ID glass, packed with 3% OV-1 on Supelcoport (100/120 mesh) or equivalent.
5.6.3 Detector—Electron capture detector. This detector has proven effective in the analysis of wastewaters for the parameters listed in the scope (Section 1.1), and was used to develop the method performance statements in Section 14. Guidelines for the use of alternate detectors are provided in Section 12.1.

# 6. Reagents
6.1 Reagent water—Reagent water is defined as a water in which an interferent is not observed at the MDL of the parameters of interest.
6.2 Acetone, hexane, isooctane, methylene chloride, methanol—Pesticide quality or equivalent.
6.3 Ethyl ether—nanograde, redistilled in glass if necessary.
6.3.1 Ethyl ether must be shown to be free of peroxides before it is used as indicated by
EM Laboratories Quant test strips. (Available from Scientific Products Co., Cat. No. P1126-8, and other suppliers.)
6.3.2 Procedures recommended for removal of peroxides are provided with the test strips. After cleanup, 20 mL of ethyl alcohol preservative must be added to each liter of ether.
6.4 Sodium sulfate—(ACS) Granular, anhydrous. Several levels of purification may be required in order to reduce background phthalate levels to an acceptable level: 1) Heat 4 h at 400 °C in a shallow tray, 2) Heat 16 h at 450 to 500 °C in a shallow tray, 3) Soxhlet extract with methylene chloride for 48 h.
6.5 Florisil—PR grade (60/100 mesh). Purchase activated at 1250 °F and store in the dark in glass containers with ground glass stoppers or foil-lined screw caps. To prepare for use, place 100 g of Florisil into a 500-mL beaker and heat for approximately 16 h at 40 °C. After heating transfer to a 500-mL reagent bottle. Tightly seal and cool to room temperature. When cool add 3 mL of reagent water. Mix thoroughly by shaking or rolling for 10 min and let it stand for at least 2 h. Keep the bottle sealed tightly.
6.6 Alumina—Neutral activity Super I, W200 series (ICN Life Sciences Group, No. 404583). To prepare for use, place 100 g of alumina into a 500-mL beaker and heat for approximately 16 h at 400 °C. After heating transfer to a 500-mL reagent bottle. Tightly seal and cool to room temperature. When cool add 3 mL of reagent water. Mix thoroughly by shaking or rolling for 10 min and let it stand for at least 2 h. Keep the bottle sealed tightly.
6.7 Stock standard solutions (1.00 µg/µL)—Stock standard solutions can be prepared from pure standard materials or purchased as certified solutions.
6.7.1 Prepare stock standard solutions by accurately weighing about 0.0100 g of pure material. Dissolve the material in isooctane and dilute to volume in a 10-mL volumetric flask. Larger volumes can be used at the convenience of the analyst. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight can be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock standard. Commercially prepared stock standards can be used at any concentration if they are certified by the manufacturer or by an independent source.
6.7.2 Transfer the stock standard solutions into Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottles. Store at 4 °C and protect from light. Stock standard solutions should be checked frequently for signs of degradation or evaporation, especially just prior to preparing calibration standards from them.
6.7.3 Stock standard solutions must be replaced after six months, or sooner if comparison with check standards indicates a problem.
6.8 Quality control check sample concentrate—See Section 8.2.1.

# 7. Calibration
7.1 Establish gas chromatograph operating conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1. The gas chromatographic system can be calibrated using the external standard technique (Section 7.2) or the internal standard technique (Section 7.3).
7.2 External standard calibration procedure:
7.2.1 Prepared calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask and diluting to volume with isooctane. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 1) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.
7.2.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 µL, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against the mass injected. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to amount injected (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (
10% relative standard deviation, RSD), linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.
7.3 Internal standard calibration procedure—To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can be suggested that is applicable to all samples.
7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flash. To each calibration standard, add a known constant amount of one or more internal standards, and dilute to volume with isooctane. One of the standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.
7.3.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 µL, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against concentration for each compound and internal standard. Calculate response factors (RF) for each compound using Equation 1.

# RF = (A

7.4 The working calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be verified on each working day by the measurement of one or more calibration standards. If the response for any parameter varies from the predicted response by more than ±15%, a new calibration curve must be prepared for that compound.
7.5 Before using any cleanup procedure, the analyst must process a series of calibration standards through the procedure to validate elution patterns and the absence of interferences from the reagents.

# 8. Quality Control
8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.
8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.
8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Sections 10.4, 11.1, and 12.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.
8.1.3 Before processing any samples, the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system and glassware are under control. Each time a set of samples is extracted or reagents are changed, a reagent water blank must be processed as a safeguard against laboratory contamination.
8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.
8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.
8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.
8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.
8.2.1 A quality contrml (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each parameter of interest at the following concentrations in acetone: butyl benzyl phthalate, 10 µg/mL; bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, 50 µg/mL; di-n-octyl phthalate, 50 µg/mL; any other phthlate, 25 µg/mL. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agancy, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.
8.2.2 Using a pipet, prepare QC check samples at the test concentrations shown in Table 2 by adding 1.00 mL of QC check sample concentrate to each of four 1-L aliquots of reagent water.
8.2.3 Analyze the well-mixed QC check samples according to the method beginning in Section 10.
8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X
) in µg/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in µg/L, for each parameter using the four results.
8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X
with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively,
found in Table 2. If s and X
for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X
falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter. Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.
8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.
8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:
8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at the test concentration in Section 8.2.2 or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.1.3 If it is impractical to determine background levels before spiking (e.g., maximum holding times will be exceeded), the spike concentration should be (1) the regulatory concentration limit, if any; or, if none (2) the larger of either 5 times higher than the expected background concentration or the test concentration in Section 8.2.2.
8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second sample aliquot with 1.0 mL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100(A-B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.
8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1.
9
If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than the test concentration in Section 8.2.2, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 2, or optional QC acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of a parameter: (1) Calculate accuracy (X′) using the equation in Table 3, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S′) using the equation in Table 3, substituting X′ for X
; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X′/T)±2.44(100 S′/T)%.
9
8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.
8.4 If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.

# Note:
The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory.
8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 1.0 mL of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 1 L of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.
8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P
s
) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.
8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (P
s
) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.
8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P
) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (s
p
). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P
−2s
p
to P
+ 2s
p
. If P
= 90% and s
p
= 10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).
8.6 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as gas chromatography with a dissimilar column, specific element detector, or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.

# 9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling
9.1 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers. Conventional sampling practices
10
should be followed, except that the bottle must not be prerinsed with sample before collection. Composite samples should be collected in refrigerated glass containers in accordance with the requirements of the program. Automatic sampling equipment must be as free as possible of Tygon tubing and other potential sources of contamination.
9.2 All samples must be iced or refrigerated at 4 °C from the time of collection until extraction.
9.3 All samples must be extracted within 7 days of collection and completely analyzed within 40 days of extraction.

# 10. Sample Extraction
10.1 Mark the water meniscus on the side of the sample bottle for later determination of sample volume. Pour the entire sample into a 2-L separatory funnel.
10.2 Add 60 mL of methylene chloride to the sample bottle, seal, and shake 30 s to rinse the inner surface. Transfer the solvent to the separatory funnel and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for 2 min. with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Allow the organic layer to separate from the water phase for a minimum of 10 min. If the emulsion interface between layers is more than one-third the volume of the solvent layer, the analyst must employ mechanical techniques to complete the phrase separation. The optimum technique depends upon the sample, but may include stirring, filtration of the emulsion through glass wool, centrifugation, or other physical methods. Collect the methylene chloride extract in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.
10.3 Add a second 60-mL volume of methylene chloride to the sample bottle and repeat the extraction procedure a second time, combining the extracts in the Erlenmeyer flask. Perform a third extraction in the same manner.
10.4 Assemble a Kuderna-Danish (K-D) concentrator by attaching a 10-mL concentrator tube to a 500-mL evaporative flask. Other concentrator devices or techniques may be used in place of the K-D concentrator if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.
10.5 Pour the combined extract through a solvent-rinsed drying column containing about 10 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and collect the extract in the K-D concentrator. Rinse the Erlenmeyer flask and column with 20 to 30 mL of methylene chloride to complete the quantitative transfer.
10.6 Add one or two clean boiling chips to the evaporative flask and attach a three-ball Snyder column. Prewet the Snyder column by adding about 1 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 °C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water, and the entire lower rounded surface of the flask is bathed with hot vapor. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 15 to 20 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood with condensed solvent. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 1 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.
10.7 Increase the temperature of the hot water bath to about 80 °C. Momentarily remove the Snyder column, add 50 mL of hexane and a new boiling chip, and reattach the Snyder column. Concentrate the extract as in Section 10.6, except use hexane to prewet the column. The elapsed time of concentration should be 5 to 10 min.
10.8 Remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of hexane. A 5-mL syringe is recommended for this operation. Adjust the extract volume to 10 mL. Stopper the concentrator tube and store refrigerated if further processing will not be performed immediately. If the extract will be stored longer than two days, it should be transferred to a Teflon-sealed screw-cap vial. If the sample extract requires no further cleanup, proceed with gas chromatographic analysis (Section 12). If the sample requires further cleanup, proceed to Section 11.
10.9 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to a 1000-mL graduated cylinder. Record the sample volume to the nearest 5 mL.

# 11. Cleanup and Separation
11. Cleanup procedures may not be necessary for a relatively clean sample matrix. If particular circumstances demand the use of a cleanup procedure, the analyst may use either procedure below or any other appropriate procedure. However, the analyst first must demonstrate that the requirements of
Section 8.2 can be met using the method as revised to incorporate the cleanup procedure.
11.2 If the entire extract is to be cleaned up by one of the following procedures, it must be concentrated to 2.0 mL. To the concentrator tube in Section 10.8, add a clean boiling chip and attach a two-ball micro-Snyder column. Prewet the column by adding about 0.5 mL of hexane to the top. Place the micro-K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (80 °C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 5 to 10 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches about 0.5 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min. Remove the micro-Snyder column and rinse its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 0.2 mL of hexane. Adjust the final volume to 2.0 mL and proceed with one of the following cleanup procedures.
11.3 Florisil column cleanup for phthalate esters:
11.3.1 Place 10 g of Florisil into a chromatographic column. Tap the column to settle the Florisil and add 1 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate to the top.
11.3.2 Preelute the column with 40 mL of hexane. The rate for all elutions should be about 2 mL/min. Discard the eluate and just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, quantitatively transfer the 2-mL sample extract onto the column using an additional 2 mL of hexane to complete the transfer. Just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, add 40 mL of hexane and continue the elution of the column. Discard this hexane eluate.
11.3.3 Next, elute the column with 100 mL of 20% ethyl ether in hexane (V/V) into a 500-mL K-D flask equipped with a 10-mL concentrator tube. Concentrate the collected fraction as in Section 10.6. No solvent exchange is necessary. Adjust the volume of the cleaned up extract to 10 mL in the concentrator tube and analyze by gas chromatography (Section 12).
11.4 Alumina column cleanup for phthalate esters:
11.4.1 Place 10 g of alumina into a chromatographic column. Tap the column to settle the alumina and add 1 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate to the top.
11.4.2 Preelute the column with 40 mL of hexane. The rate for all elutions should be about 2 mL/min. Discard the eluate and just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, quantitatively transfer the 2-mL sample extract onto the column using an additional 2 mL of hexane to complete the transfer. Just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, add 35 mL of hexane and continue the elution of the column. Discard this hexane eluate.
11.4.3 Next, elute the column with 140 mL of 20% ethyl ether in hexane (V/V) into a 500-mL K-D flask equipped with a 10-mL concentrator type. Concentrate the collected fraction as in Section 10.6. No solvent exchange is necessary. Adjust the volume of the cleaned up extract to 10 mL in the concentrator tube and analyze by gas chromatography (Section 12).

# 12. Gas Chromatography
12.1 Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are retention times and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. Examples of the separations achieved by Column 1 are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Other packed or capillary (open-tubular) columns, chromatographic conditions, or detectors may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.
12.2 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.
12.3 If the internal standard calibration procedure is being used, the internal staldard must be added to the sample extract and mixed thoroughly immediately before injection into the gas chromatograph.
12.4 Inject 2 to 5 µL of the sample extract or standard into the gas-chromatograph using the solvent-flush technique.
11
Smaller (1.0 µL) volumes may be injected if automatic devices are employed. Record the volume injected to the nearest 0.05 µL, and the resulting peak size in area or peak height units.
12.5 Identify the parameters in the sample by comparing the retention times of the peaks in the sample chromatogram with those of the peaks in standard chromatograms. The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound can be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weigh heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.
12.6 If the response for a peak exceeds the working range of the system, dilute the extract and reanalyze.
12.7 If the measurement of the peak response is prevented by the presence of interferences, further cleanup is required.

# 13. Calculations
13.1 Determine the concentration of individual compounds in the sample.
13.1.1 If the external standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the amount of material injected from the peak response using the calibration curve or calibration
factor determined in Section 7.2.2. The concentration in the sample can be calculated from Equation 2.
EC15NO91.103

where:
A = Amount of material injected (ng).
V
i
= Volume of extract injected (µL).
V
t
= Volume of total extract (µL).

where:

= Amount of internal standard added to each extract (µg).
V

= Volume of water extracted (L).
13.2 Report results in µg/L without correction for recovery data. All QC data obtained should be reported with the sample results.

# 14. Method Performance
14.1 The method detection limit (MDL) is defined as the minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence that the value is above zero.
1
The MDL concentrations listed in Table 1 were obtained using reagent water.
12
Similar results were achieved using representative wastewaters. The MDL actually achieved in a given analysis will vary depending on instrument sensitivity and matrix effects.
14.2 This method has been tested for linearity of spike recovery from reagent water and has been demonstrated to be applicable over the concentration range from 5 × MDL to 1000 × MDL with the following exceptions: dimethyl and diethyl phthalate recoveries at 1000 × MDL were low (70%); bis-2-ethylhexyl and di-n-octyl phthalate recoveries at 5 × MDL were low (60%).
12
14.3 This method was tested by 16 laboratories using reagent water, drinking water, surface water, and three industrial wastewaters spiked at six concentrations over the range 0.7 to 106 µg/L.
13
Single operator precision, overall precision, and method accuracy were found to be directly related to the concentration of the parameter and essentially independent of the sample matrix. Linear equations to describe these relationships are presented in Table 3.

# Method 607—Nitrosamines
Pt. 136, App. A, Meth. 607

# 1. Scope and Application
1.1 This method covers the determination of certain nitrosamines. The following parameters can be determined by this method:
Parameter
Storet No.
CAS No.
N-Nitrosodimethylamine
34438
62-75-9
N-Nitrosodiphenylamine
34433
86-30-6
N-Nitrosodi-n-propylamine
34428
621-64-7
1.2 This is a gas chromatographic (GC) method applicable to the determination of the parameters listed above in municipal and industrial discharges as provided under 40 CFR 136.1. When this method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for any or all of the compmunds above, compound identifications should be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. This method describes analytical conditimns for a second gas chromatographic column that can be used to confirm measurements made with the primary column. Method 625 provides gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative and quantitative confirmation of results for N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine. In order to confirm the presence of N-nitrosodiphenylamine, the cleanup procedure specified in Section 11.3 or 11.4 must be used. In order to confirm the presence of N-nitrosodimethylamine by GC/MS, Column 1 of this method must be substituted for the column recommended in Method 625. Confirmation of these parameters using GC-high resolution mass spectrometry or a Thermal Energy Analyzer is also recommended.
1 2
1.3 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 14.1)
3
for each parameter is listed in Table 1. The MDL for a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.
1.4 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.
1.5 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of a gas chromatograph and in the interpretation of gas chromatograms. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.

# 2. Summary of Method
2.1 A measured volume of sample, approximately 1-L, is extracted with methylene chloride using a separatory funnel. The methylene chloride extract is washed with dilute hydrochloric acid to remove free amines, dried, and concentrated to a volume of 10 mL or less. After the extract has been exchanged to methanol, it is separated by gas chromatography and the parameters are then measured with a nitrogen-phosphorus detector.
4
2.2 The method provides Florisil and alumina column cleanup procedures to separate diphenylamine from the nitrosamines and to aid in the elimination of interferences that may be encountered.

# 3. Interferences
3.1 Method interferences may be caused by contaminants in solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware that lead to discrete artifacts and/or elevated baselines in gas chromatograms. All of these materials must be routinely demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3.
3.1.1 Glassware must be scrupulously cleaned.
5
Clean all glassware as soon as possible after use by rinsing with the last solvent used in it. Solvent rinsing should be followed by detergent washing with hot water, and rinses with tap water and distilled water. The glassware should then be drained dry, and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 °C for 15 to 30 min. Solvent rinses with acetone and pesticide quality hexane may be substituted for the muffle furnace heating. Volumetric ware should not be heated in a muffle furnace. After drying and cooling, glassware should be sealed and stored in a clean environment to prevent any accumulation of dust or other contaminants. Store inverted or capped with aluminum foil.
3.1.2 The use of high purity reagents and solvents helps to minimize interference problems. Purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.
3.2 Matrix interferences may be caused by contaminants that are co-extracted from the sample. The extent of matrix interferences will vary considerably from source to source, depending upon the nature and diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being sampled. The cleanup procedures in Section 11 can be used to overcome many of these interferences, but unique samples may require additional cleanup approaches to achieve the MDL listed in Table 1.
3.3 N-Nitrosodiphenylamine is reported
6-9
to undergo transnitrosation reactions. Care must be exercised in the heating or concentrating of solutions containing this compound in the presence of reactive amines.
3.4 The sensitive and selective Thermal Energy Analyzer and the reductive Hall detector may be used in place of the nitrogen-phosphorus detector when interferences are encountered. The Thermal Energy Analyzer offers the highest selectivity of the non-MS detectors.

# 4. Safety
4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified
10-12
for the information of the analyst.
4.2 These nitrosamines are known carcinogens,
13-17
therefore, utmost care must be exercised in the handling of these materials. Nitrosamine reference standards and standard solutions should be handled and prepared in a ventilated glove box within a properly ventilated room.

# 5. Apparatus and Materials
5.1 Sampling equipment, for discrete or composite sampling.
5.1.1 Grab sample bottle—1-L or 1-qt, amber glass, fitted with a screw cap lined with Teflon. Foil may be substituted for Teflon if the sample is not corrosive. If amber bottles are not available, protect samples from light. The bottle and cap liner must be washed, rinsed with acetone or methylene chloride, and dried before use to minimize contamination.
5.1.2 Automatic sampler (optional)—The sampler must incorporate glass sample containers for the collection of a minimum of 250 mL of sample. Sample containers must be kept refrigerated at 4 °C and protected from light during compositing. If the sampler uses a peristaltic pump, a minimum length of compressible silicone rubber tubing may be used. Before use, however, the compressible tubing should be thoroughly rinsed with methanol, followed by repeated rinsings with distilled water to minimize the potential for contamination of the sample. An integrating flowmeter is required to collect flow proportional composites.

6.2 Sodium hydroxide solution (10 N)—Dissolve 40 g of NaOH (ACS) in reagent water and dilute to 100 ml.
6.3 Sodium thiosulfate—(ACS) Granular.
6.4 Sulfuric acid (1 + 1)—Slowly, add 50 mL of H
2
SO
4
(ACS, sp. gr. 1.84) to 50 mL of reagent water.
6.5 Sodium sulfate—(ACS) Granular, anhydrous. Purify by heating at 400 °C for 4 h in a shallow tray.
6.6 Hydrochloric acid (1 + 9)—Add one volume of concentrated HCl (ACS) to nine volumes of reagent water.
6.7 Acetone, methanol, methylene chloride, pentane—Pesticide quality or equivalent.
6.8 Ethyl ether—Nanograde, redistilled in glass if necessary.
6.8.1 Ethyl ether must be shown to be free of peroxides before it is used as indicated by EM Laboratories Quant test strips. (Available from Scientific Products Co., Cat No. P1126-8, and other suppliers.)
6.8.2 Procedures recommended for removal of peroxides are provided with the test strips. After cleanup, 20 mL of ethyl alcohol preservative must be added to each liter of ether.
6.9 Florisil—PR grade (60/100 mesh). Purchase activated at 1250 °F and store in the dark in glass containers with ground glass stoppers or foil-lined screw caps. Before use, activate each batch at least 16 h at 130 °C in a foil-covered glass container and allow to cool.
6.10 Alumina—Basic activity Super I, W200 series (ICN Life Sciences Group, No. 404571, or equivalent). To prepare for use, place 100 g of alumina into a 500-mL reagent bottle and add 2 mL of reagent water. Mix the alumina preparation thoroughly by shaking or rolling for 10 min and let it stand for at least 2 h. The preparation should be homogeneous before use. Keep the bottle sealed tightly to ensure proper activity.
6.11 Stock standard solutions (1.00 µg/µL)—Stock standard solutions can be prepared from pure standard materials or purchased as certified solutions.
6.11.1 Prepare stock standard solutions by accurately weighing about 0.0100 g of pure material. Dissolve the material in methanol and dilute to volume in a 10-mL volumetric flask. Larger volumes can be used at the convenience of the analyst. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight can be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock standard. Commercially prepared stock standards can be used at any concentration if they are certified by the manufacturer or by an independent source.
6.11.2 Transfer the stock standard solutions into Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottles. Store at 4 °C and protect from light. Stock standard solutions should be checked frequently for signs of degradation or evaporation, especially just prior to preparing calibration standards from them.
6.11.3 Stock standard solutions must be replaced after six months, or sooner if comparison with check standards indicates a problem.
6.12 Quality control check sample concentrate—See Section 8.2.1.

# 7. Calibration
7.1 Establish gas chromatographic operating conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1. The gas chromatographic system can be calibrated using the external standard technique (Section 7.2) or the internal standard technique (Section 7.3).
7.2 External standard calibration procedure:
7.2.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask and diluting to volume with methanol. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 1) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.
7.2.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 µL, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against the mass injected. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to amount injected (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (
10% relative standard deviation, RSD), linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.
7.3 Internal standard calibration procedure—To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can be suggested that is applicable to all samples.
7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask. To each calibration standard, add a known constant amount of one or more internal standards, and dilute to volume with methanol. One of the standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.
7.3.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 µL, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against concentration for each compound and internal standard. Calculate response factors (RF) for each compound using Equation 1.

# RF = (A
s

# )(C
is

# (A
is

# )(C

# )
Equation 1
where:
A

A
is
= Response for the internal standard.
C
is
= Concentration of the internal standard (µg/L).
C
s
= Concentration of the parameter to be measured (µg/L).
If the RF value over the working range is a constant (
10% RSD), the RF can be assumed to be invariant and the average RF can be used for calculations. Alternatively, the results can be used to plot a calibration curve of response ratios, A
s
/A
is
, vs. RF.
7.4 The working calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be verified on each working day by the measurement of one or more calibration standards. If the response for any parameter varies from the predicted response by more than ±15%, a new calibration curve must be prepared for that compound.
7.5 Before using any cleanup procedure, the analyst must process a series of calibration standards through the procedure to validate elution patterns and the absence of interferences from the reagents.

# 8. Quality Control
8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.
8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.
8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Sections 10.4, 11.1, and 12.2) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.
8.1.3 Before processing any samples, the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system and glassware are under control. Each time a set of samples is extracted or reagents are changed, a reagent water blank must be processed as a safeguard against laboratory contamination.
8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.
8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.
8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.
8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.
8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each parameter of interest at a concentration of 20 µg/mL in methanol. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.
8.2.2 Using a pipet, prepare QC check samples at a concentration of 20 µg/L by adding 1.00 mL of QC check sample concentrate to each of four 1-L aliquots of reagent water.
8.2.3 Analyze the well-mixed QC check samples according to the method beginning in Section 10.
8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X
) in µg/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in µg/L, for each parameter using the four results.
8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X
with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively, found in Table 2. If s and X
for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If
any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X
falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter. Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.
8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.
8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:
8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at 20 µg/L or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.1.3 If it is impractical to determine background levels before spiking (e.g., maximum holding times will be exceeded), the spike concentration should be (1) the regulatory concentration limit, if any; or, if none (2) the larger of either 5 times higher than the expected background concentration or 20 µg/L.
8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second sample aliquot with 1.0 mL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100(A−B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.
8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. These acceptance criteria were caluclated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1.
18
If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than 20 µg/L, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 2, or optional QC acceptance criteria caluclated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of a parameter: (1) Calculate accuracy (X′) using the equation in Table 3, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S′) using the equation in Table 3, substituting X′ for X
; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X′/T) ±2.44(100 S′/T)%.
18
8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.
8.4 If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.

# Note:
The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory.
8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 1.0 mL of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 1 L of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.
8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P
s
) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.
8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (P
s
) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.
8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P
) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (s
p
). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P
−2s
p
to P
+ 2s
p
. If P
= 90% and s
p
= 10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).
8.6 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of
the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as gas chromatography with a dissimilar column, specific element detector, or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.

# 9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling
9.1 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers. Conventional sampling practices
19
should be followed, except that the bottle must not be prerinsed with sample before collection. Composite samples should be collected in refrigerated glass containers in accordance with the requirements of the program. Automatic sampling equipment must be as free as possible of Tygon tubing and other potential sources of contamination.
9.2 All samples must be iced or refrigerated at 4 °C from the time of collection until extraction. Fill the sample bottles and, if residual chlorine is present, add 80 mg of sodium thiosulfate per liter of sample and mix well. EPA Methods 330.4 and 330.5 may be used for measurement of residual chlorine.
20
Field test kits are available for this purpose. If N-nitrosodiphenylamine is to be determined, adjust the sample pH to 7 to 10 with sodium hydroxide solution or sulfuric acid.
9.3 All samples must be extracted within 7 days of collection and completely analyzed within 40 days of extraction.
4
9.4 Nitrosamines are known to be light sensitive.
7
Samples should be stored in amber or foil-wrapped bottles in order to minimize photolytic decomposition.

# 10. Sample Extraction
10.1 Mark the water meniscus on the side of the sample bottle for later determination of sample volume. Pour the entire sample into a 2-L separatory funnel. Check the pH of the sample with wide-range pH paper and adjust to within the range of 5 to 9 with sodium hydroxide solution or sulfuric acid.
10.2 Add 60 mL of methylene chloride to the sample bottle, seal, and shake 30 s to rinse the inner surface. Transfer the solvent to the separatory funnel and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for 2 min with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Allow the organic layer to separate from the water phase for a minimum of 10 min. If the emulsion interface between layers is more than one-third the volume of the solvent layer, the analyst must employ mechanical techniques to complete the phase separation. The optimum technique depends upon the sample, but may include stirring, filtration of the emulsion through glass wool, centrifugation, or other physical methods. Collect the methylene chloride extract in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.
10.3 Add a second 60-mL volume of methylene chloride to the sample bottle and repeat the extraction procedure a second time, combining the extracts in the Erlenmeyer flask. Perform a third extraction in the same manner.
10.4 Assemble a Kuderna-Danish (K-D) concentrator by attaching a 10-mL concentrator tube to a 500-mL evaporative flask. Other concentration devices or techniques may be used in place of the K-D concentrator if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.
10.5 Add 10 mL of hydrochloric acid to the combined extracts and shake for 2 min. Allow the layers to separate. Pour the combined extract through a solvent-rinsed drying column containing about 10 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and collect the extract in the K-D concentrator. Rinse the Erlenmeyer flask and column with 20 to 30 mL of methylene chloride to complete the quantitative transfer.
10.6 Add one or two clean boiling chips to the evaporative flask and attach a three-ball Snyder column. Prewet the Snyder column by adding about 1 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 °C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water, and the entire lower rounded surface of the flask is bathed with hot vapor. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 15 to 20 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood with condensed solvent. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 1 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.
10.7 Remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of methylene chloride. A 5-mL syringe is recommended for this operation. Stopper the concentrator tube and store refrigerated if further processing will not be performed immediately. If the extract will be stored longer than two days, it should be transferred to a Teflon-sealed screw-cap vial. If N-nitrosodiphenylamine is to be measured by gas chromatography, the analyst must first use a cleanup column to eliminate diphenylamine interference (Section 11). If N-nitrosodiphenylamine is of no interest, the analyst may proceed directly with gas chromatographic analysis (Section 12).
10.8 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to a 1000-
mL graduated cylinder. Record the sample volume to the nearest 5 mL.

# 11. Cleanup and Separation
11.1 Cleanup procedures may not be necessary for a relatively clean sample matrix. If particular circumstances demand the use of a cleanup procedure, the analyst may use either procedure below or any other appropriate procedure. However, the analyst first must demonstrate that the requirements of Section 8.2 can be met using the method as revised to incorporate the cleanup procedure. Diphenylamine, if present in the original sample extract, must be separated from the nitrosamines if N-nitrosodiphenylamine is to be determined by this method.
11.2 If the entire extract is to be cleaned up by one of the following procedures, it must be concentrated to 2.0 mL. To the concentrator tube in Section 10.7, add a clean boiling chip and attach a two-ball micro-Snyder column. Prewet the column by adding about 0.5 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the micr-K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 °C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 5 to 10 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches about 0.5 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min. Remove the micro-Snyder column and rinse its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 0.2 mL of methylene chloride. Adjust the final volume to 2.0 mL and proceed with one of the following cleanup procedures.
11.3 Florisil column cleanup for nitrosamines:
11.3.1 Place 22 g of activated Florisil into a 22-mm ID chromatographic column. Tap the column to settle the Florisil and add about 5 mm of anhydrous sodium sulfate to the top.
11.3.2 Preelute the column with 40 mL of ethyl ether/pentane (15 + 85)(V/V). Discard the eluate and just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, quantitatively transfer the 2-mL sample extract onto the column using an additional 2 mL of pentane to complete the transfer.
11.3.3 Elute the column with 90 mL of ethyl ether/pentane (15 + 85)(V/V) and discard the eluate. This fraction will contain the diphenylamine, if it is present in the extract.
11.3.4 Next, elute the column with 100 mL of acetone/ethyl ether (5 + 95)(V/V) into a 500-mL K-D flask equipped with a 10-mL concentrator tube. This fraction will contain all of the nitrosamines listed in the scope of the method.
11.3.5 Add 15 mL of methanol to the collected fraction and concentrate as in Section 10.6, except use pentane to prewet the column and set the water bath at 70 to 75 °C. When the apparatus is cool, remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of pentane. Analyze by gas chromatography (Section 12).
11.4 Alumina column cleanup for nitrosamines:
11.4.1 Place 12 g of the alumina preparation (Section 6.10) into a 10-mm ID chromatographic column. Tap the column to settle the alumina and add 1 to 2 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate to the top.
11.4.2 Preelute the column with 10 mL of ethyl ether/pentane (3 + 7)(V/V). Discard the eluate (about 2 mL) and just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, quantitatively transfer the 2 mL sample extract onto the column using an additional 2 mL of pentane to complete the transfer.
11.4.3 Just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, add 70 mL of ethyl ether/pentane (3 + 7)(V/V). Discard the first 10 mL of eluate. Collect the remainder of the eluate in a 500-mL K-D flask equipped with a 10 mL concentrator tube. This fraction contains N-nitrosodiphenylamine and probably a small amount of N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine.
11.4.4 Next, elute the column with 60 mL of ethyl ether/pentane (1 + 1)(V/V), collecting the eluate in a second K-D flask equipped with a 10-mL concentrator tube. Add 15 mL of methanol to the K-D flask. This fraction will contain N-nitrosodimethylamine, most of the N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine and any diphenylamine that is present.
11.4.5 Concentrate both fractions as in Section 10.6, except use pentane to prewet the column. When the apparatus is cool, remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of pentane. Analyze the fractions by gas chromatography (Section 12).

# 12. Gas Chromatography
12.1 N-nitrosodiphenylamine completely reacts to form diphenylamine at the normal operating temperatures of a GC injection port (200 to 250 °C). Thus, N-nitrosodiphenylamine is chromatographed and detected as diphenylamine. Accurate determination depends on removal of diphenylamine that may be present in the original extract prior to GC analysis (See Section 11).
12.2 Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are retention times and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. Examples of the separations achieved by Column 1 are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Other packed or capillary (open-tubular) columns, chromatographic conditions, or detectors may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.
12.3 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.
12.4 If the extract has not been subjected to one of the cleanup procedures in Section 11, it is necessary to exchange the solvent from methylene chloride to methanol before the thermionic detector can be used. To a 1 to 10-mL volume of methylene chloride extract in a concentrator tube, add 2 mL of methanol and a clean boiling chip. Attach a two-ball micro-Snyder column to the concentrator tube. Prewet the column by adding about 0.5 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the micro-K-D apparatus on a boiling (100 °C) water bath so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 5 to 10 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches about 0.5 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min. Remove the micro-Snyder column and rinse its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 0.2 mL of methanol. Adjust the final volume to 2.0 mL.
12.5 If the internal standard calibration procedure is being used, the internal standard must be added to the sample extract and mixed thoroughly immediately before injection into the gas chromatograph.
12.6 Inject 2 to 5 µL of the sample extract or standard into the gas chromatograph using the solvent-flush technique.
21
Smaller (1.0 µL) volumes may be injected if automatic devices are employed. Record the volume injected to the nearest 0.05 µL, and the resulting peak size in area or peak height units.
12.7 Identify the parameters in the sample by comparing the retention times of the peaks in the sample chromatogram with those of the peaks in standard chromatograms. The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound can be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weigh heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.
12.8 If the response for a peak exceeds the working range of the system, dilute the extract and reanalyze.
12.9 If the measurement of the peak response is prevented by the presence of interferences, further cleanup is required.

# 13. Calculations
13.1 Determine the concentration of individual compounds in the sample.
13.1.1 If the external standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the amount of material injected from the peak response using the calibration curve or calibration factor determined in Section 7.2.2. The concentration in the sample can be calculated from Equation 2.
EC15NO91.105

where:
A = Amount of material injected (ng).
V
i
= Volume of extract injected (µL).
V
t

13.1.2 If the internal standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the concentration in the sample using the response factor (RF) determined in Section 7.3.2 and Equation 3.
EC15NO91.106
Equation 3
where:
A
s

I
s
= Amount of internal standard added to each extract (µg).
V
o
= Volume of water extracted (L).
13.2 Report results in µg/L without correction for recovery data. All QC data obtained should be reported with the sample results.

# 14. Method Performance
14.1 The method detection limit (MDL) is defined as the minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence that the value is above zero.
3
The MDL concentrations listed in Table 1 were obtained using reagent water.
22
Similar results were achieved using representative wastewaters. The MDL actually achieved in a given analysis will vary depending on instrument sensitivity and matrix effects.
14.2 This method has been tested for linearity of spike recovery from reagent water and has been demonstrated to be applicable over the concentration range from 4 × MDL to 1000 × MDL.
22
14.3 This method was tested by 17 laboratories using reagent water, drinking water, surface water, and three industrial wastewaters spiked at six concentrations over the range 0.8 to 55 µg/L.
23
Single operator precision, overall precision, and method accuracy were found to be directly related to the concentration of the parameter and essentially independent of the sample matrix. Linear equations to describe these relationships are presented in Table 3.

# Method 608.3—Organochlorine Pesticides And PCBs By GC/HSD

# 1. Scope and Application
1.1 This method is for determination of organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in industrial discharges and other environmental samples by gas chromatography (GC) combined with a halogen-specific detector (HSD; e.g., electron capture, electrolytic conductivity), as provided under 40 CFR 136.1. This revision is based on a previous protocol (Reference 1), on the revision promulgated October 26, 1984, on an inter-laboratory method validation study (Reference 2), and on EPA Method 1656 (Reference 16). The analytes that may be qualitatively and quantitatively determined using this method and their CAS Registry numbers are listed in Table 1.
1.2 This method may be extended to determine the analytes listed in Table 2. However, extraction or gas chromatography challenges for some of these analytes may make quantitative determination difficult.
1.3 When this method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for an analyte listed in Table 1 or Table 2, analyte identification must be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. This method gives analytical conditions for a second GC column that can be used to confirm and quantify measurements. Additionally, Method 625.1 provides gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative confirmation of results for the analytes listed in Tables 1 and 2 using the extract produced by this method, and Method 1699 (Reference 18) provides high resolution GC/MS conditions for qualitative confirmation of results using the original sample. When such methods are used to confirm the identifications of the target analytes, the quantitative results should be derived from the procedure with the calibration range and sensitivity that are most appropriate for the intended application.
1.4 The large number of analytes in Tables 1 and 2 makes testing difficult if all analytes are determined simultaneously. Therefore, it is necessary to determine and perform quality control (QC) tests for the “analytes of interest” only. The analytes of interest are those required to be determined by a regulatory/control authority or in a permit, or by a client. If a list of analytes is not specified, the analytes in Table 1 must be determined, at a minimum, and QC testing must be performed for these analytes. The analytes in Table 1 and some of the analytes in Table 2 have been identified as Toxic Pollutants (40 CFR 401.15), expanded to a list of Priority Pollutants (40 CFR part 423, appendix A).
1.5 In this revision to Method 608, Chlordane has been listed as the alpha- and gamma- isomers in Table 1. Reporting may be by the individual isomers, or as the sum of the concentrations of these isomers, as requested or required by a regulatory/control authority or in a permit. Technical Chlordane is listed in Table 2 and may be used in cases where historical reporting has only been the Technical Chlordane. Toxaphene and the PCBs have been moved from Table 1 to Table 2 (Additional Analytes) to distinguish these analytes from the analytes required in quality control tests (Table 1). QC acceptance criteria for Toxaphene and the PCBs have been retained in Table 4 and may continue to be applied if desired, or if these analytes are requested or required by a regulatory/control authority or in a permit. Method 1668C (Reference 17) may be useful for determination of PCBs as individual chlorinated biphenyl congeners, and Method 1699 (Reference 18) may be useful for determination of the pesticides listed in this method. However, at the time of writing of this revision, Methods 1668C and 1699 had not been approved for use at 40 CFR part 136.
1.6 Method detection limits (MDLs; Reference 3) for the analytes in Tables 1 and some of the analytes in Table 2 are listed in those tables. These MDLs were determined in reagent water (Reference 3). Advances in analytical technology, particularly the use of capillary (open-tubular) columns, allowed laboratories to routinely achieve MDLs for the analytes in this method that are 2-10 times lower than those in the version promulgated in 1984. The MDL for an analyte in a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.
1.6.1 EPA has promulgated this method at 40 CFR part 136 for use in wastewater compliance monitoring under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). The data reporting practices described in section 15.6 are focused on such monitoring needs and may not be relevant to other uses of the method.
1.6.2 This method includes “reporting limits” based on EPA's “minimum level” (ML) concept (see the glossary in section 23). Tables 1 and 2 contain MDL values and ML values for many of the analytes.
1.7 The separatory funnel and continuous liquid-liquid sample extraction and concentration steps in this method are essentially the same as those steps in Methods 606, 609, 611, and 612. Thus, a single sample may be extracted to measure the analytes included in the scope of each of these methods. Samples may also be extracted using a disk-based solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure developed by the 3M Corporation and approved by EPA as an Alternate Test Procedure (ATP) for wastewater analyses in 1995 (Reference 20).
1.8 This method is performance-based. It may be modified to improve performance (e.g., to overcome interferences or improve
the accuracy of results) provided all performance requirements are met.
1.8.1 Examples of allowed method modifications are described at 40 CFR 136.6. Other examples of allowed modifications specific to this method are described in section 8.1.2.
1.8.2 Any modification beyond those expressly permitted at 40 CFR 136.6 or in section 8.1.2 of this method shall be considered a major modification subject to application and approval of an alternate test procedure under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.
1.8.3 For regulatory compliance, any modification must be demonstrated to produce results equivalent or superior to results produced by this method when applied to relevant wastewaters (section 8.1.2).
1.9 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of GC/HSD. The laboratory must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure in section 8.2.
1.10 Terms and units of measure used in this method are given in the glossary at the end of the method.

# 2. Summary of Method
2.1 A measured volume of sample, the amount required to meet an MDL or reporting limit (nominally 1-L), is extracted with methylene chloride using a separatory funnel, a continuous liquid/liquid extractor, or disk-based solid-phase extraction equipment. The extract is dried and concentrated for cleanup, if required. After cleanup, or if cleanup is not required, the extract is exchanged into an appropriate solvent and concentrated to the volume necessary to meet the required compliance or detection limit, and analyzed by GC/HSD.
2.2 Qualitative identification of an analyte in the extract is performed using the retention times on dissimilar GC columns. Quantitative analysis is performed using the peak areas or peak heights for the analyte on the dissimilar columns with either the external or internal standard technique.
2.3 Florisil®, alumina, a C18 solid-phase cleanup, and an elemental sulfur cleanup procedure are provided to aid in elimination of interferences that may be encountered. Other cleanup procedures may be used if demonstrated to be effective for the analytes in a wastewater matrix.

# 3. Contamination and Interferences
3.1 Solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing lab ware may yield artifacts, elevated baselines, or matrix interferences causing misinterpretation of chromatograms. All materials used in the analysis must be demonstrated free from contamination and interferences by running blanks initially and with each extraction batch (samples started through the extraction process in a given 24-hour period, to a maximum of 20 samples—see Glossary for detailed definition), as described in section 8.5. Specific selection of reagents and purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required. Where possible, labware is cleaned by extraction or solvent rinse, or baking in a kiln or oven.
3.2 Glassware must be scrupulously cleaned (Reference 4). Clean all glassware as soon as possible after use by rinsing with the last solvent used in it. Solvent rinsing should be followed by detergent washing with hot water, and rinses with tap water and reagent water. The glassware should then be drained dry, and heated at 400 °C for 15-30 minutes. Some thermally stable materials, such as PCBs, may require higher temperatures and longer baking times for removal. Solvent rinses with pesticide quality acetone, hexane, or other solvents may be substituted for heating. Do not heat volumetric labware above 90 °C. After drying and cooling, store inverted or capped with solvent-rinsed or baked aluminum foil in a clean environment to prevent accumulation of dust or other contaminants.
3.3 Interferences by phthalate esters can pose a major problem in pesticide analysis when using the electron capture detector. The phthalate esters generally appear in the chromatogram as large late eluting peaks, especially in the 15 and 50% fractions from Florisil®. Common flexible plastics contain varying amounts of phthalates that may be extracted or leached from such materials during laboratory operations. Cross contamination of clean glassware routinely occurs when plastics are handled during extraction steps, especially when solvent-wetted surfaces are handled. Interferences from phthalates can best be minimized by avoiding use of non-fluoropolymer plastics in the laboratory. Exhaustive cleanup of reagents and glassware may be required to eliminate background phthalate contamination (References 5 and 6). Interferences from phthalate esters can be avoided by using a microcoulometric or electrolytic conductivity detector.
3.4 Matrix interferences may be caused by contaminants co-extracted from the sample. The extent of matrix interferences will vary considerably from source to source, depending upon the nature and diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being sampled. Interferences extracted from samples high in total organic carbon (TOC) may result in elevated baselines, or by enhancing or suppressing a signal at or near the retention time of an analyte of interest. Analyses of the matrix spike and matrix spike duplicate (Section 8.3) may be useful in identifying matrix interferences, and the cleanup procedures in Section 11 may aid in eliminating these interferences. EPA has provided guidance that may aid in overcoming matrix
interferences (Reference 7); however, unique samples may require additional cleanup approaches to achieve the MDLs listed in Tables 1 and 2.

# 4. Safety
4.1 Hazards associated with each reagent used in this method have not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of safety data sheets (SDSs, OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.12009(g)) should also be made available to all personnel involved in sample handling and chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified (References 8 and 9) for the information of the analyst.
4.2 The following analytes covered by this method have been tentatively classified as known or suspected human or mammalian carcinogens: 4,4′-DDT, 4,4′-DDD, the BHCs, and the PCBs. Primary standards of these toxic analytes should be prepared in a chemical fume hood, and a NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be worn when high concentrations are handled.
4.3 This method allows the use of hydrogen as a carrier gas in place of helium (section 5.8.2). The laboratory should take the necessary precautions in dealing with hydrogen, and should limit hydrogen flow at the source to prevent buildup of an explosive mixture of hydrogen in air.

# 5. Apparatus and Materials

# Note:
Brand names and suppliers are for illustration purposes only. No endorsement is implied. Equivalent performance may be achieved using equipment and materials other than those specified here. Demonstrating that the equipment and supplies used in the laboratory achieve the required performance is the responsibility of the laboratory. Suppliers for equipment and materials in this method may be found through an on-line search. Please do not contact EPA for supplier information.
5.1 Sampling equipment, for discrete or composite sampling.
5.1.1 Grab sample bottle—Amber glass bottle large enough to contain the necessary sample volume (nominally 1 L), fitted with a fluoropolymer-lined screw cap. Foil may be substituted for fluoropolymer if the sample is not corrosive. If amber bottles are not available, protect samples from light. Unless pre-cleaned, the bottle and cap liner must be washed, rinsed with acetone or methylene chloride, and dried before use to minimize contamination.
5.1.2 Automatic sampler (optional)—The sampler must use a glass or fluoropolymer container and tubing for sample collection. If the sampler uses a peristaltic pump, a minimum length of compressible silicone rubber tubing may be used. Before use, rinse the compressible tubing thoroughly with methanol, followed by repeated rinsing with reagent water to minimize the potential for sample contamination. An integrating flow meter is required to collect flow proportional composites. The sample container must be kept refrigerated at ≤6 °C and protected from light during compositing.

5.8 Gas chromatograph—Dual-column with simultaneous split/splitless, temperature programmable split/splitless (PTV), or on-column injection; temperature program with isothermal holds, and all required accessories including syringes, analytical columns, gases, and detectors. An autosampler is highly recommended because it injects volumes more reproducibly than manual injection techniques. Alternatively, two separate single-column gas chromatographic systems may be employed.
5.8.1 Example columns and operating conditions.
5.8.1.1 DB-608 (or equivalent), 30-m long x 0.53-mm ID fused-silica capillary, 0.83-µm film thickness.

(c) Temperature program: 150-270 °C at 5 °C/min, and
(d) Final temperature: 270 °C, until
trans
-Permethrin elutes.

# Note:
Other columns, internal diameters, film thicknesses, and operating conditions may be used, provided that the performance requirements in this method are met. However, the column pair chosen must have dissimilar phases/chemical properties in order to separate the compounds of interest in different retention time order. Columns that only differ in the length, ID, or film thickness, but use the same stationary phase do not qualify as “dissimilar.”
5.8.2 Carrier gas—Helium or hydrogen. Data in the tables in this method were obtained using helium carrier gas. If hydrogen is used, analytical conditions may need to be adjusted for optimum performance, and calibration and all QC tests must be performed with hydrogen carrier gas. See Section 4.3 for precautions regarding the use of hydrogen as a carrier gas.
5.8.3 Detector—Halogen-specific detector (electron capture detector [ECD], electrolytic conductivity detector [ELCD], or equivalent). The ECD has proven effective in the analysis of wastewaters for the analytes listed in Tables 1 and 2, and was used to develop the method performance data in Section 17 and Tables 4 and 5.
5.8.4 Data system—A computer system must be interfaced to the GC that allows continuous acquisition and storage of data from the detectors throughout the chromatographic program. The computer must have software that allows searching GC data for specific analytes, and for plotting responses versus time. Software must also be available that allows integrating peak areas or peak heights in selected retention time windows and calculating concentrations of the analytes.

# 6. Reagents and Standards
6.1 pH adjustment.
6.1.1 Sodium hydroxide solutions.
6.1.1.1 Concentrated (10 M)—Dissolve 40 g of NaOH (ACS) in reagent water and dilute to 100 mL.
6.1.1.2 Dilute (1 M)—Dissolve 40 g NaOH in 1 L of reagent water.
6.1.2 Sulfuric acid (1+1)—Slowly add 50 mL of H
2
SO
4
(ACS, sp. gr. 1.84) to 50 mL of reagent water.
6.1.3 Hydrochloric acid—Reagent grade, 6 N.
6.2 Sodium thiosulfate—(ACS) granular.
6.3 Sodium sulfate—Sodium sulfate, reagent grade, granular anhydrous (Baker or equivalent), rinsed with methylene chloride, baked in a shallow tray at 450 °C for 1 hour minimum, cooled in a desiccator, and stored in a pre-cleaned glass bottle with screw cap which prevents moisture from entering. If, after heating, the sodium sulfate develops a noticeable grayish cast (due to the presence of carbon in the crystal matrix), that batch of reagent is not suitable for use and should be discarded. Extraction with methylene chloride (as opposed to simple rinsing) and baking at a lower temperature may produce sodium sulfate suitable for use.
6.4 Reagent water—Reagent water is defined as water in which the analytes of interest and interfering compounds are not observed at the MDLs of the analytes in this method.
6.5 Solvents—Methylene chloride, acetone, methanol, hexane, acetonitrile, and isooctane, high purity pesticide quality, or equivalent, demonstrated to be free of the analytes and interferences (section 3). Purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.

# Note:
The standards and final sample extracts must be prepared in the same final solvent.
6.6 Ethyl ether—Nanograde, redistilled in glass if necessary. Ethyl ether must be shown to be free of peroxides before use, as indicated by EM Laboratories Quant test strips (available from Scientific Products Co. and other suppliers). Procedures recommended for removal of peroxides are provided with the test strips. After removal of peroxides, add 20 mL of ethyl alcohol preservative to each liter of ether.
6.7 Materials for sample cleanup.
6.7.1 Florisil®—PR grade (60/100 mesh), activated at 650-700 °C, stored in the dark in a glass container with fluoropolymer-lined
screw cap. Activate each batch immediately prior to use for 16 hours minimum at 130 °C in a foil-covered glass container and allow to cool. Alternatively, 500 mg cartridges (J.T. Baker, or equivalent) may be used.
6.7.1.1 Cartridge certification—Each cartridge lot must be certified to ensure recovery of the analytes of interest and removal of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol. To make the test mixture, add the trichlorophenol solution (section 6.7.1.3) to the same standard used to prepare the Quality Control Check Sample (section 6.8.3). Transfer the mixture to the column and dry the column. Pre-elute with three 10-mL portions of elution solvent, drying the column between elutions. Elute the cartridge with 10 mL each of methanol and water, as in section 11.2.3.3.
6.7.1.2 Concentrate the eluant to per section 10.3.3, exchange to isooctane or hexane per section 10.3.3, and inject 1.0 µL of the concentrated eluant into the GC using the procedure in section 12. The recovery of all analytes (including the unresolved GC peaks) shall be within the ranges for calibration verification (section 13.6 and Table 4), the recovery of trichlorophenol shall be less than 5%, and no peaks interfering with the target analytes shall be detected. Otherwise the Florisil cartridge is not performing properly and the cartridge lot shall be rejected.
6.7.1.3 Florisil cartridge calibration solution—2,4,6-Trichlorophenol, 0.1 µg/mL in acetone.
6.7.2 SPE elution solvent—Methylene chloride:acetonitrile:hexane (50:3:47).
6.7.3 Alumina, neutral, Brockman Activity I, 80-200 mesh (Fisher Scientific certified, or equivalent). Heat in a glass bottle for 16 hours at 400 to 450 °C. Seal and cool to room temperature. Add 7% (w/w) reagent water and mix for 10 to 12 hours. Keep bottle tightly sealed.
6.7.4 Sulfur removal.
6.7.4.1 Copper foil or powder—Fisher, Alfa Aesar, or equivalent. Cut copper foil into approximately 1-cm squares. Copper must be activated before it may be used, as described below.
6.7.4.1.1 Place the quantity of copper needed for sulfur removal (section 11.5.1.3) in a ground-glass-stoppered Erlenmeyer flask or bottle. Cover the foil or powder with methanol.
6.7.4.1.2 Add HCl dropwise (0.5-1.0 mL) while swirling, until the copper brightens.
6.7.4.1.3 Pour off the methanol/HCl and rinse 3 times with reagent water to remove all traces of acid, then 3 times with acetone, then 3 times with hexane.
6.7.4.1.4 For copper foil, cover with hexane after the final rinse. Store in a stoppered flask under nitrogen until used. For the powder, dry on a rotary evaporator. Store in a stoppered flask under nitrogen until used. Inspect the copper foil or powder before each use. It must have a bright, non-oxidized appearance to be effective. Copper foil or powder that has oxidized may be reactivated using the procedure described above.
6.7.4.2 Tetrabutylammonium sulfite (TBA sulfite)—Prepare as described below.

6.7.4.2.3 Dissolve approximately 3 g tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate in 100 mL of reagent water in an amber bottle with fluoropolymer-lined screw cap. Extract with three 20-mL portions of hexane and discard the hexane extracts.
6.7.4.2.4 Add 25 g sodium sulfite to produce a saturated solution. Store at room temperature. Replace after 1 month.
6.7.5 Sodium chloride—Reagent grade, prepare at 5% (w/v) solution in reagent water.
6.8 Stock standard solutions—Stock standard solutions may be prepared from pure materials, or purchased as certified solutions. Traceability must be to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) or other national or international standard, when available. Stock solution concentrations alternative to those below may be used. Because of the toxicity of some of the compounds, primary dilutions should be prepared in a hood, and a NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be worn when high concentrations of neat materials are handled. The following procedure may be used to prepare standards from neat materials.
6.8.1 Accurately weigh about 0.0100 g of pure material in a 10-mL volumetric flask. Dilute to volume in pesticide quality hexane, isooctane, or other suitable solvent. Larger volumes may be used at the convenience of the laboratory. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight may be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock standard. Commercially prepared stock standards may be used at any concentration if they are certified by the manufacturer or by an independent source.
6.8.1.1 Unless stated otherwise in this method, store non-aqueous standards in fluoropolymer-lined screw-cap, or heat-sealed, glass containers, in the dark at −20 to −10 °C. Store aqueous standards; e.g., the aqueous LCS (section 8.4), in the dark at ≤6 °C, but do not freeze.
6.8.1.2 Standards prepared by the laboratory may be stored for up to one year, except when comparison with QC check standards indicates that a standard has degraded or become more concentrated due to evaporation, or unless the laboratory has data on file to prove stability for a longer period. Commercially prepared standards may be stored until the expiration date provided by the vendor, except when comparison with QC check standards indicates that a standard
has degraded or become more concentrated due to evaporation, or unless the laboratory has data from the vendor on file to prove stability for a longer period.
6.8.2 Calibration solutions—It is necessary to prepare calibration solutions for the analytes of interest (section 1.4) only using an appropriate solvent (isooctane or hexane may be used). Whatever solvent is used, both the calibration standards and the final sample extracts must use the same solvent. Other analytes may be included as desired.
6.8.2.1 Prepare calibration standards for the single-component analytes of interest and surrogates at a minimum of three concentration levels (five are suggested) by adding appropriate volumes of one or more stock standards to volumetric flasks. One of the calibration standards should be at a concentration at or below the ML specified in Table 1, or 2, or as specified by a regulatory/control authority or in a permit. The ML value may be rounded to a whole number that is more convenient for preparing the standard, but must not exceed the ML value listed in Tables 1 or 2 for those analytes which list ML values. Alternatively, the laboratory may establish an ML for each analyte based on the concentration of the lowest calibration standard in a series of standards produced by the laboratory or obtained from a commercial vendor, again, provided that the ML does not exceed the ML in Table 1 and 2, and provided that the resulting calibration meets the acceptance criteria in section 7.5.2 based on the RSD, RSE, or R
2
.
(a) The other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the GC system. A minimum of six concentration levels is required for a second order, non-linear (e.g., quadratic; ax
2
+ bx + c = 0) calibration (section 7.5.2 or 7.6.2). Calibrations higher than second order are not allowed. A separate standard near the MDL may be analyzed as a check on sensitivity, but should not be included in the linearity assessment. The solvent for the standards must match the final solvent for the sample extracts (e.g., isooctane or hexane).

# Note:
The option for non-linear calibration may be necessary to address specific instrumental techniques. However, it is not EPA's intent to allow non-linear calibration to be used to compensate for detector saturation or to avoid proper instrument maintenance.
(b) Given the number of analytes included in this method, it is highly likely that some will coelute on one or both of the GC columns used for the analysis. Divide the analytes into two or more groups and prepare separate calibration standards for each group, at multiple concentrations (e.g., a five-point calibration will require ten solutions to cover two groups of analytes). Table 7 provides information on dividing the target analytes into separate calibration mixtures that should minimize or eliminate co-elutions. This table is provided solely as guidance, based on the GC columns suggested in this method. If an analyte listed in Table 7 is not an analyte of interest in a given laboratory setting, then it need not be included in a calibration mixture.

# Note:
Many commercially available standards are divided into separate mixtures to address this issue.
(c) If co-elutions occur in analysis of a sample, a co-elution on one column is acceptable so long as effective separation of the co-eluting compounds can be achieved on the second column.
6.8.2.2 Multi-component analytes (e.g., PCBs as Aroclors, and Toxaphene).
6.8.2.2.1 A standard containing a mixture of Aroclor 1016 and Aroclor 1260 will include many of the peaks represented in the other Aroclor mixtures. As a result, a multi-point initial calibration employing a mixture of Aroclors 1016 and 1260 at three to five concentrations should be sufficient to demonstrate the linearity of the detector response without the necessity of performing multi-point initial calibrations for each of the seven Aroclors. In addition, such a mixture can be used as a standard to demonstrate that a sample does not contain peaks that represent any one of the Aroclors. This standard can also be used to determine the concentrations of either Aroclor 1016 or Aroclor 1260, should they be present in a sample. Therefore, prepare a minimum of three calibration standards containing equal concentrations of both Aroclor 1016 and Aroclor 1260 by dilution of the stock standard with isooctane or hexane. The concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples and should bracket the linear range of the detector.
6.8.2.2.2 Single standards of each of the other five Aroclors are required to aid the analyst in pattern recognition. Assuming that the Aroclor 1016/1260 standards described in Section 6.8.2.2.1 have been used to demonstrate the linearity of the detector, these single standards of the remaining five Aroclors also may be used to determine the calibration factor for each Aroclor. Prepare a standard for each of the other Aroclors. The concentrations should generally correspond to the mid-point of the linear range of the detector, but lower concentrations may be employed at the discretion of the analyst based on project requirements.
6.8.2.2.3 For Toxaphene, prepare a minimum of three calibration standards containing Toxaphene by dilution of the stock
standard with isooctane or hexane. The concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples and should bracket the linear range of the detector.
6.8.3 Quality Control (QC) Check Sample Concentrate—Prepare one or more mid-level standard mixtures (concentrates) in acetone (or other water miscible solvent). The concentrate is used as the spiking solution with which to prepare the Demonstration of Capabilities (DOC) samples, the Laboratory Control Sample (LCS), and Matrix Spike (MS) and Matrix Spike Duplicate (MSD) samples described in section 8. If prepared by the laboratory (as opposed the purchasing it from a commercial supplier), the concentrate must be prepared independently from the standards used for calibration, but may be prepared from the same source as the second-source standard used for calibration verification (section 7.7). Regardless of the source, the concentrate must be in a water-miscible solvent, as noted above. The concentrate is used to prepare the DOC and LCS (sections 8.2.1 and 8.4) and MS/MSD samples (section 8.3). Depending on the analytes of interest for a given sample (see Section 1.4), multiple solutions and multiple LCS or MS/MSD samples may be required to account for co-eluting analytes. However, a co-elution on one column is acceptable so long as effective separation of the co-eluting compounds can be achieved on the second column. In addition, the concentrations of the MS/MSD samples should reflect any relevant compliance limits for the analytes of interest, as described in section 8.3.1. If a custom spiking solution is required for a specific discharge (section 8.3.1), prepare it separately from the DOC and LCS solution.

# Note:
Some commercially available standards are divided into separate mixtures to address the co-elution issue.
6.8.4 Calibration Verification Standards—In order to verify the results of the initial calibration standards, prepare one or more mid-level standard mixtures in isooctane or hexane, using standards obtained from a second source (different manufacturer or different certified lot from the calibration standards). These standards will be analyzed to verify the accuracy of the calibration (sections 7.7 and 13.6.2). As with the QC sample concentrate in section 6.8.3, multiple solutions may be required to address co-elutions among all of the analytes.
6.8.5 Internal standard solution—If the internal standard calibration technique is to be used, prepare pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) at a concentration of 10 µg/mL in ethyl acetate. Alternative and multiple internal standards; e.g., tetrachloro-
m
-xylene, 4,4′-dibromobiphenyl, and/or decachlorobiphenyl may be used provided that the laboratory performs all QC tests and meets all QC acceptance criteria with the alternative or additional internal standard(s) as an integral part of this method.
6.8.6 Surrogate solution—Prepare a solution containing one or more surrogates at a concentration of 2 µg/mL in acetone. Potential surrogates include: dibutyl chlorendate (DBC), tetrachloro-
m
-xylene (TCMX), 4,4′-dibromobiphenyl, or decachlorobiphenyl. Alternative surrogates and concentrations may be used, provided the laboratory performs all QC tests and meets all QC acceptance criteria with the alternative surrogate(s) as an integral part of this method. If the internal standard calibration technique is used, do not use the internal standard as a surrogate.
6.8.7 DDT and endrin decomposition (breakdown) solution—Prepare a solution containing endrin at a concentration of 50 ng/mL and 4,4'-DDT at a concentration of 100 ng/mL, in isooctane or hexane. A 1-µL injection of this standard will contain 50 picograms (pg) of endrin and 100 pg of DDT. The concentration of the solution may be adjusted by the laboratory to accommodate other injection volumes such that the same masses of the two analytes are introduced into the instrument.

# 7. Calibration
7.1 Establish gas chromatographic operating conditions equivalent to those in Section 5.8.1 and Footnote 2 to Table 3. Alternative temperature program and flow rate conditions may be used. The system may be calibrated using the external standard technique (section 7.5) or the internal standard technique (section 7.6). It is necessary to calibrate the system for the analytes of interest (section 1.4) only.
7.2 Separately inject the mid-level calibration standard for each calibration mixture. Store the retention time on each GC column.
7.3 Injection of calibration solutions—Inject a constant volume in the range of 0.5 to 2.0 µL of each calibration solution into the GC column/detector pairs. An alternative volume (see Section 12.3) may be used provided all requirements in this method are met. Beginning with the lowest level mixture and proceeding to the highest level mixture may limit the risk of carryover from one standard to the next, but other sequences may be used. An instrument blank should be analyzed after the highest standard to demonstrate that there is no carry-over within the system for this calibration range.
7.4 For each analyte, compute, record, and store, as a function of the concentration injected, the retention time and peak area on each column/detector system. If multi-component analytes are to be analyzed, store the retention time and peak area for the three to five exclusive (unique large) peaks
for each PCB or technical chlordane. Use four to six peaks for toxaphene.
7.5 External standard calibration.
7.5.1 From the calibration data (Section 7.4), calculate the calibration factor (CF) for each analyte at each concentration according to the following equation:
ER28AU17.000
Where:
C
s
= Concentration of the analyte in the standard (ng/mL)
A
s
= Peak height or area
For multi-component analytes, choose a series of characteristic peaks for each analyte (3 to 5 for each Aroclor, 4 to 6 for toxaphene) and calculate individual calibration factors for each peak. Alternatively, for toxaphene, sum the areas of all of the peaks in the standard chromatogram and use the summed area to determine the calibration factor. (If this alternative is used, the same approach must be used to quantitate the analyte in the samples.)
7.5.2 Calculate the mean (average) and relative standard deviation (RSD) of the calibration factors. If the RSD is less than 20%, linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average CF can be used for calculations. Alternatively, the results can be used to fit a linear or quadratic regression of response, A
s
, vs. concentration C
s
. If used, the regression must be weighted inversely proportional to concentration. The coefficient of determination (R
2
) of the weighted regression must be greater than 0.920. Alternatively, the relative standard error (Reference 10) may be used as an acceptance criterion. As with the RSD, the RSE must be less than 20%. If an RSE less than 20% cannot be achieved for a quadratic regression, system performance is unacceptable and the system must be adjusted and re-calibrated.

# Note:
Regression calculations are not included in this method because the calculations are cumbersome and because many GC/ECD data systems allow selection of weighted regression for calibration and calculation of analyte concentrations.
7.6 Internal standard calibration.
7.6.1 From the calibration data (Section 7.4), calculate the response factor (RF) for each analyte at each concentration according to the following equation:
ER28AU17.001
Where:
A
s
= Response for the analyte to be measured.
A
is
= Response for the internal standard.
C
is
= Concentration of the internal standard (ng/mL)
C
s
= Concentration of the analyte to be measured (ng/mL).
7.6.2 Calculate the mean (average) and relative standard deviation (RSD) of the response factors. If the RSD is less than 15%, linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average RF can be used for calculations. Alternatively, the results can be used to prepare a calibration curve of response ratios, A
s
/A
is
, vs. concentration ratios, C
s
/C
is
, for the analyte. A minimum of six concentration levels is required for a non-linear (e.g., quadratic) regression. If used, the regression must be weighted inversely proportional to concentration, and the coefficient of determination of the weighted regression must be greater than 0.920. Alternatively, the relative standard error (Reference 10) may be used as an acceptance criterion. As with the RSD, the RSE must be less than 15%. If an RSE less than 15% cannot be achieved for a quadratic regression, system performance is unacceptable and the system must be adjusted and re-calibrated.
7.7 The working calibration curve, CF, or RF must be verified immediately after calibration and at the beginning and end of each 24-hour shift by the analysis of a mid-level calibration standard. The calibration verification standard(s) must be obtained from a second manufacturer or a manufacturer's batch prepared independently from the batch used for calibration (Section 6.8.4). Requirements for calibration verification are given in Section 13.6 and Table 4. Alternatively, calibration verification may be performed after a set number of injections
(e.g., every 20 injections), to include injection of extracts of field samples, QC samples, instrument blanks, etc. (
i.e.,
it is based on the number of injections performed, not sample extracts). The time for the injections may not exceed 24 hours.

# Note:
The 24-hour shift begins after analysis of the combined QC standard (calibration verification) and ends 24 hours later. The ending calibration verification standard is run immediately after the last sample run during the 24-hour shift, so the beginning and ending calibration verifications are outside of the 24-hour shift. If calibration verification is based on the number of injections instead of time, then the ending verification standard for one group of injections may be used as the beginning verification for the next group of injections.
7.8 Florisil® calibration—The column cleanup procedure in Section 11.3 utilizes Florisil column chromatography. Florisil® from different batches or sources may vary in adsorptive capacity. To standardize the amount of Florisil® which is used, use of the lauric acid value (Reference 11) is suggested. The referenced procedure determines the adsorption from a hexane solution of lauric acid (mg) per g of Florisil®. The amount of Florisil® to be used for each column is calculated by dividing 110 by this ratio and multiplying by 20 g. If cartridges containing Florisil® are used, then this step is not necessary.

# 8. Quality Control
8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality assurance program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and ongoing analysis of spiked samples and blanks to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet performance requirements of this method. A quality control check standard (LCS, section 8.4) must be prepared and analyzed with each batch of samples to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation. A laboratory may develop its own performance criteria (as QC acceptance criteria), provided such criteria are as or more restrictive than the criteria in this method.
8.1.1 The laboratory must make an initial demonstration of the capability (IDC) to generate acceptable precision and recovery with this method. This demonstration is detailed in Section 8.2. On a continuing basis, the laboratory must repeat demonstration of capability (DOC) at least annually.
8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in analytical technology, and to overcome matrix interferences, the laboratory is permitted certain options (section 1.8 and 40 CFR 136.6(b) [Reference 12]) to improve separations or lower the costs of measurements. These options may include alternative extraction (e.g., other solid-phase extraction materials and formats), concentration, and cleanup procedures, and changes in GC columns (Reference 12). Alternative determinative techniques, such as the substitution of spectroscopic or immunoassay techniques, and changes that degrade method performance, are not allowed. If an analytical technique other than the techniques specified in this method is used, that technique must have a specificity equal to or greater than the specificity of the techniques in this method for the analytes of interest. The laboratory is also encouraged to participate in performance evaluation studies (see section 8.8).
8.1.2.1 Each time a modification listed above is made to this method, the laboratory is required to repeat the procedure in section 8.2. If the detection limit of the method will be affected by the change, the laboratory is required to demonstrate that the MDLs (40 CFR part 136, appendix B) are lower than one-third the regulatory compliance limit or as low as the MDLs in this method, whichever are greater. If calibration will be affected by the change, the instrument must be recalibrated per section 7. Once the modification is demonstrated to produce results equivalent or superior to results produced by this method as written, that modification may be used routinely thereafter, so long as the other requirements in this method are met (e.g., matrix spike/matrix spike duplicate recovery and relative percent difference).
8.1.2.1.1 If an allowed method modification, is to be applied to a specific discharge, the laboratory must prepare and analyze matrix spike/matrix spike duplicate (MS/MSD) samples (section 8.3) and LCS samples (section 8.4). The laboratory must include surrogates (Section 8.7) in each of the samples. The MS/MSD and LCS samples must be fortified with the analytes of interest (section 1.4). If the modification is for nationwide use, MS/MSD samples must be prepared from a minimum of nine different discharges (See section 8.1.2.1.2), and all QC acceptance criteria in this method must be met. This evaluation only needs to be performed once other than for the routine QC required by this method (for example it could be performed by the vendor of an alternative material) but any laboratory using that specific material must have the results of the study available. This includes a full data package with the raw data that will allow an independent reviewer to verify each determination and calculation performed by the laboratory (see section 8.1.2.2.5, items (a)-(q)).
8.1.2.1.2 Sample matrices on which MS/MSD tests must be performed for nationwide use of an allowed modification:
(a) Effluent from a publicly owned treatment works (POTW).
(b) ASTM D5905 Standard Specification for Substitute Wastewater.
(c) Sewage sludge, if sewage sludge will be in the permit.
(d) ASTM D1141 Standard Specification for Substitute Ocean Water, if ocean water will be in the permit.
(e) Untreated and treated wastewaters up to a total of nine matrix types (see
https://www.epa.gov/eg/industrial-effluent-guidelines
for a list of industrial categories with existing effluent guidelines).
(i) At least one of the above wastewater matrix types must have at least one of the following characteristics:
(A) Total suspended solids greater than 40 mg/L.
(B) Total dissolved solids greater than 100 mg/L.
(C) Oil and grease greater than 20 mg/L.
(D) NaCl greater than 120 mg/L.
(E) CaCO
3
greater than 140 mg/L.
(ii) The interim acceptance criteria for MS, MSD recoveries that do not have recovery limits in Table 4 or developed in section 8.3.3, and for surrogates that do not have recovery limits developed in section 8.6, must be no wider than 60-140%, and the relative percent difference (RPD) of the concentrations in the MS and MSD that do not have RPD limits in Table 4 or developed in section 8.3.3, must be less than 30%. Alternatively, the laboratory may use the laboratory's in-house limits if they are tighter.
(f) A proficiency testing (PT) sample from a recognized provider, in addition to tests of the nine matrices (section 8.1.2.1.1).
8.1.2.2 The laboratory must maintain records of modifications made to this method. These records include the following, at a minimum:
8.1.2.2.1 The names, titles, and business street addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses, of the analyst(s) that performed the analyses and modification, and of the quality control officer that witnessed and will verify the analyses and modifications.
8.1.2.2.2 A list of analytes, by name and CAS Registry number.
8.1.2.2.3 A narrative stating reason(s) for the modifications.
8.1.2.2.4 Results from all quality control (QC) tests comparing the modified method to this method, including:
(a) Calibration (section 7).
(b) Calibration verification (section 13.6).
(c) Initial demonstration of capability (section 8.2).
(d) Analysis of blanks (section 8.5).
(e) Matrix spike/matrix spike duplicate analysis (section 8.3).
(f) Laboratory control sample analysis (section 8.4).
8.1.2.2.5 Data that will allow an independent reviewer to validate each determination by tracing the instrument output (peak height, area, or other signal) to the final result. These data are to include:
(a) Sample numbers and other identifiers.
(b) Extraction dates.
(c) Analysis dates and times.
(d) Analysis sequence/run chronology.
(e) Sample weight or volume (section 10).
(f) Extract volume prior to each cleanup step (sections 10 and 11).
(g) Extract volume after each cleanup step (section 11).
(h) Final extract volume prior to injection (sections 10 and 12).
(i) Injection volume (sections 12.3 and 13.2).
(j) Sample or extract dilution (section 15.4).
(k) Instrument and operating conditions.
(l) Column (dimensions, material, etc.).
(m) Operating conditions (temperatures, flow rates, etc.).
(n) Detector (type, operating conditions, etc.).
(o) Chromatograms and other recordings of raw data.
(p) Quantitation reports, data system outputs, and other data to link the raw data to the results reported.
(q) A written Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).
8.1.2.2.6 Each individual laboratory wishing to use a given modification must perform the start-up tests in section 8.1.2 (e.g., DOC, MDL), with the modification as an integral part of this method prior to applying the modification to specific discharges. Results of the DOC must meet the QC acceptance criteria in Table 5 for the analytes of interest (section 1.4), and the MDLs must be equal to or lower than the MDLs in Tables 1 and 2 for the analytes of interest.
8.1.3 Before analyzing samples, the laboratory must analyze a blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system, lab ware, and reagents, are under control. Each time a batch of samples is extracted or reagents are changed, a blank must be extracted and analyzed as a safeguard against laboratory contamination. Requirements for the blank are given in section 8.5.
8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze samples to monitor and evaluate method and laboratory performance on the sample matrix. The procedure for spiking and analysis is given in section 8.3.
8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through analysis of a quality control check sample (laboratory control sample, LCS; on-going precision and
recovery sample, OPR) that the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4.
8.1.6 The laboratory should maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is given in section 8.7.
8.1.7 The large number of analytes tested in performance tests in this method present a substantial probability that one or more will fail acceptance criteria when all analytes are tested simultaneously, and a re-test (reanalysis) is allowed if this situation should occur. If, however, continued re-testing results in further repeated failures, the laboratory should document the failures and either avoid reporting results for the analytes that failed or report the problem and failures with the data. A QC failure does not relieve a discharger or permittee of reporting timely results.
8.2 Demonstration of capability (DOC)—To establish the ability to generate acceptable recovery and precision, the laboratory must perform the DOC in sections 8.2.1 through 8.2.6 for the analytes of interest initially and in an on-going manner at least annually. The laboratory must also establish MDLs for the analytes of interest using the MDL procedure at 40 CFR part 136, appendix B. The laboratory's MDLs must be equal to or lower than those listed in Tables 1 or 2, or lower than one-third the regulatory compliance limit, whichever is greater. For MDLs not listed in Tables 1 or 2, the laboratory must determine the MDLs using the MDL procedure at 40 CFR part 136, appendix B under the same conditions used to determine the MDLs for the analytes listed in Tables 1 and 2. When analyzing the PCBs as Aroclors, it is only necessary to establish an MDL for one of the multi-component analytes (e.g., PCB 1254), or the mixture of Aroclors 1016 and 1260 may be used to establish MDLs for all of the Aroclors. Similarly, MDLs for other multi-component analytes (e.g., Chlordanes) may be determined using only one of the major components. All procedures used in the analysis, including cleanup procedures, must be included in the DOC.
8.2.1 For the DOC, a QC check sample concentrate containing each analyte of interest (section 1.4) is prepared in a water-miscible solvent using the solution in section 6.8.3.

# Note:
QC check sample concentrates are no longer available from EPA.
8.2.2 Using a pipet or syringe, prepare four QC check samples by adding an appropriate volume of the concentrate and of the surrogate(s) to each of four 1-L aliquots of reagent water. Swirl or stir to mix.
8.2.3 Extract and analyze the well-mixed QC check samples according to the method beginning in section 10.
8.2.4 Calculate the average percent recovery (
X
) and the standard deviation (s) of the percent recovery for each analyte using the four results.
8.2.5 For each analyte, compare s and
X
with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and recovery in Table 4. For analytes in Table 2 that are not listed in Table 4, QC acceptance criteria must be developed by the laboratory. EPA has provided guidance for development of QC acceptance criteria (References 12 and 13). If s and
X
for all analytes of interest meet the acceptance criteria, system performance is acceptable and analysis of blanks and samples can begin. If any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual
X
falls outside the range for recovery, system performance is unacceptable for that analyte.

# Note:
The large number of analytes in Tables 1 and 2 present a substantial probability that one or more will fail at least one of the acceptance criteria when many or all analytes are determined simultaneously.
8.2.6 When one or more of the analytes tested fail at least one of the acceptance criteria, repeat the test for only the analytes that failed. If results for these analytes pass, system performance is acceptable and analysis of samples and blanks may proceed. If one or more of the analytes again fail, system performance is unacceptable for the analytes that failed the acceptance criteria. Correct the problem and repeat the test (section 8.2). See section 8.1.7 for disposition of repeated failures.

# Note:
To maintain the validity of the test and re-test, system maintenance and/or adjustment is not permitted between this pair of tests.
8.3 Matrix spike and matrix spike duplicate (MS/MSD)—The purpose of the MS/MSD requirement is to provide data that demonstrate the effectiveness of the method as applied to the samples in question by a given laboratory, and both the data user (discharger, permittee, regulated entity, regulatory/control authority, customer, other) and the laboratory share responsibility for provision of such data. The data user should identify the sample and the analytes of interest (section 1.4) to be spiked and provide sufficient sample volume to perform MS/MSD analyses. The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 5% of the samples in duplicate from each discharge being monitored to assess accuracy (recovery and precision). If direction cannot be obtained from the data user, the laboratory must spike at least one sample in duplicate per extraction batch of up to 20 samples with the analytes in Table 1. Spiked sample results should be reported only to the data user whose sample was spiked, or as requested or required by a regulatory/control authority, or in a permit.
8.3.1. If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific analyte will be
checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the concentration of the spike should be at that limit; otherwise, the concentration of the spike should be one to five times higher than the background concentration determined in section 8.3.2, at or near the midpoint of the calibration range, or at the concentration in the LCS (section 8.4) whichever concentration would be larger. When no information is available, the mid-point of the calibration may be used.
8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of the each analyte of interest. If necessary to meet the requirement in section 8.3.1, prepare a new check sample concentrate (section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentration. Spike and analyze two additional sample aliquots of the same volume as the original sample, and determine the concentrations after spiking (A
1
and A
2
) of each analyte. Calculate the percent recoveries (P
1
and P
2
) as:
ER28AU17.002
where T is the known true value of the spike.
Also calculate the relative percent difference (RPD) between the concentrations (A
1
and A
2
):
ER28AU17.003
8.3.3 Compare the percent recoveries (P
1
and P
2
) and the RPD for each analyte in the MS/MSD aliquots with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria for recovery (P) and RPD in Table 4.
(a) If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery in either aliquot, or the RPD limit is exceeded, the result for the analyte in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported or used for permitting or regulatory compliance. See section 8.1.7 for disposition of failures.
(b) For analytes in Table 2 not listed in Table 4, QC acceptance criteria must be developed by the laboratory. EPA has provided guidance for development of QC acceptance criteria (References 12 and 13).
8.3.4 After analysis of a minimum of 20 MS/MSD samples for each target analyte and surrogate, and if the laboratory chooses to develop and apply optional in-house QC limits, the laboratory should calculate and apply the optional in-house QC limits for recovery and RPD of future MS/MSD samples (Section 8.3). The optional in-house QC limits for recovery are calculated as the mean observed recovery ±3 standard deviations, and the upper QC limit for RPD is calculated as the mean RPD plus 3 standard deviations of the RPDs. The in-house QC limits must be updated at least every two years and re-established after any major change in the analytical instrumentation or process. At least 80% of the analytes tested in the MS/MSD must have in-house QC acceptance criteria that are tighter than those in Table 4 and the remaining analytes (those not included in the 80%) must meet the acceptance criteria in Table 4. If an in-house QC limit for the RPD is greater than the limit in Table 4, then the limit in Table 4 must be used. Similarly, if an in-house lower limit for recovery is below the lower limit in Table 4, then the lower limit in Table 4 must be used, and if an in-house upper limit for recovery is above the upper limit in Table 4, then the upper limit in Table 4 must be used. The laboratory must evaluate surrogate recovery data in each sample against its in-house surrogate recovery limits. The laboratory may use 60 -140% as interim acceptance criteria for surrogate recoveries until in-house limits are developed. Alternatively, surrogate recovery limits may be developed from laboratory control charts. In-house QC acceptance criteria must be updated at least every two years.
8.4 Laboratory control sample (LCS)—A QC check sample (laboratory control sample, LCS; on-going precision and recovery sample, OPR) containing each single-component analyte of interest (section 1.4) must be extracted, concentrated, and analyzed with each extraction batch of up to 20 samples (section 3.1) to demonstrate acceptable recovery of the analytes of interest from a
clean sample matrix. If multi-peak analytes are required, extract and prepare at least one as an LCS for each batch. Alternatively, the laboratory may set up a program where multi-peak LCS is rotated with a single-peak LCS.
8.4.1 Prepare the LCS by adding QC check sample concentrate (sections 6.8.3 and 8.2.1) to reagent water. Include all analytes of interest (section 1.4) in the LCS. The volume of reagent water must be the same as the nominal volume used for the sample, the DOC (Section 8.2), the blank (section 8.5), and the MS/MSD (section 8.3). Also add a volume of the surrogate solution (section 6.8.6).
8.4.2 Analyze the LCS prior to analysis of samples in the extraction batch (Section 3.1). Determine the concentration (A) of each analyte. Calculate the percent recovery as:
ER28AU17.004
where T is the true value of the concentration in the LCS.
8.4.3 For each analyte, compare the percent recovery (P) with its corresponding QC acceptance criterion in Table 4. For analytes of interest in Table 2 not listed in Table 4, use the QC acceptance criteria developed for the MS/MSD (section 8.3.3.2), or limits based on laboratory control charts. If the recoveries for all analytes of interest fall within the designated ranges, analysis of blanks and field samples may proceed. If any individual recovery falls outside the range, proceed according to section 8.4.4.

# Note:
The large number of analytes in Tables 1 and 2 present a substantial probability that one or more will fail the acceptance criteria when all analytes are tested simultaneously. Because a re-test is allowed in event of failure (sections 8.1.7 and 8.4.4), it may be prudent to extract and analyze two LCSs together and evaluate results of the second analysis against the QC acceptance criteria only if an analyte fails the first test.
8.4.4 Repeat the test only for those analytes that failed to meet the acceptance criteria (P). If these analytes now pass, system performance is acceptable and analysis of blanks and samples may proceed. Repeated failure, however, will confirm a general problem with the measurement system. If this occurs, repeat the test using a fresh LCS (section 8.2.1) or an LCS prepared with a fresh QC check sample concentrate (section 8.2.1), or perform and document system repair. Subsequent to analysis of the LCS prepared with a fresh sample concentrate, or to system repair, repeat the LCS test (Section 8.4). If failure of the LCS indicates a systemic problem with samples in the batch, re-extract and re-analyze the samples in the batch. See Section 8.1.7 for disposition of repeated failures.
8.4.5 After analysis of 20 LCS samples, and if the laboratory chooses to develop and apply optional in-house QC limits, the laboratory should calculate and apply the optional in-house QC limits for recovery of future LCS samples (section 8.4). Limits for recovery in the LCS should be calculated as the mean recovery ±3 standard deviations. A minimum of 80% of the analytes tested for in the LCS must have QC acceptance criteria tighter than those in Table 4, and the remaining analytes (those not included in the 80%) must meet the acceptance criteria in Table 4. If an in-house lower limit for recovery is lower than the lower limit in Table 4, the lower limit in Table 4 must be used, and if an in-house upper limit for recovery is higher than the upper limit in Table 4, the upper limit in Table 4 must be used. Many of the analytes and surrogates do not contain acceptance criteria. The laboratory should use 60-140% as interim acceptance criteria for recoveries of spiked analytes and surrogates that do not have recovery limits specified in Table 4, and at least 80% of the surrogates must meet the 60-140% interim criteria until in-house LCS and surrogate limits are developed. Alternatively, acceptance criteria for analytes that do not have recovery limits in Table 4 may be based on laboratory control charts. In-house QC acceptance criteria must be updated at least every two years.
8.5 Blank—Extract and analyze a blank with each extraction batch (section 3.1) to demonstrate that the reagents and equipment used for preparation and analysis are free from contamination.
8.5.1 Prepare the blank from reagent water and spike it with the surrogates. The volume of reagent water must be the same as the volume used for samples, the DOC (section 8.2), the LCS (section 8.4), and the MS/MSD (section 8.3). Extract, concentrate, and analyze the blank using the same procedures and reagents used for the samples, LCS, and MS/MSD in the batch. Analyze the blank immediately after analysis of the LCS (section 8.4) and prior to analysis of the MS/MSD and samples to demonstrate freedom from contamination.
8.5.2 If any analyte of interest is found in the blank at a concentration greater than the MDL for the analyte, at a concentration
greater than one-third the regulatory compliance limit, or at a concentration greater than one-tenth the concentration in a sample in the batch (section 3.1), whichever is greatest, analysis of samples must be halted and samples in the batch must be re-extracted and the extracts reanalyzed. Samples in a batch must be associated with an uncontaminated blank before the results for those samples may be reported or used for permitting or regulatory compliance purposes. If re-testing of blanks results in repeated failures, the laboratory should document the failures and report the problem and failures with the data.
8.6 Surrogate recovery—The laboratory must spike all samples with the surrogate standard spiking solution (section 6.8.6) per section 10.2.2 or 10.4.2, analyze the samples, and calculate the percent recovery of each surrogate. QC acceptance criteria for surrogates must be developed by the laboratory (section 8.4). If any recovery fails its criterion, attempt to find and correct the cause of the failure, and if sufficient volume is available, re-extract another aliquot of the affected sample; otherwise, see section 8.1.7 for disposition of repeated failures.
8.7 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, it is suggested but not required that method accuracy for wastewater samples be assessed and records maintained. After analysis of five or more spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (
X
) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (sp). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent interval from
X
−2sp to
X
+2sp. For example, if
X
= 90% and sp = 10%, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each analyte on a regular basis to ensure process control (e.g., after each 5-10 new accuracy measurements). If desired, statements of accuracy for laboratory performance, independent of performance on samples, may be developed using LCSs.
8.8 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as gas chromatography with another dissimilar column, specific element detector, or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.

# 9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling
9.1 Collect samples as grab samples in glass bottles, or in refrigerated bottles using automatic sampling equipment. Collect 1-L of ambient waters, effluents, and other aqueous samples. If high concentrations of the analytes of interest are expected (e.g., for untreated effluents or in-process waters), collect a smaller volume (e.g., 250 mL), but not less than 100 mL, in addition to the 1-L sample. Follow conventional sampling practices, except do not pre-rinse the bottle with sample before collection. Automatic sampling equipment must be as free as possible of polyvinyl chloride or other tubing or other potential sources of contamination. If needed, collect additional sample(s) for the MS/MSD (section 8.3).
9.2 Ice or refrigerate the sample at ≤6 °C from the time of collection until extraction, but do not freeze. If aldrin is to be determined and residual chlorine is present, add 80 mg/L of sodium thiosulfate but do not add excess. Any method suitable for field use may be employed to test for residual chlorine (Reference 14). If sodium thiosulfate interferes in the determination of the analytes, an alternative preservative (e.g., ascorbic acid or sodium sulfite) may be used.
9.3 Extract all samples within seven days of collection and completely analyze within 40 days of extraction (Reference 1). If the sample will not be extracted within 72 hours of collection, adjust the sample pH to a range of 5.0-9.0 with sodium hydroxide solution or sulfuric acid. Record the volume of acid or base used.

# 10. Sample Extraction
10.1 This section contains procedures for separatory funnel liquid-liquid extraction (SFLLE, section 10.2), continuous liquid-liquid extraction (CLLE, section 10.4), and disk-based solid-phase extraction (SPE, section 10.5). SFLLE is faster, but may not be as effective as CLLE for extracting polar analytes. SFLLE is labor intensive and may result in formation of emulsions that are difficult to break. CLLE is less labor intensive, avoids emulsion formation, but requires more time (18-24 hours), more hood space, and may require more solvent. SPE can be faster, unless the particulate load in an aqueous sample is so high that it slows the filtration process. If an alternative extraction scheme to those detailed in this method is used, all QC tests must be performed and all QC acceptance criteria must be met with that extraction scheme as an integral part of this method.
10.2 Separatory funnel liquid-liquid extraction (SFLLE).
10.2.1 The SFLLE procedure below assumes a sample volume of 1 L. When a different sample volume is extracted, adjust the volume of methylene chloride accordingly.
10.2.2 Mark the water meniscus on the side of the sample bottle for later determination of sample volume. Pour the entire sample into the separatory funnel. Pipet the surrogate standard spiking solution (section 6.8.6) into the separatory funnel. If the sample will be used for the LCS or MS or MSD, pipet the appropriate QC check sample concentrate (section 8.3 or 8.4) into the separatory funnel. Mix well. If the sample arrives in a larger sample bottle, 1 L may be measured in a graduated cylinder, then added to the separatory funnel.

# Note:
Instances in which the sample is collected in an oversized bottle should be reported by the laboratory to the data user. Of particular concern is that fact that this practice precludes rinsing the empty bottle with solvent as described below, which could leave hydrophobic pesticides on the wall of the bottle, and underestimate the actual sample concentrations.
10.2.3 Add 60 mL of methylene chloride to the sample bottle, seal, and shake for 30 seconds to rinse the inner surface. Transfer the solvent to the separatory funnel and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for two minutes with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Allow the organic layer to separate from the water phase for a minimum of 10 minutes. If an emulsion forms and the emulsion interface between the layers is more than one-third the volume of the solvent layer, employ mechanical techniques to complete the phase separation. The optimum technique depends upon the sample, but may include stirring, filtration of the emulsion through glass wool, use of phase-separation paper, centrifugation, salting, freezing, or other physical methods. Collect the methylene chloride extract in a flask. If the emulsion cannot be broken (recovery of less than 80% of the methylene chloride, corrected for the water solubility of methylene chloride), transfer the sample, solvent, and emulsion into the extraction chamber of a continuous extractor and proceed as described in section 10.4.
10.2.4 Add a second 60-mL volume of methylene chloride to the sample bottle and repeat the extraction procedure a second time, combining the extracts in the flask. Perform a third extraction in the same manner. Proceed to macro-concentration (section 10.3.1).
10.2.5 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to an appropriately sized graduated cylinder. Record the sample volume to the nearest 5 mL. Sample volumes may also be determined by weighing the container before and after extraction or filling to the mark with water.
10.3 Concentration.
10.3.1 Macro concentration.
10.3.1.1 Assemble a Kuderna-Danish (K-D) concentrator by attaching a 10-mL concentrator tube to a 500-mL evaporative flask. Other concentration devices or techniques may be used in place of the K-D concentrator so long as the requirements of section 8.2 are met.
10.3.1.2 Pour the extract through a solvent-rinsed drying column containing about 10 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and collect the extract in the K-D concentrator. Rinse the flask and column with 20-30 mL of methylene chloride to complete the quantitative transfer.
10.3.1.3 If no cleanup is to be performed on the sample, add 500 µL (0.5 mL) of isooctane to the extract to act as a keeper during concentration.
10.3.1.4 Add one or two clean boiling chips and attach a three-ball Snyder column to the K-D evaporative flask. Pre-wet the Snyder column by adding about 1 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60-65 °C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water, and the entire lower rounded surface of the flask is bathed with hot vapor. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 15-20 minutes. At the proper rate of evaporation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood with condensed solvent. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 1 mL or other determined amount, remove the K-D apparatus from the water bath and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 minutes.
10.3.1.5 If the extract is to be cleaned up by sulfur removal or acid back extraction, remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of methylene chloride. A 5-mL syringe is recommended for this operation. Adjust the final volume to 10 mL in methylene chloride and proceed to sulfur removal (section 11.5) or acid back extraction (section 11.6). If the extract is to cleaned up using one of the other cleanup procedures or is to be injected into the GC, proceed to Kuderna-Danish micro-concentration (section 10.3.2) or nitrogen evaporation and solvent exchange (section 10.3.3).
10.3.2 Kuderna-Danish micro concentration—Add another one or two clean boiling chips to the concentrator tube and attach a two-ball micro-Snyder column. Pre-wet the Snyder column by adding about 0.5 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60-65 °C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in hot water. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 5-10 minutes. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood with condensed solvent. When the
apparent volume of liquid reaches approximately 1 mL or other required amount, remove the K-D apparatus from the water bath and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 minutes. Remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with approximately 0.2 mL of methylene chloride, and proceed to section 10.3.3 for nitrogen evaporation and solvent exchange.
10.3.3 Nitrogen evaporation and solvent exchange—Extracts to be subjected to solid-phase cleanup (SPE) are exchanged into 1.0 mL of the SPE elution solvent (section 6.7.2.2). Extracts to be subjected to Florisil® or alumina cleanups are exchanged into hexane. Extracts that have been cleaned up and are ready for analysis are exchanged into isooctane or hexane, to match the solvent used for the calibration standards.
10.3.3.1 Transfer the vial containing the sample extract to the nitrogen evaporation (blowdown) device (section 5.2.5.2). Lower the vial into a 50-55 °C water bath and begin concentrating. During the solvent evaporation process, do not allow the extract to become dry. Adjust the flow of nitrogen so that the surface of the solvent is just visibly disturbed. A large vortex in the solvent may cause analyte loss.
10.3.3.2 Solvent exchange.
10.3.3.2.1 When the volume of the liquid is approximately 500 µL, add 2 to 3 mL of the desired solvent (SPE elution solvent for SPE cleanup, hexane for Florisil or alumina, or isooctane for final injection into the GC) and continue concentrating to approximately 500 µL. Repeat the addition of solvent and concentrate once more.
10.3.3.3.2 Adjust the volume of an extract to be cleaned up by SPE, Florisil®, or alumina to 1.0 mL. Proceed to extract cleanup (section 11).
10.3.3.3 Extracts that have been cleaned up and are ready for analysis—Adjust the final extract volume to be consistent with the volume extracted and the sensitivity desired. The goal is for a full-volume sample (e.g., 1-L) to have a final extract volume of 10 mL, but other volumes may be used.
10.3.4 Transfer the concentrated extract to a vial with fluoropolymer-lined cap. Seal the vial and label with the sample number. Store in the dark at room temperature until ready for GC analysis. If GC analysis will not be performed on the same day, store the vial in the dark at ≤6 °C. Analyze the extract by GC per the procedure in section 12.
10.4 Continuous liquid/liquid extraction (CLLE).
10.4.1 Use CLLE when experience with a sample from a given source indicates an emulsion problem, or when an emulsion is encountered using SFLLE. CLLE may be used for all samples, if desired.
10.4.2 Mark the water meniscus on the side of the sample bottle for later determination of sample volume. Transfer the sample to the continuous extractor and, using a pipet, add surrogate standard spiking solution. If the sample will be used for the LCS, MS, or MSD, pipet the appropriate check sample concentrate (section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) into the separatory funnel. Mix well. Add 60 mL of methylene chloride to the sample bottle, seal, and shake for 30 seconds to rinse the inner surface. Transfer the solvent to the extractor.
10.4.3 Repeat the sample bottle rinse with two additional 50-100 mL portions of methylene chloride and add the rinses to the extractor.
10.4.4 Add a suitable volume of methylene chloride to the distilling flask (generally 200-500 mL) and sufficient reagent water to ensure proper operation of the extractor, and extract the sample for 18-24 hours. A shorter or longer extraction time may be used if all QC acceptance criteria are met. Test and, if necessary, adjust the pH of the water to a range of 5.0-9.0 during the second or third hour of the extraction. After extraction, allow the apparatus to cool, then detach the distilling flask. Dry, concentrate, solvent exchange, and transfer the extract to a vial with fluoropolymer-lined cap, per Section 10.3.
10.4.5 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to an appropriately sized graduated cylinder. Record the sample volume to the nearest 5 mL. Sample volumes may also be determined by weighing the container before and after extraction or filling to the mark with water.
10.5 Solid-phase extraction of aqueous samples. The steps in this section address the extraction of aqueous field samples using disk-based solid-phase extraction (SPE) media, based on an ATP approved by EPA in 1995 (Reference 20). This application of SPE is distinct from that used in this method for the cleanup of sample extracts in section 11.2. Analysts must be careful not to confuse the equipment, supplies, or the procedural steps from these two different uses of SPE.

# Note:
Changes to the extraction conditions described below may be made by the laboratory under the allowance for method flexibility described in section 8.1, provided that the performance requirements in section 8.2 are met. However, changes in SPE materials, formats, and solvents must meet the requirements in section 8.1.2 and its subsections.
10.5.1 Mark the water meniscus on the side of the sample bottle for later determination of sample volume. If the sample contains particulates, let stand to settle out the particulates before extraction.
10.5.2 Extract the sample as follows:
10.5.2.1 Place a 90-mm standard filter apparatus on a vacuum filtration flask or manifold and attach to a vacuum source. The vacuum gauge must read at least 25 in. of
mercury when all valves are closed. Position a 90-mm C18 extraction disk onto the filter screen. Wet the entire disk with methanol. To aid in filtering samples with particulates, a 1-µm glass fiber filter or Empore® Filter Aid 400 can be placed on the top of the disk and wetted with methanol. Install the reservoir and clamp. Resume vacuum to dry the disk. Interrupt the vacuum. Wash the disk and reservoir with 20 mL of methylene chloride. Resume the vacuum briefly to pull methylene chloride through the disk. Interrupt the vacuum and allow the disk to soak for about a minute. Resume vacuum and completely dry the disk.
10.5.2.2 Condition the disk with 20 mL of methanol. Apply vacuum until nearly all the solvent has passed through the disk, interrupting it while solvent remains on the disk. Allow the disk to soak for about a minute. Resume vacuum to pull most of the methanol through, but interrupting it to leave a layer of methanol on the surface of the disk. Do not allow disk to dry. For uniform flow and good recovery, it is critical the disk not be allowed to dry from now until the end of the extraction. Discard waste solvent. Rinse the disk with 20 mL of deionized water. Resume vacuum to pull most of the water through, but interrupt it to leave a layer of water on the surface of the disk. Do not allow the disk to dry. If disk does dry, recondition with methanol as above.
10.5.2.3 Add the water sample to the reservoir and immediately apply the vacuum. If particulates have settled in the sample, gently decant the clear layer into the apparatus until most of the sample has been processed. Then pour the remainder including the particulates into the reservoir. Empty the sample bottle completely. When the filtration is complete, dry the disk for three minutes. Turn off the vacuum.
10.5.3 Discard sample filtrate. Insert tube to collect the eluant. The tube should fit around the drip tip of the base. Reassemble the apparatus. Add 5.0 mL of acetone to the center of the disk, allowing it to spread evenly over the disk. Turn the vacuum on and quickly off when the filter surface nears dryness but still remains wet. Allow to soak for 15 seconds. Add 20 mL of methylene chloride to the sample bottle, seal and shake to rinse the inside of the bottle. Transfer the methylene chloride from the bottle to the filter. Resume the vacuum slowly so as to avoid splashing.
Interrupt the vacuum when the filter surface nears dryness but still remains wet. Allow disk to soak in solvent for 20 seconds. Rinse the reservoir glass and disk with 10 mL of methylene chloride. Resume vacuum slowly. Interrupt vacuum when disk is covered with solvent. Allow to soak for 20 seconds. Resume vacuum to dry the disk. Remove the sample tube.
10.5.4 Dry, concentrate, solvent exchange, and transfer the extract to a vial with fluoropolymer-lined cap, per section 10.3.
10.5.5 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to an appropriately sized graduated cylinder. Record the sample volume to the nearest 5 mL. Sample volumes may also be determined by weighing the container before and after extraction or filling to the mark with water.

# 11. Extract Cleanup
11.1 Cleanup may not be necessary for relatively clean samples (e.g., treated effluents, groundwater, drinking water). If particular circumstances require the use of a cleanup procedure, the laboratory may use any or all of the procedures below or any other appropriate procedure (e.g., gel permeation chromatography). However, the laboratory must first repeat the tests in sections 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4 to demonstrate that the requirements of those sections can be met using the cleanup procedure(s) as an integral part of this method. This is particularly important when the target analytes for the analysis include any of the single component pesticides in Table 2, because some cleanups have not been optimized for all of those analytes.
11.1.1 The solid-phase cartridge (section 11.2) removes polar organic compounds such as phenols.
11.1.2 The Florisil® column (section 11.3) allows for selected fractionation of the organochlorine analytes and will also eliminate polar interferences.
11.1.3 Alumina column cleanup (section 11.4) also removes polar materials.
11.1.4 Elemental sulfur, which interferes with the electron capture gas chromatography of some of the pesticides, may be removed using activated copper, or TBA sulfite. Sulfur removal (section 11.5) is required when sulfur is known or suspected to be present. Some chlorinated pesticides which also contain sulfur may be removed by this cleanup.
11.1.5 Acid back extraction (section 11.6) may be useful for cleanup of PCBs and other compounds not adversely affected by sulfuric acid.
11.2 Solid-phase extraction (SPE) as a cleanup. In order to use the C18 SPE cartridge in section 5.5.3.5 as a cleanup procedure, the sample extract must be exchanged from methylene chloride to methylene chloride:acetonitrile:hexane (50:3:47). Follow the solvent exchange steps in section 10.3.3.2 prior to attempting solid-phase cleanup.

# Note:
This application of SPE is distinct from that used in this method for the extraction of aqueous samples in section 10.5. Analysts must be careful not to confuse the equipment, supplies, or procedural steps from these two different uses of SPE.
11.2.1 Setup.
11.2.1.1 Attach the VacElute Manifold (section 5.5.3.2) to a water aspirator or vacuum pump with the trap and gauge installed between the manifold and vacuum source.
11.2.1.2 Place the SPE cartridges in the manifold, turn on the vacuum source, and adjust the vacuum to 5 to 10 psi.
11.2.2 Cartridge washing—Pre-elute each cartridge prior to use sequentially with 10-mL portions each of hexane, methanol, and water using vacuum for 30 seconds after each eluting solvent. Follow this pre-elution with 1 mL methylene chloride and three 10-mL portions of the elution solvent (section 6.7.2.2) using vacuum for 5 minutes after each eluting solvent. Tap the cartridge lightly while under vacuum to dry between solvent rinses. The three portions of elution solvent may be collected and used as a cartridge blank, if desired. Finally, elute the cartridge with 10 mL each of methanol and water, using the vacuum for 30 seconds after each eluant.
11.2.3 Extract cleanup.
11.2.3.1 After cartridge washing (section 11.2.2), release the vacuum and place the rack containing the 50-mL volumetric flasks (section 5.5.3.4) in the vacuum manifold. Re-establish the vacuum at 5 to 10 psi.
11.2.3.2 Using a pipette or a 1-mL syringe, transfer 1.0 mL of extract to the SPE cartridge. Apply vacuum for five minutes to dry the cartridge. Tap gently to aid in drying.
11.2.3.3 Elute each cartridge into its volumetric flask sequentially with three 10-mL portions of the methylene chloride:acetonitrile:hexane (50:3:47) elution solvent (section 6.7.2.2), using vacuum for five minutes after each portion. Collect the eluants in the 50-mL volumetric flasks.
11.2.3.4 Release the vacuum and remove the 50-mL volumetric flasks.
11.2.3.5 Concentrate the eluted extracts per Section 10.3.
11.3 Florisil®. In order to use Florisil cleanup, the sample extract must be exchanged from methylene chloride to hexane. Follow the solvent exchange steps in section 10.3.3.2 prior to attempting Florisil® cleanup.

# Note:
Alternative formats for this cleanup may be used by the laboratory, including cartridges containing Florisil®. If an alternative format is used, consult the manufacturer's instructions and develop a formal documented procedure to replace the steps in section 11.3 of this method and demonstrate that the alternative meets the relevant quality control requirements of this method.
11.3.1 If the chromatographic column does not contain a frit at the bottom, place a small plug of pre-cleaned glass wool in the column (section 5.2.4) to retain the Florisil®. Place the mass of Florisil® (nominally 20 g) predetermined by calibration (section 7.8 and Table 6) in a chromatographic column. Tap the column to settle the Florisil® and add 1 to 2 cm of granular anhydrous sodium sulfate to the top.
11.3.2 Add 60 mL of hexane to wet and rinse the sodium sulfate and Florisil®. Just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, stop the elution of the hexane by closing the stopcock on the chromatographic column. Discard the eluant.
11.3.3 Transfer the concentrated extract (section 10.3.3) onto the column. Complete the transfer with two 1-mL hexane rinses, drawing the extract and rinses down to the level of the sodium sulfate.
11.3.4 Place a clean 500-mL K-D flask and concentrator tube under the column. Elute Fraction 1 with 200 mL of 6% (v/v) ethyl ether in hexane at a rate of approximately 5 mL/min. Remove the K-D flask and set it aside for later concentration. Elute Fraction 2 with 200 mL of 15% (v/v) ethyl ether in hexane into a second K-D flask. Elute Fraction 3 with 200 mL of 50% (v/v) ethyl ether in hexane into a third K-D flask. The elution patterns for the pesticides and PCBs are shown in Table 6.
11.3.5 Concentrate the fractions as in Section 10.3, except use hexane to prewet the column and set the water bath at about 85 °C. When the apparatus is cool, remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with hexane. Adjust the volume of Fraction 1 to approximately 10 mL for sulfur removal (Section 11.5), if required; otherwise, adjust the volume of the fractions to 10 mL, 1.0 mL, or other volume needed for the sensitivity desired. Analyze the concentrated extract by gas chromatography (Section 12).
11.4 Alumina. The sample extract must be exchanged from methylene chloride to hexane. Follow the solvent exchange steps in section 10.3.3.2 prior to attempting alumina cleanup.
11.4.1 If the chromatographic column does not contain a frit at the bottom, place a small plug of pre-cleaned glass wool in the chromatographic column (section 5.2.4) to retain the alumina. Add 10 g of alumina (section 6.7.3) on top of the plug. Tap the column to settle the alumina. Place 1-2 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate on top of the alumina.
11.4.2 Close the stopcock and fill the column to just above the sodium sulfate with hexane. Add 25 mL of hexane. Open the stopcock and adjust the flow rate of hexane to approximately 2 mL/min. Do not allow the column to go dry throughout the elutions.
11.4.3 When the level of the hexane is at the top of the column, quantitatively transfer the extract to the column. When the level of the extract is at the top of the column, slowly add 25 mL of hexane and elute the column to the level of the sodium sulfate. Discard the hexane.
11.4.4 Place a K-D flask (section 5.2.5.1.2) under the column and elute the pesticides
with approximately 150 mL of hexane:ethyl ether (80:20 v/v). It may be necessary to adjust the volume of elution solvent for slightly different alumina activities.
11.4.5 Concentrate the extract per section 10.3.
11.5 Sulfur removal—Elemental sulfur will usually elute in Fraction 1 of the Florisil® column cleanup. If Florisil® cleanup is not used, or to remove sulfur from any of the Florisil® fractions, use one of the sulfur removal procedures below. These procedures may be applied to extracts in hexane, ethyl ether, or methylene chloride.

# Note:
Separate procedures using copper or TBA sulfite are provided in this section for sulfur removal. They may be used separately or in combination, if desired.
11.5.1 Removal with copper (Reference 15).

# Note:
Some of the analytes in Table 2 are not amenable to sulfur removal with copper (e.g., atrazine and diazinon). Therefore, before using copper to remove sulfur from an extract that will be analyzed for any of the non-PCB analytes in Table 2, the laboratory must demonstrate that the analytes can be extracted from an aqueous sample matrix that contains sulfur and recovered from an extract treated with copper. Acceptable performance can be demonstrated through the preparation and analysis of a matrix spike sample that meets the QC requirements for recovery.
11.5.1.1 Quantitatively transfer the extract to a 40- to 50-mL flask or bottle. If there is evidence of water in the K-D or round-bottom flask after the transfer, rinse the flask with small portions of hexane:acetone (40:60) and add to the flask or bottle. Mark and set aside the concentration flask for future use.
11.5.1.2 Add 10-20 g of granular anhydrous sodium sulfate to the flask. Swirl to dry the extract.
11.5.1.3 Add activated copper (section 6.7.4.1.4) and allow to stand for 30-60 minutes, swirling occasionally. If the copper does not remain bright, add more and swirl occasionally for another 30-60 minutes.
11.5.1.4 After drying and sulfur removal, quantitatively transfer the extract to a nitrogen-evaporation vial or tube and proceed to section 10.3.3 for nitrogen evaporation and solvent exchange, taking care to leave the sodium sulfate and copper foil in the flask.
11.5.2 Removal with TBA sulfite.
11.5.2.1 Using small volumes of hexane, quantitatively transfer the extract to a 40- to 50-mL centrifuge tube with fluoropolymer-lined screw cap.
11.5.2.2 Add 1-2 mL of TBA sulfite reagent (section 6.7.4.2.4), 2-3 mL of 2-propanol, and approximately 0.7 g of sodium sulfite (section 6.7.4.2.2) crystals to the tube. Cap and shake for 1-2 minutes. If the sample is colorless or if the initial color is unchanged, and if clear crystals (precipitated sodium sulfite) are observed, sufficient sodium sulfite is present. If the precipitated sodium sulfite disappears, add more crystalline sodium sulfite in approximately 0.5-g portions until a solid residue remains after repeated shaking.
11.5.2.3 Add 5-10 mL of reagent water and shake for 1-2 minutes. Centrifuge to settle the solids.
11.5.2.4 Quantitatively transfer the hexane (top) layer through a small funnel containing a few grams of granular anhydrous sodium sulfate to a nitrogen-evaporation vial or tube and proceed to section 10.3.3 for micro-concentration and solvent exchange.
11.6 Acid back extraction (section 6.1.2).
11.6.1 Quantitatively transfer the extract (section 10.3.1.5) to a 250-mL separatory funnel.
11.6.2 Partition the extract against 50 mL of sulfuric acid solution (section 6.1.2). Discard the aqueous layer. Repeat the acid washing until no color is visible in the aqueous layer, to a maximum of four washings.
11.6.3 Partition the extract against 50 mL of sodium chloride solution (section 6.7.5). Discard the aqueous layer.
11.6.4 Proceed to section 10.3.3 for micro-concentration and solvent exchange.

# 12. Gas Chromatography
12.1 Establish the same operating conditions used in section 7.1 for instrument calibration.
12.2 If the internal standard calibration procedure is used, add the internal standard solution (section 6.9.3) to the extract as close as possible to the time of injection to minimize the possibility of loss by evaporation, adsorption, or reaction. For example, add 1 µL of 10 µg/mL internal standard solution into the extract, assuming no dilutions. Mix thoroughly.
12.3 Simultaneously inject an appropriate volume of the sample extract or standard solution onto both columns, using split, splitless, solvent purge, large-volume, or on-column injection. Alternatively, if using a single-column GC configuration, inject an appropriate volume of the sample extract or standard solution onto each GC column independently. If the sample is injected manually, the solvent-flush technique should be used. The injection volume depends upon the technique used and the sensitivity needed to meet MDLs or reporting limits for regulatory compliance. Injection volumes must be the same for all extracts. Record the volume injected to the nearest 0.05 µL.
12.4 Set the data system or GC control to start the temperature program upon sample injection, and begin data collection after the solvent peak elutes. Set the data system to stop data collection after the last analyte is expected to elute and to return the column to the initial temperature.
12.5 Perform all qualitative and quantitative measurements as described in Sections 14 and 15. When standards and extracts are not being used for analyses, store them refrigerated at
6 °C, protected from light, in screw-cap vials equipped with un-pierced fluoropolymer-lined septa.

# 13. System and Laboratory Performance
13.1 At the beginning of each shift during which standards or extracts are analyzed, GC system performance and calibration must be verified for all analytes and surrogates on both column/detector systems. Adjustment and/or recalibration (per section 7) are performed until all performance criteria are met. Only after all performance criteria are met may samples, blanks and other QC samples, and standards be analyzed.
13.2 Inject an aliquot of the calibration verification standard (section 6.8.4) on both columns. Inject an aliquot of each of the multi-component standards.
13.3 Retention times—The absolute retention times of the peak maxima shall be within ±2 seconds of the retention times in the calibration verification (section 7.8).
13.4 GC resolution—Resolution is acceptable if the valley height between two peaks (as measured from the baseline) is less than 40% of the shorter of the two peaks.
13.4.1 DB-608 column—DDT and endrin aldehyde
13.4.2 DB-1701 column—
alpha
and
gamma
chlordane

# Note:
If using other GC columns or stationary phases, these resolution criteria apply to these four target analytes and any other closely eluting analytes on those other GC columns.
13.5 Decomposition of DDT and endrin—If DDT, endrin, or their breakdown products are to be determined, this test must be performed prior to calibration verification (section 13.6). DDT decomposes to DDE and DDD. Endrin decomposes to endrin aldehyde and endrin ketone.
13.5.1 Inject 1 µL of the DDT and endrin decomposition solution (section 6.8.7). As noted in section 6.8.7, other injection volumes may be used as long as the concentrations of DDT and endrin in the solution are adjusted to introduce the masses of the two analytes into the instrument that are listed in section 6.8.7.
13.5.2 Measure the areas of the peaks for DDT, DDE, DDD, endrin, endrin aldehyde, and endrin ketone in the chromatogram and calculate the percent breakdown as shown in the equations below:
ER28AU17.005
13.5.3 Both the % breakdown of DDT and of endrin must be less than 20%, otherwise the system is not performing acceptably for DDT and endrin. In this case, repair the GC column system that failed and repeat the performance tests (sections 13.2 to 13.6) until the specification is met.

# Note:
DDT and endrin decomposition are usually caused by accumulations of particulates in the injector and in the front end of the column. Cleaning and silanizing the injection port liner, and breaking off a short section of the front end of the column will usually eliminate the decomposition problem. Either of these corrective actions may affect retention times, GC resolution, and calibration linearity.
13.6 Calibration verification.
13.6.1 Compute the percent recovery of each analyte and of the coeluting analytes, based on the initial calibration data (section 7.5 or 7.6).
13.6.2 For each analyte or for coeluting analytes, compare the concentration with the limits for calibration verification in Table 4. For coeluting analytes, use the coeluting analyte with the least restrictive specification (the widest range). For analytes in Table 2 not listed in Table 4, QC acceptance criteria must be developed by the laboratory. EPA has provided guidance for development of QC acceptance criteria (References 13 and 14). If the recoveries for all analytes meet the acceptance criteria, system performance is acceptable and analysis of blanks and samples may continue. If, however, any recovery falls outside the calibration verification range, system performance is unacceptable for that analyte. If this occurs, repair the system and repeat the test (section 13.6), or prepare a fresh calibration
standard and repeat the test, or recalibrate (section 7). See Section 8.1.7 for information on repeated test failures.
13.7 Laboratory control sample.
13.7.1 Analyze the extract of the LCS (section 6.8.3) extracted with each sample batch (Section 8.4). See Section 8.4 for criteria acceptance of the LCS.
13.7.2 It is suggested, but not required, that the laboratory update statements of data quality. Add results that pass the specifications in section 13.7.3 to initial (section 8.7) and previous ongoing data. Update QC charts to form a graphic representation of continued laboratory performance. Develop a statement of laboratory data quality for each analyte by calculating the average percent recovery (R) and the standard deviation of percent recovery, sr. Express the accuracy as a recovery interval from R − 2sr to R + 2sr. For example, if R = 95% and sr = 5%, the accuracy is 85 to 105%.
13.8 Internal standard response—If internal standard calibration is used, verify that detector sensitivity has not changed by comparing the response (area or height) of each internal standard in the sample, blank, LCS, MS, and MSD to the response in calibration verification (section 6.8.3). The peak area or height of the internal standard should be within 50% to 200% (
1/2
to 2x) of its respective peak area or height in the verification standard. If the area or height is not within this range, compute the concentration of the analytes using the external standard method (section 7.5). If the analytes are affected, re-prepare and reanalyze the sample, blank, LCS, MS, or MSD, and repeat the pertinent test.

# 14. Qualitative Identification
14.1 Identification is accomplished by comparison of data from analysis of a sample, blank, or other QC sample with data from calibration verification (section 7.7.1 or 13.5), and with data stored in the retention-time and calibration libraries (section 7.7). The retention time window is determined as described in section 14.2. Identification is confirmed when retention time agrees on both GC columns, as described below. Alternatively, GC/MS identification may be used to provide another means of identification.
14.2 Establishing retention time windows.
14.2.1 Using the data from the multi-point initial calibration (section 7.4), determine the retention time in decimal minutes (not minutes:seconds) of each peak representing a single-component target analyte on each column/detector system. For the multi-component analytes, use the retention times of the five largest peaks in the chromatograms on each column/detector system.
14.2.2 Calculate the standard deviation of the retention times for each single-component analyte on each column/detector system and for the three to five exclusive (unique large) peaks for each multi-component analyte.
14.2.3 Define the width of the retention time window as three times that standard deviation. Establish the center of the retention time window for each analyte by using the absolute retention time for each analyte from the calibration verification standard at the beginning of the analytical shift. For samples run during the same shift as an initial calibration, use the retention time of the mid-point standard of the initial calibration. If the calculated RT window is less than 0.02 minutes, then use 0.02 minutes as the window.

# Note:
Procedures for establishing retention time windows from other sources may be employed provided that they are clearly documented and provide acceptable performance. Such performance may be evaluated using the results for the spiked QC samples described in this method, such as laboratory control samples and matrix spike samples.
14.2.4 The retention time windows must be recentered when a new GC column is installed or if a GC column has been shortened during maintenance to a degree that the retention times of analytes in the calibration verification standard have shifted close to the lower limits of the established retention time windows.
14.2.5 RT windows should be checked periodically by examining the peaks in spiked samples such as the LCS or MS/MSD to confirm that peaks for known analytes are properly identified.
14.2.6 If the retention time of an analyte in the calibration (Section 7.4) varies by more than 5 seconds across the calibration range as a function of the concentration of the standard, using the standard deviation of the retention times (section 14.2.3) to set the width of the retention time window may not adequately serve to identify the analyte in question under routine conditions. In such cases, data from additional analyses of standards may be required to adequately model the chromatographic behavior of the analyte.
14.3 Identifying the analyte in a sample.
14.3.1 In order to identify a single-component analyte from analysis of a sample, blank, or other QC sample, the peak representing the analyte must fall within its respective retention time windows on both column/detector systems (as defined in section 14.2). That identification is further supported by the comparison of the numerical results on both columns, as described in section 15.7.
14.3.2 In order to identify a multi-component analyte, pattern matching (fingerprinting) may be used, or the three to five exclusive (unique and largest) peaks for that analyte must fall within their respective retention time windows on both column/detector systems (as defined in section 14.2).
That identification is further supported by the comparison of the numerical results on both columns, as described in section 15.7. Alternatively, GC/MS identification may be used. Differentiation among some of the Aroclors may require evaluation of more than five peaks to ensure correct identification.
14.4 GC/MS confirmation. When the concentration of an analyte is sufficient and the presence or identity is suspect, its presence should be confirmed by GC/MS. In order to match the sensitivity of the GC/ECD, confirmation would need to be by GC/MS-SIM, or the estimated concentration would need to be 100 times higher than the GC/ECD calibration range. The extract may be concentrated by an additional amount to allow a further attempt at GC/MS confirmation.
14.5 Additional information that may aid the laboratory in the identification of an analyte. The occurrence of peaks eluting near the retention time of an analyte of interest increases the probability of a false positive for the analyte. If the concentration is insufficient for confirmation by GC/MS, the laboratory may use the cleanup procedures in this method (section 11) on a new sample aliquot to attempt to remove the interferent. After attempts at cleanup are exhausted, the following steps may be helpful to assure that the substance that appears in the RT windows on both columns is the analyte of interest.
14.5.1 Determine the consistency of the RT data for the analyte on each column. For example, if the RT is very stable (
i.e.,
varies by no more than a few seconds) for the calibration, calibration verification, blank, LCS, and MS/MSD, the RT for the analyte of interest in the sample should be within this variation regardless of the window established in Section 14.2. If the analyte is not within this variation on both columns, it is likely not present.
14.5.2 The possibility exists that the RT for the analyte in a sample could shift if extraneous materials are present. This possibility may be able to be confirmed or refuted by the behavior of the surrogates in the sample. If multiple surrogates are used that span the length of the chromatographic run, the RTs for the surrogates on both columns are consistent with their RTs in calibration, calibration verification, blank, LCS, and MS/MSD, it is unlikely that the RT for the analyte of interest has shifted.
14.5.3 If the RT for the analyte is shifted slightly later on one column and earlier on the other, and the surrogates have not shifted, it is highly unlikely that the analyte is present, because shifts nearly always occur in the same direction on both columns.

# 15. Quantitative Determination
15.1 External standard quantitation—Calculate the concentration of the analyte in the extract using the calibration curve or average calibration factor determined in calibration (section 7.5.2) and the following equation:
ER28AU17.006
where:
C
ex
= Concentration of the analyte in the extract (ng/mL)
A
s
= Peak height or area for the analyte in the standard or sample
CF = Calibration factor, as defined in Section 7.5.1
15.2 Internal standard quantitation—Calculate the concentration of the analyte in the extract using the calibration curve or average response factor determined in calibration (section 7.6.2) and the following equation:
ER28AU17.007
where:
C
ex
= Concentration of the analyte in the extract (ng/mL)
A
s
= Peak height or area for the analyte in the standard or sample
C
is
= Concentration of the internal standard (ng/mL)
A
is
= Area of the internal standard
RF = Response factor, as defined in section 7.6.1
15.3 Calculate the concentration of the analyte in the sample using the concentration in the extract, the extract volume, the sample volume, and the dilution factor, per the following equation:
ER28AU17.008
where:
C
s
= Concentration of the analyte in the sample (µg/L)
V
ex
= Final extract volume (mL)
C
ex
= Concentration in the extract (ng/mL)
V
s
= Volume of sample (L)
DF = Dilution factor
and the factor of 1,000 in the denominator converts the final units from ng/L to µg/L
15.4 If the concentration of any target analyte exceeds the calibration range, either extract and analyze a smaller sample volume, or dilute and analyze the diluted extract.
15.5 Quantitation of multi-component analytes.
15.5.1 PCBs as Aroclors. Quantify an Aroclor by comparing the sample chromatogram to that of the most similar Aroclor standard as indicated in section 14.3.2. Compare the responses of 3 to 5 major peaks in the calibration standard for that Aroclor with the peaks observed in the sample extract. The amount of Aroclor is calculated using the individual calibration factor for each of the 3 to 5 characteristic peaks chosen in section 7.5.1. Determine the concentration of each of the characteristic peaks, using the average calibration factor calculated for that peak in section 7.5.2, and then those 3 to 5 concentrations are averaged to determine the concentration of that Aroclor.
15.5.2 Other multi-component analytes. Quantify any other multi-component analytes (technical chlordane or toxaphene) using the same peaks used to develop the average calibration factors in section 7.5.2. Determine the concentration of each of the characteristic peaks, and then the concentrations represented by those characteristic peaks are averaged to determine the concentration of the analyte. Alternatively, for toxaphene, the analyst may determine the calibration factor in section 7.5.2 by summing the areas of all of the peaks for the analyte and using the summed of the peak areas in the sample chromatogram to determine the concentration. However, the approach used for toxaphene must be the same for the calibration and the sample analyses.
15.6 Reporting of results. As noted in section 1.6.1, EPA has promulgated this method at 40 CFR part 136 for use in wastewater compliance monitoring under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). The data reporting practices described here are focused on such monitoring needs and may not be relevant to other uses of the method.
15.6.1 Report results for wastewater samples in µg/L without correction for recovery. (Other units may be used if required by in a permit.) Report all QC data with the sample results.
15.6.2 Reporting level. Unless specified otherwise by a regulatory authority or in a discharge permit, results for analytes that meet the identification criteria are reported down to the concentration of the ML established by the laboratory through calibration of the instrument (see section 7.5 or 7.6 and the glossary for the derivation of the ML). EPA considers the terms “reporting limit,” “quantitation limit,” and “minimum level” to be synonymous.
15.6.2.1 Report the lower result from the two columns (see section 15.7 below) for each analyte in each sample or QC standard at or above the ML to 3 significant figures. Report a result for each analyte in each sample or QC standard below the ML as “
ML,” where “ML” is the concentration of the analyte at the ML (e.g., if the ML is 10 µg/L, then report the result as
10 µg/L), or as required by the regulatory authority or permit. Report a result for each analyte in a blank at or above the MDL to 2 significant figures. Report a result for each analyte found in a blank below the MDL as “
MDL,” where MDL is the concentration of the analyte at the MDL, or as required by the regulatory/control authority or permit.
15.6.2.2 In addition to reporting results for samples and blank(s) separately, the concentration of each analyte in a blank or field blank associated with that sample may be subtracted from the result for that sample, but only if requested or required by a regulatory authority or in a permit. In this case, both the sample result and the blank results must be reported together.
15.6.2.3 Report the result for an analyte in a sample or extract that has been diluted at the least dilute level at which the peak area is within the calibration range (
i.e.,
above the ML for the analyte) and the MS/MSD recovery and RPD are within their respective QC acceptance criteria (Table 4). This may require reporting results for some analytes
from different analyses. Results for each analyte in MS/MSD samples should be reported from the same GC column as used to report the results for that analyte in the unspiked sample. If the MS/MSD recoveries and RPDs calculated in this manner do not meet the acceptance criteria in Table 4, the analyst may use the results from the other GC column to determine if the MS/MSD results meet the acceptance criteria. If such a situation occurs, the results for the sample should be recalculated using the same GC column data as used for the MS/MSD samples, and reported with appropriate annotations that alert the data user of the issue.
15.6.2.4 Results from tests performed with an analytical system that is not in control (
i.e.,
that does not meet acceptance criteria for all of QC tests in this method) must not be reported or otherwise used for permitting or regulatory compliance purposes, but do not relieve a discharger or permittee of reporting timely results. See section 8.1.7 for dispositions of failures. If the holding time would be exceeded for a re-analysis of the sample, the regulatory/control authority should be consulted for disposition.
15.6.3 Analyze the sample by GC/MS or on a third column when analytes have co-eluted or interfere with determination on both columns.

# Note:
Dichlone and kepone do not elute from the DB-1701 column and must be confirmed on a DB-5 column, or by GC/MS.
15.7 Quantitative information that may aid in the confirmation of the presence of an analyte.
15.7.1 As noted in Section 14.3, the relative agreement between the numerical results from the two GC columns may be used to support the identification of the target analyte by providing evidence that co-eluting interferences are not present at the retention time of the target analyte. Calculate the percent difference (%D) between the results for the analyte from both columns, as follows:
ER28AU17.009
In general, if the %D of the two results is less than 50% (e.g., a factor of 2), then the pesticide is present. This %D is generous and allows for the pesticide that has the largest measurement error.

# Note:
Laboratories may employ metrics less than 50% for this comparison, including those specified in other analytical methods for these pesticides (e.g., CLP or SW-846).
15.7.2 If the amounts do not agree, and the RT data indicate the presence of the analyte (per Section 14), it is likely that a positive interference is present on the column that yielded the higher result. That interferent may be represented by a separate peak on the other column that does not coincide with the retention time of any of the target analytes. If the interfering peak is evident on the other column, report the result from that column and advise the data user that the interference resulted in a %D value greater than 50%. If an interferent is not identifiable on the second column, then the results must be reported as “not detected” at the lower concentration. In this event, the pesticide is not confirmed and the reporting limit is elevated. See section 8.1.7 for disposition of problem results.

# Note:
The resulting elevation of the reporting limit may not meet the requirements for compliance monitoring and the use of additional cleanup procedures may be required.

# 16. Analysis of Complex Samples
16.1 Some samples may contain high levels (greater than 1 µg/L) of the analytes of interest, interfering analytes, and/or polymeric materials. Some samples may not concentrate to 1.0 mL (section 10.3.3.3.2); others may overload the GC column and/or detector.
16.2 When an interference is known or suspected to be present, the laboratory should attempt to clean up the sample extract using the SPE cartridge (section 11.2), by Florisil® (Section 11.3), Alumina (Section 11.4), sulfur removal (section 11.5), or another clean up procedure appropriate to the analytes of interest. If these techniques do not remove the interference, the extract is diluted by a known factor and reanalyzed (section 12). Dilution until the extract is lightly colored is preferable. Typical dilution factors are 2, 5, and 10.
16.3 Recovery of surrogate(s)—In most samples, surrogate recoveries will be similar to those from reagent water. If surrogate recovery is outside the limits developed in Section 8.6, re-extract and reanalyze the sample if there is sufficient sample and if it is within the 7-day extraction holding time. If surrogate recovery is still outside this range, extract and analyze one-tenth the volume of sample to overcome any matrix interference problems. If a sample is highly colored or suspected to be high in concentration, a 1-L
sample aliquot and a 100-mL sample aliquot could be extracted simultaneously and still meet the holding time criteria, while providing information about a complex matrix.
16.4 Recovery of the matrix spike and matrix spike duplicate (MS/MSD)—In most samples, MS/MSD recoveries will be similar to those from reagent water. If either the MS or MSD recovery is outside the range specified in Section 8.3.3, one-tenth the volume of sample is spiked and analyzed. If the matrix spike recovery is still outside the range, the result for the unspiked sample may not be reported or used for permitting or regulatory compliance purposes. See Section 8.1.7 for dispositions of failures. Poor matrix spike recovery does not relieve a discharger or permittee of reporting timely results.

# 17. Method Performance
17.1 This method was tested for linearity of spike recovery from reagent water and has been demonstrated to be applicable over the concentration range from 4x MDL to 1000x MDL with the following exceptions: Chlordane recovery at 4x MDL was low (60%); Toxaphene recovery was demonstrated linear over the range of 10x MDL to 1000x MDL (Reference 3).
17.2 The 1984 version of this method was tested by 20 laboratories using reagent water, drinking water, surface water, and three industrial wastewaters spiked at six concentrations (Reference 2). Concentrations used in the study ranged from 0.5 to 30 µg/L for single-component pesticides and from 8.5 to 400 µg/L for multi-component analytes. These data are for a subset of analytes described in the current version of the method.
17.3 During the development of Method 1656, a similar EPA procedure for the organochlorine pesticides, single-operator precision, overall precision, and method accuracy were found to be directly related to the concentration of the analyte and essentially independent of the sample matrix. Linear equations to describe these relationships are presented in Table 5.

# 18. Pollution Prevention
18.1 Pollution prevention encompasses any technique that reduces or eliminates the quantity or toxicity of waste at the point of generation. Many opportunities for pollution prevention exist in laboratory operations. EPA has established a preferred hierarchy of environmental management techniques that places pollution prevention as the management option of first choice. Whenever feasible, the laboratory should use pollution prevention techniques to address waste generation. When wastes cannot be reduced at the source, the Agency recommends recycling as the next best option.
18.2 The analytes in this method are used in extremely small amounts and pose little threat to the environment when managed properly. Standards should be prepared in volumes consistent with laboratory use to minimize the disposal of excess volumes of expired standards. This method utilizes significant quantities of methylene chloride. Laboratories are encouraged to recover and recycle this and other solvents during extract concentration.
18.3 For information about pollution prevention that may be applied to laboratories and research institutions, consult “Less is Better: Laboratory Chemical Management for Waste Reduction” (Reference 19), available from the American Chemical Society's Department of Governmental Relations and Science Policy, 1155 16th Street NW., Washington DC 20036, 202-872-4477.

# 19. Waste Management
19.1 The laboratory is responsible for complying with all Federal, State, and local regulations governing waste management, particularly the hazardous waste identification rules and land disposal restrictions, and to protect the air, water, and land by minimizing and controlling all releases from fume hoods and bench operations. Compliance is also required with any sewage discharge permits and regulations. An overview of requirements can be found in Environmental Management Guide for Small Laboratories (EPA 233-B-98-001).
19.2 Samples at pH
2, or pH
12, are hazardous and must be handled and disposed of as hazardous waste, or neutralized and disposed of in accordance with all federal, state, and local regulations. It is the laboratory's responsibility to comply with all federal, state, and local regulations governing waste management, particularly the hazardous waste identification rules and land disposal restrictions. The laboratory using this method has the responsibility to protect the air, water, and land by minimizing and controlling all releases from fume hoods and bench operations. Compliance is also required with any sewage discharge permits and regulations. For further information on waste management, see “The Waste Management Manual for Laboratory Personnel,” also available from the American Chemical Society at the address in section 18.3.
19.3 Many analytes in this method decompose above 500 °C. Low-level waste such as absorbent paper, tissues, animal remains, and plastic gloves may be burned in an appropriate incinerator. Gross quantities of neat or highly concentrated solutions of toxic or hazardous chemicals should be packaged securely and disposed of through commercial or governmental channels that are capable of handling toxic wastes.
19.4 For further information on waste management, consult The Waste Management Manual for Laboratory Personnel and
Less is Better-Laboratory Chemical Management for Waste Reduction, available from the American Chemical Society's Department of Government Relations and Science Policy, 1155 16th Street NW., Washington, DC 20036, 202-872-4477.

Analytical batch—The set of samples analyzed on a given instrument during a 24-hour period that begins and ends with calibration verification (sections 7.8 and 13). See also “Extraction batch.”
Blank (method blank; laboratory blank)—An aliquot of reagent water that is treated exactly as a sample including exposure to all glassware, equipment, solvents, reagents, internal standards, and surrogates that are used with samples. The blank is used to determine if analytes or interferences are present in the laboratory environment, the reagents, or the apparatus.
Calibration factor (CF)—See section 7.5.1.
Calibration standard—A solution prepared from stock solutions and/or a secondary standards and containing the analytes of interest, surrogates, and internal standards. This standard is used to model the response of the GC instrument against analyte concentration.
Calibration verification—The process of confirming that the response of the analytical system remains within specified limits of the calibration.
Calibration verification standard—The standard (section 6.8.4) used to verify calibration (sections 7.8 and 13.6).
Extraction Batch—A set of up to 20 field samples (not including QC samples) started through the extraction process in a given 24-hour shift. Each extraction batch of 20 or fewer samples must be accompanied by a blank (section 8.5), a laboratory control sample (LCS, section 8.4), a matrix spike and duplicate (MS/MSD; section 8.3), resulting in a minimum of five samples (1 field sample, 1 blank, 1 LCS, 1 MS, and 1 MSD) and a maximum of 24 samples (20 field samples, 1 blank, 1 LCS, 1 MS, and 1 MSD) for the batch. If greater than 20 samples are to be extracted in a 24-hour shift, the samples must be separated into extraction batches of 20 or fewer samples.

Matrix spike (MS) and matrix spike duplicate (MSD) (laboratory fortified sample matrix and duplicate)—Two aliquots of an environmental sample to which known quantities of the analytes of interest and surrogates are added in the laboratory. The MS/MSD are prepared and analyzed exactly like a field sample. Their purpose is to quantify any additional bias and imprecision caused by the sample matrix. The background concentrations of the analytes in the sample matrix must be determined in a separate aliquot and the measured values in the MS/MSD corrected for background concentrations.
May—This action, activity, or procedural step is neither required nor prohibited.
May not—This action, activity, or procedural step is prohibited.
Method detection limit (MDL)—A detection limit determined by the procedure at 40 CFR part 136, appendix B. The MDLs determined by EPA are listed in Tables 1 and 2. As noted in section 1.6, use the MDLs in Tables 1 and 2 in conjunction with current MDL data from the laboratory actually analyzing samples to assess the sensitivity of this procedure relative to project objectives and regulatory requirements (where applicable).
Minimum level (ML)—The term “minimum level” refers to either the sample concentration equivalent to the lowest calibration point in a method or a multiple of the method detection limit (MDL), whichever is higher. Minimum levels may be obtained in several ways: They may be published in a method; they may be based on the lowest acceptable calibration point used by a laboratory; or they may be calculated by multiplying the MDL in a method, or the MDL determined by a laboratory, by a factor of 3. For the purposes of NPDES compliance monitoring, EPA considers the following terms to be synonymous: “quantitation limit,” “reporting limit,” and “minimum level.”

1.2 This is a gas chromatographic (GC) method applicable to the determination of the compounds listed above in municipal and industrial discharges as provided under 40 CFR 136.1. When this method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for any or all of the compounds above, compound identifications should be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. This method describes analytical conditions for a second gas chromatographic column that can be used to confirm measurements made with the primary column. Method 625 provides gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative and quantitative confirmation of results for all of the parameters listed above, using the extract produced by this method.
1.3 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 14.1)
1
for each parameter is listed in Table 1. The MDL for a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.
1.4 The sample extraction and concentration steps in this method are essentially the same as in Methods 606, 608, 611, and 612. Thus, a single sample may be extracted to measure the parameters included in the scope of each of these methods. When cleanup is required, the concentration levels must be high enough to permit selecting aliquots, as necessary, to apply appropriate cleanup procedures. The analyst is allowed the latitude, under Section 12, to select chromatographic conditions appropriate for the simultaneous measurement of combinations of these parameters.
1.5 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.
1.6 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of a gas chromatograph and in the interpretation of gas chromatograms. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.

# 2. Summary of Method
2.1 A measured volume of sample, approximately 1-L, is extracted with methylene chloride using a separatory funnel. The methylene chloride extract is dried and exchanged to hexane during concentration to a volume of 10 mL or less. Isophorone and nitrobenzene are measured by flame ionization detector gas chromatography (FIDGC). The dinitrotoluenes are measured by electron capture detector gas chromatography (ECDGC).
2
2.2 The method provides a Florisil column cleanup procedure to aid in the elimination of interferences that may be encountered.

# 3. Interferences
3.1 Method interferences may be caused by contaminants in solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware that lead to discrete artifacts and/or elevated baseliles in gas chromatograms. All of these materials must be routinely demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3.
3.1.1 Glassware must be scrupulously cleaned.
3
Clean all glassware as soon as possible after use by rinsing with the last solvent used in it. Solvent rinsing should be followed by detergent washing with hot water, and rinses with tap water and distilled water. The glassware should then be drained dry, and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 °C for 15 to 30 min. Some thermally stable materials, such as PCBs, may not be eliminated by this treatment. Solvent rinses with acetone and pesticide quality hexane may be substituted for the muffle furnace heating. Thorough rinsing with such solvents usually eliminates PCB interference. Volumetric ware should not be heated in a muffle furnace. After drying and cooling, glassware should be sealed and stored in a clean environment to prevent any accumulation of dust or other contaminants. Store inverted or capped with aluminum foil.
3.1.2 The use of high purity reagents and solvents helps to minimize interference problems. Purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.
3.2 Matrix interferences may be caused by contaminants that are co-extracted from the sample. The extent of matrix interferences will vary considerably from source to source, depending upon the nature and diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being sampled. The cleanup procedure in Section 11 can be used to overcome many of these interferences, but unique samples may require additional cleanup approaches to achieve the MDL listed in Table 1.

# 4. Safety
4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified
4-6
for the information of the analyst.

# 5. Apparatus and Materials
5.1 Sampling equipment, for discrete or composite sampling.
5.1.1 Grab sample bottle—1-L or 1-qt, amber glass, fitted with a screw cap lined with Teflon. Foil may be substituted for Teflon if the sample is not corrosive. If amber bottles are not available, protect samples from light. The bottle and cap liner must be washed, rinsed with acetone or methylene chloride, and dried before use to minimize contamination.
5.1.2 Automatic sampler (optional)—The sampler must incorporate glass sample containers for the collection of a minimum of
250 mL of sample. Sample containers must be kept refrigerated at 4 °C and protected from light during compositing. If the sampler uses a peristaltic pump, a minimum length of compressible silicone rubber tubing may be used. Before use, however, the compressible tubing should be thoroughly rinsed with methanol, followed by repeated rinsings with distilled water to minimize the potential for contamination of the sample. An integrating flow meter is required to collect flow proportional composites.
5.2 Glassware (All specifications are suggested. Catalog numbers are included for illustration only.):
5.2.1 Separatory funnel—2-L, with Teflon stopcock.
5.2.2 Drying column—Chromatographic column, approximately 400 mm long × 19 mm ID, with coarse frit filter disc.

5.2.8 Vials—10 to 15-mL, amber glass, with Teflon-lined screw cap.
5.3 Boiling chips—Approximately 10/40 mesh. Heat to 400 °C for 30 min or Soxhlet extract with methylene chloride.
5.4 Water bath—Heated, with concentric ring cover, capable of temperature control (±2 °C). The bath should be used in a hood.
5.5 Balance—Analytical, capable of accurately weighing 0.0001 g.
5.6 Gas chromatograph—An analytical system complete with gas chromatograph suitable for on-column injection and all required accessories including syringes, analytical columns, gases, detector, and strip-chart recorder. A data system is recommended for measuring peak areas.
5.6.1 Column 1—1.2 m long × 2 or 4 mm ID glass, packed with 1.95% QF-1/1.5% OV-17 on Gas-Chrom Q (80/100 mesh) or equivalent. This column was used to develop the method performance statements given in Section 14. Guidelines for the use of alternate column packings are provided in Section 12.1.
5.6.2 Column 2—3.0 m long × 2 or 4 mm ID glass, packed with 3% OV-101 on Gas-Chrom Q (80/100 mesh) or equivalent.
5.6.3 Detectors—Flame ionization and electron capture detectors. The flame ionization detector (FID) is used when determining isophorone and nitrobenzene. The electron capture detector (ECD) is used when determining the dinitrotoluenes. Both detectors have proven effective in the analysis of wastewaters and were used in develop the method performance statements in Section 14. Guidelines for the use to alternate detectors are provided in Section 12.1.

# 6. Reagents
6.1 Reagent water—Reagent water is defined as a water in which an interferent is not observed at the MDL of the parameters of interest.
6.2 Sodium hydroxide solution (10 N)—Dissolve 40 g of NaOH (ACS) in reagent water and dilute to 100 mL.
6.3 Sulfuric acid (1 + 1)—Slowly, add 50 mL of H
2
SO
4
(ACS, sp. gr. 1.84) to 50 mL of reagent water.
6.4 Acetone, hexane, methanol, methylene chloride—Pesticide quality or equivalent.
6.5 Sodium sulfate—(ACS) Granular, anhydrous. Purify by heating at 400 °C for 4 h in a shallow tray.
6.6 Florisil—PR grade (60/100 mesh). Purchase activated at 1250 °F and store in dark in glass containers with ground glass stoppers or foil-lined screw caps. Before use, activate each batch at least 16 h at 200 °C in a foil-covered glass container and allow to cool.
6.7 Stock standard solutions (1.00 µg/µL)—Stock standard solutions can be prepared from pure standard materials or purchased as certified solutions.
6.7.1 Prepare stock standard solutions by accurately weighing about 0.0100 g of pure material. Dissolve the material in hexane and dilute to volume in a 10-mL volumetric flask. Larger volumes can be used at the convenience of the analyst. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight can be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock standard. Commercially prepared stock standards can be used at any concentration if they are certified by the manufacturer or by an independent source.
6.7.2 Transfer the stock standard solutions into Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottles. Store at 4 °C and protect from light. Stock standard solutions should be checked frequently for signs of degradation or evaporation, especially just prior to preparing calibration standards from them.
6.7.3 Stock standard solutions must be replaced after six months, or sooner if comparison with check standards indicates a problem.
6.8 Quality control check sample concentrate—See Section 8.2.1.

# 7. Calibration
7.1 Establish gas chromatographic operating conditions equivalent to those given in
Table 1. The gas chromatographic system can be calibrated using the external standard technique (Section 7.2) or the internal standard technique (Section 7.3).
7.2 External standard calibration procedure:
7.2.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask and diluting to volume with hexane. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 1) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.
7.2.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 µL, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against the mass injected. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to amount injected (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (
10% relative standard deviation, RSD) linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.
7.3 Internal standard calibration procedure—To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can be suggested that is applicable to all samples.
7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flash. To each calibration standard, add a known constant amount of one or more internal standards, and dilute to volume with hexane. One of the standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.
7.3.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 µL, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against concentration for each compound and internal standard. Calculate response factors (RF) for each compound using Equation 1.
Equation 1.

If the RF value over the working range is a constant (
10% RSD), the RF can be assumed to be invariant and the average RF can be used for calculations. Alternatively, the results can be used to plot a calibration curve of response ratios, A

, vs. RF.
7.4 The working calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be verified on each working day by the measurement of one or more calibration standards. If the response for any parameter varies from the predicted response by more than ±15%, a new calibration curve must be prepared for that compound.
7.5 Before using any cleanup procedure, the analyst must process a series of calibration standards through the procedure to validate elution patterns and the absence of interferences from the reagents.

# 8. Quality Control
8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.
8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.
8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Sections 10.4, 11.1, and 12.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.
8.1.3 Before processing any samples, the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system and glassware are under control. Each time a set of samples is extracted or reagents are changed, a reagent water blank must be processed as a safeguard against laboratory contamination.
8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.
8.1,5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.
8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.
8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.
8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each parameter of interest in acetone at a concentration of 20 µg/mL for each dinitrotoluene and 100 µg/mL for isophorone and nitrobenzene. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.
8.2.2 Using a pipet, prepare QC check samples at the test concentrations shown in Table 2 by adding 1.00 mL of QC check sample concentrate to each of four 1-L aliquots of reagent water.
8.2.3 Analyze the well-mixed QC check samples according to the method beginning in Section 10.
8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X
) in µg/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in µg/L, for each parameter using the four results.
8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X
with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively, found in Table 2. If s and X
for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X
falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter. Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.
8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.
8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:
8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at the test concentration in Section 8.2.2 or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.1.3 If it is impractical to determile background levels before spiking (e.g., maximum holding times will be exceeded), the spike concentration should be (1) the regulatory concentration limit, if any; or, if none (2) the larger of either 5 times higher than the expected background concentration or the test concentration in Section 8.2.2.
8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second sample aliquot with 1.0 mL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100 (A−B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.
8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1.
7
If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than the test concentration in Section 8.2.2, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 2, or optional QC acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of a parameter: (1)
Calculate accuracy (X′) using the equation in Table 3, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S′) using the equation in Table 3, substituting X′ for X
8; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X′/T) ±2.44 (100 S′/T)%.
7
8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.
8.4. If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.

# Note:
The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory.
8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 1.0 mL of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 1 L of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.
8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P
s
) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.
8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (P
s
) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.
8.5 As part of QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P
) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (s
p
). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P
−2s
p
to P
+ 2s
p
. If P
= 90% and s
p
= 10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).
8.6 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as gas chromatography with a dissimilar column, specific element detector, or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.

# 9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling
9.1 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers. Conventional sampling practices
8
should be followed, except that the bottle must not be prerinsed with sample before collection. Composite samples should be collected in refrigerated glass containers in accordance with the requirements of the program. Automatic sampling equipment must be as free as possible of Tygon tubing and other potential sources of contamination.
9.2 All samples must be iced or refrigerated at 4 °C from the time of collection until extraction.
9.3 All samples must be extracted within 7 days of collection and completely analyzed within 40 days of extraction.
2

# 10. Sample Extraction
10.1 Mark the water meniscus on the side of the sample bottle for later determination of sample volume. Pour the entire sample into a 2-L separatory funnel. Check the pH of the sample with wide-range pH paper and adjust to within the range of 5 to 9 with sodium hydroxide solution or sulfuric acid.
10.2 Add 60 mL of methylene chloride to the sample bottle, seal, and shake 30 s to rinse the inner surface. Transfer the solvent to the separatory funnel and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for 2 min. with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Allow the organic layer to separate from the water phase for a minimum of 10 min. If the emulsion interface between layers is more than one-third the volume of the solvent layer, the analyst must employ mechanical techniques to complete the phase separation. The optimum technique depends upon the sample, but may include stirring, filtration of the emulsion through glass wool, centrifugation, or other physical methods. Collect the methylene chloride extract in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.
10.3 Add a second 60-mL volume of methylene chloride to the sample bottle and repeat the extraction procedure a second time, combining the extracts in the Erlenmeyer flask. Perform a third extraction in the same manner.
10.4 Assemble a Kuderna-Danish (K-D) concentrator by attaching a 10-mL concentrator tube to a 500-mL evaporative flask. Other concentration devices or techniques may be used in place of the K-D concentrator if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.
10.5 Pour the combined extract through a solvent-rinsed drying column containing about 10 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and collect the extract in the K-D concentrator. Rinse the Erlenmeyer flask and column with 20 to 30 mL of methylene chloride to complete the quantitative transfer.
10.6 Sections 10.7 and 10.8 describe a procedure for exchanging the methylene chloride solvent to hexane while concentrating the extract volume to 1.0 mL. When it is not necessary to achieve the MDL in Table 2, the solvent exchange may be made by the addition of 50 mL of hexane and concentration to 10 mL as described in Method 606, Sections 10.7 and 10.8.
10.7 Add one or two clean boiling chips to the evaporative flask and attach a three-ball Snyder column. Prewet the Snyder column by adding about 1 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 °C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water, and the entire lower rounded surface of the flask is bathed with hot vapor. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 15 to 20 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood with condensed solvent. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 1 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.
10.8 Remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of methylene chloride. A 5-mL syringe is recommended for this operation. Add 1 to 2 mL of hexane and a clean boiling chip to the concentrator tube and attach a two-ball micro-Snyder column. Prewet the column by adding about 0.5 mL of hexane to the top. Place the micro-K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 °C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 5 to 10 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 0.5 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.
10.9 Remove the micro-Snyder column and rinse its lower joint into the concentrator tube with a minimum amount of hexane. Adjust the extract volume to 1.0 mL. Stopper the concentrator tube and store refrigerated if further processing will not be performed immediately. If the extract will be stored longer than two days, it should be transferred to a Teflon-sealed screw-cap vial. If the sample extract requires no further cleanup, proceed with gas chromatographic analysis (Section 12). If the sample requires further cleanup, proceed to Section 11.
10.10 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to a 1000-mL graduated cylinder. Record the sample volume to the nearest 5 mL.

# 11. Cleanup and Separation
11.1 Cleanup procedures may not be necessary for a relatively clean sample matrix. If particular circumstances demand the use of a cleanup procedure, the analyst may use the procedure below or any other appropriate procedure. However, the analyst first must demonstrate that the requirements of Section 8.2 can be met using the method as revised to incorporate the cleanup procedure.
11.2 Florisil column cleanup:
11.2.1 Prepare a slurry of 10 g of activated Florisil in methylene chloride/hexane (1 + 9)(V/V) and place the Florisil into a chromatographic column. Tap the column to settle the Florisil and add 1 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate to the top. Adjust the elution rate to about 2 mL/min.
11.2.2 Just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, quantitatively transfer the sample extract onto the column using an additional 2 mL of hexane to complete the transfer. Just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, add 30 mL of methylene chloride/hexane (1 + 9)(V/V) and continue the elution of the column. Discard the eluate.
11.2.3 Next, elute the column with 30 mL of acetone/methylene chloride (1 + 9)(V/V) into a 500-mL K-D flask equipped with a 10-mL concentrator tube. Concentrate the collected fraction as in Sections 10.6, 10.7, 10.8, and 10.9 including the solvent exchange to 1 mL of hexane. This fraction should contain the nitroaromatics and isophorone. Analyze by gas chromatography (Section 12).

# 12. Gas Chromatography
12.1 Isophorone and nitrobenzene are analyzed by injection of a portion of the extract into an FIDGC. The dinitrotoluenes are analyzed by a separate injection into an ECDGC. Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are retention times and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. Examples of the separations achieved by Column 1 are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Other packed or capillary (open-tubular) columns, chromatographic conditions, or detectors may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.
12.2 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.
12.3 If the internal standard calibration procedure is being used, the internal standard must be added to the same extract and mixed thoroughly immediately before injection into the gas chromatograph.
12.4 Inject 2 to 5 µL of the sample extract or standard into the gas chromatograph using the solvent-flush technique.
9
Smaller (1.0 µL) volumes may be injected if automatic devices are employed. Record the volume injected to the nearest 0.05 µL, the total extract volume, and the resulting peak size in area or peak height units.
12.5 Identify the parameters in the sample by comparing the retention times of the peaks in the sample chromatogram with those of the peaks in standard chromatograms. The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound can be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weigh heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.
12.6 If the response for a peak exceeds the working range of the system, dilute the extract and reanalyze.
12.7 If the measurement of the peak response is prevented by the presence of interferences, further cleanup is required.

# 13. Calculations
13.1 Determine the concentration of individual compounds in the sample.
13.1.1 If the external standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the amount of material injected from the peak response using the calibration curve or calibration factor determined in Section 7.2.2. The concentration in the sample can be calculated from Equation 2.
EC15NO91.111

where:
A = Amount of material injected (ng).
V
i
= Volume of extract injected (µL).
V

= Volume of total extract (µL).

13.1.2 If the internal standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the concentration in the sample using the response factor (RF) determined in Section 7.3.2 and Equation 3.

where:

V

= Volume of water extracted (L).
13.2 Report results in µg/L without correction for recovery data. All QC data obtained should be reported with the sample results.

# 14. Method Performance
14.1 The method detection limit (MDL) is defined as the minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence that the value is above zero.
1
The MDL concentrations listed in Table 1 were obtained using reagent water.
10
Similar results were achieved using representative wastewaters. The MDL actually achieved in a given analysis will vary depending on instrument sensitivity and matrix effects.
14.2 This method has been tested for linearity of spike recovery from reagent water and has been demonstrated to be applicable over the concentration range from 7 × MDL to 1000 × MDL.
10
14.3 This method was tested by 18 laboratories using reagent water, drinking water, surface water, and three industrial wastewaters spiked at six concentrations over the range 1.0 to 515 µg/L.
11
Single operator precision, overall precision, and method accuracy were found to be directly related to the concentration of the parameter and essentially independent of the sample matrix. Linear equations to describe these relationships are presented in Table 3.

1.2 This is a chromatographic method applicable to the determination of the compounds listed above in municipal and industrial discharges as provided under 40 CFR 136.1. When this method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for any or all of the compounds above, compound identifications should be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. Method 625 provides gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative and quantitative confirmation of results for many of the parameters listed above, using the extract produced by this method.
1.3 This method provides for both high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) and gas chromatographic (GC) approaches for the determination of PAHs. The gas chromatographic procedure does not adequately resolve the following four pairs of compounds: Anthracene and phenanthrene; chrysene and benzo(a)anthracene; benzo(b)fluoranthene and benzo(k)fluoranthene; and dibenzo(a,h) anthracene and indeno (1,2,3-cd)pyrene. Unless the purpose for the analysis can be served by reporting the sum of an unresolved pair, the liquid chromatographic approach must be used for these compounds. The liquid chromatographic method does resolve all 16 of the PAHs listed.
1.4 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 15.1)
1
for each parameter is listed in Table 1. The MDL for a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.
1.5 The sample extraction and concentration steps in this method are essentially the same as in Methods 606, 608, 609, 611, and 612. Thus, a single sample may be extracted to measure the parameters included in the scope of each of these methods. When cleanup is required, the concentration levels must be high enough to permit selecting aliquots, as necessary, to apply appropriate cleanup procedures. Selection of the aliquots must be made prior to the solvent exchange steps of this method. The analyst is allowed the latitude, under Sections 12 and 13, to select chromatographic conditions appropriate for the simultaneous measurement of combinations of these parameters.
1.6 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.
1.7 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of HPLC and GC systems and in the interpretation of liquid and gas chromatograms. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.

# 2. Summary of Method
2.1 A measured volume of sample, approximately 1-L, is extracted with methylene chloride using a separatory funnel. The methylene chloride extract is dried and concentrated to a volume of 10 mL or less. The extract is then separated by HPLC or GC. Ultraviolet (UV) and fluorescence detectors are used with HPLC to identify and measure the PAHs. A flame ionization detector is used with GC.
2
2.2 The method provides a silica gel column cleanup procedure to aid in the elimination of interferences that may be encountered.

# 3. Interferences
3.1 Method interferences may be caused by contaminants in solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardward that lead to discrete artifacts and/or elevated baselines in the chromatograms. All of these materials must be routinely demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3.
3.1.1 Glassware must be scrupulously cleaned.
3
Clean all glassware as soon as possible after use by rinsing with the last solvent used in it. Solvent rinsing should be followed by detergent washing with hot water, and rinses with tap water and distilled water. The glassware should then be drained dry, and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 °C for 15 to 30 min. Some thermally stable materials, such as PCBs, may not be eliminated by this treatment. Solvent rinses with acetone and pesticide quality hexane may be
substituted for the muffle furnace heating. Thorough rinsing with such solvents usually eliminates PCB interference. Volumetric ware should not be heated in a muffle furnace. After drying and cooling, glassware should be sealed and stored in a clean environment to prevent any accumulation of dust or other contaminants. Store inverted or capped with aluminum foil.
3.1.2 The use of high purity reagents and solvents helps to minimize interference problems. Purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.
3.2 Matrix interferences may be caused by contaminants that are co-extracted from the sample. The extent of matrix interferences will vary considerably from source to source, depending upon the nature and diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being sampled. The cleanup procedure in Section 11 can be used to overcome many of these interferences, but unique samples may require additional cleanup approaches to achieve the MDL listed in Table 1.
3.3 The extent of interferences that may be encountered using liquid chromatographic techniques has not been fully assessed. Although the HPLC conditions described allow for a unique resolution of the specific PAH compounds covered by this method, other PAH compounds may interfere.

# 4. Safety
4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method have not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified
4-6
for the information of the analyst.
4.2 The following parameters covered by this method have been tentatively classified as known or suspected, human or mammalian carcinogens: benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, and dibenzo(a,h)-anthracene. Primary standards of these toxic compounds should be prepared in a hood. A NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be worn when the analyst handles high concentrations of these toxic compounds.

# 5. Apparatus and Materials
5.1 Sampling equipment, for discrete or composite sampling.
5.1.1 Grab sample bottle—1-L or 1-qt, amber glass, fitted with a screw cap lined with Teflon. Foil may be substituted for Teflon if the sample is not corrosive. If amber bottles are not available, protect samples from light. The bottle and cap liner must be washed, rinsed with acetone or methylene chloride, and dried before use to minimize contamination.
5.1.2 Automatic sampler (optional)—The sampler must incorporate glass sample containers for the collection of a minimum of 250 mL of sample. Sample containers must be kept refrigerated at 4 °C and protected from light during compositing. If the sampler uses a peristaltic pump, a minimum length of compressible silicone rubber tubing may be used. Before use, however, the compressible tubing should be thoroughly rinsed with methanol, followed by repeated rinsings with distilled water to minimize the potential for contamination of the sample. An integrating flow meter is required to collect flow proportional composites.
5.2 Glassware (All specifications are suggested. Catalog numbers are included for illustration only.):
5.2.1 Separatory funnel—2-L, with Teflon stopcock.

5.4 Water bath—Heated, with concentric ring cover, capable of temperature control (±2 °C). The bath should be used in a hood.
5.5 Balance—Analytical, capable of accurately weighing 0.0001 g.
5.6 High performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC)—An analytical system complete with column supplies, high pressure syringes, detectors, and compatible strip-chart recorder. A data system is recommended for measuring peak areas and retention times.
5.6.1 Gradient pumping system—Constant flow.
5.6.2 Reverse phase column—HC-ODS Sil-X, 5 micron particle diameter, in a 25 cm × 2.6 mm ID stainless steel column (Perkin Elmer No. 089-0716 or equivalent). This column was used to develop the method performance statements in Section 15. Guidelines for the use of alternate column packings are provided in Section 12.2.
5.6.3 Detectors—Fluorescence and/or UV detectors. The fluorescence detector is used for excitation at 280 nm and emission greater than 389 nm cutoff (Corning 3-75 or equivalent). Fluorometers should have dispersive optics for excitation and can utilize either filter or dispersive optics at the emission detector. The UV detector is used at 254 nm and should be coupled to the fluorescence detector. These detectors were used to develop the method performance statements in Section 15. Guidelines for the use of alternate detectors are provided in Section 12.2.
5.7 Gas chromatograph—An analytical system complete with temperature programmable gas chromatograph suitable for on-column or splitless injection and all required accessories including syringes, analytical columns, gases, detector, and strip-chart recorder. A data system is recommended for measuring peak areas.
5.7.1 Column—1.8 m long × 2 mm ID glass, packed with 3% OV-17 on Chromosorb W-AW-DCMS (100/120 mesh) or equivalent. This column was used to develop the retention time data in Table 2. Guidelines for the use of alternate column packings are provided in Section 13.3.
5.7.2 Detector—Flame ionization detector. This detector has proven effective in the analysis of wastewaters for the parameters listed in the scope (Section 1.1), excluding the four pairs of unresolved compounds listed in Section 1.3. Guidelines for the use of alternate detectors are provided in Section 13.3.

# 6. Reagents
6.1 Reagent water—Reagent water is defined as a water in which an interferent is not observed at the MDL of the parameters of interest.
6.2 Sodium thiosulfate—(ACS) Granular.
6.3 Cyclohexane, methanol, acetone, methylene chloride, pentane—Pesticide quality or equivalent.
6.4 Acetonitrile—HPLC quality, distilled in glass.
6.5 Sodium sulfate—(ACS) Granular, anhydrous. Purify by heating at 400 °C for 4 h in a shallow tray.
6.6 Silica gel—100/200 mesh, desiccant, Davison, grade-923 or equivalent. Before use, activate for at least 16 h at 130 °C in a shallow glass tray, loosely covered with foil.
6.7 Stock standard solutions (1.00 µg/µL)—Stock standard solutions can be prepared from pure standard materials or purchased as certified solutions.
6.7.1 Prepare stock standard solutions by accurately weighing about 0.0100 g of pure material. Dissolve the material in acetonitrile and dilute to volume in a 10-mL volumetric flask. Larger volumes can be used at the convenience of the analyst. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight can be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock standard. Commercially prepared stock standards can be used at any concentration if they are certified by the manufacturer or by an independent source.
6.7.2 Transfer the stock standard solutions into Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottles. Store at 4 °C and protect from light. Stock standard solutions should be checked frequently for signs of degradation or evaporation, especially just prior to preparing calibration standards from them.
6.7.3 Stock standard solutions must be replaced after six months, or sooner if comparison with check standards indicates a problem.
6.8 Quality control check sample concentrate—See Section 8.2.1.

# 7. Calibration
7.1 Establish liquid or gas chromatographic operating conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1 or 2. The chromatographic system can be calibrated using the external standard technique (Section 7.2) or the internal standard technique (Section 7.3).
7.2 External standard calibration procedure:
7.2.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask and diluting to volume with acetonitrile. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 1) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.
7.2.2 Using injections of 5 to 25 µL for HPLC and 2 to 5 µL for GC, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 or 13, as appropriate. Tabulate peak height or area responses against the mass injected. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to amount injected (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (
10% relative standard deviation, RSD), linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.
7.3 Internal standard calibration procedure—To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the
compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can be suggested that is applicable to all samples.
7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask. To each calibration standard, add a known constant amount of one or more internal standards, and dilute to volume with acetonitrile. One of the standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.
7.3.2 Using injections of 5 to 25 µL for HPLC and 2 to 5 µL for GC, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 or 13, as appropriate. Tabulate peak height or area responses against concentration for each compound and internal standard. Calculate response factors (RF) for each compound using Equation 1.
EC15NO91.113
Equation 1
where:
A
s
= Response for the parameter to be measured.
A
is
= Response for the internal standard.
C
is
= Concentration of the internal standard (µg/L).
C
s
= Concentration of the parameter to be measured (µg/L).
If the RF value over the working range is a constant (
10% RSD), the RF can be assumed to be invariant and the average RF can be used for calculations. Alternatively, the results can be used to plot a calibration curve of response ratios, A
s
/A
is
, vs. RF.
7.4 The working calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be verified on each working day by the measurement of one or more calibration standards. If the response for any parameter varies from the predicted response by more than ±15%, the test must be repeated using a fresh calibration standard. Alternatively, a new calibration curve must be prepared for that compound.
7.5 Before using any cleanup procedure, the analyst must process a series of calibration standards through the procedure to validate elution patterns and the absence of interferences from the reagents.

# 8. Quality Control
8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.
8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.
8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Sections 10.4, 11.1, 12.2, and 13.3) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.
8.1.3 Before processing any samples the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system and glassware are under control. Each time a set of samples is extracted or reagents are changed a reagent water blank must be processed as a safeguard against laboratory contamination.
8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.
8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.
8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.
8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.
8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each parameter of interest at the following concentrations in acetonitrile: 100 µg/mL of any
of the six early-eluting PAHs (naphthalene, acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene, and anthracene); 5 µg/mL of benzo(k)fluoranthene; and 10 µg/mL of any of the other PAHs. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.
8.2.2 Using a pipet, prepare QC check samples at the test concentrations shown in Table 3 by adding 1.00 mL of QC check sample concentrate to each of four 1-L aliquots of reagent water.
8.2.3 Analyze the well-mixed QC check samples according to the method beginning in Section 10.
8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X
) in µg/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in µg/L, for each parameter using the four results.
8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X
with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively, found in Table 3. If s and X
for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X
falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter.

# Note:
The large number of parameters in Table 3 present a substantial probability that one or more will fail at least one of the acceptance criteria when all parameters are analyzed.
8.2.6 When one or more of the parameters tested fail at least one of the acceptance criteria, the analyst must proceed according to Section 8.2.6.1 or 8.2.6.2.
8.2.6.1 Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.
8.2.6.2 Beginning with Section 8.2.2, repeat the test only for those parameters that failed to meet criteria. Repeated failure, however, will confirm a general problem with the measurement system. If this occurs, locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all compounds of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.
8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.
8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:
8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at the test concentration in Section 8.2.2 or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.1.3 If it is impractical to determine background levels before spiking (e.g., maximum holding times will be exceeded), the spike concentration should be (1) the regulatory concentration limit, if any; or, if none, (2) the larger of either 5 times higher than the expected background concentration or the test concentration in Section 8.2.2.
8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second sample aliquot with 1.0 mL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100 (A−B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.
8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 3. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1.
7
If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than the test concentration in Section 8.2.2, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 3, or optional QC acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of a parameter: (1) Calculate accuracy (X′) using the equation in Table 4, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S′) using the equation in Table 4, substituting X′ for X
; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X′/T)±2.44(100 S′/T)%.
7
8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter
that failed the critiera must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.
8.4 If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.

# Note:
The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory. If the entire list of parameters in Table 3 must be measured in the sample in Section 8.3, the probability that the analysis of a QC check standard will be required is high. In this case the QC check standard should be routinely analyzed with the spike sample.
8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 1.0 mL of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 1 L of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.
8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P
s
) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.
8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (P
s
) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 3. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.
8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P
) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (s
p
). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P
-2s
p
to P
+ 2s
p
. If P
= 90% and s
p
= 10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).
8.6 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as gas chromatography with a dissimilar column, specific element detector, or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.

# 9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling
9.1 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers. Conventional sampling practices
8
should be followed, except that the bottle must not be prerinsed with sample before collection. Composite samples should be collected in refrigerated glass containers in accordance with the requirements of the program. Automatic sampling equipment must be as free as possible of Tygon tubing and other potential sources of contamination.
9.2 All samples must be iced or refrigerated at 4 °C from the time of collection until extraction. PAHs are known to be light sensitive; therefore, samples, extracts, and standards should be stored in amber or foil-wrapped bottles in order to minimize photolytic decomposition. Fill the sample bottles and, if residual chlorine is present, add 80 mg of sodium thiosulfate per liter of sample and mix well. EPA Methods 330.4 and 330.5 may be used for measurement of residual chlorine.
9
Field test kits are available for this purpose.
9.3 All samples must be extracted within 7 days of collection and completely analyzed within 40 days of extraction.
2

# 10. Sample Extraction
10.1 Mark the water meniscus on the side of the sample bottle for later determination of sample volume. Pour the entire sample into a 2-L separatory funnel.
10.2 Add 60 mL of methylene chloride to the sample bottle, seal, and shake 30 s to rinse the inner surface. Transfer the solvent to the separatory funnel and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for 2 min. with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Allow the organic layer to separate from the water phase for a minimum of 10 min. If the emulsion interface between layers is more than one-third the volume of the solvent layer, the analyst must employ mechanical techniques to complete the phase separation. The optimum technique depends upon the sample, but may include stirring, filtration of the emulsion through glass wool, centrifugation, or other physical methods. Collect the methylene chloride extract in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.
10.3 Add a second 60-mL volume of methylene chloride to the sample bottle and repeat the extraction procedure a second time, combining the extracts in the Erlenmeyer flask. Perform a third extraction in the same manner.
10.4 Assemble a Kuderna-Danish (K-D) concentrator by attaching a 10-mL concentrator tube to a 500-mL evaporative flask. Other concentration devices or techniques may be used in place of the K-D concentrator if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.
10.5 Pour the combined extract through a solvent-rinsed drying column containing about 10 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and collect the extract in the K-D concentrator. Rinse the Erlenmeyer flask and column with 20 to 30 mL of methylene chloride to complete the quantitative transfer.
10.6 Add one or two clean boiling chips to the evaporative flask and attach a three-ball Snyder column. Prewet the Snyder column by adding about 1 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 °C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water, and the entire lower rounded surface of the flask is bathed with hot vapor. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 15 to 20 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood with condensed solvent. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 1 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.
10.7 Remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of methylene chloride. A 5-mL syringe is recommended for this operation. Stopper the concentrator tube and store refrigerated if further processing will not be performed immediately. If the extract will be stored longer than two days, it should be transferred to a Teflon-sealed screw-cap vial and protected from light. If the sample extract requires no further cleanup, proceed with gas or liquid chromatographic analysis (Section 12 or 13). If the sample requires further cleanup, proceed to Section 11.
10.8 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to a 1000-mL graduated cylinder. Record the sample volume to the nearest 5 mL.

# 11. Cleanup and Separation
11.1 Cleanup procedures may not be necessary for a relatively clean sample matrix. If particular circumstances demand the use of a cleanup procedure, the analyst may use the procedure below or any other appropriate procedure. However, the analyst first must demonstrate that the requirements of Section 8.2 can be met using the methods as revised to incorporate the cleanup procedure.
11.2 Before the silica gel cleanup technique can be utilized, the extract solvent must be exchanged to cyclohexane. Add 1 to 10 mL of the sample extract (in methylene chloride) and a boiling chip to a clean K-D concentrator tube. Add 4 mL of cyclohexane and attach a two-ball micro-Snyder column. Prewet the column by adding 0.5 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the micro-K-D apparatus on a boiling (100 °C) water bath so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete concentration in 5 to 10 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood. When the apparent volume of the liquid reaches 0.5 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min. Remove the micro-Snyder column and rinse its lower joint into the concentrator tube with a minimum amount of cyclohexane. Adjust the extract volume to about 2 mL.
11.3 Silica gel column cleanup for PAHs:
11.3.1 Prepare a slurry of 10 g of activiated silica gel in methylene chloride and place this into a 10-mm ID chromatographic column. Tap the column to settle the silica gel and elute the methylene chloride. Add 1 to 2 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate to the top of the silica gel.
11.3.2 Preelute the column with 40 mL of pentane. The rate for all elutions should be about 2 mL/min. Discard the eluate and just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, transfer the 2-mL cyclohexane sample extract onto the column using an additional 2 mL cyclohexane to complete the transfer. Just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, add 25 mL of pentane and continue the elution of the column. Discard this pentane eluate.
11.3.3 Next, elute the column with 25 mL of methylene chloride/pentane (4 + 6)(V/V) into a 500-mL K-D flask equipped with a 10-mL concentrator tube. Concentrate the collected fraction to less than 10 mL as in Section 10.6. When the apparatus is cool, remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint with pentane. Proceed with HPLC or GC analysis.

# 12. High Performance Liquid Chromatography
12.1 To the extract in the concentrator tube, add 4 mL of acetonitrile and a new boiling chip, then attach a two-ball micro-Snyder column. Concentrate the solvent as in Section 10.6, except set the water bath at 95 to 100 °C. When the apparatus is cool, remove the micro-Snyder column and rinse its lower joint into the concentrator tube with about 0.2 mL of acetonitrile. Adjust the extract volume to 1.0 mL.
12.2 Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the HPLC. Included in this table are retention times, capacity factors, and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. The UV detector is recommended for the determination of naphthalene, acenaphthylene, acenapthene, and
fluorene and the fluorescence detector is recommended for the remaining PAHs. Examples of the separations achieved by this HPLC column are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Other HPLC columns, chromatographic conditions, or detectors may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.
12.3 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.
12.4 If the internal standard calibration procedure is being used, the internal standard must be added to the sample extract and mixed thoroughly immediately before injection into the instrument.
12.5 Inject 5 to 25 µL of the sample extract or standard into the HPLC using a high pressure syringe or a constant volume sample injection loop. Record the volume injected to the nearest 0.1 µL, and the resulting peak size in area or peak height units. Re-equilibrate the HPLC column at the initial gradient conditions for at least 10 min between injections.
12.6 Identify the parameters in the sample by comparing the retention time of the peaks in the sample chromatogram with those of the peaks in standard chromatograms. The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound can be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weigh heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.
12.7 If the response for a peak exceeds the working range of the system, dilute the extract with acetonitrile and reanalyze.
12.8 If the measurement of the peak response is prevented by the presence of interferences, further cleanup is required.

# 13. Gas Chromatography
13.1 The packed column GC procedure will not resolve certain isomeric pairs as indicated in Section 1.3 and Table 2. The liquid chromatographic procedure (Section 12) must be used for these parameters.
13.2 To achieve maximum sensitivity with this method, the extract must be concentrated to 1.0 mL. Add a clean boiling chip to the methylene chloride extract in the concentrator tube. Attach a two-ball micro-Snyder column. Prewet the micro-Snyder column by adding about 0.5 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the micro-K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 °C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 5 to 10 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 0.5 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min. Remove the micro-Snyder column and rinse its lower joint into the concentrator tube with a minimum amount of methylene chloride. Adjust the final volume to 1.0 mL and stopper the concentrator tube.
13.3 Table 2 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are retention times that were obtained under these conditions. An example of the separations achieved by this column is shown in Figure 3. Other packed or capillary (open-tubular) columns, chromatographic conditions, or detectors may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.
13.4 Calibrate the gas chromatographic system daily as described in Section 7.
13.5 If the internal standard calibration procedure is being used, the internal standard must be added to the sample extract and mixed thoroughly immediately before injection into the gas chromatograph.
13.6 Inject 2 to 5 µL of the sample extract or standard into the gas chromatograph using the solvent-flush technique.
10
Smaller (1.0 µL) volumes may be injected if automatic devices are employed. Record the volume injected to the nearest 0.05 µL, and the resulting peak size in area or peak height units.
13.7 Identify the parameters in the sample by comparing the retention times of the peaks in the sample chromatogram with those of the peaks in standard chromatograms. The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound can be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weigh heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.
13.8 If the response for a peak exceeds the working range of the system, dilute the extract and reanalyze.
13.9 If the measurement of the peak response is prevented by the presence of interferences, further cleanup is required.

# 14. Calculations
14.1 Determine the concentration of individual compounds in the sample.
14.1.1 If the external standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the amount of material injected from the peak response using the calibration curve or calibration factor determined in Section 7.2.2. The concentration in the sample can be calculated from Equation 2.

where:
A = Amount of material injected (ng).

= Volume of extract injected (µL).

13.1.2 If the internal standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the concentration in the sample using the response factor (RF) determined in Section 7.3.2 and Equation 3.

14.2 Report results in µg/L without correction for recovery data. All QC data obtained should be reported with the sample results.

# 15. Method Performance
15.1 The method detection limit (MDL) is defined as the minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence that the value is above zero.
1
The MDL concentrations listed in Table 1 were obtained using reagent water.
11
Similar results were achieved using representative wastewaters. MDL for the GC approach were not determined. The MDL actually achieved in a given analysis will vary depending on instrument sensitivity and matrix effects.
15.2 This method has been tested for linearity of spike recovery from reagent water and has been demonstrated to be applicable over the concentration range from 8 × MDL to 800 × MDL
11
with the following exception: benzo(ghi)perylene recovery at 80 × and 800 × MDL were low (35% and 45%, respectively).
15.3 This method was tested by 16 laboratories using reagent water, drinking water, surface water, and three industrial wastewaters spiked at six concentrations over the range 0.1 to 425 µg/L.
12
Single operator precision, overall precision, and method accuracy were found to be directly related to the concentration of the parameter and essentially independent of the sample matrix. Linear equations to describe these relationships are presented in Table 4.

1.2 This is a gas chromatographic (GC) method applicable to the determination of the compounds listed above in municipal and industrial discharges as provided under 40 CFR 136.1. When this method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for any or all of the compounds above, compound identifications should be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. This method describes analytical conditions for a second gas chromatographic column that can be used to confirm measurements made with the primary column. Method 625 provides gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative and quantitative confirmation of results for all of the parameters listed above, using the extract produced by this method.
1.3 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 14.1)
1
for each parameter is listed in Table 1. The MDL for a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.
1.4 The sample extraction and concentration steps in this method are essentially the same as in Methods 606, 608, 609, and 612. Thus, a single sample may be extracted to measure the parameters included in the scope of each of these methods. When cleanup is required, the concentration levels must be high enough to permit selecting aliquots, as necessary, to apply appropriate cleanup procedures. The analyst is allowed the latitude, under Section 12, to select
chromatographic conditions appropriate for the simultaneous measurement of combinations of these parameters.
1.5 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.
1.6 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of a gas chromatograph and in the interpretation of gas chromatograms. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.

# 2. Summary of Method
2.1 A measured volume of sample, approximately 1-L, is extracted with methylene chloride using a separatory funnel. The methylene chloride extract is dried and exchanged to hexane during concentration to a volume of 10 mL or less. The extract is separated by gas chromatography and the parameters are then measured with a halide specific detector.
2
2.2 The method provides a Florisil column cleanup procedure to aid in the elimination of interferences that may be encountered.

# 3. Interferences
3.1 Method interferences may be caused by contaminants in solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware that lead to discrete artifacts and/or elevated baselines in gas chromatograms. All of these materials must be routinely demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3.
3.1.1 Glassware must be scrupulously cleaned.
3
Clean all glassware as soon as possible after use by rinsing with the last solvent used in it. Solvent rinsing should be followed be detergent washing with hot water, and rinses with tap water and distilled water. The glassware should then be drained dry, and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 °C for 15 to 30 min. Some thermally stable materials, such a PCBs, may not be eliminated by this treatment. Solvent rinses with acetone and pesticide quality hexane may be substituted for the muffle furnace heating. Thorough rinsing with such solvents usually eliminates PCB interference. Volumetric ware should not be heated in a muffle furnace. After drying and cooling, glassware should be sealed and stored in a clean environment to prevent any accumulation of dust or other contaminants. Store inverted or capped with aluminum foil.
3.1.2 The use of high purity reagents and solvents helps to minimize interference problems. Purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.
3.2 Matrix interferences may be caused by contaminants that are co-extracted from the sample. The extent of matrix interferences will vary considerably from source to source, depending upon the nature and diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being sampled. The cleanup procedure in Section 11 can be used to overcome many of these interferences, but unique samples may require additional cleanup approaches to achieve the MDL listed in Table 1.
3.3 Dichlorobenzenes are known to coelute with haloethers under some gas chromatographic conditions. If these materials are present together in a sample, it may be necessary to analyze the extract with two different column packings to completely resolve all of the compounds.

# 4. Safety
4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified
4-6
for the information of the analyst.

# 5. Apparatus and Materials
5.1 Sampling equipment, for discrete or composite sampling.
5.1.1 Grab sample bottle—1-L or 1-qt, amber glass, fitted with a screw cap lined with Teflon. Foil may be substituted for Teflon if the sample is not corrosive. If amber bottles are not available, protect samples from light. The bottle and cap liner must be washed, rinsed with acetone or methylene chloride, and dried before use to minimize contamination.
5.1.2 Automatic sampler (optional)—The sampler must incorporate glass sample containers for the collection of a minimum of 250 mL of sample. Sample containers must be kept refrigerated at 4 °C and protected from light during compositing. If the sampler uses a peristaltic pump, a minimum length of compressible silicone rubber tubing may be used. Before use, however, the compressible tubing should be thoroughly rinsed with methanol, followed by repeated rinsings with distilled water to minimize the potential for contamination of the sample. An integrating
flow meter is required to collect flow proportional composites.
5.2 Glassware (All specifications are suggested. Catalog numbers are included for illustration only.):
5.2.1 Separatory funnel—2-L, with Teflon stopcock.
5.2.2 Drying column—Chromatographic column, approximately 400 mm long × 19 mm ID, with coarse frit filter disc.
5.2.3 Chromatographic column—400 mm long × 19 mm ID, with Teflon stopcock and coarse frit filter disc at bottom (Kontes K-420540-0224 or equivalent).
5.2.4 Concentrator tube, Kuderna-Danish—10-mL, graduated (Kontes K-570050-1025 or equivalent). Calibration must be checked at the volumes employed in the test. Ground glass stopper is used to prevent evaporation of extracts.
5.2.5 Evaporative flask, Kuderna-Danish—500-mL (Kontes K-570001-0500 or equivalent). Attach to concentrator tube with springs.
5.2.6 Snyder column, Kuderna-Danish—Three-ball macro (Kontes K-503000-0121 or equivalent).
5.2.7 Vials—10 to 15-mL, amber glass, with Teflon-lined screw cap.
5.3 Boiling chips—Approximately 10/40 mesh. Heat to 400 °C for 30 min or Soxhlet extract with methylene chloride.
5.4 Water bath—Heated, with concentric ring cover, capable of temperature control (±2 °C). The bath should be used in a hood.
5.5 Balance—Analytical, capable of accurately weighing 0.0001 g.
5.6 Gas chromatograph—An analytical system complete with temperature programmable gas chromatograph suitable for on-column injection and all required accessories including syringes, analytical columns, gases, detector, and strip-chart recorder. A data system is recommended for measuring peak areas.
5.6.1 Column 1—1.8 m long × 2 mm ID glass, packed with 3% SP-1000 on Supelcoport (100/120 mesh) or equivalent. This column was used to develop the method performance statements in Section 14. Guidelines for the use of alternate column packings are provided in Section 12.1.
5.6.2 Column 2—1.8 m long × 2 mm ID glass, packed with 2,6-diphenylene oxide polymer (60/80 mesh), Tenax, or equivalent.
5.6.3 Detector—Halide specific detector: electrolytic conductivity or microcoulometric. These detectors have proven effective in the analysis of wastewaters for the parameters listed in the scope (Section 1.1). The Hall conductivity detector was used to develop the method performance statements in Section 14. Guidelines for the use of alternate detectors are provided in Section 12.1. Although less selective, an electron capture detector is an acceptable alternative.

# 6. Reagents
6.1 Reagent water—Reagent water is defined as a water in which an interferent is not observed at the MDL of the parameters of interest.
6.2 Sodium thiosulfate—(ACS) Granular.
6.3 Acetone, hexane, methanol, methylene chloride, petroleum ether (boiling range 30-60 °C)—Pesticide quality or equivalent.
6.4 Sodium sulfate—(ACS) Granular, anhydrous. Purify by heating at 400 °C for 4 h in a shallow tray.
6.5 Florisil—PR Grade (60/100 mesh). Purchase activated at 1250 °F and store in the dark in glass containers with ground glass stoppers or foil-lined screw caps. Before use, activate each batch at least 16 h at 130 °C in a foil-covered glass container and allow to cool.
6.6 Ethyl ether—Nanograde, redistilled in glass if necessary.
6.6.1 Ethyl ether must be shown to be free of peroxides before it is used as indicated by EM Laboratories Quant test strips. (Available from Scientific Products Co., Cat. No. P1126-8, and other suppliers.)
6.6.2 Procedures recommended for removal of peroxides are provided with the test strips. After cleanup, 20 mL of ethyl alcohol preservative must be added to each liter of ether.
6.7 Stock standard solutions (1.00 µg/µL)—Stock standard solutions can be prepared from pure standard materials or purchased as certified solutions.
6.7.1 Prepare stock standard solutions by accurately weighing about 0.0100 g of pure material. Dissolve the material in acetone and dilute to volume in a 10-mL volumetric flask. Larger volumes can be used at the convenience of the analyst. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight can be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock standard. Commercially prepared stock standards can be used at any concentration if they are certified by the manufacturer or by an independent source.
6.7.2 Transfer the stock standard solutions into Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottles. Store at 4 °C and protect from light. Stock standard solutions should be checked frequently for signs of degradation or evaporation, especially just prior to preparing calibration standards from them.
6.7.3 Stock standard solutions must be replaced after six months, or sooner if comparison with check standards indicates a problem.
6.8 Quality control check sample concentrate—See Section 8.2.1.

# 7. Calibration
7.1 Establish gas chromatographic operating conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1. The gas chromatographic system
can be calibrated using the external standard technique (Section 7.2) or the internal standard technique (Section 7.3).
7.2 External standard calibration procedure:
7.2.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask and diluting to volume with hexane. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 1) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.
7.2.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 µL, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against the mass injected. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to amount injected (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (
10% relative standard deviation, RSD), linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.
7.3 Internal standard calibration procedure—To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can be suggested that is applicable to all samples.
7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask. To each calibration standard, add a known constant amount of one or more internal standards, and dilute to volume with hexane. One of the standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.
7.3.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 µL, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against concentration for each compound and internal standard. Calculate response factors (RF) for each compound using Equation 1.
EC15NO91.116

If the RF value over the working range is a constant (

/A
is
, vs. RF.
7.4 The working calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be verified on each working day by the measurement of one or more calibration standards. If the response for any parameter varies from the predicted response by more than ±15%, a new calibration curve must be prepared for that compound.
7.5 The cleanup procedure in Section 11 utilizes Florisil column chromatography. Florisil from different batches or sources may vary in adsorptive capacity. To standardize the amount of Florisil which is used, the use of lauric acid value
7
is suggested. The referenced procedure determines the adsorption from hexane solution of lauric acid (mg) per g of Florisil. The amount of Florisil to be used for each column is calculated by dividing 110 by this ratio and multiplying by 20 g.
7.6 Before using any cleanup procedure, the analyst must process a series of calibration standards through the procedure to validate elution patterns and the absence of interferences from the reagents.

# 8. Quality Control
8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.
8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.
8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Sections 10.4, 11.1, and 12.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.
8.1.3 Before processing any samples, the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system and glassware are under control. Each time a set of samples is extracted or reagents are changed, a reagent water blank must be processed as a safeguard against laboratory contamination.
8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.
8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.
8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.
8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.
8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each parameter of interest at a concentration of 100 µg/mL in acetone. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.
8.2.2 Using a pipet, prepare QC check samples at a concentration of 100 µg/L by adding 1.00 mL of QC check sample concentrate to each of four 1-L aliquots of reagent water.
8.2.3 Analyze the well-mixed QC check samples according to the method beginning in Section 10.
8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X
) in µg/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in µg/L, for each parameter using the four results.
8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X
with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively, found in Table 2. If s and X
for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X
falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter. Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.
8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.
8.3.1. The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:
8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at 100 µg/L or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.1.3 If it is impractical to determine background levels before spiking (e.g., maximum holding times will be exceeded), the spike concentration should be (1) the regulatory concentration limit, if any; or, if none (2) the larger of either 5 times higher than the expected background concentration or 100 µg/L.
8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second sample aliquot with 1.0 mL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100(A−B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.
8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1.
8
If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than 100 µg/L, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 2, or optional QC
acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of a parameter: (1) Calculate accuracy (X′) using the equation in Table 3, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S′) using the equation in Table 3, substituting X′ for X
; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X′/T)±2.44(100 S′/T)%.
8
8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.
8.4 If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.

# Note:
The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory.
8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 1.0 m/L of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 1 L of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.
8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P
s
) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.
8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (P
s
) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.
8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P
) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (s
p
). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P
-2s
p
to P
+ 2s
p
. If P
= 90% and s
p
= 10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).
8.6 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as gas chromatography with a dissimilar column, specific element detector, or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.

# 9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling
9.1 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers. Conventional sampling practices
9
should be followed, except that the bottle must not be prerinsed with sample before collection. Composite samples should be collected in refrigerated glass containers in accordance with the requirements of the program. Automatic sampling equipment must be as free as possible of Tygon tubing and other potential sources of contamination.
9.2 All samples must be iced or refrigerated at 4 °C from the time of collection until extraction. Fill the sample bottles and, if residual chlorine is present, add 80 mg of sodium thiosulfate per liter of sample and mix well. EPA Methods 330.4 and 330.5 may be used for measurement of residual chlorine.
10
Field test kits are available for this purpose.
9.3 All samples must be extracted within 7 days of collection and completely analyzed within 40 days of extraction.
2

# 10. Sample Extraction
10.1 Mark the water meniscus on the side of the sample bottle for later determination of sample volume. Pour the entire sample into a 2-L separatory funnel.
10.2 Add 60 mL methylene chloride to the sample bottle, seal, and shake 30 s to rinse the inner surface. Transfer the solvent to the separatory funnel and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for 2 min with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Allow the organic layer to separate from the water phase for a minimum of 10 min. If the emulsion interface between layers is more than one-third the volume of the solvent layer, the analyst must employ mechanical techniques to complete the phase separation. The optimum technique depends upon the sample, but may include stirring, filtration of the emulsion through glass wool, centrifugation, or other physical methods. Collect the methylene chloride extract in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.
10.3 Add a second 60-mL volume of methylene chloride to the sample bottle and repeat the extraction procedure a second time, combining the extracts in the Erlenmeyer flask. Perform a third extraction in the same manner.
10.4 Assemble a Kuderna-Danish (K-D) concentrator by attaching a 10-mL concentrator tube to a 500-mL evaporative flask. Other concentration devices or techniques may be used in place of the K-D concentrator if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.
10.5 Pour the combined extract through a solvent-rinsed drying column containing about 10 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and collect the extract in the K-D concentrator. Rinse the Erlenmeyer flask and column with 20 to 30 mL of methylene chloride to complete the quantitative transfer.
10.6 Add one or two clean boiling chips to the evaporative flask and attach a three-ball Snyder column. Prewet the Snyder column by adding about 1 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 °C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water, and the entire lower rounded surface of the flask is bathed with hot vapor. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 15 to 20 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood with condensed solvent. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 1 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.

# Note:
Some of the haloethers are very volatile and significant losses will occur in concentration steps if care is not exercised. It is important to maintain a constant gentle evaporation rate and not to allow the liquid volume to fall below 1 to 2 mL before removing the K-D apparatus from the hot water bath.
10.7 Momentarily remove the Snyder column, add 50 mL of hexane and a new boiling chip, and reattach the Snyder column. Raise the temperature of the water bath to 85 to 90 °C. Concentrate the extract as in Section 10.6, except use hexane to prewet the column. The elapsed time of concentration should be 5 to 10 min.
10.8 Remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of hexane. A 5-mL syringe is recommended for this operation. Stopper the concentrator tube and store refrigerated if further processing will not be performed immediately. If the extract will be stored longer than two days, it should be transferred to a Teflon-sealed screw-cap vial. If the sample extract requires no further cleanup, proceed with gas chromatographic analysis (Section 12). If the sample requires further cleanup, proceed to Section 11.
10.9 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to a 1000-mL graduated cylinder. Record the sample volume to the nearest 5 mL.

# 11. Cleanup and Separation
11.1 Cleanup procedures may not be necessary for a relatively clean sample matrix. If particular circumstances demand the use of a cleanup procedure, the analyst may use the procedure below or any other appropriate procedure. However, the analyst first must demonstrate that the requirements of Section 8.2 can be met using the method as revised to incorporate the cleanup procedure.
11.2 Florisil column cleanup for haloethers:
11.2.1 Adjust the sample extract volume to 10 mL.
11.2.2 Place a weight of Florisil (nominally 20 g) predetermined by calibration (Section 7.5), into a chromatographic column. Tap the column to settle the Florisil and add 1 to 2 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate to the top.
11.2.3 Preelute the column with 50 to 60 mL of petroleum ether. Discard the eluate and just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, quantitatively transfer the sample extract onto the column by decantation and subsequent petroleum ether washings. Discard the eluate. Just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, begin eluting the column with 300 mL of ethyl ether/petroleum ether (6 + 94) (V/V). Adjust the elution rate to approximately 5 mL/min and collect the eluate in a 500-mL K-D flask equipped with a 10-mL concentrator tube. This fraction should contain all of the haloethers.
11.2.4 Concentrate the fraction as in Section 10.6, except use hexane to prewet the column. When the apparatus is cool, remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with hexane. Adjust the volume of the cleaned up extract to 10 mL with hexane and analyze by gas chromatography (Section 12).

# 12. Gas Chromatography
12.1 Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are retention times and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. Examples of the separations achieved by Columns 1 and 2 are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. Other packed or capillary (open-tubular) columns, chromatographic conditions, or detectors may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.
12.2 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.
12.3 If the internal standard calibration procedure is being used, the internal standard must be added to the sample extract and mixed thoroughly immediately before injection into the gas chromatrograph.
12.4 Inject 2 to 5 µL of the sample extract or standard into the gas chromatograph using the solvent-flush technique.
11
Smaller (1.0 µL) volumes may be injected if automatic devices are employed. Record the volume injected to the nearest 0.05 µL, the total extract volume, and the resulting peak size in area or peak height units.
12.5 Identify the parameters in the sample by comparing the retention times of the peaks in the sample chromatogram with those of the peaks in standard chromatograms. The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound can be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weight heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.
12.6 If the response for a peak exceeds the working range of the system, dilute the extract and reanalyze.
12.7 If the measurement of the peak response is prevented by the presence of interferences, further cleanup is required.

# 13. Calculations
13.1 Determine the concentration of individual compounds in the sample.
13.1.1 If the external standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the amount of material injected from the peak response using the calibration curve or calibration factor determined in Section 7.2.2. The concentration in the sample can be calculated from Equation 2.
EC15NO91.117

where:
A = Amount of material injected (ng).
V
i
= Volume of extract injected (µL).
V
t
= Volume of total extract (µL).

13.1.2 If the internal standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the concentration in the sample using the response factor (RF) determined in Section 7.3.2 and Equation 3.
EC15NO91.118
Equation 3
where:

= Amount of internal standard added to each extract (µg).
V

= Volume of water extracted (L).
13.2 Report results in µg/L without correction for recovery data. All QC data obtained should be reported with the sample results.

# 14. Method Performance
14.1 The method detection limit (MDL) is defined as the minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence that the value is above zero.
1
The MDL concentrations listed in Table 1 were obtained using reagent water.
12
Similar results were achieved using representative wastewaters. The MDL actually achieved in a given analysis will vary depending on instrument sensitivity and matrix effects.
14.2 This method has been tested for linearity of spike recovery from reagent water and has been demonstrated to be applicable over the concentration range from 4 × MDL to 1000 × MDL.
12
14.3 This method was tested by 20 laboratories using reagent water, drinking water, surface water, and three industrial wastewaters spiked at six concentrations over the range 1.0 to 626 µ/L.
12
Single operator precision, overall precision, and method accuracy were found to be directly related to the concentration of the parameter and essentially independent of the sample matrix. Linear equations to describe these relationships are presented in Table 3.

1.2 This is a gas chromatographic (GC) method applicable to the determination of the compounds listed above in municipal and industrial discharges as provided under 40 CFR 136.1. When this method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for any or all of the compounds above, compound identifications should be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. This method describes a second gas chromatographic column that can be used to confirm measurements made with the primary column. Method 625 provides gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) conditions appropriate for the qualitative and quantitative confirmation of results for all of the parameters listed above, using the extract produced by this method.
1.3 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 14.1)
1
for each parameter is listed in Table 1. The MDL for a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.
1.4 The sample extraction and concentration steps in this method are essentially the same as in Methods 606, 608, 609, and 611. Thus, a single sample may be extracted to measure the parameters included in the scope of each of these methods. When cleanup is required, the concentration levels must be high enough to permit selecting aliquots, as necessary, to apply appropriate cleanup procedures. The analyst is allowed the latitude, under Section 12, to select chromatographic conditions appropriate for the simultaneous measurement of combinations of these parameters.
1.5 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.
1.6 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of a gas chromatograph and in the interpretation of gas chromatograms. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.

# 2. Summary of Method
2.1 A measured volume of sample, approximately 1-L, is extracted with methylene chloride using a separatory funnel. The methylene chloride extract is dried and exchanged to hexane during concentration to a volume of 10 mL or less. The extract is separated by gas chromatography and the parameters are then measured with an electron capture detector.
2
2.2 The method provides a Florisil column cleanup procedure to aid in the elimination of interferences that may be encountered.

# 3. Interferences
3.1 Method interferences may be caused by contaminants in solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware that lead to discrete artifacts and/or elevated baselines in gas chromatograms. All of these materials must be routinely demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3.
3.1.1 Glassware must be scrupulously cleaned.
3
Clean all glassware as soon as possible after use by rinsing with the last solvent used in it. Solvent rinsing should be followed by detergent washing with hot water, and rinses with tap water and distilled water. The glassware should then be drained dry, and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 °C for 15 to 30 min. Some thermally stable materials, such as PCBs, may not be eliminated by this treatment. Solvent rinses with acetone and pesticide quality hexane may be substituted for the muffle furnace heating. Thorough rinsing with such solvents usually eliminates PCB interference. Volumetric ware should not be heated in a muffle furnace. After drying and cooling, glassware should be sealed and stored in a clean environment to prevent any accumulation of dust or other contaminants. Store inverted or capped with aluminum foil.
3.1.2 The use of high purity reagents and solvents helps to minimize interference problems. Purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.
3.2 Matrix interferences may be caused by contaminants that are co-extracted from the sample. The extent of matrix interferences will vary considerably from source to source, depending upon the nature and diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being sampled. The cleanup procedure in Section 11 can be used to overcome many of these interferences, but unique samples may require additional cleanup approaches to achieve the MDL listed in Table 1.

# 4. Safety
4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all
personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified
4-6
for the information of the analyst.

# 5. Apparatus and Materials
5.1 Sampling equipment, for discrete or composite sampling.
5.1.1 Grab sample bottle—1cL or 1-qt, amber glass, fitted with a screw cap lined with Teflon. Foil may be substituted for Teflon if the sample is not corrosive. If amber bottles are not available, protect samples from light. The bottle and cap liner must be washed, rinsed with acetone or methylene chloride, and dried before use to minimize contamination.
5.1.2 Automatic sampler (optional)—The sampler must incorporate glass sample containers for the collection of a minimum of 250 mL of sample. Sample containers must be kept refrigerated at 4 °C and protected from light during compositing. If the sampler uses a peristaltic pump, a minimum length of compressible silicone rubber tubing may be used. Before use, however, the compressible tubing should be thoroughly rinsed with methanol, followed by repeated rinsings with distilled water to minimize the potential for contamination of the sample. An integrating flow meter is required to collect flow proportional composites.
5.2 Glassware (All specifications are suggested. Catalog numbers are included for illustration only.):
5.2.1 Separatory funnel—2-L, with Teflon stopcock.
5.2.2 Drying column—Chromatographic column, approximately 400 mm long × 19 mm ID, with coarse frit filter disc.
5.2.3 Chromatographic column—300 long × 10 mm ID, with Teflon stopcock and coarse frit filter disc at bottom.
5.2.4 Concentrator tube, Kuderna-Danish—10-mL, graduated (Kontes K-570050-1025 or equivalent). Calibration must be checked at the volumes employed in the test. Ground glass stopper is used to prevent evaporation of extracts.
5.2.5 Evaporative flask, Kuderna-Danish—500-mL (Kontes K-570001-0500 or equivalent). Attach to concentrator tube with springs.
5.2.6 Snyder column, Kuderna-Danish—Three-ball macro (Kontes K-503000-0121 or equivalent).
5.2.7 Vials—10 to 15-mL, amber glass, with Teflon-lined screw cap.
5.3 Boiling chips—Approximately 10/40 mesh. Heat to 400 °C for 30 min or Soxhlet extract with methylene chloride.
5.4 Water bath—Heated, with concentric ring cover, capable of temperature control (±2 °C). The bath should be used in a hood.
5.5 Balance—Analytical, capable of accurately weighing 0.0001 g.
5.6 Gas chromatograph—An analytical system complete with gas chromatograph suitable for on-column injection and all required accessories including syringes, analytical columns, gases, detector, and strip-chart recorder. A data system is recommended for measuring peak areas.
5.6.1 Column 1—1.8 m long × 2 mm ID glass, packed with 1% SP-1000 on Supelcoport (100/120 mesh) or equivalent. Guidelines for the use of alternate column packings are provide in Section 12.1.
5.6.2 Column 2—1.8 m long × 2 mm ID glass, packed with 1.5% OV-1/2.4% OV-225 on Supelcoport (80/100 mesh) or equivalent. This column was used to develop the method performance statements in Section 14.
5.6.3 Detector—Electron capture detector. This detector has proven effective in the analysis of wastewaters for the parameters listed in the scope (Section 1.1), and was used to develop the method performance statements in Section 14. Guidelines for the use of alternate detectors are provided in Section 12.1.

# 6. Reagents
6.1 Reagent water—Reagent water is defined as a water in which an interferent is not observed at the MDL of the parameters of interest.
6.2 Acetone, hexane, isooctane, methanol, methylene chloride, petroleum ether (boiling range 30 to 60 °C)—Pesticide quality or equivalent.
6.3 Sodium sulfate—(ACS) Granular, anhydrous. Purify heating at 400 °C for 4 h in a shallow tray.
6.4 Florisil—PR grade (60/100 mesh). Purchase activated at 1250 °F and store in the dark in glass containers with ground glass stoppers or foil-lined screw caps. Before use, activate each batch at least 16 h at 130 °C in a foil-covered glass container and allow to cool.
6.5 Stock standard solution (1.00 µg/µL)—Stock standard solutions can be prepared from pure standard materials or purchased as certified solutions.
6.5.1 Prepare stock standard solutions by accurately weighing about 0.0100 g of pure material. Dissolve the material in isooctane and dilute to volume in a 120-mL volumetric flask. Larger volumes can be used at the convenience of the analyst. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight can be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock standard. Commercially prepared stock standards can be used at any concentration if they are certified by the manufacturer or by an independent source.
6.5.2 Transfer the stock standard solutions into Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottles. Store at 4 °C and protect from light. Stock standard solutions should be checked frequently for signs of degradation or evaporation, especially just prior to preparing calibration standards from them.
6.5.3 Stock standard solutions must be replaced after six months, or sooner if comparision with check standards indicates a problem.
6.6 Quality control check sample concentrate—See Section 8.2.1.

# 7. Calibration
7.1 Establish gas chromatographic operating conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1. The gas chromatographic system can be calibrated using the external standard technique (Section 7.2) or the internal standard technique (Section 7.3).
7.2 External standard calibration procedure:
7.2.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask and diluting to volume with isooctane. One of the external standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL (Table 1) and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.
7.2.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 µL, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against the mass injected. The results can be used to prepare a calibration curve for each compound. Alternatively, if the ratio of response to amount injected (calibration factor) is a constant over the working range (
10% relative standard deviation, RSD), linearity through the origin can be assumed and the average ratio or calibration factor can be used in place of a calibration curve.
7.3 Internal standard calibration procedure—To use this approach, the analyst must select one or more internal standards that are similar in analytical behavior to the compounds of interest. The analyst must further demonstrate that the measurement of the internal standard is not affected by method or matrix interferences. Because of these limitations, no internal standard can be suggested that is applicable to all samples.
7.3.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of three concentration levels for each parameter of interest by adding volumes of one or more stock standards to a volumetric flask. To each calibration standard, add a known constant amount of one or more internal standards, and dilute to volume with isooctane. One of the standards should be at a concentration near, but above, the MDL and the other concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the detector.
7.3.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 µL, analyze each calibration standard according to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area responses against concentration for each compound and internal standard. Calculate response factors (RF) for each compound using Equation 1.
EC15NO91.119
Equation 1
where:
A
s
= Response for the parameter to be measured.
A
is
= Response for the internal standard.
C
is
= Concentration of the internal standard (µg/L).
C
s
= Concentration of the parameter to be measured (µg/L).
If the RF value over the working range is a constant (
10% RSD), the RF can be assumed to be invariant and the average RF can be used for calculations. Alternatively, the results can be used to plot a calibration curve of response ratios, A
s
/A
is
, vs. RF.
7.4 The working calibration curve, calibration factor, or RF must be verified on each working day by the measurement of one or more calibration standards. If the response for any parameter varies from the predicted response by more than ±15%, a new calibration curve must be prepared for that compound.
7.5 Before using any cleanup procedure, the analyst must process a series of calibration standards through the procedure to validate elution patterns and the absence of interferences from the reagents.

# 8. Quality Control
8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When the results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.
8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.
8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Sections 10.4, 11.1, and 12.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2.
8.1.3 Before processing any samples, the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system and glassware are under control. Each time a set of samples is extracted or reagents are changed, a reagent water blank must be processed as a safeguard against laboratory contamination.
8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.
8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.
8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.
8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.
8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing each parameter of interest at the following concentrations in acetone: Hexachloro-substituted parameters, 10 µg/mL; any other chlorinated hydrocarbon, 100 µg/mL. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.
8.2.2 Using a pipet, prepare QC check samples at the test concentrations shown in Table 2 by adding 1.00 mL of QC check sample concentrate to each of four 1-L aliquots of reagent water.
8.2.3 Analyze the well-mixed QC check samples according to the method beginning in Section 10.
8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X
) in µg/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in µg/L, for each parameter using the four results.
8.2.5 For each parameter compare s and X
with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively, found in Table 2. If s and X
for all parameters of interest meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X
falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for that parameter.

# Note:
The large number of parameters in Table 2 presents a substantial probability that one or more will fail at least one of the acceptance criteria when all parameters are analyzed.
8.2.6 When one or more of the parameters tested fail at least one of the acceptance criteria, the analyst must proceed according to Section 8.2.6.1 or 8.2.6.2.
8.2.6.1 Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.
8.2.6.2 Beginning with Section 8.2.2, repeat the test only for those parameters that failed to meet criteria. Repeated failure, however, will confirm a general problem with the measurement system. If this occurs, locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all compounds of interest beginning with Section 8.2.2.
8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spike sample per month is required.
8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:
8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.1.2 If the concentration of a specific parameter in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at the test concentration in Section 8.2.2 or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.1.3 If it is impractical to determine background levels before spiking (e.g., maximum holding times will be exceeded), the spike concentration should be (1) the regulatory concentration limit, if any; or, if none by (2) the larger of either 5 times higher than the expected background concentration or the test concentration in Section 8.2.2.
8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of each parameter. In necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentrations in the sample. Spike a second sample aliquot with 1.0 mL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P) as 100 (A−B)%/T, where T is the known true value of the spike.
8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1.
7
If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than the test concentration in Section 8.2.2, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 2, or optional QC acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of a parameter: (1) Calculate accuracy (X′) using the equation in Table 3, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S′) using the equation in Table 3, substituting X′ for X
; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X′/T) ±2.44 (100 S′/T)%.
7
8.3.4 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery, that parameter has failed the acceptance criteria. A check standard containing each parameter that failed the criteria must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.
8.4. If any parameter fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard containing each parameter that failed must be prepared and analyzed.

# Note:
The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the number of parameters being simultaneously tested, the complexity of the sample matrix, and the performance of the laboratory.
8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 1.0 mL of QC check sample concentrate (Sections 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 1 L of reagent water. The QC check standard needs only to contain the parameters that failed criteria in the test in Section 8.3.
8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of each parameter. Calculate each percent recovery (P
s
) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.
8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (P
s
) for each parameter with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. Only parameters that failed the test in Section 8.3 need to be compared with these criteria. If the recovery of any such parameter falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance for that parameter is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for that parameter in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.
8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P
) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (s
p
). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P−2s
p
to P + 2s
p
. If P = 90% and s
p
= 10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each parameter on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).
8.6 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. When doubt exists over the identification of a peak on the chromatogram, confirmatory techniques such as gas chromatography with a dissimilar column, specific element detector, or mass spectrometer must be used. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevent performance evaluation studies.

# 9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling
9.1 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers. Conventional sampling practices
8
should be followed, except that the bottle must not be prerinsed with sample before collection. Composite samples should be collected in refrigerated glass containers in accordance with the requirements of the program. Automatic sampling equipment must be as free as possible of Tygon tubing and other potential sources of contamination.
9.2 All samples must be iced or refrigerated at 4 °C from the time of collection until extraction.
9.3 All samples must be extracted within 7 days of collection and completely analyzed within 40 days of extraction.
2

# 10. Sample Extraction
10.1 Mark the water meniscus on the side of the sample bottle for later determination of sample volume. Pour the entire sample into a 2-L separatory funnel.
10.2 Add 60 mL of methylele chloride to the sample bottle, seal, and shake 30 s to rinse the inner surface. Transfer the solvent to the separatory funnel and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for 2 min with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Allow the organic layer to separate from the water phase for a minimum of 10 min. If the emulsion interface between layers is more than one-third the volume of the solvent layer, the analyst must employ mechanical techniques to complete the phase separation. The optimum technique depends upon the sample, but may include stirring, filtration of the emulsion through glass wool, centrifugation, or other physical methods. Collect the methylene chloride extract in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.
10.3 Add a second 60-mL volume of methylene chloride to the sample bottle and repeat the extraction procedure a second time, combining the extracts in the Erlenmeyer flask. Perform a third extraction in the same manner.
10.4 Assemble a Kuderna-Danish (K-D) concentrator by attaching a 10-mL concentrator tube to a 500-mL evaporative flask. Other concentration devices or techniques may be used in place of the K-D concentrator if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.
10.5 Pour the combined extract through a solvent-rinsed drying column containing about 10 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and collect the extract in the K-D concentrator. Rinse the Erlenmeyer flask and column with 20 to 30 mL of methylene chloride to complete the quantitative transfer.
10.6 Add one or two clean boiling chips to the evaporative flask and attach a three-ball Snyder column. Prewet the Snyder column by adding about 1 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 °C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water, and the entire lower rounded surface of the flask is bathed with hot vapor. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 15 to 20 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood with condensed solvent. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 1 to 2 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.

# Note:
The dichloribenzenes have a sufficiently high volatility that significant losses may occur in concentration steps if care is not exercised. It is important to maintain a constant gentle evaporation rate and not to allow the liquid volume to fall below 1 to 2 mL before removing the K-D apparatus from the hot water bath.
10.7 Momentarily remove the Snyder column, add 50 mL of hexane and a new boiling chip, and reattach the Snyder column. Raise the tempeature of the water bath to 85 to 90 °C. Concentrate the extract as in Section 10.6, except use hexane to prewet the column. The elapsed time of concentration should be 5 to 10 min.
10.8 Romove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of hexane. A 5-mL syringe is recommended for this operation. Stopper the concentrator tube and store refrigerated if further processing will not be performed immediately. If the extract will be stored longer than two days, it should be transferred to a Teflon-sealed screw-cap vial. If the sample extract requires no further cleanup, proceed with gas chromatographic analysis (Section 12). If the sample requires further cleanup, proceed to Section 11.
10.9 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to a 1000-mL graduated cylinder. Record the sample volume to the nearest 5 mL.

# 11. Cleanup and Separation
11.1 Cleanup procedures may not be necessary for a relatively clean sample matrix. If particular circumstances demand the use of a cleanup procedure, the analyst may use the procedure below or any other appropriate procedure. However, the analyst first must demonstrate that the requirements of Section 8.2 can be met using the method as revised to incorporate the cleanup procedure.
11.2 Florisil column cleanup for chlorinated hydrocarbons:
11.2.1 Adjust the sample extract to 10 mL with hexane.
11.2.2 Place 12 g of Florisil into a chromatographic column. Tap the column to settle the Florisil and add 1 to 2 cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate to the top.
11.2.3 Preelute the column with 100 mL of petroleum ether. Discard the eluate and just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, quantitatively transfer the sample extract onto the column by decantation and subsequent petroleum ether washings. Discard the eluate. Just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, begin eluting the column with 200 mL of petroleum ether and collect the eluate in a 500-mL K-D flask equipped with a 10-mL concentrator tube. This fraction should contain all of the chlorinated hydrocarbons.
11.2.4 Concentrate the fraction as in Section 10.6, except use hexane to prewet the column. When the apparatus is cool, remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with hexane. Analyze by gas chromatography (Section 12).

# 12. Gas Chromatography
12.1 Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are retention times and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. Examples of the separations achieved by Columl 2 are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Other packed or capillary (open-tubular) columns, chromatographic conditions, or detectors may be used if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.
12.2 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.
12.3 If the internal standard calibration procedure is being used, the internal standard must be added to the sample extract and mixed throughly immediately before injection into the gas chromatograph.
12.4 Inject 2 to 5 µL of the sample extract or standard into the gas chromatograph using the solvent-flush techlique.
9
Smaller (1.0 µL) volumes may be injected if automatic devices are employed. Record the volume injected to the nearest 0.05 µL, the total extract volume, and the resulting peak size in area or peak height units.
12.5 Identify the parameters in the sample by comparing the retention times of the peaks in the sample chromatogram with those of the peaks in standard chromatograms. The width of the retention time window used to make identifications should be based upon measurements of actual retention time variations of standards over the course of a day. Three times the standard deviation of a retention time for a compound can be used to calculate a suggested window size; however, the experience of the analyst should weigh heavily in the interpretation of chromatograms.
12.6 If the response for a peak exceeds the working range of the system, dilute the extract and reanalyze.
12.7 If the measurement of the peak response is prevented by the presence of interferences, further cleanup is required.

# 13. Calculations
13.1 Determine the concentration of individual compounds in the sample.
13.1.1 If the external standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the amount of material injected from the peak response using the calibration curve or calibration factor determined in Section 7.2.2. The concentration in the sample can be calculated from Equation 2.
EC15NO91.120

where:
A = Amount of material injected (ng).
V
i
= Volume of extract injected (µL).
V
t
= Volume of total extract (µL).

= Volume of water extracted (mL).
13.1.2 If the internal standard calibration procedure is used, calculate the concentration in the sample using the response factor (RF) determined in Section 7.3.2 and Equation 3.
EC15NO91.121
Equation 3
where:
A
s
= Response for the parameter to be measured.
A
is

I
s
= Amount of internal standard added to each extract (µg).
V
o
= Volume of water extracted (L).
13.2 Report results in µg/L without correction for recovery data. All QC data obtained should be reported with the sample results.

# 14. Method Performance
14.1 The method detection limit (MDL) is defined as the minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence that the value is above zero.
1
The MDL concentrations listed in Table 1 were obtained using reagent water.
10
Similar results were achieved using representative wastewaters. The MDL actually achieved in a given analysis will vary depending on instrument sensitivity and matrix effects.
14.2 This method has been tested for linearity of spike recovery from reagent water and has been demonstrated to be applicable over the concentration range from 4 × MDL to 1000 × MDL.
10
14.3 This method was tested by 20 laboratories using reagent water, drinking water, surface water, and three industrial wastewaters spiked at six concentrations over the range 1.0 to 356 µg/L.
11
Single operator precision, overall precision, and method accuracy were found to be directly related to the concentration of the parameter and essentially independent of the sample matrix. Linear equations to describe these relationships are presented in Table 3.

# Method 613—2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-Dioxin
Pt. 136, App. A, Meth. 613

# 1. Scope and Application
1.1 This method covers the determination of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD). The following parameter may be determined by this method:
Parameter
STORET No.
GAS No.
2,3,7,8-TCDD
34675
1746-01-6
1.2 This is a gas chromatographic/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) method applicable to the determination of 2,3,7,8-TCDD in municipal and industrial discharges as provided under 40 CFR 136.1. Method 625 may be used to screen samples for 2,3,7,8-TCDD. When the screening test is positive, the final qualitative confirmation and quantification must be made using Method 613.
1.3 The method detection limit (MDL, defined in Section 14.1)
1
for 2,3,7,8-TCDD is listed in Table 1. The MDL for a specific wastewater may be different from that listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.
1.4 Because of the extreme toxicity of this compound, the analyst must prevent exposure to himself, of to others, by materials knows or believed to contain 2,3,7,8-TCDD. Section 4 of this method contains guidelines and protocols that serve as minimum safe-handling standards in a limited-access laboratory.
1.5 Any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted, shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternate test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.
1.6 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer and in the interpretation of mass spectra. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure described in Section 8.2.

# 2. Summary of Method
2.1 A measured volume of sample, approximately 1-L, is spiked with an internal standard of labeled 2,3,7,8-TCDD and extracted with methylene chloride using a separatory funnel. The methylene chloride extract is exchanged to hexane during concentration to a volume of 1.0 mL or less. The extract is then analyzed by capillary column GC/MS to separate and measure 2,3,7,8-TCDD.
2 3
2.2 The method provides selected column chromatographic cleanup proceudres to aid in the elimination of interferences that may be encountered.

# 3. Interferences
3.1 Method interferences may be caused by contaminants in solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware that lead to discrete artifacts and/or elevated backgrounds at the masses (m/z) monitored. All of these materials must be routinely demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of the analysis by running laboratory reagent blanks as described in Section 8.1.3.
3.1.1 Glassware must be scrupulously cleaned.
4
Clean all glassware as soon as possible after use by rinsing with the last solvent used in it. Solvent rinsing should be followed by detergent washing with hot water, and rinses with tap water and distilled water. The glassware should then be drained dry, and heated in a muffle furnace at 400 °C for 15 to 30 min. Some thermally stable materials, such as PCBs, may not be eliminated by the treatment. Solvent rinses with acetone and pesticide quality hexane may be substituted for the muffle furnace heating. Thorough rinsing with such solvents usually eliminates PCB interference. Volumetric ware should not be heated in a muffle furnace. After drying and cooling, glassware should be sealed and stored in a clean environment to prevent any accumulation of dust or other contaminants. Store inverted or capped with aluminum foil.
3.1.2 The use of high purity reagents and solvents helps to mininmize interference problems. Purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.
3.2 Matrix interferences may be caused by contaminants that are coextracted from the sample. The extent of matrix interferences will vary considerably from source to source, depending upon the nature and diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being sampled. 2,3,7,8-TCDD is often associated with other interfering chlorinated compounds which are at concentrations several magnitudes higher than that of 2,3,7,8-TCDD. The cleanup producers in Section 11 can be used to overcome many of these interferences, but unique samples may require additional cleanup approaches
1 5-7
to eliminate false positives and achieve the MDL listed in Table 1.
3.3 The primary column, SP-2330 or equivalent, resolves 2,3,7,8-TCDD from the other 21 TCDD insomers. Positive results using any other gas chromatographic column must be confirmed using the primary column.

# 4. Safety
4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to
the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material data handling sheets should also be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified
8-10
for the information of the analyst. Benzene and 2,3,7,8-TCDD have been identified as suspected human or mammalian carcinogens.
4.2 Each laboratory must develop a strict safety program for handling 2,3,7,8-TCDD. The following laboratory practices are recommended:
4.2.1 Contamination of the laboratory will be minimized by conducting all manipulations in a hood.
4.2.2 The effluents of sample splitters for the gas chromatograph and roughing pumps on the GC/MS should pass through either a column of activated charcoal or be bubbled through a trap containing oil or high-boiling alcohols.
4.2.3 Liquid waste should be dissolved in methanol or ethanol and irradiated with ultraviolet light with a wavelength greater than 290 nm for several days. (Use F 40 BL lamps or equivalent). Analyze liquid wastes and dispose of the solutions when 2,3,7,8-TCDD can no longer be detected.
4.3 Dow Chemical U.S.A. has issued the following precautimns (revised November 1978) for safe handling of 2,3,7,8-TCDD in the laboratory:
4.3.1 The following statements on safe handling are as complete as possible on the basis of available toxicological information. The precautions for safe handling and use are necessarily general in nature since detailed, specific recommendations can be made only for the particular exposure and circumstances of each individual use. Inquiries about specific operations or uses may be addressed to the Dow Chemical Company. Assistance in evaluating the health hazards of particular plant conditions may be obtained from certain consulting laboratories and from State Departments of Health or of Labor, many of which have an industrial health service. 2,3,7,8-TCDD is extremely toxic to laboratory animals. However, it has been handled for years without injury in analytical and biological laboratories. Techniques used in handling radioactive and infectious materials are applicable to 2,3,7,8,-TCDD.
4.3.1.1 Protective equipment—Throw-away plastic gloves, apron or lab coat, safety glasses, and a lab hood adequate for radioactive work.
4.3.1.2 Training—Workers must be trained in the proper method of removing contaminated gloves and clothing without contacting the exterior surfaces.
4.3.1.3 Personal hygiene—Thorough washing of hands and forearms after each manipulation and before breaks (coffee, lunch, and shift).
4.3.1.4 Confinement—Isolated work area, posted with signs, segregated glassware and tools, plastic-backed absorbent paper on benchtops.
4.3.1.5 Waste—Good technique includes minimizing contaminated waste. Plastic bag liners should be used in waste cans. Janitors must be trained in the safe handling of waste.
4.3.1.6 Disposal of wastes—2,3,7,8-TCDD decomposes above 800 °C. Low-level waste such as absorbent paper, tissues, animal remains, and plastic gloves may be burned in a good incinerator. Gross quantities (milligrams) should be packaged securely and disposed through commercial or governmental channels which are capable of handling high-level radioactive wastes or extremely toxic wastes. Liquids should be allowed to evaporate in a good hood and in a disposable container. Residues may then be handled as above.
4.3.1.7 Decontamination—For personal decontamination, use any mild soap with plenty of scrubbing action. For decontamination of glassware, tools, and surfaces, Chlorothene NU Solvent (Trademark of the Dow Chemical Company) is the least toxic solvent shown to be effective. Satisfactory cleaning may be accomplished by rinsing with Chlorothene, then washing with any detergent and water. Dishwater may be disposed to the sewer. It is prudent to minimize solvent wastes because they may require special disposal through commercial sources which are expensive.
4.3.1.8 Laundry—Clothing known to be contaminated should be disposed with the precautions described under Section 4.3.1.6. Lab coats or other clothing worn in 2,3,7,8-TCDD work areas may be laundered.
Clothing should be collected in plastic bags. Persons who convey the bags and launder the clothing should be advised of the hazard and trained in proper handling. The clothing may be put into a washer without contact if the launderer knows the problem. The washer should be run through a cycle before being used again for other clothing.
4.3.1.9 Wipe tests—A useful method of determining cleanliness of work surfaces and tools is to wipe the surface with a piece of filter paper. Extraction and analysis by gas chromatography can achieve a limit of sensitivity of 0.1 µg per wipe. Less than 1 µg of 2,3,7,8-TCDD per sample indicates acceptable cleanliness; anything higher warrants further cleaning. More than 10 µg on a wipe sample constitutes an acute hazard and requires prompt cleaning before further use of the equipment or work space. A high (
10 µg)
2,3,7,8-TCDD level indicates that unacceptable work practices have been employed in the past.
4.3.1.10 Inhalation—Any procedure that may produce airborne contamination must be done with good ventilation. Gross losses to a ventilation system must not be allowed. Handling of the dilute solutions normally used in analytical and animal work presents no inhalation hazards except in the case of an accident.
4.3.1.11 Accidents—Remove contaminated clothing immediately, taking precautions not to contaminate skin or other articles. Wash exposed skin vigorously and repeatedly until medical attention is obtained.

# 5. Apparatus and Materials
5.1 Sampling equipment, for discrete or composite sampling.
5.1.1 Grab sample bottle—1-L or 1-qt, amber glass, fitted with a screw cap lined with Teflon. Foil may be substituted for Teflon if the sample is not corrosive. If amber bottles are not available, protect samples from light. The bottle and cap liner must be washed, rinsed with acetone or methylene chloride, and dried before use to minimize contamination.
5.1.2 Automatic sampler (optional)—The sampler must incorporate glass sample containers for the collection of a minimum of 250 mL of sample. Sample containers must be kept refrigerated at 4 °C and protected from light during compositing. If the sampler uses a peristaltic pump, a minimum length of compressible silicone rubber tubing may be used. Before use, however, the compressible tubing should be thoroughly rinsed with methanol, followed by repeated rinsings with distilled water to minimize the potential for contamination of the sample. An integrating flow meter is required to collect flow proportional composites.
5.1.3 Clearly label all samples as “POISON” and ship according to U.S. Department of Transportation regulations.
5.2 Glassware (All specifications are suggested. Catalog numbers are included for illustration only.):
5.2.1 Separatory funnels—2-L and 125-mL, with Teflon stopcock.
5.2.2 Concentrator tube, Kuderna-Danish—10-mL, graduated (Kontes K-570050-1025 or equivalent). Calibration must be checked at the volumes employed in the test. Ground glass stopper is used to prevent evaporation of extracts.
5.2.3 Evaporative flask, Kuderna-Danish—500-mL (Kontes K-570001-0500 or equivalent). Attach to concentrator tube with springs.
5.2.4 Snyder column, Kuderna-Danish—Three-ball macro (Kontes K-503000-0121 or equivalent).
5.2.5 Snyder column, Kuderna-Danish—Two-ball micro (Kontes K-569001-0219 or equivalent).
5.2.6 Vials—10 to 15-mL, amber glass, with Teflon-lined screw cap.
5.2.7 Chromatographic column—300 mm long × 10 mm ID, with Teflon stopcock and coarse frit filter disc at bottom.
5.2.8 Chromatographic column—400 mm long × 11 mm ID, with Teflon stopcock and coarse frit filter disc at bottom.
5.3 Boiling chips—Approximately 10/40 mesh. Heat to 400 °C for 30 min or Soxhlet extract with methylene chloride.
5.4 Water bath—Heated, with concentric ring cover, capable of temperature control (±2 °C). The bath should be used in a hood.
5.5 GC/MS system:
5.5.1 Gas chromatograph—An analytical system complete with a temperature programmable gas chromatograph and all required accessories including syringes, analytical columns, and gases. The injection port must be designed for capillary columns. Either split, splitless, or on-column injection techniques may be employed, as long as the requirements of Section 7.1.1 are achieved.
5.5.2 Column—60 m long × 0.25 mm ID glass or fused silica, coated with SP-2330 (or equivalent) with a film thickness of 0.2 µm. Any equivalent column must resolve 2, 3, 7, 8-TCDD from the other 21 TCDD isomers.
16
5.5.3 Mass spectrometer—Either a low resolution mass spectrometer (LRMS) or a high resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS) may be used. The mass spectrometer must be equipped with a 70 V (nominal) ion source and be capable of aquiring m/z abundance data in real time selected ion monitoring (SIM) for groups of four or more masses.
5.5.4 GC/MS interface—Any GC to MS interface can be used that achieves the requirements of Section 7.1.1. GC to MS interfaces constructed of all glass or glass-lined materials are recommended. Glass surfaces can be deactivated by silanizing with dichlorodimethylsilane. To achieve maximum sensitivity, the exit end of the capillary column should be placed in the ion source. A short piece of fused silica capillary can be used as the interface to overcome problems associated with straightening the exit end of glass capillary columns.
5.5.5 The SIM data acquired during the chromatographic program is defined as the Selected Ion Current Profile (SICP). The SICP can be acquired under computer control or as a real time analog output. If computer control is used, there must be software available to plot the SICP and report peak height or area data for any m/z in the SICP between specified time or scan number limits.
5.6 Balance—Analytical, capable of accurately weighing 0.0001 g.

# 6. Reagents
6.1 Reagent water—Reagent water is defined as a water in which an interferent is not observed at the MDL of 2, 3, 7, 8-TCDD.
6.2 Sodium hydroxide solution (10 N)—Dissolve 40 g of NaOH (ACS) in reagent water and dilute to 100 mL. Wash the solution with methylene chloride and hexane before use.
6.3 Sodium thiosulfate—(ACS) Granular.
6.4 Sulfuric acid—Concentrated (ACS, sp. gr. 1.84).
6.5 Acetone, methylene chloride, hexane, benzene, ortho-xylene, tetradecane—Pesticide quality or equivalent.
6.6 Sodium sulfate—(ACS) Granular, anhydrous. Purify by heating at 400 °C for 4 h in a shallow tray.
6.7 Alumina—Neutral, 80/200 mesh (Fisher Scientific Co., No. A-540 or equivalent). Before use, activate for 24 h at 130 °C in a foil-covered glass container.
6.8 Silica gel—High purity grade, 100/120 mesh (Fisher Scientific Co., No. S-679 or equivalent).
6.9 Stock standard solutions (1.00 µg/µL)—Stock standard solutimns can be prepared from pure standard materials or purchased as certified solutions. Acetone should be used as the solvent for spiking solutions; ortho-xylene is recommended for calibration standards for split injectors; and tetradecane is recommended for splitless or on-colum injectors. Analyze stock internal standards to verify the absence of native 2,3,7,8-TCDD.
6.9.1 Prepare stock standard solutions of 2,3,7,8-TCDD (mol wt 320) and either
37
C1
4
2,3,7,8-TCDD (mol wt 328) or
13
C1
12
2,3,7,8-TCDD (mol wt 332) in an isolated area by accurately weighing about 0.0100 g of pure material. Dissolve the material in pesticide quality solvent and dilute to volume in a 10-mL volumetric flask. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight can be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock standard. Commercially prepared stock standards can be used at any concentration if they are certified by the manufacturer or by an independent source.
6.9.2 Transfer the stock standard solutions into Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottles. Store in an isolated refrigerator protected from light. Stock standard solutions should be checked frequently for signs of degradation or evaporation, especially just prior to preparing calibration standards or spiking solutions from them.
6.9.3 Stock standard solutions must be replaced after six months, or sooner if comparison with check standards indicates a problem.
6.10 Internal standard spiking solution (25 ng/mL)—Using stock standard solution, prepare a spiking solution in acetone of either
13
Cl
12
or
37
Cl
4
2,3,7,8-TCDD at a concentration of 25 ng/mL. (See Section 10.2)
6.11 Quality control check sample concentrate—See Section 8.2.1.

# 7. Calibration
7.1 Establish gas chromatograhic operating conditions equivalent to those given in Table 1 and SIM conditions for the mass spectrometer as described in Section 12.2 The GC/MS system must be calibrated using the internal standard technique.
7.1.1 Using stock standards, prepare calibration standards that will allow measurement of relative response factors of at least three concentration ratios of 2,3,7,8-TCDD to internal standard. Each calibration standard must be prepared to contain the internal standard at a concentration of 25 ng/mL. If any interferences are contributed by the internal standard at m/z 320 and 322, its concentration may be reduced in the calibration standards and in the internal standard spiking solution (Section 6.10). One of the calibration standards should contain 2,3,7,8-TCDD at a concentration near, but above, the MDL and the other 2,3,7,8-TCDD concentrations should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the GC/MS system.
7.1.2 Using injections of 2 to 5 µL, analyze each calibration standardaccording to Section 12 and tabulate peak height or area response against the concentration of 2,3,7,8-TCDD and internal standard. Calculate response factors (RF) for 2,3,7,8-TCDD using Equation 1.

, vs. RF.
7.1.3 The working calibration curve or RF must be verified on each working day by the measurement of one or more 2,3,7,8-TCDD calibration standards. If the response for 2,3,7,8-TCDD varies from the predicted response by more than ±15%, the test must be repeated using a fresh calibration standard. Alternatively, a new calibration curve must be prepared.
7.2 Before using any cleanup procedure, the analyst must process a series of calibration standards through the procedure to validate elution patterns and the absence of interferences from the reagents.

# 8. Quality Control
8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of spiked samples to evaluate and document data quality. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing data quality checks are compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method. When results of sample spikes indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.
8.1.1 The analyst must make an initial, one-time, demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 8.2.
8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in chromatography, the analyst is permitted certain options (detailed in Sections 10.5, 11.1, and 12.1) to improve the separations or lower the cost of measurements. Each time such a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the procedure in Section 8.2
8.1.3 Before processing any samples, the analyst must analyze a reagent water blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system and glassware are under control. Each time a set of samples is extracted or reagents are changed, a reagent water blank must be processed as a safeguard against laboratory contamination.
8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze a minimum of 10% of all samples with native 2,3,7,8-TCDD to monitor and evaluate laboratory data quality. This procedure is described in Section 8.3.
8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analyses of quality control check standards that the operation of the measurement system is in control. This procedure is described in Section 8.4. The frequency of the check standard analyses is equivalent to 10% of all samples analyzed but may be reduced if spike recoveries from samples (Section 8.3) meet all specified quality control criteria.
8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is described in Section 8.5.
8.2 To establish the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.
8.2.1 A quality control (QC) check sample concentrate is required containing 2,3,7,8-TCDD at a concentration of 0.100 µg/mL in acetone. The QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, if available. If not available from that source, the QC check sample concentrate must be obtained from another external source. If not available from either source above, the QC check sample concentrate must be prepared by the laboratory using stock standards prepared independently from those used for calibration.
8.2.2 Using a pipet, prepare QC check samples at a concentration of 0.100 µg/L (100 ng/L) by adding 1.00 mL of QC check sample concentrate to each of four 1-L aliquots of reagent water.
8.2.3 Analyze the well-mixed QC check samples according to the method beginning in Section 10.
8.2.4 Calculate the average recovery (X
) in µg/L, and the standard deviation of the recovery (s) in µg/L, for 2,3,7,8-TCDD using the four results.
8.2.5 Compare s and (X
) with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, respectively, found in Table 2. If s and X
meet the acceptance criteria, the system performance is acceptable and analysis of actual samples can begin. If s exceeds the precision limit or X
falls outside the range for accuracy, the system performance is unacceptable for 2,3,7,8-TCDD. Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test beginning with Section 8.2.2.
8.3 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 10% of the samples from each sample site being monitored to assess accuracy. For laboratories analyzing one to ten samples per month, at least one spiked sample per month is required.
8.3.1 The concentration of the spike in the sample should be determined as follows:
8.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of 2,3,7,8-TCDD in the sample is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spike should be at that limit or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.1.2 If the concentration of 2,3,7,8-TCDD in the sample is not being checked against a limit specific to that parameter, the spike should be at 0.100 µg/L or 1 to 5 times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 8.3.2, whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.1.3 If it is impractical to determine background levels before spiking (e.g., maximum holding times will be exceeded), the
spike concentration should be (1) the regulatory concentration limit, if any; or, if none (2) the larger of either 5 times higher than the expected background concentration or 0.100 µg/L.
8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of 2,3,7,8-TCDD. If necessary, prepare a new QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentration in the sample. Spike a second sample aliquot with 1.0 mL of the QC check sample concentrate and analyze it to determine the concentration after spiking (A) of 2,3,7,8-TCDD. Calculate percent recovery (P) as 100(A−B)%T, where T is the known true value of the spike.
8.3.3 Compare the percent recovery (P) for 2,3,7,8-TCDD with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. These acceptance criteria were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the analyst's spike to background ratio approaches 5:1.
11
If spiking was performed at a concentration lower than 0.100 µg/L, the analyst must use either the QC acceptance criteria in Table 2, or optional QC acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration. To calculate optional acceptance criteria for the recovery of 2,3,7,8-TCDD: (1) Calculate accuracy (X′) using the equation in Table 3, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) calculate overall precision (S′) using the equation in Table 3, substituting X′ for X; (3) calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X′/T)±2.44(100 S′/T)%.
11
8.3.4 If the recovery of 2,3,7,8-TCDD falls outside the designated range for recovery, a check standard must be analyzed as described in Section 8.4.
8.4 If the recovery of 2,3,7,8-TCDD fails the acceptance criteria for recovery in Section 8.3, a QC check standard must be prepared and analyzed.

# Note:
The frequency for the required analysis of a QC check standard will depend upon the complexity of the sample matrix and the performance of the laboratory.
8.4.1 Prepare the QC check standard by adding 1.0 mL of QC check sample concentrate (Section 8.2.1 or 8.3.2) to 1 L of reagent water.
8.4.2 Analyze the QC check standard to determine the concentration measured (A) of 2,3,7,8-TCDD. Calculate the percent recovery (P
s
) as 100 (A/T)%, where T is the true value of the standard concentration.
8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (P
s
) with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria found in Table 2. If the recovery of 2,3,7,8-TCDD falls outside the designated range, the laboratory performance is judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected. The analytical result for 2,3,7,8-TCDD in the unspiked sample is suspect and may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.
8.5 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, method accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records must be maintained. After the analysis of five spiked wastewater samples as in Section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P
) and the spandard deviation of the percent recovery (s
p
). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P
−2s
p
to P
+ 2s
p
. If P
= 90% and s
p
= 10%, for example, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment on a regular basis (e.g. after each five to ten new accuracy measurements).
8.6 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of the environmental measurements. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.

# 9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling
9.1 Grab samples must be collected in glass containers. Conventional sampling practices
12
should be followed, except that the bottle must not be prerinsed with sample before collection. Composite samples should be collected in refrigerated glass containers in accordance with the requirements of the program. Automatic sampling equipment must be as free as possible of Tygon tubing and other potential sources of contamination.
9.2 All samples must be iced or refrigerated at 4 °C and protected from light from the time of collection until extraction. Fill the sample bottles and, if residual chlorine is present, add 80 mg of sodium thiosulfate per liter of sample and mix well. EPA Methods 330.4 and 330.5 may be used for measurement of residual chlorine.
13
Field test kits are available for this purpose.
9.3 Label all samples and containers “POISON” and ship according to applicable U.S. Department of Transportation regulations.
9.4 All samples must be extracted within 7 days of collection and completely analyzed within 40 days of extraction.
2

# 10. Sample Extraction
Caution:
When using this method to analyze for 2,3,7,8-TCDD, all of the following operations must be performed in a limited-access laboratory with the analyst wearing full
protective covering for all exposed skin surfaces. See Section 4.2.
10.1 Mark the water meniscus on the side of the sample bottle for later determination of sample volume. Pour the entire sample into a 2-L separatory funnel.
10.2 Add 1.00 mL of internal standard spiking solution to the sample in the separatory funnel. If the final extract will be concentrated to a fixed volume below 1.00 mL (Section 12.3), only that volume of spiking solution should be added to the sample so that the final extract will contain 25 ng/mL of internal standard at the time of analysis.
10.3 Add 60 mL of methylene chloride to the sample bottle, seal, and shake 30 s to rinse the inner surface. Transfer the solvent to the separatory funnel and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for 2 min. with periodic venting to release excess pressure. Allow the organic layer to separate from the water phase for a minimum of 10 min. If the emulsion interface between layers is more than one-third the vmlume of the solvent layer, the analyst must employ mechanical techniques to complete the phase separation. The optimum technique depends upon the sample, but may include stirring, filtration of the emulsion through glass wool, centrifugation, or other physical methods. Collect the methylene chloride extract in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.
10.4 Add a second 60-mL volume of methylene chloride to the sample bottle and repeat the extraction procedure a second time, combining the extracts in the Erlenmeyer flask. Perform a third extraction in the same manner.
10.5 Assemble a Kuderna-Danish (K-D) concentrator by attaching a 10-mL concentrator tube to a 500-mL evaporative flask. Other concentration devices or techniques may be used in place of the K-D concentrator if the requirements of Section 8.2 are met.
10.6 Pour the combined extract into the K-D concentrator. Rinse the Erlenmeyer flask with 20 to 30 mL of methylele chloride to complete the quantitative transfer.
10.7 Add one or two clean boiling chips to the evaporative flask and attach a three-ball Snyder column. Prewet the Snyder column by adding about 1 mL of methylene chloride to the top. Place the K-D apparatus on a hot water bath (60 to 65 °C) so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water, and the entire lower rounded surface of the flask is bathed with hot vapor. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 15 to 20 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood with condensed solvent. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches 1 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min.
10.8 Momentarily remove the Snyder column, add 50 mL of hexane and a new boiling chip, and reattach the Snyder column. Raise the temperature of the water bath to 85 to 90 °C. Concentrate the extract as in Section 10.7, except use hexane to prewet the column. Remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of hexane. A 5-mL syringe is recommended for this operation. Set aside the K-D glassware for reuse in Section 10.14.
10.9 Pour the hexane extract from the concentrator tube into a 125-mL separatory funnel. Rinse the concentrator tube four times with 10-mL aliquots of hexane. Combine all rinses in the 125-mL separatory funnel.
10.10 Add 50 mL of sodium hydroxide solution to the funnel and shake for 30 to 60 s. Discard the aqueous phase.
10.11 Perform a second wash of the organic layer with 50 mL of reagent water. Discard the aqueous phase.
10.12 Wash the hexane layer with a least two 50-mL aliquots of concentrated sulfuric acid. Continue washing the hexane layer with 50-mL aliquots of concentrated sulfuric acid until the acid layer remains colorless. Discard all acid fractions.
10.13 Wash the hexane layer with two 50-mL aliquots of reagent water. Discard the aqueous phases.
10.14 Transfer the hexane extract into a 125-mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 1 to 2 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate. Swirl the flask for 30 s and decant the hexane extract into the reassembled K-D apparatus. Complete the quantitative transfer with two 10-mL hexane rinses of the Erlenmeyer flask.
10.15 Replace the one or two clean boiling chips and concentrate the extract to 6 to 10 mL as in Section 10.8.
10.16 Add a clean boiling chip to the concentrator tube and attach a two-ball micro-Snyder column. Prewet the column by adding about 1 mL of hexane to the top. Place the micro-K-D apparatus on the water bath so that the concentrator tube is partially immersed in the hot water. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 5 to 10 min. At the proper rate of distillation the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood. When the apparent volume of liquid reaches about 0.5 mL, remove the K-D apparatus and allow it to drain and cool for at least 10 min. Remove the micro-Snyder column and rinse its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 0.2 mL of hexane.
Adjust the extract volume to 1.0 mL with hexane. Stopper the concentrator tube and store refrigerated and protected from light if further processing will not be performed immediately. If the extract will be stored
longer than two days, it should be transferred to a Teflon-sealed screw-cap vial. If the sample extract requires no further cleanup, proceed with GC/MS analysis (Section 12). If the sample requires further cleanup, proceed to Section 11.
10.17 Determine the original sample volume by refilling the sample bottle to the mark and transferring the liquid to a 1000-mL graduated cylinder. Record the sample volume to the nearest 5 mL.

# 11. Cleanup and Separation
11.1 Cleanup procedures may not be necessary for a relatively clean sample matrix. If particular circumstances demand the use of a cleanup procedure, the analyst may use either procedure below or any other appropriate procedure.
1 5-7
However, the analyst first must demonstrate that the requirements of Section 8.2 can be met using the method as revised to incorporate the cleanup procedure. Two cleanup column options are offered to the analyst in this section. The alumina column should be used first to overcome interferences. If background problems are still encountered, the silica gel column may be helpful.
11.2 Alumina column cleanup for 2,3,7,8-TCDD:
11.2.1 Fill a 300 mm long × 10 mm ID chromatographic column with activated alumina to the 150 mm level. Tap the column gently to settle the alumina and add 10 mm of anhydrous sodium sulfate to the top.
11.2.2 Preelute the column with 50 mL of hexane. Adjust the elution rate to 1 mL/min. Discard the eluate and just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, quantitatively transfer the 1.0-mL sample extract onto the column using two 2-mL portions of hexane to complete the transfer.
11.2.3 Just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, add 50 mL of 3% methylene chloride/95% hexane (V/V) and continue the elution of the column. Discard the eluate.
11.2.4 Next, elute the column with 50 mL of 20% methylene chloride/80% hexane (V/V) into a 500-mL K-D flask equipped with a 10-mL concentrator tube. Concentrate the collected fraction to 1.0 mL as in Section 10.16 and analyze by GC/MS (Section 12).
11.3 Silica gel column cleanup for 2,3,7,8-TCDD:
11.3.1 Fill a 400 mm long × 11 mm ID chromatmgraphic column with silica gel to the 300 mm level. Tap the column gently to settle the silica gel and add 10 mm of anhydrous sodium sulfate to the top.
11.3.2 Preelute the column with 50 mL of 20% benzene/80% hexane (V/V). Adjust the elution rate to 1 mL/min. Discard the eluate and just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, quantitatively transfer the 1.0-mL sample extract onto the column using two 2-mL portions of 20% benzene/80% hexane to complete the transfer.
11.3.3 Just prior to exposure of the sodium sulfate layer to the air, add 40 mL of 20% benzene/80% hexane to the column. Collect the eluate in a clean 500-mL K-D flask equipped with a 10-mL concentrator tube. Concentrate the collected fraction to 1.0 mL as in Section 10.16 and analyze by GC/MS.

# 12. GC/MS Analysis
12.1 Table 1 summarizes the recommended operating conditions for the gas chromatograph. Included in this table are retention times and MDL that can be achieved under these conditions. Other capillary columns or chromatographic conditions may be used if the requirements of Sections 5.5.2 and 8.2 are met.
12.2 Analyze standards and samples with the mass spectrometer operating in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode using a dwell time to give at least seven points per peak. For LRMS, use masses at m/z 320, 322, and 257 for 2,3,7,8-TCDD and either m/z 328 for
37
Cl
4
2,3,7,8-TCDD or m/z 332 for
13
C
12
2,3,7,8-TCDD. For HRMS, use masses at m/z 319.8965 and 321.8936 for 2,3,7,8-TCDD and either m/z 327.8847 for
37
Cl
4
2,3,7,8-TCDD or m/z 331.9367 for
13
C
12
2,3,7,8-TCDD.
12.3 If lower detection limits are required, the extract may be carefully evaporated to dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen with the concentrator tube in a water bath at about 40 °C. Conduct this operation immediately before GC/MS analysis. Redissolve the extract in the desired final volume of ortho-xylene or tetradecane.
12.4 Calibrate the system daily as described in Section 7.
12.5 Inject 2 to 5 µL of the sample extract into the gas chromatograph. The volume of calibration standard injected must be measured, or be the same as all sample injection volumes.
12.6 The presence of 2,3,7,8-TCDD is qualitatively confirmed if all of the following criteria are achieved:
12.6.1 The gas chromatographic column must resolve 2,3,7,8-TCDD from the other 21 TCDD isomers.
12.6.2 The masses for native 2,3,7,8-TCDD (LRMS-m/z 320, 322, and 257 and HRMS-m/z 320 and 322) and labeled 2,3,7,8-TCDD (m/z 328 or 332) must exhibit a simultaneous maximum at a retention time that matches that of native 2,3,7,8-TCDD in the calibration standard, with the performance specifications of the analytical system.
12.6.3 The chlorine isotope ratio at m/z 320 and m/z 322 must agree to within±10% of that in the calibration standard.
12.6.4 The signal of all peaks must be greater than 2.5 times the noise level.
12.7 For quantitation, measure the response of the m/z 320 peak for 2,3,7,8-TCDD
and the m/z 332 peak for
13
C
12
2,3,7,8-TCDD or the m/z 328 peak for
37
Cl
4
2,3,7,8-TCDD.
12.8 Co-eluting impurities are suspected if all criteria are achieved except those in Section 12.6.3. In this case, another SIM analysis using masses at m/z 257, 259, 320 and either m/a 328 or m/z 322 can be performed. The masses at m/z 257 and m/z 259 are indicative of the loss of one chlorine and one carbonyl group from 2,3,7,8-TCDD. If masses m/z 257 and m/z 259 give a chlorine isotope ratio that agrees to within ±10% of the same cluster in the calibration standards, then the presence of TCDD can be confirmed. Co-eluting DDD, DDE, and PCB residues can be confirmed, but will require another injection using the appropriate SIM masses or full repetitive mass scans. If the response for
37
Cl
4
2,3,7,8-TCDD at m/z 328 is too large, PCB contamination is suspected and can be confirmed by examining the response at both m/z 326 and m/z 328. The
37
Cl
4
2,3,7,8-TCDD internal standard gives negligible response at m/z 326. These pesticide residues can be removed using the alumina column cleanup procedure.
12.9 If broad background interference restricts the sensitivity of the GC/MS analysis, the analyst should employ additional cleanup procedures and reanalyze by GC/MS.
12.10 In those circumstances where these procedures do not yield a definitive conclusion, the use of high resolution mass spectrometry is suggested.

# 13. Calculations
13.1 Calculate the concentration of 2,3,7,8-TCDD in the sample using the response factor (RF) determined in Section 7.1.2 and Equation 2.
EC15NO91.123
Equation 2
where:
A
s
= SIM response for 2,3,7,8-TCDD at m/z 320.
A
is
= SIM response for the internal standard at m/z 328 or 332.
I
s
= Amount of internal standard added to each extract (µg).
V
o
= Volume of water extracted (L).
13.2 For each sample, calculate the percent recovery of the internal standard by comparing the area of the m/z peak measured in the sample to the area of the same peak in the calibration standard. If the recovery is below 50%, the analyst should review all aspects of his analytical technique.
13.3 Report results in µg/L without correction for recovery data. All QC data obtained should be reported with the sample results.

# 14. Method Performance
14.1 The method detection limit (MDL) is defined as the minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence that the value is above zero.
1
The MDL concentration listed in Table 1 was obtained using reagent water.
14
The MDL actually achieved in a given analysis will vary depending on instrument sensitivity and matrix effects.
14.2 This method was tested by 11 laboratories using reagent water, drinking water, surface water, and three industrial wastewaters spiked at six concentrations over the range 0.02 to 0.20 µg/L.
15
Single operator precision, overall precision, and method accuracy were found to be directly related to the concentration of the parameter and essentially independent of the sample matrix. Linear equations to describe these relationships are presented in Table 3.

# Method 624.1—Purgeables by GC/MS

# 1. Scope and Application
1.1 This method is for determination of purgeable organic pollutants in industrial discharges and other environmental samples by gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC/MS), as provided under 40 CFR 136.1. This revision is based on previous protocols (References 1—3), on the revision promulgated October 26, 1984, and on an interlaboratory method validation study (Reference 4). Although this method was validated through an interlaboratory study conducted in the early 1980s, the fundamental chemistry principles used in this method remain sound and continue to apply.
1.2 The analytes that may be qualitatively and quantitatively determined using this method and their CAS Registry numbers are listed in Table 1. The method may be extended to determine the analytes listed in Table 2; however, poor purging efficiency or gas chromatography of some of these analytes may make quantitative determination difficult. For example, an elevated temperature may be required to purge some analytes from water. If an elevated temperature is used, calibration and all quality control (QC) tests must be performed at the elevated temperature. EPA encourages the use of this method to determine additional compounds amenable to purge-and-trap GC/MS.
1.3 The large number of analytes in Tables 1 and 2 of this method makes testing difficult if all analytes are determined simultaneously. Therefore, it is necessary to determine and perform QC tests for “analytes of interest” only. Analytes of interest are those required to be determined by a regulatory/control authority or in a permit, or by a client. If a list of analytes is not specified, the
analytes in Table 1 must be determined, at a minimum, and QC testing must be performed for these analytes. The analytes in Table 1 and some of the analytes in Table 2 have been identified as Toxic Pollutants (40 CFR 401.15), expanded to a list of Priority Pollutants (40 CFR part 423, appendix A).
1.4 Method detection limits (MDLs; Reference 5) for the analytes in Table 1 are listed in that table. These MDLs were determined in reagent water (Reference 6). Advances in analytical technology, particularly the use of capillary (open-tubular) columns, allowed laboratories to routinely achieve MDLs for the analytes in this method that are 2-10 times lower than those in the version promulgated in 1984. The MDL for a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending on the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.
1.4.1 EPA has promulgated this method at 40 CFR part 136 for use in wastewater compliance monitoring under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). The data reporting practices described in section 13.2 are focused on such monitoring needs and may not be relevant to other uses of the method.
1.4.2 This method includes “reporting limits” based on EPA's “minimum level” (ML) concept (see the glossary in section 20). Table 1 contains MDL values and ML values for many of the analytes. The MDL for an analyte in a specific wastewater may differ from that listed in Table 1, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.
1.5 This method is performance-based. It may be modified to improve performance (e.g., to overcome interferences or improve the accuracy of results) provided all performance requirements are met.
1.5.1 Examples of allowed method modifications are described at 40 CFR 136.6. Other examples of allowed modifications specific to this method are described in section 8.1.2.
1.5.2 Any modification beyond those expressly allowed at 40 CFR 136.6 or in section 8.1.2 of this method shall be considered a major modification that is subject to application and approval of an alternate test procedure under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.
1.5.3 For regulatory compliance, any modification must be demonstrated to produce results equivalent or superior to results produced by this method when applied to relevant wastewaters (section 8.3).
1.6 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the operation of a purge-and-trap system and a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer and in the interpretation of mass spectra. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method using the procedure in section 8.2.
1.7 Terms and units of measure used in this method are given in the glossary at the end of the method.

# 2. Summary of Method
2.1 A gas is bubbled through a measured volume of water in a specially-designed purging chamber. The purgeables are efficiently transferred from the aqueous phase to the vapor phase. The vapor is swept through a sorbent trap where the purgeables are trapped. After purging is completed, the trap is heated and backflushed with the gas to desorb the purgeables onto a gas chromatographic column. The column is temperature programmed to separate the purgeables which are then detected with a mass spectrometer.
2.2 Different sample sizes in the range of 5-25 mL are allowed in order to meet differing sensitivity requirements. Calibration and QC samples must have the same volume as field samples.

# 3. Interferences
3.1 Impurities in the purge gas, organic compounds outgassing from the plumbing ahead of the trap, and solvent vapors in the laboratory account for the majority of contamination problems. The analytical system must be demonstrated to be free from contamination under the conditions of the analysis by analyzing blanks initially and with each analytical batch (samples analyzed on a given 12-hour shift, to a maximum of 20 samples), as described in Section 8.5. Fluoropolymer tubing, fittings, and thread sealant should be used to avoid contamination.
3.2 Samples can be contaminated by diffusion of volatile organics (particularly fluorocarbons and methylene chloride) through the septum seal into the sample during shipment and storage. Protect samples from sources of volatiles during collection, shipment, and storage. A reagent water field blank carried through sampling and analysis can serve as a check on such contamination.
3.3 Contamination by carry-over can occur whenever high level and low level samples are analyzed sequentially. To reduce the potential for carry-over, the purging device and sample syringe must be rinsed with reagent water between sample analyses. Whenever an unusually concentrated sample is encountered, it should be followed by an analysis of a blank to check for cross contamination. For samples containing large amounts of water-soluble materials, suspended solids, high boiling compounds or high purgeable levels, it may be necessary to wash the purging device with a detergent solution, rinse it with distilled water, and then dry it in a 105 °C oven between analyses. The trap and other parts of the system are also subject to contamination; therefore, frequent bakeout
and purging of the entire system may be required. Screening samples at high dilution may prevent introduction of contaminants into the system.

# 4. Safety
4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of safety data sheets (SDSs, OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.1200(g)) should also be made available to all personnel involved in sample handling and chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified (References 7-9) for the information of the analyst.
4.2. The following analytes covered by this method have been tentatively classified as known or suspected human or mammalian carcinogens: Benzene; carbon tetrachloride; chloroform; 1,4-dichlorobenzene; 1,2-dichloroethane; 1,2-dichloropropane; methylene chloride; tetrachloroethylene; trichloroethylene; and vinyl chloride. Primary standards of these toxic compounds should be prepared in a chemical fume hood, and a NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be worn when handling high concentrations of these compounds.
4.3 This method allows the use of hydrogen as a carrier gas in place of helium (Section 5.3.1.2). The laboratory should take the necessary precautions in dealing with hydrogen, and should limit hydrogen flow at the source to prevent buildup of an explosive mixture of hydrogen in air.

# 5. Apparatus and Materials

# Note:
Brand names, suppliers, and part numbers are cited for illustration purposes only. No endorsement is implied. Equivalent performance may be achieved using equipment and materials other than those specified here. Demonstration of equivalent performance that meets the requirements of this method is the responsibility of the laboratory. Suppliers for equipment and materials in this method may be found through an on-line search.
5.1 Sampling equipment for discrete sampling.
5.1.1 Vial—25- or 40-mL capacity, or larger, with screw cap with a hole in the center (Fisher #13075 or equivalent). Unless pre-cleaned, detergent wash, rinse with tap and reagent water, and dry at 105 ± 5 °C before use.
5.1.2 Septum—Fluoropolymer-faced silicone (Fisher #12722 or equivalent). Unless pre-cleaned, detergent wash, rinse with tap and reagent water, and dry at 105 ± 5 °C for one hour before use.
5.2 Purge-and-trap system—The purge-and-trap system consists of three separate pieces of equipment: A purging device, trap, and desorber. Several complete systems are commercially available with autosamplers. Any system that meets the performance requirements in this method may be used.
5.2.1 The purging device should accept 5- to 25-mL samples with a water column at least 3 cm deep. The purge gas must pass though the water column as finely divided bubbles. The purge gas must be introduced no more than 5 mm from the base of the water column. Purge devices of a different volume may be used so long as the performance requirements in this method are met.
5.2.2 The trap should be at least 25 cm long and have an inside diameter of at least 0.105 in. The trap should be packed to contain the following minimum lengths of adsorbents: 1.0 cm of methyl silicone coated packing (section 6.3.2), 15 cm of 2,6-diphenylene oxide polymer (section 6.3.1), and 8 cm of silica gel (section 6.3.3). A trap with different dimensions and packing materials is acceptable so long as the performance requirements in this method are met.
5.2.3 The desorber should be capable of rapidly heating the trap to the temperature necessary to desorb the analytes of interest, and of maintaining this temperature during desorption. The trap should not be heated higher than the maximum temperature recommended by the manufacturer.
5.2.4 The purge-and-trap system may be assembled as a separate unit or coupled to a gas chromatograph.
5.3 GC/MS system.
5.3.1 Gas chromatograph (GC)—An analytical system complete with a temperature programmable gas chromatograph and all required accessories, including syringes and analytical columns. Autosamplers designed for purge-and-trap analysis of volatiles also may be used.
5.3.1.1 Injection port—Volatiles interface, split, splitless, temperature programmable split/splitless (PTV), large volume, on-column, backflushed, or other.
5.3.1.2 Carrier gas—Data in the tables in this method were obtained using helium carrier gas. If another carrier gas is used, analytical conditions may need to be adjusted for optimum performance, and calibration and all QC tests must be performed with the alternative carrier gas. See Section 4.3 for precautions regarding the use of hydrogen as a carrier gas.
5.3.2 GC column—See the footnote to Table 3. Other columns or column systems may be used provided all requirements in this method are met.
5.3.3 Mass spectrometer—Capable of repetitively scanning from 35-260 Daltons (amu) every 2 seconds or less, utilizing a 70 eV (nominal) electron energy in the electron impact ionization mode, and producing a mass spectrum which meets all criteria in Table 4 when 50 ng or less of 4-bromofluorobenzene (BFB) is injected through the GC inlet. If acrolein, acrylonitrile, chloromethane, and vinyl chloride are to be determined, it may be necessary to scan from below 25 Daltons to measure the peaks in the 26-35 Dalton range for reliable identification.
5.3.4 GC/MS interface—Any GC to MS interface that meets all performance requirements in this method may be used.
5.3.5 Data system—A computer system must be interfaced to the mass spectrometer that allows continuous acquisition and storage of mass spectra throughout the chromatographic program. The computer must have software that allows searching any GC/MS data file for specific m/z's (masses) and plotting m/z abundances versus time or scan number. This type of plot is defined as an extracted ion current profile (EICP). Software must also be available that allows integrating the abundance at any EICP between specified time or scan number limits.
5.4 Syringes—Graduated, 5-25 mL, glass hypodermic with Luerlok tip, compatible with the purging device.
5.5 Micro syringes—Graduated, 25-1000 µL, with 0.006 in. ID needle.

5.8 Bottle—15 mL, screw-cap, with Teflon cap liner.
5.9 Balance—Analytical, capable of accurately weighing 0.0001 g.

# 6. Reagents
6.1 Reagent water—Reagent water is defined as water in which the analytes of interest and interfering compounds are not detected at the MDLs of the analytes of interest. It may be generated by passing deionized water, distilled water, or tap water through a carbon bed, passing the water through a water purifier, or heating the water to between 90 and 100 °C while bubbling contaminant-free gas through it for approximately 1 hour. While still hot, transfer the water to screw-cap bottles and seal with a fluoropolymer-lined cap.
6.2 Sodium thiosulfate—(ACS) Granular.
6.3 Trap materials.
6.3.1 2,6-Diphenylene oxide polymer—Tenax, 60/80 mesh, chromatographic grade, or equivalent.
6.3.2 Methyl silicone packing—3% OV-1 on Chromosorb-W, 60/80 mesh, or equivalent.
6.3.3 Silica gel—35/60 mesh, Davison, Grade-15 or equivalent.
6.3.4 Other trap materials are acceptable if performance requirements in this method are met.
6.4 Methanol—Demonstrated to be free from the target analytes and potentially interfering compounds.
6.5 Stock standard solutions—Stock standard solutions may be prepared from pure materials, or purchased as certified solutions. Traceability must be to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) or other national or international standard, when available. Stock solution concentrations alternative to those below may be used. Prepare stock standard solutions in methanol using assayed liquids or gases as appropriate. Because some of the compounds in this method are known to be toxic, primary dilutions should be prepared in a hood, and a NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be worn when high concentrations of neat materials are handled. The following procedure may be used to prepare standards from neat materials:
6.5.1 Place about 9.8 mL of methanol in a 10-mL ground-glass-stoppered volumetric flask. Allow the flask to stand, unstoppered, for about 10 minutes or until all alcohol wetted surfaces have dried. Weigh the flask to the nearest 0.1 mg.
6.5.2 Add the assayed reference material.
6.5.2.1 Liquids—Using a 100 µL syringe, immediately add two or more drops of assayed reference material to the flask. Be sure that the drops fall directly into the alcohol without contacting the neck of the flask. Reweigh, dilute to volume, stopper, then mix by inverting the flask several times. Calculate the concentration in µg/µL from the net gain in weight.
6.5.2.2 Gases—To prepare standards for any of compounds that boil below 30 °C, fill a 5-mL valved gas-tight syringe with reference standard vapor to the 5.0 mL mark. Lower the needle to 5 mm above the methanol meniscus. Slowly introduce the vapor above the surface of the liquid (the vapor will rapidly dissolve in the methanol). Reweigh, dilute to volume, stopper, then mix by inverting the flask several times. Calculate the concentration in µg/µL from the net gain in weight.
6.5.3 When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight may be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock standard. Commercially prepared stock standards may be used at any concentration if they are certified by the manufacturer or by an independent source.
6.5.4 Prepare fresh standards weekly for the gases and 2-chloroethylvinyl ether. Unless stated otherwise in this method, store non-aqueous standards in fluoropolymer-
lined screw-cap, or heat-sealed, glass containers, in the dark at −20 to −10 °C. Store aqueous standards; e.g., the aqueous LCS (section 8.4.1) in the dark at ≤6 °C (but do not freeze) with zero headspace; e.g., in VOA vials (section 5.1.1). Standards prepared by the laboratory may be stored for up to one month, except when comparison with QC check standards indicates that a standard has degraded or become more concentrated due to evaporation, or unless the laboratory has data on file to prove stability for a longer period. Commercially prepared standards may be stored until the expiration date provided by the vendor, except when comparison with QC check standards indicates that a standard has degraded or become more concentrated due to evaporation, or unless the laboratory has data from the vendor on file to prove stability for a longer period.

# Note:
2-Chloroethylvinyl ether has been shown to be stable for as long as one month if prepared as a separate standard, and the other analytes have been shown to be stable for as long as 2 months if stored at less than −10 °C with minimal headspace in sealed, miniature inert-valved vials.
6.6 Secondary dilution standards—Using stock solutions, prepare secondary dilution standards in methanol that contain the compounds of interest, either singly or mixed. Secondary dilution standards should be prepared at concentrations such that the aqueous calibration standards prepared in section 7.3.2 will bracket the working range of the analytical system.
6.7 Surrogate standard spiking solution—Select a minimum of three surrogate compounds from Table 5. The surrogates selected should match the purging characteristics of the analytes of interest as closely as possible. Prepare a stock standard solution for each surrogate in methanol as described in section 6.5, and prepare a solution for spiking the surrogates into all blanks, LCSs, and MS/MSDs. Prepare the spiking solution such that spiking a small volume will result in a constant concentration of the surrogates. For example, add 10 µL of a spiking solution containing the surrogates at a concentration of 15 µg/mL in methanol to a 5-mL aliquot of water to produce a concentration of 30 µg/L for each surrogate. Other surrogate concentrations may be used. Store per section 6.5.4.
6.8 BFB standard—Prepare a solution of BFB in methanol as described in Sections 6.5 and 6.6. The solution should be prepared such that an injection or purging from water will result in introduction of ≤ 50 ng into the GC. BFB may be included in a mixture with the internal standards and/or surrogates.
6.9 Quality control check sample concentrate—See Section 8.2.1.

# 7. Calibration
7.1 Assemble a purge-and-trap system that meets the specifications in Section 5.2. Prior to first use, condition the trap overnight at 180 °C by backflushing with gas at a flow rate of at least 20 mL/min. Condition the trap after each analysis at a temperature and time sufficient to prevent detectable concentrations of the analytes or contaminants in successive analyses.
7.2 Connect the purge-and-trap system to the gas chromatograph. The gas chromatograph should be operated using temperature and flow rate conditions equivalent to those given in the footnotes to Table 3. Alternative temperature and flow rate conditions may be used provided that performance requirements in this method are met.
7.3 Internal standard calibration.
7.3.1 Internal standards.
7.3.1.1 Select three or more internal standards similar in chromatographic behavior to the compounds of interest. Suggested internal standards are listed in Table 5. Use the base peak m/z as the primary m/z for quantification of the standards. If interferences are found at the base peak, use one of the next two most intense m/z's for quantitation. Demonstrate that measurements of the internal standards are not affected by method or matrix interferences.
7.3.1.2 To assure accurate analyte identification, particularly when selected ion monitoring (SIM) is used, it may be advantageous to include more internal standards than those suggested in Section 7.3.1.1. An analyte will be located most accurately if its retention time relative to an internal standard is in the range of 0.8 to 1.2.
7.3.1.3 Prepare a stock standard solution for each internal standard in methanol as described in Section 6.5, and prepare a solution for spiking the internal standards into all blanks, LCSs, and MS/MSDs. Prepare the spiking solution such that spiking a small volume will result in a constant concentration of the internal standards. For example, add 10 µL of a spiking solution containing the internal standards at a concentration of 15 µg/mL in methanol to a 5-mL aliquot of water to produce a concentration of 30 µg/L for each internal standard. Other concentrations may be used. The internal standard solution and the surrogate standard spiking solution (Section 6.7) may be combined, if desired. Store per section 6.5.4.
7.3.2 Calibration.
7.3.2.1 Calibration standards.
7.3.2.1.1 Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of five concentration levels for each analyte of interest by adding appropriate volumes of one or more stock standards to a fixed volume (e.g., 40 mL) of reagent water in volumetric glassware. Fewer levels may be necessary for some analytes based on the sensitivity of the MS, but no
fewer than 3 levels may be used, and only the highest or lowest point(s) may be dropped from the calibration. One of the calibration standards should be at a concentration at or below the ML or as specified by a regulatory/control authority or in a permit. The ML value may be rounded to a whole number that is more convenient for preparing the standard, but must not exceed the ML values listed in Table 1 for those analytes which list ML values. Alternatively, the laboratory may establish the ML for each analyte based on the concentration of the lowest calibration standard in a series of standards produced in the laboratory or obtained from a commercial vendor, again, provided that the ML value does not exceed the MLs in Table 1, and provided that the resulting calibration meets the acceptance criteria in Section 7.3.4, based on the RSD, RSE, or R
2
. The concentrations of the higher standards should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples, or should define the working range of the GC/MS system for full-scan and/or SIM operation, as appropriate. A minimum of six concentration levels is required for a second order, non-linear (e.g., quadratic; ax
2
+ bx + c = 0) calibration. Calibrations higher than second order are not allowed.
7.3.2.1.2 To each calibration standard or standard mixture, add a known constant volume of the internal standard spiking solution (section 7.3.1.3) and surrogate standard spiking solution (section 6.7) or the combined internal standard solution and surrogate spiking solution (section 7.3.1.3). Aqueous standards may be stored up to 24 hours, if held in sealed vials with zero headspace. If not so stored, they must be discarded after one hour.
7.3.2.2 Prior to analysis of the calibration standards, analyze the BFB standard (section 6.8) and adjust the scan rate of the MS to produce a minimum of 5 mass spectra across the BFB GC peak, but do not exceed 2 seconds per scan. Adjust instrument conditions until the BFB criteria in Table 4 are met. Once the scan conditions are established, they must be used for analyses of all standards, blanks, and samples.

# Note:
The BFB spectrum may be evaluated by summing the intensities of the m/z's across the GC peak, subtracting the background at each m/z in a region of the chromatogram within 20 scans of but not including any part of the BFB peak. The BFB spectrum may also be evaluated by fitting a Gaussian to each m/z and using the intensity at the maximum for each Gaussian, or by integrating the area at each m/z and using the integrated areas. Other means may be used for evaluation of the BFB spectrum so long as the spectrum is not distorted to meet the criteria in Table 4.
7.3.2.3 Analyze the mid-point standard and enter or review the retention time, relative retention time, mass spectrum, and quantitation m/z in the data system for each analyte of interest, surrogate, and internal standard. If additional analytes (Table 2) are to be quantified, include these analytes in the standard. The mass spectrum for each analyte must be comprised of a minimum of 2 m/z's; 3 to 5 m/z's assure more reliable analyte identification. Suggested quantitation m/z's are shown in Table 6 as the primary m/z. For analytes in Table 6 that do not have a secondary m/z, acquire a mass spectrum and enter one or more secondary m/z's for more reliable identification. If an interference occurs at the primary m/z, use one of the secondary m/z's or an alternative m/z. A single m/z only is required for quantitation.
7.3.2.4 For SIM operation, determine the analytes in each descriptor, the quantitation m/z for each analyte (the quantitation m/z can be the same as for full-scan operation; Section 7.3.2.3), the dwell time on each m/z for each analyte, and the beginning and ending retention time for each descriptor. Analyze the verification standard in scan mode to verify m/z's and establish retention times for the analytes. There must be a minimum of two m/z's for each analyte to assure analyte identification. To maintain sensitivity, the number of m/z's in a descriptor should be limited. For example, for a descriptor with 10 m/z's and a chromatographic peak width of 5 sec, a dwell time of 100 ms at each m/z would result in a scan time of 1 second and provide 5 scans across the GC peak. The quantitation m/z will usually be the most intense peak in the mass spectrum. The quantitation m/z and dwell time may be optimized for each analyte. The acquisition table used for SIM must take into account the mass defect (usually less than 0.2 Dalton) that can occur at each m/z monitored. Refer to the footnotes to Table 3 for establishing operating conditions and to section 7.3.2.2 for establishing scan conditions.
7.3.2.5 For combined scan and SIM operation, set up the scan segments and descriptors to meet requirements in sections 7.3.2.2-7.3.2.4. Analyze unfamiliar samples in the scan mode to assure that the analytes of interest are determined.
7.3.3 Analyze each calibration standard according to Section 10 and tabulate the area at the quantitation m/z against concentration for each analyte of interest, surrogate, and internal standard. Calculate the response factor (RF) for each compound at each concentration using Equation 1.
ER28AU17.012
Where:
A
s
= Area of the characteristic m/z for the analyte to be measured.
A
is
= Area of the characteristic m/z for the internal standard.
C
is
= Concentration of the internal standard (µg/L).
C
s
= Concentration of the analyte to be measured (µg/L).
7.3.4 Calculate the mean (average) and relative standard deviation (RSD) of the response factors. If the RSD is less than 35%, the RF can be assumed to be invariant and the average RF can be used for calculations. Alternatively, the results can be used to fit a linear or quadratic regression of response ratios, A
s
/A
is
, vs. concentration ratios Cs/Cis. If used, the regression must be weighted inversely proportional to concentration (1/C). The coefficient of determination (R
2
) of the weighted regression must be greater than 0.920 (this value roughly corresponds to the RSD limit of 35%). Alternatively, the relative standard error (Reference 10) may be used as an acceptance criterion. As with the RSD, the RSE must be less than 35%. If an RSE less than 35% cannot be achieved for a quadratic regression, system performance is unacceptable, and the system must be adjusted and re-calibrated.

# Note:
Using capillary columns and current instrumentation, it is quite likely that a laboratory can calibrate the target analytes in this method and achieve a linearity metric (either RSD or RSE) well below 35%. Therefore, laboratories are permitted to use more stringent acceptance criteria for calibration than described here, for example, to harmonize their application of this method with those from other sources.
7.4 Calibration verification—Because the analytical system is calibrated by purge of the analytes from water, calibration verification is performed using the laboratory control sample (LCS). See section 8.4 for requirements for calibration verification using the LCS, and the Glossary for further definition.

# 8. Quality Control
8.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality assurance program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and ongoing analysis of spiked samples and blanks to evaluate and document data quality (40 CFR 136.7). The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of data generated. Results of ongoing performance tests are compared with established QC acceptance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet performance requirements of this method. When results of spiked samples do not meet the QC acceptance criteria in this method, a quality control check sample (laboratory control sample; LCS) must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation. A laboratory may develop its own performance criteria (as QC acceptance criteria), provided such criteria are as or more restrictive than the criteria in this method.
8.1.1 The laboratory must make an initial demonstration of capability (DOC) to generate acceptable precision and recovery with this method. This demonstration is detailed in Section 8.2. On a continuing basis, the laboratory must repeat demonstration of capability (DOC) at least annually.
8.1.2 In recognition of advances that are occurring in analytical technology, and to overcome matrix interferences, the laboratory is permitted certain options (section 1.5 and 40 CFR 136.6(b)) to improve separations or lower the costs of measurements. These options may include an alternative purge-and-trap device, and changes in both column and type of mass spectrometer (see 40 CFR 136.6(b)(4)(xvi)). Alternative determinative techniques, such as substitution of spectroscopic or immunoassay techniques, and changes that degrade method performance, are not allowed. If an analytical technique other than GC/MS is used, that technique must have a specificity equal to or greater than the specificity of GC/MS for the analytes of interest. The laboratory is also encouraged to participate in inter-comparison and performance evaluation studies (see section 8.8).
8.1.2.1 Each time a modification is made to this method, the laboratory is required to repeat the procedure in section 8.2. If the detection limit of the method will be affected by the change, the laboratory must demonstrate that the MDLs (40 CFR part 136, appendix B) are lower than one-third the regulatory compliance limit or the MDLs in this method, whichever are greater. If calibration will be affected by the change, the instrument must be recalibrated per section 7. Once the modification is demonstrated to produce results equivalent or superior to results produced by this method, that modification may be used routinely thereafter, so long as the other requirements in this method are met (e.g., matrix spike/matrix spike
duplicate recovery and relative percent difference).
8.1.2.1.1 If a modification is to be applied to a specific discharge, the laboratory must prepare and analyze matrix spike/matrix spike duplicate (MS/MSD) samples (Section 8.3) and LCS samples (section 8.4). The laboratory must include internal standards and surrogates (section 8.7) in each of the samples. The MS/MSD and LCS samples must be fortified with the analytes of interest (section 1.3.). If the modification is for nationwide use, MS/MSD samples must be prepared from a minimum of nine different discharges (See section 8.1.2.1.2), and all QC acceptance criteria in this method must be met. This evaluation only needs to be performed once, other than for the routine QC required by this method (for example it could be performed by the vendor of the alternative materials) but any laboratory using that specific material must have the results of the study available. This includes a full data package with the raw data that will allow an independent reviewer to verify each determination and calculation performed by the laboratory (see section 8.1.2.2.5, items (a)-(l)).
8.1.2.1.2 Sample matrices on which MS/MSD tests must be performed for nationwide use of an allowed modification:
(a) Effluent from a publicly owned treatment works (POTW).
(b) ASTM D5905 Standard Specification for Substitute Wastewater.
(c) Sewage sludge, if sewage sludge will be in the permit.
(d) ASTM D1141 Standard Specification for Substitute Ocean Water, if ocean water will be in the permit.
(e) Untreated and treated wastewaters up to a total of nine matrix types (see
https://www.epa.gov/eg/industrial-effluent-guidelines
for a list of industrial categories with existing effluent guidelines).
(i) At least one of the above wastewater matrix types must have at least one of the following characteristics:
(A) Total suspended solids greater than 40 mg/L.
(B) Total dissolved solids greater than 100 mg/L.
(C) Oil and grease greater than 20 mg/L.
(D) NaCl greater than 120 mg/L.
(E) CaCO3 greater than 140 mg/L.
(ii) Results of MS/MSD tests must meet QC acceptance criteria in section 8.3.
(f) A proficiency testing (PT) sample from a recognized provider, in addition to tests of the nine matrices (section 8.1.2.1.1).
8.1.2.2 The laboratory is required to maintain records of modifications made to this method. These records include the following, at a minimum:
8.1.2.2.1 The names, titles, and business street addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses of the analyst(s) that performed the analyses and modification, and of the quality control officer that witnessed and will verify the analyses and modifications.
8.1.2.2.2 A list of analytes, by name and CAS Registry Number.
8.1.2.2.3 A narrative stating reason(s) for the modifications.
8.1.2.2.4 Results from all quality control (QC) tests comparing the modified method to this method, including:
(a) Calibration (section 7).
(b) Calibration verification/LCS (section 8.4).
(c) Initial demonstration of capability (section 8.2).
(d) Analysis of blanks (section 8.5).
(e) Matrix spike/matrix spike duplicate analysis (section 8.3).
(f) Laboratory control sample analysis (section 8.4).
8.1.2.2.5 Data that will allow an independent reviewer to validate each determination by tracing the instrument output (peak height, area, or other signal) to the final result. These data are to include:
(a) Sample numbers and other identifiers.
(b) Analysis dates and times.
(c) Analysis sequence/run chronology.
(d) Sample volume (Section 10).
(e) Sample dilution (Section 13.2).
(f) Instrument and operating conditions.
(g) Column (dimensions, material, etc).

8.1.2.2.6 Each individual laboratory wishing to use a given modification must perform the start-up tests in section 8.1.2 (e.g., DOC, MDL), with the modification as an integral part of this method prior to applying the modification to specific discharges. Results of the DOC must meet the QC acceptance criteria in Table 7 for the analytes of interest (section 1.3), and the MDLs must be equal to or lower than the MDLs in Table3 for the analytes of interest
8.1.3 Before analyzing samples, the laboratory must analyze a blank to demonstrate that interferences from the analytical system, labware, and reagents are under control. Each time a batch of samples is analyzed or reagents are changed, a blank must be analyzed as a safeguard against laboratory contamination. Requirements for the blank are given in section 8.5.
8.1.4 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike and analyze samples to monitor
and evaluate method and laboratory performance on the sample matrix. The procedure for spiking and analysis is given in section 8.3.
8.1.5 The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through analysis of a quality control check sample (laboratory control sample, LCS; on-going precision and recovery sample, OPR) that the measurement system is in control. This procedure is given in section 8.4.
8.1.6 The laboratory must maintain performance records to document the quality of data that is generated. This procedure is given in section 8.8.
8.1.7 The large number of analytes tested in performance tests in this method present a substantial probability that one or more will fail acceptance criteria when many analytes are tested simultaneously, and a re-test is allowed if this situation should occur. If, however, continued re-testing results in further repeated failures, the laboratory must document and report the failures (e.g., as qualifiers on results), unless the failures are not required to be reported as determined by the regulatory/control authority. Results associated with a QC failure for an analyte regulated in a discharge cannot be used to demonstrate regulatory compliance. QC failures do not relieve a discharger or permittee of reporting timely results.
8.2 Initial demonstration of capability (DOC)—To establish the ability to generate acceptable recovery and precision, the laboratory must perform the DOC in sections 8.2.1 through 8.2.6 for the analytes of interest. The laboratory must also establish MDLs for the analytes of interest using the MDL procedure at 40 CFR part 136, appendix B. The laboratory's MDLs must be equal to or lower than those listed in Table 1 for those analytes which list MDL values, or lower than one-third the regulatory compliance limit, whichever is greater. For MDLs not listed in Table 1, the laboratory must determine the MDLs using the MDL procedure at 40 CFR part 136, appendix B under the same conditions used to determine the MDLs for the analytes listed in Table 1. All procedures used in the analysis must be included in the DOC.
8.2.1 For the DOC, a QC check sample concentrate (LCS concentrate) containing each analyte of interest (section 1.3) is prepared in methanol. The QC check sample concentrate must be prepared independently from those used for calibration, but may be from the same source as the second-source standard used for calibration verification/LCS (sections 7.4 and 8.4). The concentrate should produce concentrations of the analytes of interest in water at the mid-point of the calibration range, and may be at the same concentration as the LCS (section 8.4).

# Note:
QC check sample concentrates are no longer available from EPA.
8.2.2 Using a pipet or micro-syringe, prepare four LCSs by adding an appropriate volume of the concentrate to each of four aliquots of reagent water. The volume of reagent water must be the same as the volume that will be used for the sample, blank (section 8.5), and MS/MSD (section 8.3). A volume of 5 mL and a concentration of 20 µg/L were used to develop the QC acceptance criteria in Table 7. An alternative volume and sample concentration may be used, provided that all QC tests are performed and all QC acceptance criteria in this method are met. Also add an aliquot of the surrogate spiking solution (section 6.7) and internal standard spiking solution (section 7.3.1.3) to the reagent-water aliquots.
8.2.3 Analyze the four LCSs according to the method beginning in section 10.
8.2.4 Calculate the average percent recovery (
X
) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (s) for each analyte using the four results.
8.2.5 For each analyte, compare s and
X
with the corresponding acceptance criteria for precision and recovery in Table 7. For analytes in Tables 1 and 2 not listed in Table 7, DOC QC acceptance criteria must be developed by the laboratory. EPA has provided guidance for development of QC acceptance criteria (References 11 and 12). Alternatively, acceptance criteria for analytes not listed in Table 7 may be based on laboratory control charts. If s and
X
for all analytes of interest meet the acceptance criteria, system performance is acceptable and analysis of blanks and samples may begin. If any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual
X
falls outside the range for recovery, system performance is unacceptable for that analyte.

# Note:
The large number of analytes in Tables 1 and 2 present a substantial probability that one or more will fail at least one of the acceptance criteria when many or all analytes are determined simultaneously. Therefore, the analyst is permitted to conduct a “re-test” as described in section 8.2.6.
8.2.6 When one or more of the analytes tested fail at least one of the acceptance criteria, repeat the test for only the analytes that failed. If results for these analytes pass, system performance is acceptable and analysis of samples and blanks may proceed. If one or more of the analytes again fail, system performance is unacceptable for the analytes that failed the acceptance criteria. Correct the problem and repeat the test (section 8.2). See section 8.1.7 for disposition of repeated failures.

# Note:
To maintain the validity of the test and re-test, system maintenance and/or adjustment is not permitted between this pair of tests.
8.3 Matrix spike and matrix spike duplicate (MS/MSD)—The purpose of the MS/MSD
requirement is to provide data that demonstrate the effectiveness of the method as applied to the samples in question by a given laboratory, and both the data user (discharger, permittee, regulated entity, regulatory/control authority, customer, other) and the laboratory share responsibility for provision of such data. The data user should identify the sample and the analytes of interest (section 1.3) to be spiked and provide sufficient sample volume to perform MS/MSD analyses. The laboratory must, on an ongoing basis, spike at least 5% of the samples in duplicate from each discharge being monitored to assess accuracy (recovery and precision). If direction cannot be obtained from the data user, the laboratory must spike at least one sample in duplicate per extraction batch of up to 20 samples with the analytes in Table 1. Spiked sample results should be reported only to the data user whose sample was spiked, or as requested or required by a regulatory/control authority, or in a permit.
8.3.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of a specific analyte will be checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the concentration of the spike should be at that limit; otherwise, the concentration of the spike should be one to five times higher than the background concentration determined in section 8.3.2, at or near the mid-point of the calibration range, or at the concentration in the LCS (section 8.4) whichever concentration would be larger.
8.3.2 Analyze one sample aliquot to determine the background concentration (B) of the each analyte of interest. If necessary, prepare a new check sample concentrate (section 8.2.1) appropriate for the background concentration. Spike and analyze two additional sample aliquots, and determine the concentration after spiking (A
1
and A
2
) of each analyte. Calculate the percent recoveries (P
1
and P
2
) as 100 (A
1
−B)/T and 100 (A
2
−B)/T, where T is the known true value of the spike. Also calculate the relative percent difference (RPD) between the concentrations (A
1
and A
2
) as 200 |A
1
−A
2
|/(A
1
+ A
2
). If necessary, adjust the concentrations used to calculate the RPD to account for differences in the volumes of the spiked aliquots.
8.3.3 Compare the percent recoveries (P
1
and P
2
) and the RPD for each analyte in the MS/MSD aliquots with the corresponding QC acceptance criteria in Table 7. A laboratory may develop and apply QC acceptance criteria more restrictive than the criteria in Table 7, if desired.
8.3.3.1 If any individual P falls outside the designated range for recovery in either aliquot, or the RPD limit is exceeded, the result for the analyte in the unspiked sample is suspect. See Section 8.1.7 for disposition of failures.
8.3.3.2 The acceptance criteria in Table 7 were calculated to include an allowance for error in measurement of both the background and spike concentrations, assuming a spike to background ratio of 5:1. This error will be accounted for to the extent that the spike to background ratio approaches 5:1 (Reference 13) and is applied to spike concentrations of 20 µg/L and higher. If spiking is performed at a concentration lower than 20 µg/L, the laboratory must use the QC acceptance criteria in Table 7, the optional QC acceptance criteria calculated for the specific spike concentration in Table 8, or optional in-house criteria (Section 8.3.4). To use the acceptance criteria in Table 8: (1) Calculate recovery (X') using the equation in Table 8, substituting the spike concentration (T) for C; (2) Calculate overall precision (S') using the equation in Table 8, substituting X' for
X
; (3) Calculate the range for recovery at the spike concentration as (100 X'/T) ± 2.44(100 S'/T)% (Reference 4). For analytes of interest in Tables 1 and 2 not listed in Table 7, QC acceptance criteria must be developed by the laboratory. EPA has provided guidance for development of QC acceptance criteria (References 11 and 12). Alternatively, acceptance criteria may be based on laboratory control charts. In-house LCS QC acceptance criteria must be updated at least every two years.
8.3.4 After analysis of a minimum of 20 MS/MSD samples for each target analyte and surrogate, and if the laboratory chooses to develop and apply in-house QC limits, the laboratory should calculate and apply in-house QC limits for recovery and RPD of future MS/MSD samples (section 8.3). The QC limits for recovery are calculated as the mean observed recovery ± 3 standard deviations, and the upper QC limit for RPD is calculated as the mean RPD plus 3 standard deviations of the RPDs. The in-house QC limits must be updated at least every two years and re-established after any major change in the analytical instrumentation or process. If in-house QC limits are developed, at least 80% of the analytes tested in the MS/MSD must have in-house QC acceptance criteria that are tighter than those in Table 7 and the remaining analytes (those other than the analytes included in the 80%) must meet the acceptance criteria in Table 7. If an in-house QC limit for the RPD is greater than the limit in Table 7, then the limit in Table 7 must be used. Similarly, if an in-house lower limit for recovery is below the lower limit in Table 7, then the lower limit in Table 7 must be used, and if an in-house upper limit for recovery is above the upper limit in Table 7, then the upper limit in Table 7 must be used.
8.4 Calibration verification/laboratory control sample (LCS)—The working calibration curve or RF must be verified immediately after calibration and at the beginning of each 12-hour shift by the measurement of an LCS. The LCS must be from a source different from the source used for
calibration (section 7.3.2.1), but may be the same as the sample prepared for the DOC (section 8.2.1).

# Note:
The 12-hour shift begins after analysis of BFB, the LCS, and the blank, and ends 12 hours later. BFB, the LCS, and blank are outside of the 12-hour shift (Section 11.4). The MS and MSD are treated as samples and are analyzed within the 12-hour shift.
8.4.1 Prepare the LCS by adding QC check sample concentrate (section 8.2.1) to reagent water. Include all analytes of interest (Section 1.3) in the LCS. The volume of reagent water must be the same as the volume used for the sample, blank (Section 8.5), and MS/MSD (section 8.3). Also add an aliquot of the surrogate solution (Section 6.7) and internal standard solution (section 7.3.1.3). The concentration of the analytes in reagent water should be the same as the concentration in the DOC (section 8.2.2).
8.4.2 Analyze the LCS prior to analysis of field samples in the batch of samples analyzed during the 12-hour shift (see the
Note
at section 8.4). Determine the concentration (A) of each analyte. Calculate the percent recovery (Q) as 100 (A/T) %, where T is the true value of the concentration in the LCS.
8.4.3 Compare the percent recovery (Q) for each analyte with its corresponding QC acceptance criterion in Table 7. For analytes of interest in Tables 1 and 2 not listed in Table 7, use the QC acceptance criteria developed for the LCS (section 8.4.5). If the recoveries for all analytes of interest fall within their respective QC acceptance criteria, analysis of blanks and field samples may proceed. If any individual Q falls outside the range, proceed according to section 8.4.4.

# Note:
The large number of analytes in Tables 1—2 present a substantial probability that one or more will fail the acceptance criteria when all analytes are tested simultaneously. Because a re-test is allowed in event of failure (sections 8.1.7 and 8.4.3), it may be prudent to analyze two LCSs together and evaluate results of the second analysis against the QC acceptance criteria only if an analyte fails the first test.
8.4.4 Repeat the test only for those analytes that failed to meet the acceptance criteria (Q). If these analytes now pass, system performance is acceptable and analysis of blanks and samples may proceed. Repeated failure, however, will confirm a general problem with the measurement system. If this occurs, repeat the test (section 8.4.2). using a fresh LCS (section 8.2.2) or an LCS prepared with a fresh QC check sample concentrate (section 8.2.1), or perform and document system repair. Subsequent to repair, repeat the calibration verification/LCS test (section 8.4). If the acceptance criteria for Q cannot be met, re-calibrate the instrument (section 7). See section 8.1.7 for disposition of repeated failures.

# Note:
To maintain the validity of the test and re-test, system maintenance and/or adjustment is not permitted between the pair of tests.
8.4.5 After analysis of 20 LCS samples, and if the laboratory chooses to develop and apply in-house QC limits, the laboratory should calculate and apply in-house QC limits for recovery to future LCS samples (section 8.4). Limits for recovery in the LCS calculated as the mean recovery ±3 standard deviations. A minimum of 80% of the analytes tested for in the LCS must have QC acceptance criteria tighter than those in Table 7, and the remaining analytes (those other than the analytes included in the 80%) must meet the acceptance criteria in Table 7. If an in-house lower limit for recovery is lower than the lower limit in Table 7, the lower limit in Table 7 must be used, and if an in-house upper limit for recovery is higher than the upper limit in Table 7, the upper limit in Table 7 must be used. Many of the analytes and surrogates do not have acceptance criteria. The laboratory should use 60-140% as interim acceptance criteria for recoveries of spiked analytes that do not have recovery limits specified in Table 7, and least 80% of the analytes should meet the 60-140% interim criteria until in-house LCS limits are developed. Alternatively, acceptance criteria for analytes that do not have recovery limits in Table 7 may be based on laboratory control charts. In-house QC acceptance criteria must be updated at least every two years.
8.5 Blank—A blank must be analyzed prior to each 12-hour shift to demonstrate freedom from contamination. A blank must also be analyzed after a sample containing a high concentration of an analyte or potentially interfering compound to demonstrate freedom from carry-over.
8.5.1 Spike the internal standards and surrogates into the blank. Analyze the blank immediately after analysis of the LCS (Section 8.4) and prior to analysis of the MS/MSD and samples to demonstrate freedom from contamination.
8.5.2 If any analyte of interest is found in the blank: At a concentration greater than the MDL for the analyte, at a concentration greater than one-third the regulatory compliance limit, or at a concentration greater than one-tenth the concentration in a sample analyzed during the 12-hour shift (section 8.4),
whichever is greater;
analysis of samples must be halted and samples affected by the blank must be re-analyzed. If, however, continued re-testing results in repeated blank contamination, the laboratory must document and report the failures (e.g., as qualifiers on results), unless the failures are not required to be reported as determined by the regulatory/control authority. Results associated with blank contamination for an analyte regulated in a discharge cannot be used to demonstrate regulatory compliance.
QC failures do not relieve a discharger or permittee of reporting timely results.
8.6 Surrogate recoveries—The laboratory must evaluate surrogate recovery data in each sample against its in-house surrogate recovery limits for surrogates that do not have acceptance criteria in Table 7. The laboratory may use 60-140% as interim acceptance criteria for recoveries for surrogates not listed in Table 5. At least 80% of the surrogates must meet the 60-140% interim criteria until in-house limits are developed. Alternatively, surrogate recovery limits may be developed from laboratory control charts.
8.6.1 Spike the surrogates into all samples, blanks, LCSs, and MS/MSDs. Compare surrogate recoveries against the QC acceptance criteria in Table 7. For surrogates in Table 5 without QC acceptance criteria in Table 7, and for other surrogates that may be used by the laboratory, limits must be developed by the laboratory. EPA has provided guidance for development of QC acceptance criteria (References 11 and 12). Alternatively, surrogate recovery limits may be developed from laboratory control charts. In-house QC acceptance criteria must be updated at least every two years.
8.6.2 If any recovery fails its criteria, attempt to find and correct the cause of the failure. See section 8.1.7 for disposition of failures.
8.7 Internal standard responses.
8.7.1 Calibration verification/LCS—The responses (GC peak heights or areas) of the internal standards in the calibration verification/LCS must be within 50% to 200% (1/2 to 2×) of their respective responses in the mid-point calibration standard. If they are not, repeat the LCS test using a fresh QC check sample (section 8.4.1) or perform and document system repair. Subsequent to repair, repeat the calibration verification/LCS test (section 8.4). If the responses are still not within 50% to 200%, re-calibrate the instrument (section 7) and repeat the calibration verification/LCS test.
8.7.2 Samples, blanks, and MS/MSDs—The responses (GC peak heights or areas) of each internal standard in each sample, blank, and MS/MSD must be within 50% to 200% (1/2 to 2×) of its respective response in the mid-point calibration standard. If, as a group, all internal standards are not within this range, perform and document system repair, repeat the calibration verification/LCS test (section 8.4), and re-analyze the affected samples. If a single internal standard is not within the 50% to 200% range, use an alternative internal standard for quantitation of the analyte referenced to the affected internal standard. It may be necessary to use the data system to calculate a new response factor from calibration data for the alternative internal standard/analyte pair. If an internal standard fails the 50-200% criteria and no analytes are detected in the sample, ignore the failure or report it if required by the regulatory/control authority.
8.8 As part of the QC program for the laboratory, control charts or statements of accuracy for wastewater samples must be assessed and records maintained periodically (see 40 CFR 136.7(c)(1)(viii)). After analysis of five or more spiked wastewater samples as in section 8.3, calculate the average percent recovery (P
X
) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (sp). Express the accuracy assessment as a percent interval from P
X
−2
sp
to P
X
+ 2
sp
. For example, if P
X
= 90% and sp = 10%, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70-110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each analyte on a regular basis (e.g., after each 5-10 new accuracy measurements). If desired, statements of accuracy for laboratory performance, independent of performance on samples, may be developed using LCSs.
8.9 It is recommended that the laboratory adopt additional quality assurance practices for use with this method. The specific practices that are most productive depend upon the needs of the laboratory and the nature of the samples. Field duplicates may be analyzed to assess the precision of environmental measurements. Whenever possible, the laboratory should analyze standard reference materials and participate in relevant performance evaluation studies.

# 9. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Handling
9.1 Collect the sample as a grab sample in a glass container having a total volume of at least 25 mL. Fill the sample bottle just to overflowing in such a manner that no air bubbles pass through the sample as the bottle is being filled. Seal the bottle so that no air bubbles are entrapped in it. If needed, collect additional sample(s) for the MS/MSD (section 8.3).
9.2 Ice or refrigerate samples at ≤6 °C from the time of collection until analysis, but do not freeze. If residual chlorine is present, add sodium thiosulfate preservative (10 mg/40 mL is sufficient for up to 5 ppm Cl
2
) to the empty sample bottle just prior to shipping to the sampling site. Any method suitable for field use may be employed to test for residual chlorine (Reference 14). Field test kits are also available for this purpose. If sodium thiosulfate interferes in the determination of the analytes, an alternative preservative (e.g., ascorbic acid or sodium sulfite) may be used. If preservative has been added, shake the sample vigorously for one minute. Maintain the hermetic seal on the sample bottle until time of analysis.
9.3 If acrolein is to be determined, analyze the sample within 3 days. To extend the holding time to 14 days, acidify a separate sample to pH 4-5 with HCl using the procedure in section 9.7.
9.4 Experimental evidence indicates that some aromatic compounds, notably benzene,
toluene, and ethyl benzene are susceptible to rapid biological degradation under certain environmental conditions (Reference 3). Refrigeration alone may not be adequate to preserve these compounds in wastewaters for more than seven days. To extend the holding time for aromatic compounds to 14 days, acidify the sample to approximately pH 2 using the procedure in section 9.7.
9.5 If halocarbons are to be determined, either use the acidified aromatics sample in section 9.4 or acidify a separate sample to a pH of about 2 using the procedure in section 9.7.
9.6 The ethers listed in Table 2 are prone to hydrolysis at pH 2 when a heated purge is used. Aqueous samples should not be acid preserved if these ethers are of interest, or if the alcohols they would form upon hydrolysis are of interest and the ethers are anticipated to present.
9.7 Sample acidification—Collect about 500 mL of sample in a clean container and adjust the pH of the sample to 4-5 for acrolein (section 9.3), or to about 2 for the aromatic compounds (section 9.4) by adding 1+1 HCl while swirling or stirring. Check the pH with narrow range pH paper. Fill a sample container as described in section 9.1. Alternatively, fill a precleaned vial (section 5.1.1) that contains approximately 0.25 mL of 1+1 HCl with sample as in section 9.1. If preserved using this alternative procedure, the pH of the sample can be verified to be
2 after some of the sample is removed for analysis. Acidification will destroy 2-chloroethylvinyl ether; therefore, determine 2-chloroethylvinyl ether from the unacidified sample.
9.8 All samples must be analyzed within 14 days of collection (Reference 3), unless specified otherwise in sections 9.3-9.7.

# 10. Sample Purging and Gas Chromatography
10.1 The footnote to Table 3 gives the suggested GC column and operating conditions MDLs and MLs for many of the analytes are given in Table 1. Retention times for many of the analytes are given in Table 3. Sections 10.2 through 10.7 suggest procedures that may be used with a manual purge-and-trap system. Auto-samplers and other columns or chromatographic conditions may be used if requirements in this method are met. Prior to performing analyses, and between analyses, it may be necessary to bake the purge-and-trap and GC systems (section 3.3).
10.2 Attach the trap inlet to the purging device, and set the purge-and-trap system to purge. Open the syringe valve located on the purging device sample introduction needle.
10.3 Allow the sample to come to ambient temperature prior to pouring an aliquot into the syringe. Remove the plunger from a syringe and attach a closed syringe valve. Open the sample bottle (or standard) and carefully pour the sample into the syringe barrel to just short of overflowing. Replace the syringe plunger and compress the sample. Open the syringe valve and vent any residual air while adjusting the sample volume. Since this process of taking an aliquot destroys the validity of the sample for future analysis, the analyst should fill a second syringe at this time to protect against possible loss of data. Add the surrogate spiking solution (section 6.7) and internal standard spiking solution (section 7.3.1.3) through the valve bore, then close the valve. The surrogate and internal standards may be mixed and added as a single spiking solution. Autosamplers designed for purge-and-trap analysis of volatiles also may be used.
10.4 Attach the syringe valve assembly to the syringe valve on the purging device. Open the syringe valve and inject the sample into the purging chamber.
10.5 Close both valves and purge the sample at a temperature, flow rate, and duration sufficient to purge the less-volatile analytes onto the trap, yet short enough to prevent blowing the more-volatile analytes through the trap. The temperature, flow rate, and time should be determined by test. The same purge temperature, flow rate, and purge time must be used for all calibration, QC, and field samples.
10.6 After the purge, set the purge-and-trap system to the desorb mode, and begin the temperature program of the gas chromatograph. Introduce the trapped materials to the GC column by rapidly heating the trap to the desorb temperature while backflushing the trap with carrier gas at the flow rate and for the time necessary to desorb the analytes of interest. The optimum temperature, flow rate, and time should be determined by test. The same temperature, desorb time, and flow rate must be used for all calibration, QC, and field samples. If heating of the trap does not result in sharp peaks for the early eluting analytes, the GC column may be used as a secondary trap by cooling to an ambient or subambient temperature. To avoid carry-over and interferences, maintain the trap at the desorb temperature and flow rate until the analytes, interfering compounds, and excess water are desorbed. The optimum conditions should be determined by test.
10.7 Start MS data acquisition at the start of the desorb cycle and stop data collection when the analytes of interest, potentially interfering compounds, and water have eluted (see the footnote to Table 3 for conditions).
10.8 Cool the trap to the purge temperature and return the trap to the purge mode. When the trap is cool, the next sample can be analyzed.

# 11. Performance Tests
11.1 At the beginning of each 12-hour shift during which standards or samples will be
analyzed, perform the tests in sections 11.2-11.3 to verify system performance. Use the instrument operating conditions in the footnotes to Table 3 for these performance tests. Alternative conditions may be used so as long as all QC requirements are met.
11.2 BFB—Inject 50 ng of BFB solution directly on the column. Alternatively, add BFB to reagent water or an aqueous standard such that 50 ng or less of BFB will be introduced into the GC. Analyze according to section 10. Confirm that all criteria in section 7.3.2.2 and Table 4 are met. If all criteria are not met, perform system repair, retune the mass spectrometer, and repeat the test until all criteria are met.
11.3 Verify calibration with the LCS (section 8.4) after the criteria for BFB are met (Reference 15) and prior to analysis of a blank or sample. After verification, analyze a blank (section 8.5) to demonstrate freedom from contamination and carry-over at the MDL. Tests for BFB, the LCS, and the blank are outside of the 12-hour shift, and the 12-hour shift includes samples and matrix spikes and matrix spike duplicates (section 8.4). The total time for analysis of BFB, the LCS, the blank, and the 12-hour shift must not exceed 14 hours.

# 12. Qualitative Identification
12.1 Identification is accomplished by comparison of results from analysis of a sample or blank with data stored in the GC/MS data system (section 7.3.2.3). Identification of an analyte is confirmed per sections 12.1.1 through 12.1.4.
12.1.1 The signals for the quantitation and secondary m/z's stored in the data system (section 7.3.2.3) for each analyte of interest must be present and must maximize within the same two consecutive scans.
12.1.2 The retention time for the analyte should be within ± 10 seconds of the analyte in the LCS run at the beginning of the shift (section 8.4).

# Note:
Retention time windows other than ± 10 seconds may be appropriate depending on the performance of the gas chromatograph or observed retention time drifts due to certain types of matrix effects. Relative retention time (RRT) may be used as an alternative to absolute retention times if retention time drift is a concern. RRT is a unitless quantity (see section 20.2), although some procedures refer to “RRT units” in providing the specification for the agreement between the RRT values in the sample and the LCS or other standard. When significant retention time drifts are observed, dilutions or spiked samples may help the analyst determine the effects of the matrix on elution of the target analytes and to assist in qualitative identification.
12.1.3 Either the background corrected EICP areas, or the corrected relative intensities of the mass spectral peaks at the GC peak maximum, must agree within 50% to 200% (
1/2
to 2 times) for the quantitation and secondary m/z's in the reference mass spectrum stored in the data system (section 7.3.2.3), or from a reference library. For example, if a peak has an intensity of 20% relative to the base peak, the analyte is identified if the intensity of the peak in the sample is in the range of 10% to 40% of the base peak.
12.1.4 If the acquired mass spectrum is contaminated, or if identification is ambiguous, an experienced spectrometrist (section 1.6) must determine the presence or absence of the compound.
12.2 Structural isomers that produce very similar mass spectra should be identified as individual isomers if they have sufficiently different gas chromatographic retention times. Sufficient gas chromatographic resolution is achieved if the height of the valley between two isomer peaks is less than 50% of the average of the two peak heights. Otherwise, structural isomers are identified as isomeric pairs. The resolution should be verified on the mid-point concentration of the initial calibration as well as the laboratory designated continuing calibration verification level if closely eluting isomers are to be reported.

# 13. Calculations
13.1 When an analyte has been identified, quantitation of that analyte is based on the integrated abundance from the EICP of the primary characteristic m/z in Table 5 or 6. Calculate the concentration using the response factor (RF) determined in section 7.3.3 and Equation 2. If a calibration curve was used, calculate the concentration using the regression equation for the curve. If the concentration of an analyte exceeds the calibration range, dilute the sample by the minimum amount to bring the concentration into the calibration range, and re-analyze. Determine a dilution factor (DF) from the amount of the dilution. For example, if the extract is diluted by a factor of 2, DF = 2.
ER28AU17.013
Where:
C
s
= Concentration of the analyte in the sample, and the other terms are as defined in Section 7.3.3.
13.2 Reporting of results
As noted in section 1.4.1, EPA has promulgated this method at 40 CFR part 136 for use in wastewater compliance monitoring under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). The data reporting practices described here are focused on such monitoring needs and may not be relevant to other uses of this method.
13.2.1 Report results for wastewater samples in µg/L without correction for recovery. (Other units may be used if required by a permit.) Report all QC data with the sample results.
13.2.2 Reporting level. Unless otherwise specified in by a regulatory authority or in a discharge permit, results for analytes that meet the identification criteria are reported down to the concentration of the ML established by the laboratory through calibration of the instrument (see section 7.3.2 and the glossary for the derivation of the ML). EPA considers the terms “reporting limit,” “limit of quantitation,” “quantitation limit,” and “minimum level” to be synonymous.
13.2.2.1 Report a result for each analyte in each field sample or QC standard at or above the ML to 3 significant figures. Report a result for each analyte found in each field sample or QC standard below the ML as “
ML,” where ML is the concentration of the analyte at the ML, or as required by the regulatory/control authority or permit. Report a result for each analyte in a blank at or above the MDL to 2 significant figures. Report a result for each analyte found in a blank below the MDL as “
MDL,” where MDL is the concentration of the analyte at the MDL, or as required by the regulatory/control authority or permit.
13.2.2.2 In addition to reporting results for samples and blanks separately, the concentration of each analyte in a blank associated with the sample may be subtracted from the result for that sample, but only if requested or required by a regulatory authority or in a permit. In this case, both the sample result and the blank result must be reported together.
13.2.2.3 Report a result for an analyte found in a sample that has been diluted at the least dilute level at which the area at the quantitation m/z is within the calibration range (
i.e.,
above the ML for the analyte) and the MS/MSD recovery and RPD are within their respective QC acceptance criteria (Table 7). This may require reporting results for some analytes from different analyses.
13.2.3 Results from tests performed with an analytical system that is not in control (
i.e.,
that does not meet acceptance criteria for any of the QC test in this method) must be documented and reported (e.g., as a qualifier on results), unless the failure is not required to be reported as determined by the regulatory/control authority. Results associated with a QC failure cannot be used to demonstrate regulatory compliance. QC failures do not relieve a discharger or permittee of reporting timely results. If the holding time would be exceeded for a re-analysis of the sample, the regulatory/control authority should be consulted for disposition.

# 14. Method Performance
14.1 This method was tested by 15 laboratories using reagent water, drinking water, surface water, and industrial wastewaters spiked at six concentrations over the range 5-600 µg/L (References 4 and 16). Single-operator precision, overall precision, and method accuracy were found to be directly related to the concentration of the analyte and essentially independent of the sample matrix. Linear equations to describe these relationships are presented in Table 8.
14.2 As noted in section 1.1, this method was validated through an interlaboratory study conducted in the early 1980s. However, the fundamental chemistry principles used in this method remain sound and continue to apply.

# 15. Pollution Prevention
15.1 Pollution prevention encompasses any technique that reduces or eliminates the quantity or toxicity of waste at the point of generation. Many opportunities for pollution prevention exist in laboratory operations. EPA has established a preferred hierarchy of environmental management techniques that places pollution prevention as the management option of first choice. Whenever feasible, the laboratory should use pollution prevention techniques to address waste generation. When wastes cannot be reduced at the source, the Agency recommends recycling as the next best option.
15.2 The analytes in this method are used in extremely small amounts and pose little threat to the environment when managed properly. Standards should be prepared in volumes consistent with laboratory use to minimize the disposal of excess volumes of expired standards.
15.3 For information about pollution prevention that may be applied to laboratories and research institutions, consult “Less is Better: Laboratory Chemical Management for Waste Reduction,” available from the American Chemical Society's Department of Governmental Relations and Science Policy, 1155 16th Street NW., Washington, DC 20036, 202-872-4477.

# 16. Waste Management
16.1 The laboratory is responsible for complying with all Federal, State, and local regulations governing waste management, particularly the hazardous waste identification rules and land disposal restrictions, and to protect the air, water, and land by minimizing and controlling all releases from fume hoods and bench operations. Compliance is also required with any sewage discharge permits and regulations. An overview of requirements can be found in Environmental Management Guide for Small Laboratories (EPA 233-B-98-001).
16.2 Samples at pH
2, or pH
12, are hazardous and must be handled and disposed of as hazardous waste, or neutralized and disposed of in accordance with all federal, state, and local regulations. It is the laboratory's responsibility to comply with all federal, state, and local regulations governing waste management, particularly the hazardous waste identification rules and land disposal restrictions. The laboratory using this method has the responsibility to protect the air, water, and land by minimizing and controlling all releases from fume hoods and bench operations. Compliance is also required with any sewage discharge permits and regulations. For further information on waste management, see “The Waste Management Manual for Laboratory Personnel,” also available from the American Chemical Society at the address in Section 15.3.
16.3 Many analytes in this method decompose above 500 °C. Low-level waste such as absorbent paper, tissues, and plastic gloves may be burned in an appropriate incinerator. Gross quantities of neat or highly concentrated solutions of toxic or hazardous chemicals should be packaged securely and disposed of through commercial or governmental channels that are capable of handling these types of wastes.
16.4 For further information on waste management, consult “Waste Management Manual for Laboratory Personnel and Less is Better-Laboratory Chemical Management for Waste Reduction,” available from the American Chemical Society's Department of Government Relations and Science Policy, 1155 16th Street NW., Washington, DC 20036, 202-872-4477.

19.2 Definitions and acronyms (in alphabetical order).
Analyte—A compound tested for by this method. The analytes are listed in Tables 1 and 2.
Analyte of interest—An analyte of interest is an analyte required to be determined by a regulatory/control authority or in a permit, or by a client.
Analytical batch—The set of samples analyzed on a given instrument during a 12-hour period that begins with analysis of a calibration verification/LCS. See section 8.4.
Blank—An aliquot of reagent water that is treated exactly as a sample including exposure to all glassware, equipment, solvents, reagents, internal standards, and surrogates that are used with samples. The blank is used to determine if analytes or interferences are present in the laboratory environment, the reagents, or the apparatus. See section 8.5.
Calibration—The process of determining the relationship between the output or response of a measuring instrument and the value of an input standard. Historically, EPA has referred to a multi-point calibration as the “initial calibration,” to differentiate it from a single-point calibration verification.
Calibration standard—A solution prepared from stock solutions and/or a secondary standards and containing the analytes of interest, surrogates, and internal standards. The calibration standard is used to calibrate the response of the GC/MS instrument against analyte concentration.
Calibration verification standard—The laboratory control sample (LCS) used to verify calibration. See Section 8.4.
Descriptor—In SIM, the beginning and ending retention times for the RT window, the m/z's sampled in the RT window, and the dwell time at each m/z.
Extracted ion current profile (EICP)—The line described by the signal at a given m/z.
Field duplicates—Two samples collected at the same time and place under identical conditions, and treated identically throughout field and laboratory procedures. Results of analyses of field duplicates provide an estimate of the precision associated with sample collection, preservation, and storage, as well as with laboratory procedures.
Field blank—An aliquot of reagent water or other reference matrix that is placed in a sample container in the field, and treated as a sample in all respects, including exposure to sampling site conditions, storage, preservation, and all analytical procedures. The purpose of the field blank is to determine if the field or sample transporting procedures and environments have contaminated the sample.
GC—Gas chromatograph or gas chromatography.
Internal standard—A compound added to a sample in a known amount and used as a reference for quantitation of the analytes of interest and surrogates. Internal standards are listed in Table 5. Also see Internal standard quantitation.
Internal standard quantitation—A means of determining the concentration of an analyte of interest (Tables 1 and 2) by reference to a compound added to a sample and not expected to be found in the sample.
DOC—Initial demonstration of capability (DOC; section 8.2); four aliquots of reagent water spiked with the analytes of interest and analyzed to establish the ability of the laboratory to generate acceptable precision and recovery. A DOC is performed prior to the first time this method is used and any time the method or instrumentation is modified.
Laboratory control sample (LCS; laboratory fortified blank (LFB); on-going precision and recovery sample; OPR)—An aliquot of reagent water spiked with known quantities of the analytes of interest and surrogates. The LCS is analyzed exactly like a sample. Its purpose is to assure that the results produced by the laboratory remain within the limits specified in this method for precision and recovery. In this method, the LCS is synonymous with a calibration verification sample (See sections 7.4 and 8.4).
Laboratory fortified sample matrix—See Matrix spike.
Laboratory reagent blank—See Blank.
Matrix spike (MS) and matrix spike duplicate (MSD) (laboratory fortified sample matrix and duplicate)—Two aliquots of an environmental sample to which known quantities of the analytes of interest and surrogates are added in the laboratory. The MS/MSD are prepared and analyzed exactly like a field sample. Their purpose is to quantify any additional bias and imprecision caused by the sample matrix. The background concentrations of the analytes in the sample matrix must be determined in a separate aliquot and the measured values in the MS/MSD corrected for background concentrations.
May—This action, activity, or procedural step is neither required nor prohibited.
May not—This action, activity, or procedural step is prohibited.
Method blank (laboratory reagent blank)—See Blank.
Method detection limit (MDL)—A detection limit determined by the procedure at 40 CFR part 136, appendix B. The MDLs determined by EPA in the original version of the method are listed in Table 1. As noted in Sec. 1.4, use the MDLs in Table 1 in conjunction with current MDL data from the laboratory actually analyzing samples to assess the sensitivity of this procedure relative to project objectives and regulatory requirements (where applicable).
Minimum level (ML)—The term “minimum level” refers to either the sample concentration equivalent to the lowest calibration point in a method or a multiple of the method detection limit (MDL), whichever is higher. Minimum levels may be obtained in several ways: They may be published in a method; they may be based on the lowest acceptable calibration point used by a laboratory; or they may be calculated by multiplying the MDL in a method, or the MDL determined by a laboratory, by a factor of 3. For the purposes of NPDES compliance monitoring, EPA considers the following terms to
be synonymous: “quantitation limit,” “reporting limit,” and “minimum level.”
MS—Mass spectrometer or mass spectrometry.
Must—This action, activity, or procedural step is required.
m/z—The ratio of the mass of an ion (m) detected in the mass spectrometer to the charge (z) of that ion.
Quality control sample (QCS)—A sample containing analytes of interest at known concentrations. The QCS is obtained from a source external to the laboratory or is prepared from standards obtained from a different source than the calibration standards.
The purpose is to check laboratory performance using test materials that have been prepared independent of the normal preparation process.
Reagent water—Water demonstrated to be free from the analytes of interest and potentially interfering substances at the MDLs for the analytes in this method.
Regulatory compliance limit (or regulatory concentration limit)—A limit on the concentration or amount of a pollutant or contaminant specified in a nationwide standard, in a permit, or otherwise established by a regulatory/control authority.
Relative retention time (RRT)—The ratio of the retention time of an analyte to the retention time of its associated internal standard. RRT compensates for small changes in the GC temperature program that can affect the absolute retention times of the analyte and internal standard. RRT is a unitless quantity.
Relative standard deviation (RSD)—The standard deviation times 100 divided by the mean. Also termed “coefficient of variation.”
RF—Response factor. See section 7.3.3.
RSD—See relative standard deviation.
Safety Data Sheet (SDS)—Written information on a chemical's toxicity, health hazards, physical properties, fire, and reactivity, including storage, spill, and handling precautions that meet the requirements of OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) and appendix D to § 1910.1200. United Nations Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS), third revised edition, United Nations, 2009.
Selected Ion Monitoring (SIM)—An MS technique in which a few m/z's are monitored. When used with gas chromatography, the m/z's monitored are usually changed periodically throughout the chromatographic run to correlate with the characteristic m/z's for the analytes, surrogates, and internal standards as they elute from the chromatographic column. The technique is often used to increase sensitivity and minimize interferences.
Signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)—The height of the signal as measured from the mean (average) of the noise to the peak maximum divided by the width of the noise.
SIM—See Selection Ion Monitoring.
Should—This action, activity, or procedural step is suggested but not required.
Stock solution—A solution containing an analyte that is prepared using a reference material traceable to EPA, the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST), or a source that will attest to the purity and authenticity of the reference material.
Surrogate—A compound unlikely to be found in a sample, and which is spiked into sample in a known amount before purge-and-trap. The surrogate is quantitated with the same procedures used to quantitate the analytes of interest. The purpose of the surrogate is to monitor method performance with each sample.
VOA—Volatile organic analysis: e.g., the analysis performed by this method.

# Method 625.1—Base/Neutrals and Acids by GC/MS
Pt. 136, App. A, Meth. 625.1

# 1. Scope and Application
1.1 This method is for determination of semivolatile organic pollutants in industrial discharges and other environmental samples by gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC/MS), as provided under 40 CFR 136.1. This revision is based on a previous protocol (Reference 1), on the basic revision promulgated October 26, 1984, and on an interlaboratory method validation study (Reference 2). Although this method was validated through an interlaboratory study conducted in the early 1980s, the fundamental chemistry principles used in this method remain sound and continue to apply.
1.2 The analytes that may be qualitatively and quantitatively determined using this method and their CAS Registry numbers are listed in Tables 1 and 2. The method may be extended to determine the analytes listed in Table 3; however, extraction or gas chromatography of some of these analytes may make quantitative determination difficult. For example, benzidine is subject to oxidative losses during extraction and/or solvent concentration. Under the alkaline conditions of the extraction,
alpha
-BHC,
gamma
-BHC, endosulfan I and II, and endrin are subject to decomposition. Hexachlorocyclopentadiene is subject to thermal decomposition in the inlet of the gas chromatograph, chemical reaction in acetone solution, and photochemical decomposition. N-nitrosodiphenylamine and other nitrosoamines may decompose in the gas chromatographic inlet. The sample may be extracted at neutral pH if necessary to overcome these or other decomposition problems that could occur at alkaline or acidic pH. EPA also has provided other methods (e.g., Method 607—Nitrosamines) that may be used for determination of some of these analytes.
EPA encourages use of Method 625.1 to determine additional compounds amenable to extraction and GC/MS.
1.3 The large number of analytes in Tables 1-3 of this method makes testing difficult if all analytes are determined simultaneously. Therefore, it is necessary to determine and perform quality control (QC) tests for the “analytes of interest” only. Analytes of interest are those required to be determined by a regulatory/control authority or in a permit, or by a client. If a list of analytes is not specified, the analytes in Tables 1 and 2 must be determined, at a minimum, and QC testing must be performed for these analytes. The analytes in Tables 1 and 2, and some of the analytes in Table 3 have been identified as Toxic Pollutants (40 CFR 401.15), expanded to a list of Priority Pollutants (40 CFR part 423, appendix A).
1.4 In this revision to Method 625, the pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been moved from Table 1 to Table 3 (Additional Analytes) to distinguish these analytes from the analytes required in quality control tests (Tables 1 and 2). QC acceptance criteria for pesticides and PCBs have been retained in Table 6 and may continue to be applied if desired, or if requested or required by a regulatory/control authority or in a permit. Method 608.3 should be used for determination of pesticides and PCBs. However, if pesticides and/or PCBs are to be determined, an additional sample must be collected and extracted using the pH adjustment and extraction procedures specified in Method 608.3. Method 1668C may be useful for determination of PCBs as individual chlorinated biphenyl congeners, and Method 1699 may be useful for determination of pesticides. At the time of writing of this revision, Methods 1668C and 1699 had not been approved for use at 40 CFR part 136. The screening procedure for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-
p
-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) contained in the version of Method 625 promulgated October 26, 1984 has been replaced with procedures for selected ion monitoring (SIM), and 2,3,7,8-TCDD may be determined using the SIM procedures. However, EPA Method 613 or 1613B should be used for analyte-specific determination of 2,3,7,8-TCDD because of the focus of these methods on this compound. Methods 613 and 1613B are approved for use at 40 CFR part 136.
1.5 Method detection limits (MDLs; Reference 3) for the analytes in Tables 1, 2, and 3 are listed in those tables. These MDLs were determined in reagent water (Reference 4). Advances in analytical technology, particularly the use of capillary (open-tubular) columns, allowed laboratories to routinely achieve MDLs for the analytes in this method that are 2-10 times lower than those in the version promulgated in 1984. The MDL for an analyte in a specific wastewater may differ from those listed, depending upon the nature of interferences in the sample matrix.
1.5.1 EPA has promulgated this method at 40 CFR part 136 for use in wastewater compliance monitoring under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). The data reporting practices described in section 15.2 are focused on such monitoring needs and may not be relevant to other uses of the method.
1.5.2 This method includes “reporting limits” based on EPA's “minimum level” (ML) concept (see the glossary in section 22). Tables 1, 2, and 3 contain MDL values and ML values for many of the analytes.
1.6 This method is performance-based. It may be modified to improve performance (e.g., to overcome interferences or improve the accuracy of results) provided all performance requirements are met.
1.6.1 Examples of allowed method modifications are described at 40 CFR 136.6. Other examples of allowed modifications specific to this method, including solid-phase extraction (SPE) are described in section 8.1.2.
1.6.2 Any modification beyond those expressly permitted at 40 CFR 136.6 or in section 8.1.2 of this method shall be considered a major modification subject to application and approval of an alternate test procedure under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.
1.6.3 For regulatory compliance, any modification must be demonstrated to produce results equivalent or superior to results produced by this method when applied to relevant wastewaters (section 8.3).
1.7 This method is restricted to use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer and in the interpretation of mass spectra. Each laboratory that uses this method must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results using the procedure in Section 8.2.
1.8 Terms and units of measure used in this method are given in the glossary at the end of the method.

# 2. Summary of Method
2.1 A measured volume of sample, sufficient to meet an MDL or reporting limit, is serially extracted with methylene chloride at pH 11-13 and again at a pH less than 2 using a separatory funnel or continuous liquid/liquid extractor.
2.2 The extract is concentrated to a volume necessary to meet the required compliance or detection limit, and analyzed by GC/MS. Qualitative identification of an analyte in the extract is performed using the retention time and the relative abundance of two or more characteristic masses (m/z's). Quantitative analysis is performed using the internal standard technique with a single characteristic m/z.

# 3. Contamination and Interferences
3.1 Solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing labware may yield artifacts, elevated baselines, or matrix interferences causing misinterpretation of chromatograms and mass spectra. All materials used in the analysis must be demonstrated to be free from contamination and interferences by analyzing blanks initially and with each extraction batch (samples started through the extraction process in a given 24-hour period, to a maximum of 20 samples—see Glossary for detailed definition), as described in Section 8.5. Specific selection of reagents and purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required. Where possible, labware is cleaned by extraction or solvent rinse, or baking in a kiln or oven.
3.2 Glassware must be scrupulously cleaned (Reference 5). Clean all glassware as soon as possible after use by rinsing with the last solvent used in it. Solvent rinsing should be followed by detergent washing with hot water, and rinses with tap water and reagent water. The glassware should then be drained dry, and heated at 400 °C for 15-30 minutes. Some thermally stable materials, such as PCBs, may require higher temperatures and longer baking times for removal. Solvent rinses with pesticide quality acetone, hexane, or other solvents may be substituted for heating. Do not heat volumetric labware above 90 °C. After drying and cooling, store inverted or capped with solvent-rinsed or baked aluminum foil in a clean environment to prevent accumulation of dust or other contaminants.
3.3 Matrix interferences may be caused by contaminants co-extracted from the sample. The extent of matrix interferences will vary considerably from source to source, depending upon the nature and diversity of the industrial complex or municipality being sampled. Interferences extracted from samples high in total organic carbon (TOC) may result in elevated baselines, or by enhancing or suppressing a signal at or near the retention time of an analyte of interest. Analyses of the matrix spike and duplicate (section 8.3) may be useful in identifying matrix interferences, and gel permeation chromatography (GPC; Section 11.1) and sulfur removal (section 11.2) may aid in eliminating these interferences. EPA has provided guidance that may aid in overcoming matrix interferences (Reference 6).
3.4 In samples that contain an inordinate number of interferences, the use of chemical ionization (CI) or triple quadrupole (MRM) mass spectrometry may make identification easier. Tables 4 and 5 give characteristic CI and MRM m/z's for many of the analytes covered by this method. The use of CI or MRM mass spectrometry may be utilized to support electron ionization (EI) mass spectrometry or as a primary method for identification and quantification. While the use of these enhanced techniques is encouraged, it is not required.

# 4. Safety
4.1 Hazards associated with each reagent used in this method have not been precisely defined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. From this viewpoint, exposure to these chemicals must be reduced to the lowest possible level by whatever means available. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of safety data sheets (SDSs, OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.1200(g)) should also be made available to all personnel involved in sample handling and chemical analysis. Additional references to laboratory safety are available and have been identified (References 7-9) for the information of the analyst.
4.2 The following analytes covered by this method have been tentatively classified as known or suspected human or mammalian carcinogens: Benzo(a)anthracene, benzidine, 3,3′-dichlorobenzidine, benzo(a)pyrene,
alpha
-BHC,
beta
-BHC,
delta
-BHC,
gamma
-BHC, Dibenz(a,h)-anthracene, N-nitrosodimethylamine, 4,4′-DDT, and PCBs. Other compounds in Table 3 may also be toxic. Primary standards of toxic compounds should be prepared in a chemical fume hood, and a NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be worn when handling high concentrations of these compounds.
4.3 This method allows the use of hydrogen as a carrier gas in place of helium (section 5.6.1.2). The laboratory should take the necessary precautions in dealing with hydrogen, and should limit hydrogen flow at the source to prevent buildup of an explosive mixture of hydrogen in air.

# 5. Apparatus and Materials

# Note:
Brand names, suppliers, and part numbers are for illustration purposes only. No endorsement is implied. Equivalent performance may be achieved using equipment and materials other than those specified here. Demonstrating that the equipment and supplies used in the laboratory achieves the required performance is the responsibility of the laboratory. Suppliers for equipment and materials in this method may be found through an on-line search. Please do not contact EPA for supplier information.
5.1 Sampling equipment, for discrete or composite sampling.
5.1.1 Grab sample bottle—amber glass bottle large enough to contain the necessary sample volume, fitted with a fluoropolymer-lined screw cap. Foil may be substituted for fluoropolymer if the sample is not corrosive.
If amber bottles are not available, protect samples from light. Unless pre-cleaned, the bottle and cap liner must be washed, rinsed with acetone or methylene chloride, and dried before use to minimize contamination.
5.1.2 Automatic sampler (optional)—the sampler must incorporate a pre-cleaned glass sample container. Samples must be kept refrigerated at ≤6 °C and protected from light during compositing. If the sampler uses a peristaltic pump, a minimum length of compressible silicone rubber tubing may be used. Before use, however, rinse the compressible tubing with methanol, followed by repeated rinsing with reagent water, to minimize the potential for sample contamination. An integrating flow meter is required to collect flow-proportioned composites.
5.2 Glassware.
5.2.1 Separatory funnel—Size appropriate to hold sample volume and extraction solvent volume, and equipped with fluoropolymer stopcock.
5.2.2 Drying column—Chromatographic column, approximately 400 mm long by 19 mm ID, with coarse frit, or equivalent, sufficient to hold 15 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate.
5.2.3 Concentrator tube, Kuderna-Danish—10 mL, graduated (Kontes 570050-1025 or equivalent). Calibration must be checked at the volumes employed in the test. A ground glass stopper is used to prevent evaporation of extracts.

5.6.1.1 Injection port—Can be split, splitless, temperature programmable vaporization split/splitless (PTV), solvent-purge, large-volume, on-column, backflushed, or other. An autosampler is highly recommended because it injects volumes more precisely than volumes injected manually.
5.6.1.2 Carrier gas—Helium or hydrogen. Data in the tables in this method were obtained using helium carrier gas. If hydrogen is used, analytical conditions may need to be adjusted for optimum performance, and calibration and all QC tests must be performed with hydrogen carrier gas. See Section 4.3 for precautions regarding the use of hydrogen as a carrier gas.
5.6.2 GC column—See the footnotes to Tables 4 and 5. Other columns or column systems may be used provided all requirements in this method are met.
5.6.3 Mass spectrometer—Capable of repetitively scanning from 35-450 Daltons (amu) every two seconds or less, utilizing a 70 eV (nominal) electron energy in the electron impact ionization mode, and producing a mass spectrum which meets all the criteria in Table 9A or 9B when 50 ng or less of decafluorotriphenyl phosphine (DFTPP; CAS 5074-71-5; bis(pentafluorophenyl) phenyl phosphine) is injected into the GC.
5.6.4 GC/MS interface—Any GC to MS interface that meets all performance requirements in this method may be used.
5.6.5 Data system—A computer system must be interfaced to the mass spectrometer that allows the continuous acquisition and storage of mass spectra acquired throughout the chromatographic program. The computer must have software that allows searching any GC/MS data file for specific m/z's (masses) and plotting m/z abundances versus time or scan number. This type of plot is defined as an extracted ion current profile (EICP). Software must also be available that allows integrating the abundance at any EICP between specified time or scan number limits.
5.7 Automated gel permeation chromatograph (GPC).
5.7.1 GPC column—150-700 mm long × 21-25 mm ID, packed with 70 g of SX-3 Biobeads; Bio-Rad Labs, or equivalent.

# 6. Reagents
6.1 Reagent water—Reagent water is defined as water in which the analytes of interest and interfering compounds are not detected at the MDLs of the analytes of interest.
6.2 Sodium hydroxide solution (10 N)—Dissolve 40 g of NaOH (ACS) in reagent water and dilute to 100 mL.
6.3 Sodium thiosulfate—(ACS) granular.
6.4 Sulfuric acid (1+1)—Slowly add 50 mL of H
2
SO
4
(ACS, sp. gr. 1.84) to 50 mL of reagent water.
6.5 Acetone, methanol, methylene chloride, 2-propanol—High purity pesticide quality, or equivalent, demonstrated to be free of the analytes of interest and interferences (Section 3). Purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.
6.6 Sodium sulfate—(ACS) granular, anhydrous, rinsed or Soxhlet extracted with methylene chloride (20 mL/g), baked in a shallow tray at 450 °C for one hour minimum, cooled in a desiccator, and stored in a pre-cleaned glass bottle with screw cap that prevents moisture from entering.
6.7 Stock standard solutions (1.00 µg/µL)—Stock standard solutions may be prepared from pure materials, or purchased as certified solutions. Traceability must be to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) or other national or international standard, when available. Stock solution concentrations alternate to those below may be used. Because of the toxicity of some of the compounds, primary dilutions should be prepared in a hood, and a NIOSH/MESA approved toxic gas respirator should be worn when high concentrations of neat materials are handled. The following procedure may be used to prepare standards from neat materials.
6.7.1 Prepare stock standard solutions by accurately weighing about 0.0100 g of pure material. Dissolve the material in pesticide quality methanol or other suitable solvent and dilute to volume in a 10-mL volumetric flask. Larger volumes may be used at the convenience of the laboratory. When compound purity is assayed to be 96% or greater, the weight may be used without correction to calculate the concentration of the stock standard. Commercially prepared stock standards may be used at any concentration if they are certified by the manufacturer or by an independent source.
6.7.2 Unless stated otherwise in this method, store non-aqueous standards in fluoropolymer-lined screw-cap, or heat-sealed, glass containers, in the dark at −20 to −10 °C. Store aqueous standards; e.g., the aqueous LCS (section 8.4.1), in the dark at ≤ 6 °C, but do not freeze. Standards prepared by the laboratory may be stored for up to one year, except when comparison with QC check standards indicates that a standard has degraded or become more concentrated due to evaporation, or unless the laboratory has data on file to prove stability for a longer period. Commercially prepared standards may be stored until the expiration date provided by the vendor, except when comparison with QC check standards indicates that a standard has degraded or become more concentrated due to evaporation, or unless the laboratory has data from the vendor on file to prove stability for a longer period.
6.8 Surrogate standard spiking solution.
6.8.1 Select a minimum of three surrogate compounds from Table 8 that most closely match the recovery of the analytes of interest. For example, if all analytes tested are considered acids, use surrogates that have similar chemical attributes. Other compounds may be used as surrogates so long as they do not interfere in the analysis. If only one or two analytes are determined, one or two surrogates may be used.
6.8.2 Prepare a solution containing each selected surrogate such that the concentration in the sample would match the concentration in the mid-point calibration standard. For example, if the midpoint of the calibration is 100 µg/L, prepare the spiking solution at a concentration of 100 µg/mL in methanol. Addition of 1.00 mL of this solution to 1000 mL of sample will produce a concentration of 100 µg/L of the surrogate. Alternate volumes and concentrations appropriate to the response of the GC/MS instrument or for selective ion monitoring (SIM) may be used, if desired. Store per section 6.7.2.
6.9 Internal standard spiking solution.
6.9.1 Select three or more internal standards similar in chromatographic behavior to the analytes of interest. Internal standards are listed in Table 8. Suggested internal standards are: 1,4-dichlorobenzene-d
4
; naphthalene-d
8
; acenaphthene-d
10
; phenanthrene-d
10
; chrysene-d
12
; and perylene-d
12
. The laboratory must demonstrate that measurement of the internal standards is not affected by method or matrix interferences (see also section 7.3.4).
6.9.2 Prepare the internal standards at a concentration of 10 mg/mL in methylene chloride or other suitable solvent. When 10 µL of this solution is spiked into a 1-mL extract, the concentration of the internal standards will be 100 µg/mL. A lower concentration appropriate to the response of the GC/MS instrument or for SIM may be used, if desired. Store per section 6.7.3.
6.9.3 To assure accurate analyte identification, particularly when SIM is used, it may be advantageous to include more internal standards than those suggested in section 6.9.1. An analyte will be located most accurately if its retention time relative to an internal standard is in the range of 0.8 to 1.2.
6.10 DFTPP standard—Prepare a solution of DFTPP in methanol or other suitable solvent such that 50 ng or less will be injected (see section 13.2). An alternative concentration may be used to compensate for specific injection volumes or to assure that the operating range of the instrument is not exceeded, so long as the total injected is 50 ng or less. Include benzidine and pentachlorophenol in this solution such that ≤100 ng of benzidine and ≤50 ng of pentachlorophenol will be injected.
6.11 Quality control check sample concentrate—See section 8.2.1.
6.12 GPC calibration solution.
6.12.1 Prepare a methylene chloride solution to contain corn oil, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (BEHP), perylene, and sulfur at the concentrations in section 6.12.2, or at concentrations appropriate to the response of the detector.

# Note:
Sulfur does not readily dissolve in methylene chloride, but is soluble in warm corn oil. The following procedure is suggested for preparation of the solution.
6.12.2 Weigh 8 mg sulfur and 2.5 g corn oil into a 100-mL volumetric flask and warm to dissolve the sulfur. Separately weigh 100 mg BEHP, 20 mg pentachlorophenol, and 2 mg perylene and add to flask. Bring to volume with methylene chloride and mix thoroughly.
6.12.3 Store the solution in an amber glass bottle with a fluoropolymer-lined screw cap at 0-6 °C. Protect from light. Refrigeration may cause the corn oil to precipitate. Before use, allow the solution to stand at room temperature until the corn oil dissolves, or warm slightly to aid in dissolution. Replace the solution every year, or more frequently if the response of a component changes.
6.13 Sulfur removal—Copper foil or powder (bright, non-oxidized), or tetrabutylammonium sulfite (TBA sulfite).
6.13.1 Copper foil, or powder—Fisher, Alfa Aesar 42455-18, 625 mesh, or equivalent. Cut copper foil into approximately 1-cm squares. Copper must be activated before it may be used, as described below:
6.13.1.1 Place the quantity of copper needed for sulfur removal (section 11.2.1.3) in a ground-glass-stoppered Erlenmeyer flask or bottle. Cover the foil or powder with methanol.
6.13.1.2 Add HCl dropwise (0.5-1.0 mL) while swirling, until the copper brightens.
6.13.1.3 Pour off the methanol/HCl and rinse 3 times with reagent water to remove all traces of acid, then 3 times with acetone, then 3 times with hexane.
6.13.1.4 For copper foil, cover with hexane after the final rinse. Store in a stoppered flask under nitrogen until used. For the powder, dry on a rotary evaporator or under a stream of nitrogen. Store in a stoppered flask under nitrogen until used. Inspect the copper foil or powder before each use. It must have a bright, non-oxidized appearance to be effective. Copper foil or powder that has oxidized may be reactivated using the procedure described above.
6.13.2 Tetrabutylammonium sodium sulfite (TBA sodium sulfite).
6.13.2.1 Tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate, [CH

6.13.2.3 Dissolve approximately 3 g tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate in 100 mL of reagent water in an amber bottle with fluoropolymer-lined screw cap. Extract with three 20-mL portions of hexane and discard the hexane extracts.
6.13.2.4 Add 25 g sodium sulfite to produce a saturated solution. Store at room temperature. Replace after 1 month.
6.14 DDT and endrin decomposition (breakdown) solution—Prepare a solution containing endrin at a concentration of 1 µg/mL and 4,4′-DDT at a concentration of 2 µg/mL, in isooctane or hexane. A 1-µL injection of this standard will contain 1 nanogram (ng) of endrin and 2 ng of DDT. The concentration of the solution may be adjusted by the laboratory to accommodate other injection volumes such that the same masses of the two analytes are introduced into the instrument.

# 7. Calibration
7.1 Establish operating conditions equivalent to those in the footnote to Table 4 or 5 for the base/neutral or acid fraction, respectively. If a combined base/neutral/acid fraction will be analyzed, use the conditions in the footnote to Table 4. Alternative temperature program and flow rate conditions may be used. It is necessary to calibrate the GC/MS for the analytes of interest (Section 1.3) only.
7.2 Internal standard calibration.
7.2.1 Prepare calibration standards for the analytes of interest and surrogates at a minimum of five concentration levels by adding appropriate volumes of one or more stock standards to volumetric flasks. One of the calibration standards should be at a concentration at or below the ML specified in Table 1, 2, or 3, or as specified by a regulatory/control authority or in a permit. The ML value may be rounded to a whole number that is more convenient for preparing the standard, but must not exceed the ML in Table 1, 2, or 3 for those analytes which list ML values. Alternatively, the laboratory may establish a laboratory ML for each analyte based on the concentration in a
nominal whole-volume sample that is equivalent to the concentration of the lowest calibration standard in a series of standards produced in the laboratory or obtained from a commercial vendor. The laboratory's ML must not exceed the ML in Table 1, 2, or 3, and the resulting calibration must meet the acceptance criteria in Section 7.2.3, based on the RSD, RSE, or R
2
. The concentrations of the other calibration standards should correspond to the expected range of concentrations found in real samples or should define the working range of the GC/MS system for full-scan and/or SIM operation, as appropriate. A minimum of six concentration levels is required for a second order, non-linear (e.g., quadratic; ax
2
+ bx + c = 0) calibration (section 7.2.3). Calibrations higher than second order are not allowed. To each calibration standard or standard mixture, add a known constant volume of the internal standard solution (section 6.9), and dilute to volume with methylene chloride.

# Note:
The large number of analytes in Tables 1 through 3 may not be soluble or stable in a single solution; multiple solutions may be required if a large number of analytes are to be determined simultaneously.
7.2.1.1 Prior to analysis of the calibration standards, inject the DFTPP standard (Section 6.10) and adjust the scan rate of the mass spectrometer to produce a minimum of 5 mass spectra across the DFTPP GC peak. Adjust instrument conditions until the DFTPP criteria in Table 9A or 9B are met. Calculate peak tailing factors for benzidine and pentachlorophenol. Calculation of the tailing factor is illustrated in Figure 1. The tailing factor for benzidine and pentachlorophenol must be
2; otherwise, adjust instrument conditions and either replace the column or break off a short section of the front end of the column, and repeat the test. Once the scan conditions are established, they must be used for analyses of all standards, blanks, and samples.

# Note:
The DFTPP spectrum may be evaluated by summing the intensities of the m/z's across the GC peak, subtracting the background at each m/z in a region of the chromatogram within 20 scans of but not including any part of, the DFTPP peak. The DFTPP spectrum may also be evaluated by fitting a Gaussian to each m/z and using the intensity at the maximum for each Gaussian or by integrating the area at each m/z and using the integrated areas. Other means may be used for evaluation of the DFTPP spectrum so long as the spectrum is not distorted to meet the criteria in Table 9A or 9B.
7.2.1.2 Analyze the mid-point combined base/neutral and acid calibration standard and enter or review the retention time, relative retention time, mass spectrum, and quantitation m/z in the data system for each analyte of interest, surrogate, and internal standard. If additional analytes (Table 3) are to be quantified, include these analytes in the standard. The mass spectrum for each analyte must be comprised of a minimum of 2 m/z's (Tables 4 and 5); 3 to 5 m/z's assure more reliable analyte identification. Suggested quantitation m/z's are shown in Tables 4 and 5 as the primary m/z. If an interference occurs at the primary m/z, use one of the secondary m/z's or an alternate m/z. A single m/z only is required for quantitation.
7.2.1.3 For SIM operation, determine the analytes in each descriptor, the quantitation m/z for each analyte (the quantitation m/z can be the same as for full-scan operation; section 7.2.1.2), the dwell time on each m/z for each analyte, and the beginning and ending retention time for each descriptor. Analyze the verification standard in scan mode to verify m/z's and establish retention times for the analytes. There must be a minimum of two m/z's for each analyte to assure analyte identification. To maintain sensitivity, the number of m/z's in a descriptor should be limited. For example, for a descriptor with 10 m/z's and a chromatographic peak width of 5 sec, a dwell time of 100 ms at each m/z would result in a scan time of 1 second and provide 5 scans across the GC peak. The quantitation m/z will usually be the most intense peak in the mass spectrum. The quantitation m/z and dwell time may be optimized for each analyte. The acquisition table used for SIM must take into account the mass defect (usually less than 0.2 Dalton) that can occur at each m/z monitored. Refer to the footnotes to Table 4 or 5 for establishing operating conditions and to section 7.2.1.1 for establishing scan conditions.
7.2.1.4 For combined scan and SIM operation, set up the scan segments and descriptors to meet requirements in sections 7.2.1.1-7.2.1.3. Analyze unfamiliar samples in the scan mode to assure that the analytes of interest are determined.
7.2.2 Analyze each calibration standard according to section 12 and tabulate the area at the quantitation m/z against concentration for each analyte of interest, surrogate, and internal standard. If an interference is encountered, use a secondary m/z (Table 4 or 5) for quantitation. Calculate a response factor (RF) for each analyte of interest at each concentration using Equation 1.
ER28AU17.014

C
s
= Concentration of the analyte of interest or surrogate (µg/mL).
7.2. Calculate the mean (average) and relative standard deviation (RSD) of the responses factors. If the RSD is less than 35%, the RF can be assumed to be invariant and the average RF can be used for calculations. Alternatively, the results can be used to fit a linear or quadratic regression of response ratios, As/Ais, vs. concentration ratios Cs/Cis. If used, the regression must be weighted inversely proportional to concentration. The coefficient of determination (R
2
; Reference 10) of the weighted regression must be greater than 0.920 (this value roughly corresponds to the RSD limit of 35%). Alternatively, the relative standard error (Reference 11) may be used as an acceptance criterion. As with the RSD, the RSE must be less than 35%. If an RSE less than 35% cannot be achieved for a quadratic regression, system performance is unacceptable and the system must be adjusted and re-calibrated.

# Note:
Using capillary columns and current instrumentation, it is quite likely that a laboratory can calibrate the target analytes in this method and achieve a linearity metric (either RSD or RSE) well below 35%. Therefore, laboratories are permitted to use more stringent acceptance criteria for calibration than described here, for example, to harmonize their application of this method with those from other sources.
7.3 Calibration verification—The RF or calibration curve must be verified immediately after calibration and at the beginning of each 12-hour shift, by analysis of a standard at or near the concentration of the mid-point calibration standard (section 7.2.1). The standard(s) must be obtained from a second manufacturer or a manufacturer's batch prepared independently from the batch used for calibration. Traceability must be to a national standard, when available. Include the surrogates (section 6.8) in this solution. It is necessary to verify calibration for the analytes of interest (section 1.3) only.

# Note:
The 12-hour shift begins after the DFTPP (section 13.1) and DDT/endrin tests (if DDT and endrin are to be determined), and after analysis of the calibration verification standard. The 12-hour shift ends 12 hours later. The DFTPP, DDT/endrin, and calibration verification tests are outside of the 12-hour shift.
7.3.1 Analyze the calibration verification standard(s) beginning in section 12. Calculate the percent recovery of each analyte. Compare the recoveries for the analytes of interest against the acceptance criteria for recovery (Q) in Table 6, and the recoveries for the surrogates against the acceptance criteria in Table 8. If recovery of the analytes of interest and surrogates meet acceptance criteria, system performance is acceptable and analysis of samples may continue. If any individual recovery is outside its limit, system performance is unacceptable for that analyte.

# Note:
The large number of analytes in Tables 6 and 8 present a substantial probability that one or more will fail acceptance criteria when all analytes are tested simultaneously.
7.3.2 When one or more analytes fail acceptance criteria, analyze a second aliquot of the calibration verification standard and compare ONLY those analytes that failed the first test (section 7.3.1) with their respective acceptance criteria. If these analytes now pass, system performance is acceptable and analysis of samples may continue. A repeat failure of any analyte that failed the first test, however, will confirm a general problem with the measurement system. If this occurs, repair the system (section 7.2.1.1) and repeat the test (section 7.3.1), or prepare a fresh calibration standard and repeat the test. If calibration cannot be verified after maintenance or injection of the fresh calibration standard, re-calibrate the instrument.

# Note:
If it is necessary to perform a repeat verification test frequently;
i.e.,
perform two tests in order to pass, it may be prudent to perform two injections in succession and review the results, rather than perform one injection, review the results, then perform the second injection if results from the first injection fail. To maintain the validity of the test and re-test, system maintenance and/or adjustment is not permitted between the injections.
7.3.3 Many of the analytes in Table 3 do not have QC acceptance criteria in Table 6, and some of the surrogates in Table 8 do not have acceptance criteria. If calibration is to be verified and other QC tests are to be performed for these analytes, acceptance criteria must be developed and applied. EPA has provided guidance for development of QC acceptance criteria (References 12 and 13). Alternatively, analytes that do not have acceptance criteria in Table 6 or Table 8 may
be based on laboratory control charts, or 60 to 140% may be used.
