refers to title 40, part 52, section 2020.

# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

# INQUIRIES

Determination of attainment
—In accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, EPA has determined that Pittsburgh-Beaver Valley 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard and that certain requirements of section 172(c) of the Clean Air Act are suspended as long as the nonattainment area continues to meet the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. This determination is based upon complete, quality assured, and certified ambient air monitoring data that show the area has monitored attainment of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS for the 2007 to 2009 monitoring period. Complete, quality-assured air monitoring data for 2010 are consistent with continued attainment. This determination suspends the obligation of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to submit an attainment demonstration and associated reasonably
available control measures (RACM), a reasonable further progress (RFP) plan, contingency measures, and other planning requirements related to attainment of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS for the Pittsburgh Area for as long as the area continues to meet the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. If a violation of the1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Pittsburgh-Beaver Valley 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, this determination shall no longer apply.
(r)

Mass Emissions Limits, the Facility shall use CEMS in accordance with the procedures at 40 CFR part 75. Emissions rates, mass emissions, and other quantitative standards set by or under this section must be met to the number of significant digits in which the standard or limit is expressed. For example, an Emission Rate of 0.100 is not met if the actual Emission Rate is 0.101. The Facility shall round the fourth significant digit to the nearest third significant digit, or the sixth significant digit to the nearest fifth significant digit, depending upon whether the limit is expressed to three or five significant digits. For example, if an actual emission rate is 0.1004, that shall be reported as 0.100, and shall be in compliance with an emission rate of 0.100, and if an actual emission rate is 0.1005, that shall be reported as 0.101, and shall not be in compliance with an emission eate of 0.100. The Facility shall report data to the number of significant digits in which the standard or limit is expressed.
(h)
Recordkeeping and periodic peporting.
(1) The Facility shall electronically submit to EPA a periodic report, within thirty (30) Days after the end of each six-month reporting period (January through June, July through December in each calendar year). The portion of the periodic report containing the data required to be reported by this paragraph (h) shall be in an unlocked electronic spreadsheet format, such as Excel or other widely-
used software, and contain data for each Operating Day during the reporting period, including, but not limited to: Facility ID (ORISPL); Facility name; Unit ID; Date; Unit-specific total Daily Operating Time (hours); Unit-specific Daily NO
X
Mass Emissions (lbs); Unit-specific total Daily Heat Input (MMBtu); Unit-specific Daily NO
X
Emission Rate (lb/MMBtu); Facility-wide 30-Day Rolling Average NO
X
Emission Rate (lb/MMBtu); Owner; Operator; Representative (Primary); and Representative (Secondary). In addition, the Facility shall maintain the following information for 5 years from the date of creation of the data and make such information available to EPA if requested: Unit-specific hourly heat input, Unit-specific hourly ammonia injection amounts, and Unit-specific hourly NO
X
emission rate.
(2) In any periodic report submitted pursuant to this section, the Facility may incorporate by reference information previously submitted to EPA under its Title V permitting requirements, so long as that information is adequate to determine compliance with the emission limits and in the same electronic format as required for the periodic report, and provided that the Facility attaches the Title V Permit report (or the pertinent portions of such report) and provides a specific reference to the provisions of the Title V Permit report that are responsive to the information required in the periodic report.
(3) In addition to the reports required pursuant to this section, if the Facility exceeds the Facility-wide 30-day rolling average NO
X
emission limit on three or more days during any 30-day period, or exceeds the Unit-specific daily mass emission limit for any Unit on three or more days during any 30-day period, the Facility shall electronically submit to EPA a report on the exceedances within ten (10) business days after the Facility knew or should have known of the event. In the report, the Facility shall explain the cause or causes of the exceedances and any measures taken or to be taken to cure the reported exceedances or to prevent such exceedances in the future. If, at any time, the provisions of this section are included in Title V Permits, consistent with the requirements for such inclusion in this section, then the deviation reports required under applicable Title V regulations shall be deemed to satisfy all the requirements of this paragraph (h)(3).
(4) Each report shall be signed by the Responsible Official as defined in Title V of the Clean Air Act, or his or her equivalent or designee of at least the rank of Vice President. The signatory shall also electronically submit the following certification, which may be contained in a separate document:

Rules and regulations.
(a) Part D—Disapproval.
(1) On November 5, 1985, the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management submitted a revision to the Rhode Island State Implementation Plan (SIP) for Arkwright Incorporated. This revision is an alternative reasonably available control technology determination for the control of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from three paper coating lines at Arkwright Incorporated's Fiskeville, Rhode Island facility. As a result of EPA's disapproval of this revision, the existing VOC rules applicable to Arkwright Incorporated and contained in the Rhode Island SIP remain in effect (Rhode Island Air Pollution Control Regulation No. 19 as approved by EPA in 40 CFR 52.2080(c)(19)).

Emission inventories.
(a) The Governor's designee for the State of Rhode Island submitted the 1990 base year emission inventory for the Providence ozone nonattainment area on January 12, 1993 as a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP). The 1990 base year emission inventory requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been satisfied for this area.
(b) The inventory is for the ozone precursors which are volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide. The inventory covers point, area, non-road mobile, on-road mobile, and biogenic sources.
(c) The Providence nonattainment area is classified as serious and includes the entire state of Rhode Island.
(d) Minor revisions to the Rhode Island 1990 base year emission inventory were submitted to EPA on September 21, 1998. The revised emission estimates were prepared in accordance with EPA guidance, and are approved into the State's SIP.
(e) The state of Rhode Island submitted base year emission inventories representing emissions for calendar year 2002 from the Providence moderate ozone nonattainment area on April 30, 2008 as revisions to the State's SIP. The 2002 base year emission inventory requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been satisfied for this area. The inventory consists of emission estimates of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides, and cover point, area, non-road mobile, on-road mobile and biogenic sources. The inventory was submitted as a revision to the SIP in partial fulfillment of obligations for nonattainment areas under EPA's 1997 8-hour ozone standard.

§ 52.2088
Control strategy: Ozone.
(a)
Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Rhode Island
Department of Environmental Management on September 21, 1998.
These revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the rate of progress requirement of section 182(c)(2)(B), and the contingency measure requirements of section 182(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act, for the Providence serious ozone nonattainment area.
(b) Approval—Revisions to the state implementation plan submitted by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management on March 24, 2003. The revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the one-hour ozone attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act, for the Rhode Island serious ozone nonattainment area. The revision establishes a one-hour attainment date of November 15, 2007 for the Rhode Island serious ozone nonattainment area, and approves the contingency measures for purposes of attainment. This revision establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets for 2007 of 30.68 tons per day of volatile organic compounds and 33.97 tons per day of nitrogen oxides to be used in transportation conformity in the Rhode Island serious ozone nonattainment area. Rhode Island also commits to conduct a mid-course review to assess modeling and monitoring progress achieved towards the goal of attainment by 2007, and to submit the results to EPA by December 31, 2004.
(c) Determination of Attainment. Effective July 6, 2010, EPA is determining that the Providence (All of Rhode Island) 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (
see
40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for as long as the area does not monitor any violations of the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. If a violation of the 1997 ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Providence (All of Rhode Island) 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, this determination shall no longer apply.
(d)
Determination of Attainment.
Effective November 22, 2010, EPA is determining that the Providence (All of Rhode Island) 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard based on 2007-2009 monitoring data. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for as long as the area does not monitor any violations of the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. If a violation of the 1997 ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Providence (All of Rhode Island) 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, this determination shall no longer apply. In addition, this area met its June 15, 2010 attainment deadline for the 1997 ozone standard.
(e) Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management on April 30, 2008. The revision is for the purpose of satisfying the rate of progress requirement of section 182(b)(1) from 2002 through 2008, and the contingency measure requirement of sections 172(c)(9) and of the Clean Air Act, for the Providence moderate ozone nonattainment area. The revision establishes motor vehicle emission budgets for 2008 of 24.64 tons per day of volatile organic compounds and 28.26 tons per day of nitrogen oxides to be used in transportation conformity in the Providence moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area.
[66 FR 30815, June 8, 2001, as amended at 68 FR 16724, Apr. 7, 2003; 75 FR 31290, June 3, 2010; 75 FR 64951, Oct. 22, 2010; 77 FR 50601, Aug. 22, 2012]
§ 52.2089
Control strategy: carbon monoxide.
(a) Approval—On September 22, 2008, the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management submitted a request to establish a limited maintenance plan for the Providence Rhode Island carbon monoxide attainment area for the remainder of the second ten-year maintenance plan. The State of Rhode Island has committed to year round carbon monoxide monitoring at the East Providence Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Station (PAMS)
site; re-establishing downtown Providence CO monitoring if criteria specified in the Limited Maintenance Plan are triggered; and, ensuring that project-level carbon monoxide evaluations of transportation projects in the maintenance area are conducted. The limited maintenance plan satisfies all applicable requirements of section 175A of the Clean Air Act. Approval of a limited maintenance plan is conditioned on maintaining levels of ambient carbon monoxide levels below the required limited maintenance plan 8-hour carbon monoxide design value criterion of 7.65 parts per million. If the Limited Maintenance Plan criterion is no longer satisfied, Rhode Island must develop a full maintenance plan to meet Clean Air Act requirements.

§ 52.2122
Approval status.
(a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves South Carolina's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds that the plan satisfies all requirements of part D, title 1, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977.
(b) EPA disapproved South Carolina's generic bubble regulation submitted for approval into the State Implementation Plan (SIP) on June 5, 1985.
(c)(1) Insofar as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions found in this subpart apply to stationary sources of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, the Administrator approves that application only to the extent that GHGs are “subject to regulation”, as provided in this paragraph (c), and the Administrator takes no action on that application to the extent that GHGs are not “subject to regulation.”
(2) Beginning January 2, 2011, the pollutant GHGs is subject to regulation if:
(i) The stationary source is a new major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will emit or will have the potential to emit 75,000 tpy CO
2
e or more; or
(ii) The stationary source is an existing major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will have an emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant, and an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO
2
e or more; and,
(3) Beginning July 1, 2011, in addition to the provisions in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the pollutant GHGs shall also be subject to regulation:
(i) At a new stationary source that will emit or have the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO
2
e; or
(ii) At an existing stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO
2
e, when such stationary source undertakes a physical change or change in the method of operation that will result in an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO
2
e or more.
(4) For purposes of this paragraph (c)—
(i) The term greenhouse gas shall mean the air pollutant defined in 40 CFR 86.1818-12(a) as the aggregate group of six greenhouse gases: Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
(ii) The term tpy CO
2
equivalent emissions (CO
2
e) shall represent an amount of GHGs emitted, and shall be computed as follows:
(A) Multiplying the mass amount of emissions (tpy), for each of the six greenhouse gases in the pollutant GHGs, by the gas's associated global warming potential published at Table A-1 to subpart A of 40 CFR part 98—Global Warming Potentials.
(B) Sum the resultant value from paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for each gas to compute a tpy CO
2
e.
(iii) The term emissions increase shall mean that both a significant emissions increase (as calculated using the procedures in South Carolina Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards (South Carolina Regulations) 61-62.5, Standard No. 7, paragraph (a)(2)(iv)) and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in South
Carolina Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards (South Carolina Regulations) 61-62.5, Standard No. 7, paragraphs (b)(34) and (b)(49)(i)) occur. For the pollutant GHGs, an emissions increase shall be based on tpy CO
2
e, and shall be calculated assuming the pollutant GHGs is a regulated NSR pollutant, and “significant” is defined as 75,000 tpy CO
2
e instead of applying the value in South Carolina Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards (South Carolina Regulations) 61-62.5, Standard No. 7, paragraph (b)(49)(ii).
(d) Regulation 61-62.5 Standard No. 7—This regulation (submitted on July 1, 2005) includes two portions of EPA's 2002 NSR Reform Rules that were vacated by the D.C. Circuit Court—Pollution Control Projects (PCPs) and clean units. As a result, EPA is disapproving all rules and/or rule sections in the South Carolina PSD rules referencing clean units or PCPs. Specifically, the following South Carolina rules are being disapproved: (a)(2)(iv)(e); (a)(2)(iv)(f) (second sentence only); (a)(2)(vi); (b)(12); (b)(30)(iii)(h); (b)(34)(iii)(b); (b)(34)(vi)(d); (b)(35); (r)(6)—only the reference to the term “clean unit” is being disapproved.

§ 52.2125
Control strategy: Ozone.
(a)
Determination of attaining data.
EPA has determined, as of November 15, 2011, the bi-state Charlotte-Gastonia-Rockhill, North Carolina-South Carolina nonattainment area has attaining data for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standards for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS.
(b) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2008-2010, EPA determined that the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill, North Carolina-South Carolina, 1997 8-hour ozone nonattainment Area attained the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of June 15, 2011. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2) to determine, based on the Area's air
quality as of the attainment date, whether the Area attained the standard. EPA also determined that the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill, North Carolina-South Carolina, 1997 8-hour ozone nonattainment Area is not subject to the consequences of failing to attain pursuant to section 181(b)(2).
(c)
Determination of attainment.
The EPA has determined, as of June 3, 2016, that based on 2012 to 2014 ambient air quality data, the Charlotte-Rock Hill, NC-SC 2008 ozone Marginal nonattainment area has attained the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Therefore, the EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality data as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. The EPA also determined that the Charlotte-Rock Hill, NC-SC nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to attain by its applicable attainment date under section 181(b)(2)(A).

VOC rule deficiency correction.
Sections I and II of South Carolina's Regulations 62.1 and 62.5 is approved. The State submitted these regulations to EPA for approval on September 18, 1990. Sections I and II of Regulation 62.5 were intended to correct deficiencies cited in a letter calling for the State to revise its SIP for ozone from Mr. Greer C. Tidwell, the EPA Regional Administrator, to Governor Carroll A. Campbell on May 26, 1988, and clarified in a letter from Mr. Winston A. Smith, EPA Region IV, Air, Pesticides and Toxics Management Division, to Mr. Otto E. Pearson, former Director of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control:
(a) South Carolina's VOC regulations contain no method for determining capture efficiency. This deficiency must be corrected after EPA publishes guidance on the methods for determining capture efficiency before the SIP for ozone can be fully approved.

§ 52.2172
Approval status.
(a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves South Dakota's plan as meeting the requirements of section 110 of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977. Furthermore, the Administrator finds that the plan satisfies all requirements of Part D of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977.
(b)(1) Insofar as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions found in this subpart apply to stationary sources of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, the Administrator approves that application only to the extent that GHGs are “subject to regulation”, as provided in this paragraph (b), and the Administrator takes no action on that application to the extent that GHGs are not “subject to regulation.”
(2) Beginning January 2, 2011, the pollutant GHGs is subject to regulation if:
(i) The stationary source is a new major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will emit or will have the potential to emit 75,000 tpy CO
2
e or more; or
(ii) The stationary source is an existing major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will have an emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant, and an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO
2
e or more; and,
(3) Beginning July 1, 2011, in addition to the provisions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the pollutant GHGs shall also be subject to regulation:
(i) At a new stationary source that will emit or have the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO
2
e; or
(ii) At an existing stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO
2
e, when such stationary
source undertakes a physical change or change in the method of operation that will result in an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO
2
e or more.
(4) For purposes of this paragraph (b)—
(i) The term greenhouse gas shall mean the air pollutant defined in 40 CFR 86.1818-12(a) as the aggregate group of six greenhouse gases: Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
(ii) The term tpy CO
2
equivalent emissions (CO
2
e) shall represent an amount of GHGs emitted, and shall be computed as follows:
(A) Multiplying the mass amount of emissions (tpy), for each of the six greenhouse gases in the pollutant GHGs, by the gas's associated global warming potential published at Table A-1 to subpart A of 40 CFR part 98—Global Warming Potentials.
(B) Sum the resultant value from paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for each gas to compute a tpy CO
2
e.
(iii) The term emissions increase shall mean that both a significant emissions increase (as calculated using the procedures in 40 CFR 52.21(a)(2)(iv)) and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in paragraphs 40 CFR 52.21(b)(3) and (b)(23)(i)) occur. For the pollutant GHGs, an emissions increase shall be based on tpy CO
2
e, and shall be calculated assuming the pollutant GHGs is a regulated NSR pollutant, and “significant” is defined as 75,000 tpy CO
2
e instead of applying the value in 40 CFR 52.21(b)(23)(ii).
[75 FR 82561, Dec. 30, 2010]
§ 52.2173
Legal authority.
(a) The requirements of § 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met since the South Dakota Compiled Law 34-16A-21 provides that data which relates to processes or production unique to the owner or which tend to adversely affect a competitive position of the owner shall be held confidential.
(b) Delegation of authority: Pursuant to section 114 of the Act, South Dakota requested a delegation of authority to enable it to collect, correlate and release emission data to the public. The Administrator has determined that South Dakota is qualified to receive a delegation of the authority it requested. Accordingly, the Administrator delegates to South Dakota his authority under sections 114(a) (1) and (2) and section 114(c) of the Act, i.e., authority to collect, correlate, and release emission data to the public.

§ 52.2180
Stack height regulations.
The State of South Dakota has committed to revise its stack height regulations should EPA complete rulemaking to respond to the decision in
NRDC
v.
Thomas,
838 F.2d 1224 (DC Cir. 1988). In a letter to Douglas M. Skie,
EPA, dated May 11, 1988, Joel C. Smith, Administrator, Office of Air Quality and Solid Waste, stated:
“* * * We are submitting this letter to allow EPA to continue to process our current SIP submittal with the understanding that if EPA's response to the NRDC remand modifies the July 8, 1985 regulations, EPA will notify the State of the rules that must be changed to comport with the EPA's modified requirements. The State of South Dakota agrees to make the appropriate changes.”

§ 52.2183
Variance provision.
The revisions to the variance provisions in Chapter 74:26:01:31.01 of the South Dakota Air Pollution Control Program, which were submitted by the Governor's designee on September 25, 1991, are disapproved because they are inconsistent with section 110(i) of the Clean Air Act, which prohibits any state or EPA from granting a variance from any requirement of an applicable implementation plan with respect to a stationary source.
[58 FR 37426, July 12, 1993]
§ 52.2184
Operating permits for minor sources.
Emission limitations and related provisions established in South Dakota minor source operating permits, which are issued in accordance with ARSD 74:36:04 and which are submitted to EPA in a timely manner in both proposed and final form, shall be enforceable by EPA. EPA reserves the right to deem permit conditions not federally enforceable. Such a determination will be made according to appropriate procedures and will be based upon the permit, permit approval procedures, or permit requirements which do not conform with the operating permit program requirements of EPA's underlying regulations.
[60 FR 46228, Sept. 6, 1995]

§ 52.2222
Approval status.
(a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves Tennessee's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds that the plan satisfies all requirements of part D, title 1, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977.
(b) New source review permits issued pursuant to section 173 of the Clean Air Act will not be deemed valid by EPA unless the provisions of Section V of the emission offset interpretative rule (Appendix S of 40 CFR part 51) are met.
(c) [Reserved]

Compliance schedules.
(a) The information in this section is available in the 40 CFR, part 52 edition revised as of July 1, 1999, the 40 CFR, part 52, Volume 1 of 2 (§§ 52.01 to 52.1018) editions revised as of July 1, 2000 through July 1, 2011, and the 40 CFR, part 52, Volume 3 of 3 (§§ 52.2020 to End) editions revised as of July 1, 2012.
(b)-(f) [Reserved]
[79 FR 30052, May 27, 2014]
§ 52.2224
Legal authority.
(a) The requirements of § 51.230(c) of this chapter are not met since the plan does not provide the legal authority for controlling motor vehicles during air pollution emergency episodes.
(b) The requirements of § 51.230(d) of this chapter are not met since statutory authority to prevent construction, modification, or operation of a facility, building, structure, or installation, or combination thereof, which indirectly results or may result in emissions of any air pollutant at any location which will prevent the maintenance of a national air quality standard is not adequate.
(c)(1) The requirements of § 51.230(b) of this chapter are not met since the definition of
person
set forth in the Tennessee Air Quality Act and in the State implementation plan does not include facilities owned or operated by the State. Therefore, section 53-3409(f) of the Tennessee Code Annotated and section 30 of Chapter II of the Tennessee Air Pollution Control Regulations are disapproved.
(2) Definition of
person.
For the purposes of the plan,
person
shall mean any individual, partnership, copartnership, firm, company, corporation, association, joint stock company, trust, estate, State-owned or operated facility, State agency, political subdivision, or any other legal entity, or their legal representatives, agents, or assigns.
(d) The requirements of § 51.230(b) of this chapter are not met since the State lacks legal authority, as a result of the enactment of House Bill 1490 by the 1974 Tennessee legislature, to control emissions from the quarrying and processing of agricultural limestone.
Therefore, section 53-3424 of the Tennessee Code Annotated is disapproved.
(e) The requirements of § 51.230(b) of this chapter are not met since the State lacks legal authority, as a result of the enactment of House Bill 1845 by the 1974 Tennessee legislature, to control emissions from air contaminant sources which use woodwaste only as fuel. Therefore, the last sentence of section 53-3422 of the Tennessee Code Annotated is disapproved.

These amendments are in response to the Clean Air Act section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement to submit RACT rules correcting deficiencies in the existing SIP in accordance with EPA's pre-amendment guidance. These deficiencies were first noted in a letter from Greer Tidwell, the EPA Region IV Administrator, to Governor McWherter on May 26, 1988, and clarified in a letter dated June 10, 1988, from Winston Smith, EPA Region IV Air Division Director, to Paul Bontrager, Director of the Air Pollution Control Division of the Metropolitan Health Department for Nashville/Davidson County, and were further identified in EPA guidance including the Blue Book and the proposed Post-87 policy. The following deficiency in the Tennessee Regulations, however, has not been corrected.
(1) Section 7-25, “Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements” Nashville/Davidson County committed in a letter dated May 7, 1991, to include a separate provision that requires records to be maintained for at least two years. This additional provision, which is scheduled for a July 15, 1992, public hearing, will be submitted to EPA shortly after that date and will be acted upon separately.
(2) In Section 7-3, Petition for Alternative Controls, the words “as applied” should be added to the term “VOC/gallon solids” as a clarification.
(3) The term “vapor-tight” should be defined in section 7-13.
(4) “Once-in/always-in” is missing from the applicability section of the individual rules.
(5) Section 7-25, “Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements” should be revised to include additional requirements that would contain: units of compliance consistent with the performance requirements; applicable time periods for data entries; and a clear, separate provision that requires records to be kept.

(a)
Part D—Conditional approval.
The Nashville-Davidson County regulation for the review of new sources and modifications in nonattainment areas is approved on condition that the State by October 31, 1984, submit a revision limiting source shutdown credit for offsets to replacement units, and, in the interim, assure implementation of the regulation in conformity with Federal requirements.
(b)
Section 123—Conditional approval.
The plan's provision for implementation of the requirements of section 123 of the Clean Air Act in Nashville-Davidson County is approved on condition that the State by October 31, 1984, submit:
(1) Definitions in the local regulation of
nearby
and
excessive concentration
and
(2) Provision in the local regulation for public notification and opportunity for hearing in cases where stack
heights in excess of normal good engineering practice are proposed on the basis of fluid modeling demonstrations, and, in the interim, assure implementation of the local regulation in conformity with Federal requirements.
(c) The State of Tennessee proposed to delete section 1200-3-18-.03 “Standard for New Sources” from the Tennessee State Implementation Plan (SIP) and the Memphis-Shelby County portion of the Tennessee SIP. EPA is disapproving the deletion of this rule for the Tennessee SIP because Tennessee does not have federally approved New Source Review (NSR) regulations which apply to some of the sources in this chapter. EPA is approving the deletion of this rule for the Memphis submittal because the federally approved TN NSR applies to the Memphis-Shelby County area.
(d) The State of Tennessee proposed to delete rule 1200-3-18-.03 “Standard for New Sources” from the Tennessee State Implementation Plan (SIP). In paragraph (e) of this section, EPA disapproved the deletion of this rule because Tennessee did not have federally approved New Source Review (NSR) regulations that applied to some of the sources in this chapter. EPA is hereby approving the deletion of section 1200-3-18-.03 of the Tennessee SIP, and is deleting EPA's earlier disapproval in paragraph (e) of this section.

§ 52.2233
Significant deterioration of air quality.
(a)(1) Paragraph 1200-3-9-.01(4)-(0)-2. of Tennessee's regulations is disapproved because it does not require that the consent of the Governor(s) of affected states be obtained when innovative technology waivers are granted. EPA retains permitting authority for sources requesting innovative technology waivers which would significantly impact air quality in adjacent states.
(2) Tennessee's definition of
stationary source
specifically excludes
the activities of any Vessel.
This exclusion is not currently approvable and EPA is deferring action on it pending final rulemaking on the issue. EPA retains authority for permits which involve vessel emissions where a source is not willing to include all vessel emissions in the definition of source.
(b) The requirements of § 52.21 except paragraph (a)(1) are hereby incorporated and made part of the applicable SIP for the State of Tennessee for the following purposes:
(1) Permitting of sources requesting innovative technology waivers which would significantly impact air quality in adjacent states.
(2) Permitting of sources involving vessel emissions where the source is unwilling to include all vessel emissions in the definition of source.

Control strategy: Ozone.
(a) Determination—EPA is determining that, as of August 8, 1995, the Nashville ozone nonattainment area has attained the ozone standard and that the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act do not apply to the area for so long as the area does not monitor any violations of the ozone standard. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Nashville ozone nonattainment area, these determinations shall no longer apply.
(b) Nonregulatory provisions for the implementation of a basic I/M program in Rutherford, Sumner, Williamson, and Wilson Counties, submitted on July 13, 1994, were approved by EPA on September 26, 1995.
(c) Determination of Attaining Data. EPA has determined, as of October 12, 2010 the Knoxville, Tennessee nonattainment area has attaining data for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standards for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS.
(d)
Determination of attainment.
The EPA has determined, as of June 3, 2016, that based on 2011 to 2013 ambient air quality data, the Knoxville, TN and Memphis, TN-MS-AR 2008 ozone Marginal nonattainment areas have attained the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Therefore, the EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on an area's air quality data as of the attainment date, whether the areas attained the standard. The EPA also determined that the Knoxville, TN and Memphis, TN-MS-AR nonattainment areas will not be reclassified for failure to attain by their applicable attainment date under section 181(b)(2)(A).

§ 52.2236
Control strategy; lead.
(a) The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation has submitted revisions to the Tennessee SIP on October 6, 1994. These revisions address the requirements necessary to change a lead nonattainment area to attainment. The maintenance plan for the Fayette County area near Rossville, Tennessee is comprised of a maintenance demonstration and NSR/PSD program. For areas where the only lead source has shut down, these components are sufficient for an approvable maintenance plan. The State's maintenance plan is complete and satisfies all of the requirements of section 175(A) of the CAA.
(b)
Determination of attaining data.
EPA has determined the Bristol, Tennessee, nonattainment area has attaining data for the 2008 lead (Pb) NAAQS.
This clean data determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 2008 Pb NAAQS.

(d)
Determinations that Certain Areas Did Not Attain the 1-Hour Ozone NAAQS.
EPA has determined that the Houston/Galveston/Brazoria severe-17 1-hour ozone nonattainment area did not attain the 1-hour ozone NAAQS by the
applicable attainment date of November 15, 2007. This determination bears on the area's obligations with respect to implementation of two specific 1-hour ozone standard anti-backsliding requirements: section 172(c)(9) contingency measures for failure to attain and sections 182(d)(3) and 185 major stationary source fee programs.
(e) Approval—The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) submitted a revision to the Texas SIP on February 18, 2003, concerning the Victoria County 1-hour ozone maintenance plan. This SIP revision was adopted by TCEQ on February 5, 2003. This SIP revision satisfies the Clean Air Act requirement, as amended in 1990, for the second 10-year update to the Victoria County 1-hour ozone maintenance area.
(f)
Determination of attainment.
Effective November 17, 2008 EPA has determined that the Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) 1-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1-hour ozone standard. Under the provisions of EPA's Clean Data Policy, this determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration or 5% increment of progress plan, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other State Implementation Plans related to attainment of the 1-hour ozone NAAQS for so long as the area continues to attain the 1-hour ozone NAAQS.

(103) Revisions to the Texas SIP addressing VOC RACT Negative Declarations. A revision to the Texas SIP was submitted on January 10, 1996, which included negative declarations for various categories. Section 172(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 requires nonattainment areas to adopt, at a minimum, the reasonably available control technology (RACT) to reduce emissions from existing sources. Pursuant to section 182(b)(2) of the Act, for moderate and above ozone nonattainment areas, the EPA has identified 13 categories for such sources and developed the Control Technique Guidelines (CTGs) or Alternate Control Techniques (ACTs) documents to implement RACT at those sources. When no major volatile organic compound (VOC) sources for a source category exist in a nonattainment area, a State may submit a negative declaration for that category. Texas submitted negative declarations for the areas and source categories listed in this paragraph (c)(103). For the Beaumont/Port Arthur region, negative declarations were submitted for the following eight categories: clean-up solvents, aerospace coatings, shipbuilding and repair, wood furniture, plastic part coatings-business machines, plastic part coatings-others, autobody refinishing, and offset lithography. For Dallas/Fort Worth, negative declarations were submitted for six categories: industrial wastewater, clean-up solvents, shipbuilding and repair, autobody refinishing, plastic part coatings-business machines, and offset lithography. For the Houston/Galveston area, negative declarations were submitted for seven categories: clean-up solvents, aerospace coatings, wood furniture, plastic part coatings-business machines, plastic part coatings-others, autobody refinishing, and offset lithography. For El Paso, negative declarations were submitted for nine categories: industrial wastewater, clean-up solvents, aerospace coatings, shipbuilding and repair, wood furniture, plastic part coatings-business machines, plastic part coatings-others, autobody refinishing, and offset lithography. This submittal satisfies section 182(b)(2) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 for these particular CTG/ACT source categories for the Texas ozone nonattainment areas stated in this paragraph (c)(103).
(i) Incorporation by reference. The letter dated January 10, 1996, from the Governor of Texas to the Regional Administrator, submitting the Post-1996 Rate of Progress Plan as a revision to the SIP, which included VOC RACT negative declarations.

(i) For each unit, SO
2
emissions for each calendar day shall be determined by summing the hourly emissions measured in pounds of SO
2
. For each unit, heat input for each boiler-operating-day shall be determined by adding together all hourly heat inputs, in millions of BTU. Each boiler-operating-day of the thirty-day rolling average for a unit shall be determined by adding together the pounds of SO
2
from that day and the preceding 29-boiler-operating-days and dividing the total pounds of SO
2
by the sum of the heat input during the same 30-boiler-operating-day period. The result shall be the 30-boiler-operating-day rolling average in terms of lb/MMBtu emissions of SO
2
. If a valid SO
2
pounds per hour or heat input is not available for any hour for a unit, that heat input and SO
2
pounds per hour shall not be used in the calculation of the 30-boiler-operating-day rolling average for SO
2
.
(ii) In lieu of paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, and if San Miguel meets paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, it may install a CEMS at the inlet of the scrubber system. The 30 BOD SO
2
average from the existing outlet CEMS must read at or below 6.0% (94% control) of a 30 BOD SO
2
average from the inlet CEMS.
(5)
Testing and monitoring.
(i) No later than the compliance date as set out in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall install, calibrate, maintain and operate Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS) for SO
2
on the units listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section in accordance with 40 CFR 60.8 and 60.13(e), (f), and (h), and appendix B of part 60 of this chapter. No later than the compliance date as set out in paragraph (a)(2), San Miguel must submit a letter to the Regional Administrator that informs the EPA which compliance option it elects, as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. San Miguel must then adhere to the compliance method set forth in that letter to the Regional Administrator. All owners or operators shall comply with the quality assurance procedures for CEMS found in 40 CFR part 75. Compliance with the emission limits for SO
2
shall be determined by using data from a CEMS.
(ii) Continuous emissions monitoring shall apply during all periods of operation of the coal burning equipment, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, except for CEMS breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments. Continuous monitoring systems for measuring SO
2
and diluent gas shall complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute period. Hourly averages shall be computed using at least one data point in each fifteen minute quadrant of an hour. Notwithstanding this requirement, an hourly average may be computed from at least two data points separated by a minimum of 15 minutes (where the unit operates for more than one quadrant in an hour) if data are unavailable as a result of performance of calibration, quality assurance, preventive maintenance activities, or backups of data from data acquisition and handling system, and recertification events. When valid SO
2
pounds per hour, or SO
2
pounds per million Btu
emission data are not obtained because of continuous monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, or zero and span adjustments, emission data must be obtained by using other monitoring systems approved by the EPA to provide emission data for a minimum of 18 hours in each 24 hour period and at least 22 out of 30 successive boiler-operating-days.
(6)
Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
Unless otherwise stated all requests, reports, submittals, notifications, and other communications to the Regional Administrator required by this section shall be submitted, unless instructed otherwise, to the Director, Air and Radiation Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 6, to the attention of Mail Code: AR, at 1201 Elm Street, Suite 500, Dallas, Texas 75270-2102. For each unit subject to the emissions limitation in this section and upon completion of the installation of CEMS as required in this section, the owner or operator shall comply with the following requirements:
(i) For each emissions limit in this section, comply with the notification, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements for CEMS compliance monitoring in 40 CFR 60.7(c) and (d).
(ii) For each day, provide the total SO
2
emitted that day by each emission unit. For any hours on any unit where data for hourly pounds or heat input is missing, identify the unit number and monitoring device that did not produce valid data that caused the missing hour.
(7)
Equipment operations.
At all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, the owner or operator shall, to the extent practicable, maintain and operate the unit including associated air pollution control equipment in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Regional Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operating and maintenance procedures, and inspection of the unit.
(8)
Enforcement.
(i) Notwithstanding any other provision in this implementation plan, any credible evidence or information relevant as to whether the unit would have been in compliance with applicable requirements if the appropriate performance or compliance test had been performed, can be used to establish whether or not the owner or operator has violated or is in violation of any standard or applicable emission limit in the plan.
(ii) Emissions in excess of the level of the applicable emission limit or requirement that occur due to a malfunction shall constitute a violation of the applicable emission limit.

Group II SIPs. The Texas Air Control Board adopted these revisions on May 13, 1988. The State of Texas has committed to comply with the PM
10
Group II SIP requirements, as articulated in the
Federal Register
notice of July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24670), for the defined areas of Dallas, Harris, Lubbock, and Nueces counties as provided in the Texas PM
10
Group II SIPs. In addition to the SIP, a letter
from the Governor of Texas, dated July 18, 1988, stated that:
* * * In the July 1, 1987 issue of the
Federal Register,
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced the requirement that each state submit a committal SIP for PM
10
Group II areas instead of full control strategies. States were also required to submit demonstrations of attainment and maintenance of the PM
10
National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The TACB is committed to carrying out the activities contained in the enclosed proposed SIP to satisfy those requirements * * *.

§ 52.2307
Small business assistance program.
The Governor of Texas submitted on November 13, 1992 a plan revision to develop and implement a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program to meet the requirements of section 507 of the Clean Air Act by November 15, 1994. The plan commits to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses, hire an Ombudsman to serve as an independent advocate for small businesses, and establish a Compliance Advisory Panel to advise the program and report to the EPA on the program's effectiveness.
[59 FR 42765, Aug. 19, 1994]
§ 52.2308
Area-wide nitrogen oxides (NO
X
) exemptions.
(a) The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) submitted to the EPA on June 17, 1994, a petition requesting that the Dallas ozone nonattainment area be exempted from the NO
X
control requirements of section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as amended in 1990. The Dallas nonattainment area consists of Dallas, Tarrant, Denton, and Collin counties. The exemption request was based on a photochemical grid modeling which shows that the Dallas nonattainment area would attain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone by the CAA mandated deadline without the implementation of the additional NO
X
controls required under section 182(f). On November 21, 1994, the EPA conditionally approved this exemption request, conditioned upon the EPA approving the modeling portion of the Dallas attainment demonstration SIP.
(b) The TNRCC submitted to the EPA on June 17, 1994, a petition requesting that the El Paso ozone nonattainment area be exempted from the NO
X
control requirements of section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as amended in 1990. The El Paso nonattainment area consists of El Paso county, and shares a common airshed with Juarez, Mexico. The exemption request was based on a photochemical grid modeling which shows that the El Paso nonattainment area would attain the NAAQS for ozone by the CAA mandated deadline without the implementation of the additional NO
X
controls required under section 182(f), but for emissions emanating from Mexico. On November 21, 1994, the EPA conditionally approved this exemption request, conditioned upon the EPA approving the modeling portion of the El Paso attainment demonstration SIP.
(c) The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission submitted to the EPA on May 4, 1994, a petition requesting that the Victoria County incomplete data ozone nonattainment area be exempted from the requirement to meet the NO
X
provisions of the Federal transportation conformity rule. The exemption request was based on monitoring data which demonstrated that the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone had been attained in this area for the 35 months prior to the petition, with the understanding that approval of the State's request would be contingent upon the collection of one additional month of data. The required additional month of verified data was submitted later and, together with the data submitted with the State's petition, demonstrated attainment of the NAAQS for 36 consecutive months. The EPA approved this exemption request on March 2, 1995.
(d) The TNRCC submitted to the EPA on August 17, 1994, with supplemental information submitted on August 31, 1994, and September 9, 1994, a petition requesting that the Houston and Beaumont ozone nonattainment areas be temporarily exempted from the NO
X
control requirements of section 182(f)
of the CAA. The Houston nonattainment area consists of Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller counties. The Beaumont nonattainment area consists of Hardin, Jefferson, and Orange counties. The exemption request was based on photochemical grid modeling which shows that reductions in NO
X
would not contribute to attaining the ozone NAAQS. On April 12, 1995, the EPA approved the State's request for a temporary exemption. Approval of the temporary exemption waives the federal requirements for NO
X
Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT), New Source Review (NSR), conformity, and vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) for the period of the temporary exemption. The temporary exemption automatically expires on December 31, 1996, without further notice from the EPA. Based on the rationale provided in the notice of proposed rulemaking on this action, upon the expiration of the temporary exemption, the requirements pertaining to NO
X
RACT, NSR, conformity, and I/M will again become applicable, except that the NO
X
RACT implementation date applicable to the Houston and Beaumont nonattainment areas under section 182(f) shall be as expeditious as practicable but no later than May 31, 1997, unless the State has received a permanent NO
X
exemption from the EPA prior to that time.
(e) The TNRCC submitted to EPA on March 6, 1996, a petition requesting that the Houston/Galveston and Beaumont/Port Arthur ozone nonattainment areas be granted an extension to a previously-granted temporary exemption from the NO
X
control requirements of sections 182(f) and 182(b) of the Clean Air Act. The temporary exemption was granted on April 19, 1995. The current petition is based on the need for more time to complete UAM to confirm the need for, and the extent of, NO
X
controls required. On May 23, 1997, EPA approved the State's request for an extension to the temporary exemption. The temporary extension automatically expires on December 31, 1997, without further notice from EPA. Upon expiration of the extension, the requirements pertaining to NO
X
RACT, NSR, I/M, general and transportation conformity will become applicable, except that the NO
X
RACT compliance date shall be implemented as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than May 31, 1999, unless the State has received a contingent NO
X
exemption from the EPA prior to that time.
(f) The extension of the temporary exemption from NO
X
control requirements of sections 182(f) and 182(b) of the Clean Air Act for the Houston/Galveston and Beaumont/Port Arthur ozone nonattainment areas granted on May 23, 1997, expired December 31, 1997. Upon expiration of the extension, the requirements pertaining to NO
X
RACT, NSR, I/M, general and transportation conformity will become applicable and the State is expected to implement the requirements as expeditiously as possible.
(g) The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission submitted a letter to EPA requesting rescission of the previously-granted conditional exemption from the NO
X
control requirements of section 182(f) of the Act for the Dallas/Fort Worth ozone nonattainment area. The letter was sent on November 13, 1998. The conditional exemption was granted on November 21, 1994, conditioned upon EPA approving the modeling portion of the DFW attainment demonstration SIP. The conditional exemption was also approved on a contingent basis. The modeling-based exemption would last only as long as the area's modeling continued to demonstrate attainment without the additional NO
X
reductions required by section 182(f). The State's request is based on new photochemical modeling which shows the need for NO
X
controls to help the area attain the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Furthermore, EPA would not and could not approve the earlier attainment demonstration SIP modeling upon which the condition was based.
(1) On June 21, 1999, the conditional NO
X
exemption for the DFW area granted on November 21, 1994 is rescinded. Upon rescission, the Federal requirements pertaining to NO
X
Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT), New Source Review, vehicle Inspection/Maintenance, general and transportation conformity now apply.
(2) The NO
X
RACT final compliance date must be implemented as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than March 31, 2001.
[59 FR 60714, Nov. 28, 1994, as amended at 60 FR 5867, Jan. 31, 1995; 60 FR 19522, Apr. 19, 1995; 62 FR 28349, May 23, 1997; 63 FR 7072, Feb. 12, 1998; 64 FR 19286, Apr. 20, 1999]
§ 52.2309
Emissions inventories.
(a) The Governor of the State of Texas submitted the 1990 base year emission inventories for the Houston/Galveston (HGA), Beaumont/Port Arthur (BPA), El Paso (ELP), and Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) ozone nonattainment areas on November 17, 1992 as a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP). The 1990 base year emission inventory requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been satisfied for each of these areas.
(b) The inventories are for the ozone precursors which are volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide. The inventories cover point, area, non-road mobile, on-road mobile, and biogenic sources.
(c) The HGA nonattainment area is classified as Severe-17 and includes Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller Counties; the BPA nonattainment area is classified as Serious and includes Hardin, Jefferson, and Orange Counties; the ELP nonattainment area is classified as Serious and includes El Paso County; and the DFW nonattainment area is classified as Moderate and includes Collin, Dallas, Denton, and Tarrant Counties.
(d) The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission submitted State Implementation Plan revisions to the 1990 base year emission inventory for the Beaumont/Port Arthur area with a cover letter from the Governor of Texas dated August 9, 1996.
(e) The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission submitted a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) on August 9, 1996. This revision was submitted for the purpose of satisfying the 15% Rate-of-Progress requirements of the Clean Air Act, which will aid in ensuring the attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone. This submittal also contained revisions to the 1990 base year emissions inventories for the Dallas/Fort Worth, El Paso and Houston/Galveston areas.
(f) The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission submitted a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) on May 19, 2000. This revision was submitted for the purpose of satisfying the 9 percent Rate-of-Progress requirements of the Clean Air Act, which will aid in ensuring the attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone. This submission also contained revisions to the 1990 base year emissions inventory for the Houston/Galveston areas.
[59 FR 55589, Nov. 8, 1994, as amended at 63 FR 6663, Feb. 10, 1998; 63 FR 62947, Nov. 10, 1998; 66 FR 20751, Apr. 25, 2001]
§ 52.2311
Motor vehicle antitampering.
The State of Texas submitted revisions to the State Implementation Plan for 30 TAC Chapter 114, sections 114.1 “Maintenance and Operation of Air Pollution Control Systems or Devices Used to Control Emissions from Motor Vehicles” and 114.5 “Exclusions and Exceptions” on February 24, 1989, and September 6, 1990, and July 13, 1993. The EPA disapproved these revisions that relate to Statewide antitampering provisions and exemptions to antitampering provisions for motor vehicles or motor vehicle engine emission control systems because the State's antitampering rules are not consistent with the Act, section 203(a)(3) and EPA's tampering prohibitions as outlined in EPA's antitampering enforcement policy, Mobile Source Enforcement Memorandum No. 1A.
[63 FR 6653, Feb. 10, 1998]
§ 52.2312
Requirements for the control of SO
2
emissions to address in full or in part requirements related to BART, reasonable progress, and interstate visibility transport.
(a) The Texas SO
2
Trading Program provisions set forth in subpart FFFFF of part 97 of this chapter constitute the Federal Implementation Plan provisions fully addressing Texas' obligations with respect to best available retrofit technology under section 169A of the Act and the deficiencies associated with EPA's disapprovals in § 52.2304(d)
and partially addressing Texas' obligations with respect to reasonable progress under section 169A of the Act, as those obligations relate to emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO
2
) from electric generating units (EGUs).
(b) The provisions of subpart FFFFF of part 97 of this chapter apply to sources in Texas but not sources in Indian country located within the borders of Texas, with regard to emissions in 2019 and each subsequent year.

§ 52.2323
Approval status.
(a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves Utah's plan as meeting the requirements of section 110 of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977. Furthermore, the Administrator finds that the plan satisfies all requirements of Part D, Title 1, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, except as noted below.
(b)(1) Insofar as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions found in this subpart apply to stationary sources of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, the Administrator approves that application only to the extent that GHGs are “subject to regulation”, as provided in this paragraph (b), and the Administrator takes no action on that application to the extent that GHGs are not “subject to regulation.”
(2) Beginning January 2, 2011, the pollutant GHGs is subject to regulation if:
(i) The stationary source is a new major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will emit or will have the potential to emit 75,000 tpy CO
2
e or more; or
(ii) The stationary source is an existing major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will have an emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant, and an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO
2
e or more; and,
(3) Beginning July 1, 2011, in addition to the provisions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the pollutant GHGs shall also be subject to regulation:
(i) At a new stationary source that will emit or have the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO
2
e; or
(ii) At an existing stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO
2
e, when such stationary source undertakes a physical change or change in the method of operation that will result in an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO
2
e or more.
(4) For purposes of this paragraph (b)—
(i) The term greenhouse gas shall mean the air pollutant defined in 40 CFR 86.1818-12(a) as the aggregate group of six greenhouse gases: Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
(ii) The term tpy CO
2
equivalent emissions (CO
2
e) shall represent an amount of GHGs emitted, and shall be computed as follows:
(A) Multiplying the mass amount of emissions (tpy), for each of the six greenhouse gases in the pollutant GHGs, by the gas's associated global warming potential published at Table A-1 to subpart A of 40 CFR part 98—Global Warming Potentials.
(B) Sum the resultant value from paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for each gas to compute a tpy CO
2
e.
(iii) the term emissions increase shall mean that both a significant emissions increase (as calculated using
the procedures in 40 CFR 52.21(a)(2)(iv)) and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in paragraphs 40 CFR 52.21(b)(3) and (b)(23)(i)) occur. For the pollutant GHGs, an emissions increase shall be based on tpy CO
2
e, and shall be calculated assuming the pollutant GHGs is a regulated NSR pollutant, and “significant” is defined as 75,000 tpy CO
2
e instead of applying the value in 40 CFR 52.21(b)(23)(ii).
