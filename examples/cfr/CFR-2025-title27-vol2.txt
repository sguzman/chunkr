# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

# INQUIRIES

* For large cigars: Until March 31, 2009, the percentage tax rate applies when the sale price is $235.294 per thousand or less, and the flat tax rate applies when the sale price is more than $235.294 per thousand. On and after April 1, 2009, the percentage tax rate applies when the sale price is $763.222 or less per thousand cigars, and the flat tax rate applies when the sale price is more than $763.222 per thousand cigars.
(b) See § 40.22 of this part for rules concerning determination of sale price of large cigars.
(c) Cigars not exempt from tax under 26 U.S.C. chapter 52 and the provisions of this part which are removed but not intended for sale shall be taxed at the same rate as similar cigars removed for sale.
[T.D. ATF-420, 64 FR 71939, Dec. 22, 1999, as amended by T.D. TTB-75, 74 FR 14481, Mar. 31, 2009]
§ 40.22
Determination of sale price of large cigars.
(a)
General rule.
The tax imposed on large cigars is computed based on the sale price (the price for which the large cigars are sold by the manufacturer). In addition to money, goods or services exchanged for cigars may be considered as part of the sale price.
(b)
Special cases
—(1)
In general.
If there is any question concerning the applicable sale price for tax purposes, the appropriate TTB officer will determine such price, applying rules similar to the constructive sale price rules in 26 U.S.C. 4216(b) and the implementing regulations in 26 CFR 48.4216(b)-1 through 48.4216(b)-4. These constructive sale price rules apply to cigars sold by a manufacturer at retail, sold on consignment, or sold (otherwise than through an arm's length transaction) at less than the fair market price. Sales of cigars between affiliated corporations may be analyzed under the constructive sale price rules. The appropriate TTB officer may make this analysis on his or her own initiative or upon the written request of a manufacturer.
(2)
Adjustments in sale price
—(i)
Reasons for adjustment.
Adjustments to the sale price may occur as a result of a discount or price increase by the manufacturer or as a result of a TTB determination pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) above. In either case, the manufacturer must make conforming changes to the tax that was computed on the sale price before the adjustment.
(ii)
Time of adjustment.
If an adjustment is made before the end of the same tax return period as the original determination of the tax, the adjustment may be made on the same return. If the price is increased or decreased retroactively (during a later return period), either by the manufacturer or by TTB's determination, the manufacturer must make an adjustment on the tax return for the current return period in which the price change was determined.
(iii)
Amount of adjustment.
The taxpayer must compute the adjustment to the tax as the difference between the tax that was paid and the tax that should have been paid, based on the newly determined sale price, together with interest thereon and any applicable penalties. The interest must be computed from the time of payment of the original tax until the time the adjustment was made. Upon request, the appropriate TTB officer will provide information regarding interest rates applicable to specific time periods and any applicable penalties.
(3)
Pricing for different packaging.
If different bona fide sale prices are applicable to different types of packaging (
e. g.,
boxes of 25 and boxes of 50), then the cigars in each type of packaging are taxed on the basis of their respective sale prices.
(4)
Pricing of seconds.
If some of an otherwise identical cigar brand and size:
(i) Are distinctive from other such cigars because of physical imperfections, (ii) Are offered to the consumer through clear labeling as “imperfects”,
“seconds”, “throw-outs”, or a comparable commonly understood term, and
(iii) The manufacturer has a separate sale price for such cigars, then they are taxed on the basis of this separate sale price.
(5)
Combination packages.
If a manufacturer has a sale price for a combination package containing cigars of different sizes, the cigars are taxed based on that combination sale price. If there is no sale price for the combination, then the cigars are taxed based on their individual sale prices.
(6)
Removals for another person.
If a manufacturer makes taxable removals of a brand and size of cigar only for distribution by others who establish the sale price, the tax is based on such sale price even though the manufacturer who makes the removals does not establish the price.

(b)
Classification.
(1) Pipe tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco, before removal subject to tax, must be put up in packages that conform to the requirements of §§ 40.211 and 40.212, and of § 40.216a or § 40.216b as appropriate.
(2) Any tobacco that has been processed and that is removed in a package, as that term is defined in § 40.11, that does not bear the notice for smokeless tobacco prescribed in § 40.216 or the notice for pipe tobacco prescribed in § 40.216a is deemed to be roll-your-own tobacco and subject to tax at the rate applicable to roll-your-own tobacco. A container of processed tobacco, the contents of which weigh 10 pounds or less (including any added non-tobacco ingredients or constituents), that is removed within the meaning of this part for any purpose other than destruction, export, delivery as a sample to a manufacturer of processed tobacco or tobacco products for the purpose of soliciting orders of processed tobacco, or scientific testing or testing of equipment which results in the destruction of the processed tobacco or the return of the processed tobacco to the factory premises, is deemed to be a package offered for sale or delivery to the ultimate consumer.
(3) Subject to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, any tobacco that has been
processed and that is removed in a package, as that term is defined in § 40.11, is deemed to be roll-your-own tobacco and subject to tax at the rate applicable to roll-your-own tobacco, even though the package bears the notice required for pipe tobacco under § 40.216a, if:
(i) The package does not bear the declaration “pipe tobacco” in direct conjunction with, parallel to, and in substantially the same conspicuousness of type and background as the brand name each time the brand name appears on the package; or
(ii) The package or accompanying materials bear any representation that would suggest a use other than as pipe tobacco. (26 U.S.C. 5702 and 5723) The term 'accompanying materials' includes, but is not limited to, any point of sale advertising or other printed product communications issued by the manufacturer or importer of pipe tobacco products. In addition, the inclusion of cigarette papers or tubes in a package bearing a 'pipe tobacco' declaration will suggest a use other than pipe tobacco.
(4) During the period from June 22, 2009, through March 23, 2010, manufacturers may continue to remove products as pipe tobacco in packages that do not bear the declaration “pipe tobacco” in the manner prescribed in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.

§ 40.26
Persons liable for tax.
The manufacturer of tobacco products shall be liable for the taxes imposed on tobacco products by 26 U.S.C. 5701:
Provided,
That when tobacco products are transferred in bond pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 5704, to the bonded premises of another such manufacturer or an export warehouse proprietor, the transferee shall become liable for the tax upon receipt by him of such products and the transferor shall thereupon be relieved of his liability for the tax. When tobacco products are released in bond from customs custody for transfer to the bonded premises of a manufacturer of tobacco products, the transferee shall become liable for the tax on such products upon release from customs custody. Any person who possesses tobacco products in violation of 26 U.S.C. 5751(a)(1) or (2), shall be liable for a tax equal to the tax on such products.
(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat 1415, as amended, 1424, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5703, 5751))

§ 40.27
Assessment.
Whenever any person required by law to pay tax on tobacco products fails to pay such tax, the tax shall be ascertained and assessed against such person, subject to the limitations prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 6501. The tax so assessed shall be in addition to the penalties imposed by law for failure to pay such tax when required. Except in cases where delay may jeopardize collection of the tax, or where the amount is nominal or the result of an evident mathematical error, no such assessment shall be made until and after notice has been afforded such person to show cause against assessment. The person will be allowed 45 days from the date of such notice to show cause, in writing, against such assessment.

# Source:
T.D. ATF-271, 53 FR 17560, May 17, 1988, unless otherwise noted.
§ 40.31
Liability for special tax.
(a)
Manufacturer of tobacco products.
Every manufacturer of tobacco products shall pay a special (occupational) tax at a rate specified by § 40.32. The tax shall be paid on or before the date of commencing the business of manufacturing tobacco products, and thereafter every year on or before July 1. On
commencing business, the tax shall be computed from the first day of the month in which liability is incurred, through the following June 30. Thereafter, the tax shall be computed for the entire year (July 1 through June 30).
(b) [Reserved]
(c)
Each place of business taxable.
A manufacturer of tobacco products incurs special tax liability at each place of business in which an occupation subject to special tax is conducted. A place of business means the entire office, plant or area of the business in any one location under the same proprietorship. Passageways, streets, highways, rail crossings, waterways, or partitions dividing the premises are not sufficient separation to require additional special tax, if the divisions of the premises are otherwise contiguous.
(d)
Payment of tax.
Special tax must be paid by return. The prescribed return is TTB Form 5630.5t, Special Tax Registration and Return—Tobacco. Special tax returns, with payment of tax, must be filed with TTB in accordance with the instructions on the form and the requirements of subpart D of part 46 of this chapter.

§ 40.32
Rates of special tax.
(a)
General.
Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(a)(1) imposes a special tax of $1,000 per year on every manufacturer of tobacco products.
(b)
Reduced rate for small proprietors.
Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(b) provides for a reduced rate of $500 per year with respect to any manufacturer of tobacco products whose gross receipts (for the most recent taxable year ending before the first day of the taxable period to which the special tax imposed by § 40.31 relates) are less than $500,000. The “taxable year” to be used for determining gross receipts is the taxpayer's income tax year. All gross receipts of the taxpayer shall be included, not just the gross receipts of the business subject to special tax. Proprietors of new businesses that have not yet begun a taxable year, as well as proprietors of existing businesses that have not yet ended a taxable year, who commence a new activity subject to special tax, qualify for the reduced special (occupational) tax rate, unless the business is a member of a “controlled group”; in that case, the rules of paragraph (c) of this section shall apply.
(c)
Controlled group.
All persons treated as one taxpayer under 26 U.S.C. 5061(e)(3) shall be treated as one taxpayer for the purpose of determining gross receipts under paragraph (b) of this section. “Controlled group” means a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563 and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except that the words “at least 80 percent” shall be replaced by the words “more than 50 percent” in each place they appear in subsection (a) of 26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the rules for a “controlled group of corporations” apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of this section.
(d)
Short taxable year.
Gross receipts for any taxable year of less than 12 months shall be annualized by multiplying the gross receipts for the short period by 12 and dividing the result by the number of months in the short period as required by 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).
(e)
Returns and allowances.
Gross receipts for any taxable year shall be reduced by returns and allowances made during such year under 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).

§ 40.44
Disposal of forfeited, condemned, and abandoned tobacco products.
A Federal, State, or local officer shall not sell or cause to be sold for consumption in the United States any forfeited, condemned, or abandoned tobacco products in his custody upon which the Federal tax has not been paid, if in his opinion the sale thereof will not bring a price equal to the tax due and payable thereon and the expenses incident to the sale thereof. Where the products are not sold the officer may deliver them to a Federal or State hospital or institution (if they are fit for consumption) or cause their destruction by burning completely or by rendering them unfit for consumption. Where such products are sold they shall be released by the officer having custody thereof only after they are properly packaged and taxpaid. A receipt from the appropriate TTB officer evidencing payment of tax on such products shall be presented to the officer having custody of the products, which tax shall be considered part of the sales price. Where tobacco products which have been packaged under the provisions of part 44 or part 45 of this
chapter are to be released after payment of tax, the purchaser shall appropriately mark each package “Federal Tax Paid (date)” before the officer having custody of the products releases them:
Provided,
That if the purchaser is a qualified manufacturer of tobacco products, or for products packaged under part 44 a qualified export warehouse proprietor, the products may be released without such marking of the packages if the manufacturer or proprietor does not intend to place such products on the domestic market for taxable products but will dispose of them otherwise, such as by destruction or return to bond through claim for refund, and files a written statement to that effect, in original only, with the officer having custody of the products. In the case of products forfeited under the internal revenue laws the sale shall be subject to the provisions of part 72 of this chapter.

(a) Good cause has been shown for the use of the alternate method or procedure,
(b) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed method or procedure, and affords equivalent security to the revenue, and
(c) The alternate method or procedure will not be contrary to any provision of law, and will not result in an increase in cost to the Government or hinder the effective administration of this part.
No alternate method or procedure relating to the giving of any bond or to the assessment, payment, or collection of tax, shall be authorized under this section. Where a manufacturer desires to employ an alternate method or procedure, he shall submit a written application to do so, in triplicate, to the appropriate TTB officer. The application shall specifically describe the proposed alternate method or procedure, and shall set forth the reasons therefor. Alternate methods or procedures shall not be employed until the application has been approved by the appropriate TTB officer.

with the prescribed requirements of regulations from which the variations were authorized. Authority for any variations may be withdrawn whenever in the judgment of the appropriate TTB officer the revenue is jeopardized or the effective administration of this part is hindered by the continuation of such variation. Where a manufacturer desires to employ such variation, he shall submit a written application to do so, in triplicate, to the appropriate TTB officer.

(1) The premises on which it is proposed to conduct the business are not adequate to protect the revenue;
(2) The activity proposed to be carried out at such premises does not meet the minimum manufacturing or activity requirements of § 40.61(b); or

§ 40.165a
Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.
(a)
General.
(1) Each taxpayer who was liable, during a calendar year, for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 41 of this chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic fund transfer (EFT) of taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of taxes on tobacco products by cash, check, or money order, as described in § 40.168, is not authorized for a taxpayer who is
required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. For purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is defined as the gross tax liability on all taxable withdrawals and importations (including tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes brought into the United States from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, without regard to any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises from which such activities are conducted by the taxpayer. Overpayments are not taken into account in summarizing the gross tax liability.
(2) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except that the words “at least 80 percent” shall be replaced by the words “more than 50 percent” in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the rules for a “controlled group of corporations” apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make remittances by EFT.
(3) A taxpayer who is required by this section to make remittances by EFT, shall make a separate EFT remittance and file a separate return, Form 5000.24, for each factory from which tobacco products are withdrawn upon determination of tax.
(b)
Requirements.
(1) On or before January 10 of each calendar year, except for a taxpayer already remitting the tax by EFT, each taxpayer who was liable for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 41 of this chapter, during the previous calendar year, shall notify, in writing, the appropriate TTB officer. The notice shall be an agreement to make remittances by EFT.
(2) For each return filed in accordance with this part, the taxpayer shall direct the taxpayer's bank to make an electronic fund transfer in the amount of the tax payment to the Treasury Account as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. The request shall be made to the bank early enough for the transfer to be made to the Treasury Account by no later than the close of business on the last day for filing the return, prescribed in § 40.165 or § 40.167. The request shall take into account any time limit established by the bank.
(3) If a taxpayer was liable for less than five million dollars in taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 41 of this chapter during the preceding calendar year, the taxpayer may choose either to continue remitting the tax as provided in this section or to remit the tax with the return on as prescribed by § 40.168. Upon filing the first return which the taxpayer chooses to discontinue remitting the tax by EFT and to begin remitting the tax with the tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the appropriate TTB officer by attaching a written notification to Form 5000.24, stating that no taxes are due by EFT, because the tax liability during the preceding calendar year was less than five million dollars, and that the remittance shall be filed with the tax return.
(c)
Remittance.
(1) Each taxpayer shall show on the return, Form 5000.24, information about remitting the tax for that return period by EFT and shall file the return with the TTB, in accordance with the instructions on Form 5000.24.
(2) Remittances shall be considered as made when the taxpayment by electronic fund transfer is received by the Treasury Account. For purposes of this section, a taxpayment by electronic fund transfer shall be considered as received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a Federal Reserve Bank.
(3) When the taxpayer directs the bank to effect an electronic fund transfer message as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any transfer data record furnished to the taxpayer, through normal banking procedures, will serve as the record of payment,
and shall be retained as part of required records.
(d)
Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT.
The taxpayer is subject to a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5761, 6651, or 6656, as applicable, for failure to make a tax payment by EFT on or before the close of business on the prescribed last day for filing.
(e)
Procedure.
Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will issue to the taxpayer a TTB procedure entitled, Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund Transfer. This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer is to follow when preparing returns and EFT remittances in accordance with this part. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will provide the taxpayer with instructions for preparing EFT remittances for payments to be made to the CBP.

(1) The date of removal,
(2) The name and address of the person to whom shipped or delivered,

A manufacturer of tobacco products may receive in bond into his factory tobacco products and may also receive into his factory tobacco products on which the tax has been determined (including products on which the tax has been paid). Cigars and cigarettes on which the tax has been determined which are so received shall be segregated and identified as products on which the tax has been determined. If tax determined products received into the factory are so handled that they cannot be identified both physically and in the records as tax determined products they shall be accounted for as returned to bond and upon subsequent removal shall be tax determined. Where returned tax determined tobacco products are to be repackaged without being returned to bond the manufacturer shall make application for authorization to do so to the appropriate TTB officer in accordance with § 40.217. Where the manufacturer intends to file claim for credit, allowance, or refund of tax on tax determined products he shall comply with the provisions of §§ 40.311 and 40.313.

§ 40.255
Shortages and overages in inventory.
Whenever a manufacturer of tobacco products makes a physical inventory of packaged tobacco products in bond, either as part of normal operations or when required by an appropriate TTB officer, and such inventory discloses a shortage or overage in such products by kind as recorded and reported (
i.e.,
small cigars, large cigars, chewing tobacco, snuff, pipe tobacco, or roll-your-own tobacco), the manufacturer shall enter such shortage or overage in the records required by § 40.183. Shortages or overages in inventories made at different times may not be used to offset each other, but shall be recorded and reported separately. Unless the manufacturer establishes that a shortage was not caused by a removal subject to the tax the manufacturer shall determine the tax on any shortage, make an adjustment in Schedule A of his next semimonthly tax return and pay the tax thereon. If, after paying the tax on a shortage, the manufacturer satisfactorily establishes that the shortage was not caused by a removal subject to tax, then such payment would be an overpayment of tax which the manufacturer may recover as provided in § 40.286. Where the manufacturer can establish prior to paying the tax on a shortage, that the shortage was not the result of a removal subject to tax he shall submit an explanation of such shortage with his report for the month in which the shortage was disclosed and, if appropriate, he may file claim for remission of tax liability as provided in § 40.287. When an overage is disclosed which the manufacturer can explain, he shall include such explanation in his monthly report and refund of any overpayment may be recovered as provided in § 40.286. Whenever a physical inventory discloses a shortage or overage of tobacco products which have not been packaged the manufacturer shall appropriately enter such shortage or overage in his records and shall, at the time required by the appropriate TTB officer, furnish an explanation in the form of a claim for remission of tax liability as provided in § 40.287. The manufacturer shall pay the tax on any shortage or portion thereof for which he is unable to furnish an explanation acceptable to the appropriate TTB officer.

§ 40.256
Minimum manufacturing and activity requirements.
The minimum manufacturing and activity requirement prescribed in § 40.61(c) of this part is a continuing condition of a manufacturer's permit,
that is, a permit to manufacture tobacco products is conditioned upon a person's principal business activity being the manufacture of tobacco products. A permit may be suspended, and subsequently revoked, if the person's principal business activity under such permit is to receive or transfer tobacco products in bond, or if the person has no activity under such permit for a period of one year. As a minimum activity requirement, the quantity of tobacco products manufactured under the permit must be equivalent to, or exceed, the quantity transferred or received in bond under the permit.

Allowance of tax.
Relief from the payment of tax on tobacco products may be extended to a manufacturer by allowance of the tax where the tobacco products after removal from the factory upon determination of tax and prior to the payment of such tax, are lost (otherwise than by theft) or destroyed, by fire, casualty, or act of God, while in the possession or ownership of the manufacturer who removed such products, or are withdrawn by him from the market. Any claim for allowance under this section shall be filed on TTB F 5620.8, in duplicate, with the appropriate TTB officer, and shall show the date the tobacco products were removed from the factory. A claim relating to products lost or destroyed shall be supported as prescribed in § 40.301. In the case of a claim relating to tobacco products withdrawn from the market the schedule prescribed in § 40.311 shall be filed with the appropriate TTB officer. The manufacturer may not anticipate allowance of his claim by making the adjusting entry in a tax return pending consideration and action on the claim. Tobacco products to which such a claim relates must be shown as removed on determination of tax in the return covering the period during which such products were so removed. Upon action on the claim by the appropriate TTB officer he will return the copy of TTB F 5620.8 to the manufacturer as notice of such action, which copy, with the copy of any verified supporting schedules, shall be retained by the manufacturer. When such notification of allowance of the claim or any part thereof is received prior to the time the return covering the tax on the tobacco products to which the claim relates is to be filed, the manufacturer may make an adjusting entry and explanatory statement in that tax return. Where the notice of allowance is received after the filing of the return
and taxpayment of the tobacco products to which the claim relates, the manufacturer may make an adjusting entry and explanatory statement in the next tax return(s) to the extent necessary to take credit in the amount of the allowance.

The appropriate TTB officer will, after such investigation as he deems appropriate, allow the claim to the extent he is satisfied the shortage was due to operating losses such as damage during grading, sorting, or packaging, and was not caused by theft or other unlawful or improper removal. Upon action on the claim by the appropriate TTB officer he will return the copy of TTB F 5620.8 to the manufacturer as notice of such action, which copy shall be retained by the manufacturer.

§ 40.357
Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.
(a)
General.
(1) Each taxpayer who was liable, during a calendar year, for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 41 of this chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic fund transfer (EFT) of taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes in any other form of remittance, as authorized in § 40.355, is not authorized for a taxpayer who is required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. For purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is defined as the gross tax liability on all taxable withdrawals and importations (including tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes brought into the United States from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, without regard to any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises from which such activities are conducted by the taxpayer. Overpayments are not taken into account in summarizing the gross tax liability.
(2) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and implementing regulations in 26 CFR §§ 1.563-1 through 1.1563-4. Also, the rules for a “controlled group of corporations” apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one
taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make remittances by EFT.
(3) A taxpayer who is required by this section to make remittances by EFT shall make a separate EFT remittance and file a separate return, TTB Form 5000.24, for each factory from which cigarette papers or cigarette tubes are withdrawn upon determination of tax.
(b)
Requirements.
(1) On or before January 10 of each calendar year, except for a taxpayer already remitting the tax by EFT, each taxpayer who was liable for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 41 of this chapter during the previous calendar year, shall notify, in writing, the appropriate TTB officer. The notice shall be an agreement to make remittances by EFT.
(2) For each return filed in accordance with this part, the taxpayer shall direct the taxpayer's bank to make an electronic fund transfer in the amount of the taxpayment to the Department of the Treasury's General Account or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. The request shall be made to the bank early enough for the transfer to be made to the Treasury Account by no later than the close of business on the last day for filing the return, prescribed in § 40.355. The request shall take into account any time limit established by the bank.
(3) If a taxpayer was liable for less than five million dollars in taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 41 of this chapter during the preceding calendar year, the taxpayer may choose either to continue remitting the tax as provided in this section or to remit the tax with the return as prescribed by § 40.355. Upon filing the first return on which the taxpayer chooses to discontinue remitting the tax by EFT and to begin remitting the tax with the tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the appropriate TTB officer by attaching a written notification to TTB Form 5000.24, stating that no taxes are due by EFT, because the tax liability during the preceding calendar year was less than five million dollars, and that the remittance shall be filed with the tax return.
(c)
Remittance.
(1) Each taxpayer shall show on the return, TTB Form 5000.24, information about remitting the tax for that return period by EFT and shall file the return with TTB, in accordance with the instructions of TTB Form 5000.24.
(2) Remittances shall be considered as made when the taxpayment by EFT is received by the Treasury Account. For purposes of this section, a taxpayment by EFT shall be considered as received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a Federal Reserve Bank.
(3) When the taxpayer directs the bank to effect an EFT message as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any transfer data record furnished to the taxpayer, through normal banking procedures, will serve as the record of payment, and shall be retained as part of required records.
(d)
Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT.
The taxpayer is subject to a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5761, 6651, or 6656, as applicable, for failure to make a taxpayment by EFT on or before the close of business on the prescribed last day for filing.
(e)
Procedure.
Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will issue to the taxpayer a TTB procedure entitled Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund Transfer. This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer is to follow when preparing returns and EFT remittances in accordance with this part. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will provide the taxpayer with instructions for preparing EFT remittances for payments to be made to the CBP.

Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(b) provides for a reduced rate of $500 per year with respect to any manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes whose gross receipts (for the most recent taxable year ending before the first day of the taxable period to which the special tax imposed by § 40.371 relates) are less than $500,000. The “taxable year” to be used for determining gross receipts is the taxpayer's income tax year. All gross receipts of the taxpayer shall be included, not just the gross receipts of the business subject to special tax. Proprietors of new businesses that have not yet begun a taxable year, as well as proprietors of existing businesses that have not yet ended a taxable year, who commence a new activity subject to special tax, qualify for the reduced special (occupational) tax rate, unless the business is a member of a “controlled group”; in that case the rules of paragraph (c) of this section shall apply.
(c)
Controlled group.
All persons treated as one taxpayer under 26 U.S.C. 5061(e)(3) shall be treated as one taxpayer for the purpose of determining gross receipts under paragraph (b) of this section. “Controlled group” means a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563 and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4. Also, the rules for a “controlled group of corporations” apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of this section.
(d)
Short taxable year.
Gross receipts for any taxable year of less than 12 months shall be annualized by multiplying the gross receipts for the short period by 12 and dividing the result by the number of months in the short period as required by 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).
(e)
Returns and allowances.
Gross receipts for any taxable year shall be reduced by returns and allowances made during such year under 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).

# General
§ 40.382
Authority of TTB officers to enter premises.
The appropriate TTB officer may enter in the daytime any premises where cigarette papers and tubes are produced or kept, so far as it may be necessary for the purpose of examining such articles. When such premises are open at night, the appropriate TTB officer may enter them, while so open, in the performance of his or her official duties. The owner of such premises, or person having the superintendence of the same, who refuses to admit the appropriate TTB officer or permit the appropriate TTB officer to examine such
cigarette papers and tubes shall be liable to the penalties prescribed by law for the offense.
(68A Stat. 872; 903 26 U.S.C. 7342, 7606)
§ 40.383
Interference with administration.
Whoever, corruptly or by force or threats of force, endeavors to hinder or obstruct the administration of this subpart, or endeavors to intimidate or impede any TTB officer acting in an official capacity, or forcibly rescues or attempts to rescue or causes to be rescued any property, after it has been duly seized for forfeiture to the United States in connection with a violation or intended violation of this subpart, shall be liable to the penalties prescribed by law.
(68A Stat. 855; 26 U.S.C. 7212)
§ 40.384
Disposal of forfeited, condemned, and abandoned cigarette papers and tubes.
Forfeited, condemned, or abandoned cigarette papers or tubes in the custody of a Federal, State, or local officer upon which the Federal tax has not been paid shall not be sold or caused to be sold for consumption in the United States if, in the opinion of the officer, the sale of such papers and tubes will not bring a price equal to the tax due and payable, and the expenses incident to the sale. Where the cigarette papers or tubes are not sold the officer may deliver them to a Federal or State institution (if they are fit for consumption) or cause their destruction by burning completely or by rendering them unfit for consumption. Where such papers or tubes are sold, release by the officer having custody shall be made only after such papers and tubes are properly packaged and taxpaid. A receipt from the appropriate TTB officer evidencing payment of tax on such papers or tubes shall be presented to the officer having custody of the articles, which tax shall be considered part of the sales price. Where cigarette papers or tubes which have been packaged under the provisions of part 45 of this chapter are to be released after payment of tax, the purchaser shall appropriately mark each package “Federal Tax Paid (date)” before the officer having custody of the papers or tubes releases them. However, the articles may be released without such marking of the packages if the purchaser is a qualified manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes and does not intend to place such papers or tubes on the domestic market for taxable articles but will otherwise dispose of them. A written statement of notification of disposal by destruction or return to bond through claim for refund, shall be filed, in original only, with the officer having custody of the articles. In the case of cigarette papers and tubes forfeited under the internal revenue laws, the sale shall be subject to the provisions of part 72 of this chapter.

§ 40.385
Alternate methods or procedures.
A manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes, on specific approval by the appropriate TTB officer as provided in this section, may use an alternate method or procedure in lieu of a method or procedure specifically prescribed in this subpart.

(a) Good cause has been shown for the use of the alternate method or procedure,
(b) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed method or procedure, and affords equivalent security to the revenue, and
(c) The alternate method or procedure will not be contrary to any provision of law, and will not result in an increase in cost to the Government or hinder the effective administration of this subpart.
No alternate method or procedure relating to the giving of any bond or to the assessment, payment, or collection of tax, shall be authorized under this
section. A manufacturer who desires to employ an alternate method or procedure shall submit a written application, in triplicate, to the appropriate TTB officer. The application shall specifically describe the proposed alternate method or procedure, and shall set forth the reasons therefor. Alternate methods or procedures shall not be employed until the application has been approved by the appropriate TTB officer.

Authorization for any alternate method or procedure may be withdrawn whenever, in the judgment of the appropriate TTB officer, the revenue is jeopardized or the effective administration of this part is hindered. Any authorization of the appropriate TTB officer under this section shall be retained as part of the manufacturer's record in accordance with this subpart.
§ 40.386
Emergency variations from requirements.
The appropriate TTB officer may approve methods of operation other than as specified in this subpart, where it is determined that an emergency exists and the proposed variations from the specified requirements are necessary, and the proposed variations—
(a) Will afford the security and protection to the revenue intended by the prescribed specifications;
(b) Will not hinder the effective administration of this subpart; and
(c) Will not be contrary to any provision of law. Variations from requirements granted under this section are conditioned on compliance with the procedures, conditions, and limitations set forth in the approval of the application. Failure to comply in good faith with such procedures, conditions and limitations shall automatically terminate the authority for such variations and the manufacturer thereupon shall fully comply with the prescribed requirements of regulations from which the variations were authorized. Authority for any variation may be withdrawn whenever in the judgment of the appropriate TTB officer the revenue is jeopardized or the effective administration of this subpart is hindered by the continuation of such variation. Where a manufacturer desires to employ such variation, the manufacturer shall submit a written application to do so (in triplicate) to the appropriate TTB officer. The application shall describe the proposed variations and set forth the reasons therefor. Variations shall not be employed until the application has been approved. In accordance with this subpart, any authorization of the appropriate TTB officer under this section shall be retained as part of the manufacturer's records.

# General
§ 40.471
Abatement.
A claim for abatement of the unpaid portion of the assessment of any tax on cigarette papers and tubes, or any liability in respect thereof, may be allowed to the extent that such assessment is excessive in amount, is assessed after the expiration of the applicable period of limitation, or is erroneously or illegally assessed. Any claim under this section shall be prepared on TTB F 5620.8, in duplicate, and shall set forth the particulars under which the claim is filed. The original of the claim, accompanied by such evidence as is necessary to establish to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that the claim is valid, shall be filed with the appropriate TTB officer.
(68A Stat. 792, 6404)
§ 40.472
Allowance.
Relief from the payment of tax on cigarette papers and tubes may be extended to a manufacturer by allowance of the tax where the cigarette papers and tubes, after removal from the factory upon determination of tax and prior to the payment of such tax, are lost (otherwise than by theft) or destroyed by fire, casualty, or act of God, while in the possession or ownership of the manufacturer who removed such articles, or are withdrawn by the manufacturer from the market. Any claim for allowance under this section shall be filed on TTB F 5620.8 with the appropriate TTB officer, shall be executed under penalties and perjury and shall
show the date the cigarette papers and tubes were removed from the factory. A claim relating to articles lost or destroyed shall be supported as prescribed in § 40.475. In the case of a claim relating to cigarette papers or tubes withdrawn from the market the schedule prescribed in § 40.476 shall be filed with the appropriate TTB officer. The manufacturer may not anticipate allowance of a claim by making the adjusting entry in a tax return pending consideration and action on the claim. Cigarette papers and tubes to which such a claim relates must be shown as removed on determination of tax in the return covering the period during which such articles were so removed. Upon action on the claim by the appropriate TTB officer a copy of TTB F 5620.8 will be returned to the manufacturer as notice of such action. This copy of TTB F 5620.8, with the copy of any verified supporting schedules, shall be retained by the manufacturer. When such notification of allowance of the claim or any part thereof is received prior to the time the return covering the tax on the cigarette papers or tubes to which the claim relates is to be filed, the manufacturer may make an adjusting entry and explanatory statement in that tax return. Where the notice of allowance is received after the filing of the return and taxpayment of the cigarette papers or tubes to which the claim relates, the manufacturer may make an adjusting entry and explanatory statement in the next tax return(s) to the extent necessary to take credit in the amount of the allowance.
(72 Stat. 1419, as amended, 26 U.S.C. 5705)

Any claim for credit or refund under this section shall be prepared on TTB F 5620.8, in duplicate. Claims shall include a statement that the tax imposed on cigarette papers and tubes by 26 U.S.C. 7652 or Chapter 52, was paid in respect to the cigarette papers or tubes covered by the claim, and that the articles were lost, destroyed, or withdrawn from the market within 6 months preceding the date the claim is filed. A claim for credit or refund relating to articles lost or destroyed shall be supported as prescribed in § 40.475, and a claim relating to articles withdrawn from the market shall be accompanied by a schedule prepared and verified as prescribed in §§ 40.476, and 40.477. The original and one copy of TTB F 5620.8, shall be filed with the appropriate TTB officer. Upon action by the appropriate TTB officer on a claim for credit, a copy of TTB F 5620.8 will be returned to the manufacturer as notification of allowance or disallowance of the claim or any part thereof. This copy, with the copy of any verified supporting schedules, shall be retained by the manufacturer. When the manufacturer is notified of allowance of the claim for credit or any part thereof, the manufacturer shall make an adjusting entry and explanatory statement in the next tax return(s) to the extent necessary to take credit in the amount of the allowance. The manufacturer may not anticipate allowance of a claim by taking credit on a tax return prior to consideration and action on such claim. The duplicate of a claim for refund or credit, with a copy of any verified supporting schedules, shall be retained by the manufacturer.
(72 Stat. 1419, as amended, 26 U.S.C. 5705)

Where cigarette papers and tubes are so lost or destroyed the manufacturer shall report promptly such fact, and the circumstances, to the appropriate TTB officer. If the manufacturer wishes to be relieved of the tax liability, a claim on TTB F 5620.8, in duplicate, shall also be prepared, setting forth the
nature, date, place, and extent of the loss or destruction. The original and one copy of the claim, accompanied by such evidence as is necessary to establish to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that the claim is valid, shall be filed with the appropriate TTB officer. Upon action on the claim by the appropriate TTB officer, the copy of TTB F 5620.8 will be returned to the manufacturer as notice of such action, which copy shall be retained by the manufacturer.

# Other Provisions Relating to Manufacturers of Processed Tobacco
§ 40.531
Alternate methods or procedures.
(a)
General.
A manufacturer of processed tobacco, on specific approval by the appropriate TTB officer as provided in this section, may use an alternate method or procedure in lieu of a method or procedure specifically prescribed in this subpart. The appropriate TTB
officer may approve an alternate method or procedure, subject to stated conditions, when the appropriate TTB officer finds that—
(1) Good cause has been shown for the use of the alternate method or procedure;
(2) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed method or procedure, and
(3) The alternate method or procedure will not be contrary to any provision of law, and will not result in an increase in cost to the Government or hinder the effective administration of this subpart.
(b)
Application.
A manufacturer of processed tobacco who desires to employ an alternate method or procedure must submit a written application to the appropriate TTB officer. The application shall specifically describe the proposed alternate method or procedure, and shall set forth the reasons therefor. An alternate method or procedure shall not be employed until the application has been approved by the appropriate TTB officer. The manufacturer shall, during the period of authorization of an alternate method or procedure, comply with the terms of the approved application. Authorization for any alternate method or procedure may be withdrawn whenever, in the judgment of the appropriate TTB officer, the effective administration of this part is hindered. Any authorization of the appropriate TTB officer under this section shall be retained as part of the manufacturer's records in accordance with this subpart.
[T.D. TTB-78, 74 FR 29410, June 22, 2009, as amended by T.D. TTB-104, 77 FR 37304, June 21, 2012]
§ 40.532
Emergency variations from requirements.
The appropriate TTB officer may approve methods of operation other than as specified in this subpart, where it is determined that an emergency exists and the proposed variations from the specified requirements are necessary, and provided that the proposed variations will not hinder the effective administration of this subpart and will not be contrary to any provision of law. Variations from requirements granted under this section are conditioned on compliance with the procedures, conditions, and limitations set forth in the approval of the application. Failure to comply in good faith with such procedures, conditions, and limitations will automatically terminate the authority for such variations, and the manufacturer of processed tobacco thereupon must fully comply with the prescribed requirements of the regulations from which the variations were authorized. Authority for any variation may be withdrawn whenever in the judgment of the appropriate TTB officer the effective administration of this subpart is hindered by the continuation of such variation. Where a manufacturer desires to employ such variation, the manufacturer must submit a written application to do so to the appropriate TTB officer. The application must describe the proposed variations and set forth the reasons therefor. Variations may not be employed until the application has been approved. Any authorization of the appropriate TTB officer under this section shall be retained as part of the manufacturer's records, in accordance with this subpart.
§ 40.533
Penalties and forfeitures.
Anyone who fails to comply with the provisions of this subpart may be liable to the civil and criminal penalties, and forfeitures, provided by law.
§ 40.534
Power of attorney.
If the application for permit or any report or other document required to be executed under this subpart is to be signed by an individual (including one of the partners for a partnership or one of the members of an association) as an attorney in fact for any person, or if an individual is to otherwise officially represent such person, power of attorney on TTB F 5000.8 shall be furnished to the appropriate TTB officer. Such power of attorney is not required for persons whose authority is furnished with the corporate documents as required by § 40.494. TTB F 5000.8 does not have to be filed again with the appropriate TTB officer where such form has
previously been submitted to that appropriate TTB officer and is still in effect.

(2) Any tobacco that has been processed and that is removed in a package, as that term is defined in § 41.11, that does not bear the notice for smokeless tobacco prescribed in § 41.72 or the notice for pipe tobacco prescribed in § 41.72a is deemed to be roll-your-own tobacco and subject to tax at the rate applicable to roll-your-own tobacco. A container of processed tobacco, the contents of which weigh 10 pounds or less (including any added non-tobacco ingredients or constituents), that is removed within the meaning of this part for any purpose other than destruction, export, delivery as a sample to a manufacturer of processed tobacco or tobacco products for the purpose of soliciting orders of processed tobacco, or for scientific testing or testing of equipment that results in the destruction of the processed tobacco or the return of the processed tobacco, is deemed to be a package offered for sale or delivery to the ultimate consumer.
(3) Subject to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, any tobacco that has been processed and that is removed in a package, as that term is defined in § 41.11, is deemed to be roll-your-own tobacco and subject to tax at the rate applicable to roll-your-own tobacco, even though the package bears the notice required for pipe tobacco under § 41.72a, if:

(ii) The package or accompanying materials bear any representation that would suggest a use other than as pipe tobacco. The term 'accompanying materials' includes, but is not limited to, any point of sale advertising or other printed product communications issued by the manufacturer or importer of pipe tobacco products. In addition, the inclusion of cigarette papers or tubes in a package bearing a 'pipe tobacco'
declaration will suggest a use other than pipe tobacco.
(4) During the period from June 22, 2009, through March 23, 2010, importers may continue to remove products as pipe tobacco in packages that do not bear the declaration “pipe tobacco” in the manner prescribed in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.

[26 FR 8191, Aug. 31, 1961. Redesignated at 40 FR 16835, Apr. 15, 1975]
§ 41.39
Determination of sale price of large cigars.
The tax imposed on large cigars is computed based on the sale price (the price for which the large cigars are sold by the importer or United States manufacturer). In addition to money, goods or services exchanged for cigars may be considered as part of the sale price. See § 40.22(b) of this chapter for information on determining the sale price in special cases.

# Liability for and Payment of Taxes
§ 41.40
Persons liable for tax.
The importer of tobacco products or cigarette papers and tubes is liable for the internal revenue taxes imposed thereon by 26 U.S.C. 5701 or 7652, except when tobacco products or cigarette papers or tubes imported or brought into the United States (other than those previously exported and returned) are released from customs custody, without payment of tax as provided under 26 U.S.C. 5704(c). Under section 5704(c), tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes, imported or brought into the United States, may be released from customs custody, without payment of tax, for delivery to the proprietor of an export warehouse, or to a manufacturer of tobacco products or cigarette papers and tubes if such articles are not put up in packages. Under these circumstances the transferee will become liable for the internal revenue tax on these articles upon release from customs custody, and the importer will thereupon be relieved from the liability for the tax. However, if the transferee is also the importer, the importer will not be relieved from the liability for the tax.
[78 FR 38568, June 27, 2013]

# Assessment of Taxes
§ 41.60
Assessment.
Whenever any person required by law to pay internal revenue tax on tobacco
products or cigarette papers or tubes fails to pay such tax, the tax shall be ascertained and assessed against such person, subject to the limitations prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 6501. The tax so assessed shall be in addition to the penalties imposed by law for failure to pay such tax when required. Except in cases where delay may jeopardize collection of the tax, or where the amount is nominal or the result of an evident mathematical error, no such assessment shall be made until and after notice has been afforded such person to show cause against assessment. The person will be allowed 45 days from the date of such notice to show cause, in writing, against such assessment.

# Customs' Collection of Taxes
§ 41.62
Customs collection of internal revenue taxes on tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes imported or brought into the United States.
Internal revenue taxes on tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes imported or brought into the United States, which are to be paid to the Port Director of Customs or other authorized customs officer, in accordance with this part, must be collected, accounted for, and deposited as internal revenue collections by the Port Director of Customs in accordance with customs procedures and regulations.
[78 FR 38569, June 27, 2013]
§ 41.63
Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.
(a) Each importer who was liable, during a calendar year, for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in taxes on cigars, cigarettes, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 40 of this chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic fund transfer (EFT) of such taxes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of such taxes by cash, check, or money order is not authorized for an importer who is required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. For purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is defined as the gross tax liability on all taxable withdrawals and importations (including similar products brought into the United States from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, without regard to any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises from which such activities are conducted by the taxpayer.
(b) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except that the words “at least 80 percent” shall be replaced by the words “more than 50 percent” in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the rules for a “controlled group of corporations” apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make remittances by EFT.
(c) For the purposes of this section, (1) electronic fund transfer or EFT means any transfer of funds, other than a transaction originated by check, draft, or similar paper instrument, which is initiated through an electronic terminal, telephonic instrument, or computer of magnetic tape, so as to order, instruct, or authorize a financial institution to either debit or credit an account, in accordance with procedures established by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and (2) electronic fund transfer or EFT does not have the meaning defined in § 41.11 for use elsewhere in this part.
(d) An importer who is required by this section to make remittances by EFT, shall make the EFT remittance
in accordance with the requirements of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

The appropriate TTB officer will certify on the TTB F 5200.11 that the manufacturer or export warehouse proprietor has TTB authorization to receive the products. No one filing on paper may obtain release of the products under this section until they have received the TTB F 5200.11 certified by the appropriate TTB officer. The manufacturer or export warehouse proprietor must have possession of the TTB F 5200.11, bearing TTB certification, at the time the products are released from customs custody and must make the form available to a customs officer upon request at such time. After release of the products, the TTB F 5200.11 must be retained by the manufacturer or export warehouse proprietor and made available to the appropriate TTB officer or a customs officer upon request.

§ 41.115a
Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.
(a)
General.
(1) Each taxpayer who was liable, during a calendar year, for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 40 of this chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic fund transfer (EFT) of taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes by cash, check, or money order, as described in § 41.115, is not authorized for a taxpayer who is required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. For purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is defined as the gross tax liability of all taxes which are paid in accordance with this subpart, taxable withdrawals from premises in the United States, and importations during the calendar year, without regard to any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises from which such activities are conducted by the taxpayer. Overpayments are not taken into account in summarizing the gross tax liability.
(2) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except that the words “at least 80 percent” shall be replaced by the words “more than 50 percent” in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the rules for a “controlled group of corporations” apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make remittances by EFT.
(3) A taxpayer who is required by this section to make remittances by EFT, shall make a separate EFT remittance and file a separate tax return for each factory which tobacco products, or cigarette papers, or cigarette tubes are withdrawn upon determination of tax.
(b)
Requirements.
(1) On or before January 10 of each calendar year, except for a taxpayer already remitting the tax by EFT, each taxpayer who was liable for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 40 of this chapter during the previous calendar year, shall notify, in writing, the appropriate TTB officer. The notice shall be an agreement to make remittances by EFT.
(2) For each return filed in accordance with this part, the taxpayer shall direct the taxpayer's bank to make an electronic fund transfer in the amount of the taxpayment to the Treasury Account as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. The request shall be made to the bank early enough for the transfer to be made to the Treasury Account by no later than the close of business on the last day for filing the return, prescribed in § 41.105 or § 41.114. The request shall take into account any time limit established by the bank.
(3) If a taxpayer was liable for less than five million dollars in taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes during the preceding calendar year, the taxpayer may choose either to continue remitting the tax as provided in this section or to remit the tax with the return as prescribed by § 41.115. On the first return on which the taxpayer chooses to discontinue remitting the tax by EFT and to begin remitting the tax with the tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the appropriate TTB officer by attaching a written notification to the tax return, stating that no taxes are due by EFT, because the tax liability during the preceding calendar year was less than five million dollars, and that the remittance shall be filed with the tax return.
(c)
Remittance.
(1) Each taxpayer shall show on the tax return, information about remitting the tax for that return by EFT and shall file the return with the appropriate TTB officer.
(2) Remittances shall be considered as made when the taxpayment by electronic fund transfer is received by the Treasury Account. For purposes of this section, a taxpayment by electronic fund transfer shall be considered as received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a Federal Reserve Bank.
(3) When the taxpayer directs the bank to effect an electronic fund transfer message as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any transfer data record furnished to the taxpayer, through normal banking procedures, will serve as the record of payment, and shall be retained as part of required records.
(d)
Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT.
The taxpayer is subject to a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5761, 6651, or 6656, as applicable, for failure to make a taxpayment by EFT on or before the close of business on the prescribed last day for filing.
(e)
Procedure.
Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will issue to the taxpayer a TTB Procedure entitled, Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT). This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer must follow when preparing returns and EFT remittances under this part.

§ 41.181
Records of large cigars.
Every person who imports large cigars for sale within the United States must keep such records as are necessary to establish and verify the sale price that applies to large cigars removed (entered or withdrawn).
(a)
Basic record.
The importer must keep a record to show each sale price (as determined under § 41.39), which is applicable to large cigars removed. No later than the tenth business day in January of each year the importer must prepare such a record to show the sale price in effect on the first day of that year for each brand and size of large cigars. The importer must note any change in a price from that shown in the record within ten business days after such change in price. The record must be a continuing one for each brand and size of cigar (and type of packaging, if pertinent), so that the taxable price on any date may be readily ascertained. If an importer removes new types of large cigars after the beginning of the year, the importer must enter the sale price and its effective date for such large cigars in the basic record within ten business days after such removal.
(b)
Copies of price announcements.
The importer must keep a copy of each general announcement that is issued internally or to the trade about establishment or change of large cigar sale prices. If the copy does not show the actual date when issued it must be annotated to show this information.
(c)
Copies of entry and withdrawal forms.
The importer must keep a copy of each customs entry or withdrawal form on which internal revenue tax for large cigars is declared pursuant to § 41.81.
(d)
Alternative record.
If an importer has so few import transactions and/or brands and sizes of large cigars that retention of an appropriate copy of each entry and withdrawal form required under paragraph (c) of this section will provide an adequate record of sale prices, then the record required under paragraph (a) of this section need not be kept. In such case the entry and withdrawal forms must identify the brands and sizes of cigars covered and show the corresponding quantity and sale price for each. If such information was not originally entered on the form it may be included by annotation. Whenever the appropriate TTB officer finds that alternative records being kept pursuant to this paragraph are inadequate for the intended purpose, he or she may so notify the importer in writing, after which time the importer must keep the record required under paragraph (a) of this section.

as an importer of processed tobacco or an amended permit authorizing the importation of processed tobacco under chapter 52 and this subpart.

Where a partnership or association has previously filed such documents with the appropriate TTB officer and such documents are currently complete and accurate, a written statement, in duplicate, to that effect by the partnership or association will be sufficient for the purpose of this section.
§ 41.236

§ 41.237

§ 41.238
Investigation of applicant.
Appropriate TTB officers may inquire or investigate to verify the information in connection with an application for a permit. The investigation will ascertain whether the applicant is eligible for a permit. A permit may be denied if the applicant (including, in the case of a corporation, any officer, director, or principal stockholder and, in the case of a partnership, a partner)—
(a) Is, by reason of his business experience, financial standing, or trade connections or by reason of previous or current legal proceedings involving a felony violation of any other provision of Federal criminal law relating to tobacco products, processed tobacco, cigarette paper, or cigarette tubes, not likely to maintain operations in compliance with this chapter;
(b) Has been convicted of a felony violation of any provision of Federal or State criminal law relating to tobacco products, processed tobacco, cigarette paper, or cigarette tubes; or
(c) Has failed to disclose any material information required or made any material false statement in the application therefor.

Notice of contemplated disapproval.
If the appropriate TTB officer has reason to believe that the applicant is not entitled to a permit, the appropriate TTB officer will promptly give to the applicant notice of the contemplated disapproval of the application and opportunity for hearing thereon in accordance with part 71 of this chapter. If, after such notice and opportunity for hearing, the appropriate TTB officer finds that the applicant is not entitled to a permit, an order will be prepared stating the findings on which the application is denied.
§ 41.240
Issuance of permit.
If the application for the permit required under this subpart is approved, the appropriate TTB officer will issue the permit on TTB F 5200.24.

Provided that a timely application is filed, the person may continue operations under the existing permit until TTB takes final action on the application for the new permit.
[78 FR 38573, June 27, 2013]
§ 41.242

2013 or later, and that wishes to continue operations beyond the expiration of the permit, must apply for renewal of the permit within 30 days prior to expiration of the permit, in accordance with instructions provided with the renewal application form. Permits will be renewed only for those persons that have engaged in the importing of processed tobacco under the current permit during the one year period immediately prior to the date of the application to renew.
(b)
Permits with an effective date prior to August 26, 2013.
A person may not obtain renewal of a permit bearing an effective date prior to August 26, 2013. A person operating as an importer of processed tobacco that holds a permit bearing an effective date prior to August 26, 2013, and that wishes to continue in operations as an importer of processed tobacco, must apply for and receive a new permit for issuance under § 41.240 and in accordance with the rules contained in § 41.241(b).
[78 FR 38573, June 27, 2013]
§ 41.243
Retention of permit and supporting documents.
The importer of processed tobacco must retain the permit, together with the copy of the application and supporting documents returned with the permit, at the same place where the records required by this subpart are kept. The permit and supporting documents must be made available for inspection by any appropriate TTB officer upon request.

# Changes After Original Qualification
§ 41.251
Change in name.
(a)
Change in individual name.
When there is a change in the name of an individual operating under a permit as an importer of processed tobacco, the importer must, within 30 days of such change, make application on TTB F 5230.5 for an amended permit.
(b)
Change in trade name.
When there is a change in a trade name used by an importer of processed tobacco in connection with operations authorized by the permit, the importer must, within 30 days of such change, make application on TTB F 5230.5 for an amended permit to reflect such change. This requirement also applies to the addition or discontinuance of a trade name. The importer must also furnish a true copy of any new trade name certificate or document issued to the importer, or statement in lieu thereof, required by § 41.236.
(c)
Change in corporate name.
When there is a change in the corporate name of an importer of processed tobacco, the importer must, within 30 days of such change, make application on TTB F 5230.5 for an amended permit. The importer must also furnish such documents as may be necessary to establish that the corporate name has been changed.
§ 41.252
Change in ownership or control.
(a)
Fiduciary successor.
If an administrator, executor, receiver, trustee, assignee, or other fiduciary is to take over the business of an importer of processed tobacco as a continuing operation, such fiduciary shall, before commencing operations, make application for permit in accordance with § 41.232, furnish certified copies, in duplicate, of the order of the court, or other pertinent documents, showing his appointment and qualification as such fiduciary. However, where a fiduciary intends only to liquidate the business, qualification as an importer of processed tobacco will not be required if he promptly files with the appropriate TTB officer a written statement to that effect.
(b)
Transfer of ownership.
If a transfer in ownership of the business of an importer of processed tobacco (including a change of any member of a partnership or association) is to be made, such importer shall give notice, in writing, to the appropriate TTB officer, naming the proposed successor and the desired effective date of the transfer. The proposed successor must, before commencing operations, qualify as an importer of processed tobacco in accordance with this subpart. The importer must give notice of the transfer, and the proposed successor must make application for permit, in ample time for examination and approval thereof before the desired date of such change.
The predecessor must make a concluding report, in accordance with § 41.262, and surrender the permit with the report. The successor must make a first report, in accordance with § 41.262.
(c)
Change in officers, directors, or stockholders of a corporation.
Upon election or appointment (excluding successive reelection or reappointment) of any officer or director of a corporation operating as an importer of processed tobacco, or upon any occurrence that results in a person acquiring ownership or control of more than ten percent in aggregate of the outstanding stock of such corporation, the importer shall, within 30 days of such action, so notify the appropriate TTB officer in writing, giving the identity of such person. When there is any change in the authority furnished under § 41.271 for officers to act on behalf of the corporation, the importer must immediately so notify the appropriate TTB officer in writing.
(d)
Change in control of corporation.
When the issuance, sale, or transfer of the stock of a corporation operating as an importer of processed tobacco results in a change in the identity of the principal stockholders exercising actual or legal control of the operations of the corporation, the corporate manufacturer must, within 30 days after the change occurs, make application on TTB F 5230.4 for a new permit. Otherwise, the present permit shall be automatically terminated at the expiration of such 30-day period, and the importer must make a concluding report, in accordance with § 41.262, and surrender the permit with the report. If the application for a new permit is timely made, the present permit will continue in effect pending final action with respect to such application.
§ 41.253
Change in location or address.
Whenever an importer of processed tobacco intends to relocate the principal business office, the importer must, before commencing operations at the new location, make application on TTB F 5230.5, and obtain an amended permit. Whenever any change occurs in the address, but not the location, of the principal business office of an importer of processed tobacco, as a result of action of local authorities, the importer must, within 30 days of such change, make application on TTB F 5230.5 for an amended permit. Whenever the importer wishes to change the location of the premises used for the storage of processed tobacco imported or received by the importer to an extent that would be inconsistent with the location information submitted with the importer's last permit application, the importer must apply for, and obtain, an amended permit before such a change in premises takes place.
[T.D. TTB-78, 74 FR 29416, June 22, 2009, as amended by T.D. TTB-104, 77 FR 37304, June 21, 2012]

# Operations of Importers of Processed Tobacco
§ 41.261
Records.
(a) Any person who imports, or who knowingly causes to be imported, processed tobacco must make and keep records of operations and transactions. A person purchasing processed tobacco from the importer in a domestic transaction and who does not knowingly cause the processed tobacco to be imported is not required to make and keep records unless the terms and conditions of the importation are controlled by the person placing the order with the importer (for example, the importer is not an independent contractor but the agent of the person placing the order). Records maintained must reflect the date and quantity of processed tobacco:
(1) Imported;
(2) Received otherwise than through importation, together with the name and address of the person from whom it was received;
(3) Returned to customs custody or exported;
(4) Transferred or sold to a person who holds a TTB permit as an importer or manufacturer of tobacco products or of processed tobacco or as an export warehouse proprietor;
(5) Except in the case of returns to customs custody or exportations, transferred or sold to a person who does not hold a TTB permit as an importer or manufacturer of tobacco products or of processed tobacco or as an export warehouse proprietor; and
(6) Lost or destroyed; and
(7) Transferred between buildings that are covered under the same permit but that are not located in the same city, town, village, or State.
(b) The records of any importer who transfers or sells processed tobacco to a person who does not hold a TTB permit as an importer or manufacturer of tobacco products or of processed tobacco or as an export warehouse proprietor must include dated, commercial records that show the following information about each removal:
(1) The full name and business address (including city and State) of the purchaser (if there is a purchaser) or the full name and business address of the recipient (if there is no purchaser), or personal address if the purchaser or recipient is not a business;
(2) The full name, business address (including city and State), and driver's license number of the person picking up the processed tobacco for delivery;
(3) The license number of the vehicle in which the processed tobacco is picked up for delivery to purchaser or transferee;
(4) The street address of the destination of the processed tobacco;
(5) The quantity of processed tobacco in the shipment.
(c) The entries in the records required under this section must be made for each day by the close of the business day following the day on which the transfer or sale occurs. There is no particular format prescribed for the records required under this section (and commercial records may be used), although the required information must be readily ascertainable from the records kept. In the case of a removal under paragraph (a)(5) of this section that involves shipment by a common carrier, the appropriate TTB officer may approve an alternate method or procedure pursuant to § 41.26 of this part through which the importer may keep records regarding the common carrier and its means of tracking (including pick up and delivery) of the shipment in lieu of the information required by paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section. No records are required to be kept under this part regarding processed tobacco within customs custody, although this will not preclude TTB review of records related to such processed tobacco as may be appropriate for purposes of the enforcement of the provisions of this part.
(26 U.S.C. 5741)
[T.D. TTB-78, 74 FR 29416, June 22, 2009, as amended by T.D. TTB-104, 77 FR 37305, June 21, 2012]
§ 41.262
Reports.
(a)
General.
Every importer of processed tobacco must prepare a monthly report on TTB F 5220.6 in accordance with the instructions for the form. The report must be prepared at the times specified in this section and must be prepared whether or not any operations or transactions occurred during the period covered by the report. The importer must retain a copy of each report in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. The importer need not include in the reports under this part information regarding processed tobacco that is in customs custody.
(b)
First report(s).
The first monthly report must be submitted by the 15th day of the month following the month in which the permit is issued. If the importer is operating as an importer of processed tobacco under the transitional rule in accordance with § 41.233, the importer must submit the first report by the 15th day of the month following the month in which TTB provides written acknowledgement of the receipt of the application filed under § 41.232.
(c)
Reports of no activity.
Reports with the notation “No Activity” must be made for those months in which no activity occurs.
(d)
Reports of sales and transfers.
(1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, an importer that exports processed tobacco or transfers or sells processed tobacco to someone other than a person holding a permit as an importer or manufacturer of processed tobacco or tobacco products or as an export warehouse proprietor must report each such exportation, sale, or transfer on TTB F 5250.2 by the close of the next business day following the day of exportation, sale, or transfer, in accordance with the instructions on the form.
(2) In the case of removals for export, as an alternative to the procedure prescribed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the importer may submit to TTB monthly summary reports of such removals in a format approved by the appropriate TTB officer. Prior to the use of such an alternate procedure, the importer must obtain written approval from the appropriate TTB officer.
(3) An importer that ships or transfers processed tobacco for scientific testing or testing of equipment which results in the destruction of the processed tobacco or the return of the processed tobacco is not required to report such shipment or transfer on TTB F 5250.2.
(e)
Concluding report.
When a transfer of ownership of the business of an importer of processed tobacco described in § 41.252(b) occurs, or when a change in control of a corporation described in § 41.252(d) occurs, a concluding report with the notation “Concluding Report” must be made for the month or partial month during which the transfer of ownership or change in control becomes effective. A concluding report must also be made for the month or partial month during which an importer concludes operations under the permit or authorization.
(26 U.S.C. 5722)
[T.D. TTB-78, 74 FR 29416, June 22, 2009, as amended by T.D. TTB-104, 77 FR 37305, June 21, 2012; T.D. TTB-196, 89 FR 87947, Nov. 6, 2024]
§ 41.263
Maintenance of records and reports.
All records and reports required by this subpart must be maintained separately, chronologically by transaction or reporting date, at the importer's principal place of business. The appropriate TTB officer may, pursuant to a written request, authorize files, or an individual file, to be maintained at another business location under the control of the importer, provided that the alternative location does not cause undue inconvenience to TTB when attempting to examine the files and does not delay the timely transmittal of any documents required to be submitted to TTB.
(26 U.S.C. 5741)
§ 41.264
Inventories.
Every importer of processed tobacco must provide a true and accurate inventory of any processed tobacco stored on premises designated pursuant to § 41.237. The importer must make such an inventory at the time of commencing business, at the time of transferring ownership, at the time of changing the location of facilities in which processed tobacco is stored, at the time of concluding business, and at such other time as the appropriate TTB officer may require. A specific format is not prescribed. For permits issued prior to June 21, 2012, the permittee has 180 days from June 21, 2012, to make an inventory as required under this paragraph.
[T.D. TTB-104, 77 FR 37305, June 21, 2012]
§ 41.265
Processed tobacco importation process.
(a)
General.
In the case of processed tobacco imported into the United States, the importer, if filing electronically, must file with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) the information specified in paragraph (b) of this section at the time of filing the entry or entry summary, as appropriate, along with any other information that is required by CBP to be filed as part of the entry or entry summary for CBP purposes. If the information required by this section is required by, and filed with, CBP for purposes of meeting CBP requirements, such filing will also satisfy the requirements of this section. Regardless of the method of filing, the importer must retain as a record the information required by this section, any information required as part of the entry or entry summary by CBP for CBP purposes, and any supporting documentation, and must make such records available upon request by the appropriate TTB officer or a customs officer.
(b)
Information required.
The following information is required, as described in paragraph (a) of this section:
(1) The number of the importer's permit issued under subpart K or M of this part;
(2) The employer identification number (EIN) assigned to the importer by
the Internal Revenue Service and provided to TTB by the importer on its permit application to TTB on TTB Form 5230.4;
(3) The name and address of the ultimate consignee;
(4) A description of the product as “processed tobacco” for Internal Revenue Code purposes; and
(5) The quantity of processed tobacco.

[81 FR 94210, Dec. 22, 2016]

# Other Provisions Applicable to Importers of Processed Tobacco
§ 41.271
Power of attorney.
If the application for a permit or authorization or any report or other document required to be executed under this subpart is to be signed by an individual (including one of the partners for a partnership or one of the members of an association) as an attorney in fact for any person, or if an individual is otherwise to officially represent such person, power of attorney on TTB F 5000.8 shall be furnished to the appropriate TTB officer. Such power of attorney is not required for persons whose authority is furnished with the corporate documents as required by § 41.234. Form 5000.8 does not have to be filed again with an appropriate TTB officer where such form has previously been submitted to TTB and is still in effect.
§ 41.272
Cross reference.
For other applicable provisions pertaining to forms prescribed, retention of records, interference with administration, alternate methods or procedures, emergency variations from requirements, penalties and forfeitures, and delegations of the Administrator, see subpart C of this part.
§ 41.273
Suspension and revocation of permit.
Where the appropriate TTB officer has reason to believe that an importer of processed tobacco has not in good faith complied with the provisions of 26 U.S.C. chapter 52, and regulations thereunder, or with any other provision of 26 U.S.C. with intent to defraud, or has violated any condition of his permit, or has failed to disclose any material information required or made any material false statement in the application for the permit, or is, by reason of previous or current legal proceedings involving a felony violation of any other provision of Federal criminal law relating to tobacco products, processed tobacco, cigarette paper, or cigarette tubes, not likely to maintain operations in compliance with 26 U.S.C. chapter 52, or has been convicted of a felony violation of any provision of Federal or State criminal law relating to tobacco products, processed tobacco, cigarette paper, or cigarette tubes, the appropriate TTB officer shall issue an order, stating the facts charged, citing such person to show cause why his permit should not be suspended or revoked. Such citation shall be issued and opportunity for hearing afforded in accordance with part 71 of this chapter, which part is applicable to such proceedings. If, after hearing, the hearing examiner, or on appeal, the Administrator, finds that such person has not shown cause why his permit should not be suspended or revoked, such permit shall be suspended for such period as the appropriate TTB officer deems proper or shall be revoked.

# Subpart Ba—Special (Occupational) Taxes

# Source:
T.D. ATF-271, 53 FR 17563, May 17, 1988, unless otherwise noted.
§ 44.31
Liability for special tax.
(a)
Export warehouse proprietor.
Every export warehouse proprietor shall pay a special (occupational) tax at a rate specified by § 44.32. The tax shall be paid on or before the date of commencing the business of an export warehouseman, and thereafter every year on or before July 1. On commencing business, the tax shall be computed from the first day of the month in which liability is incurred, through the following June 30. Thereafter, the tax shall be computed for the entire year (July 1 through June 30).
(b) [Reserved]
(c)
Each place of business taxable.
An export warehouse proprietor under this part incurs special tax liability at each place of business in which an occupation subject to special tax is conducted. A place of business means the entire office, plant or area of the business in any one location under the same proprietorship. Passageways, streets, highways, rail crossings, waterways, or partitions dividing the premises are not sufficient separation to require additional special tax, if the divisions of the premises are otherwise contiguous.
(d)
Payment of tax.
Special tax must be paid by return. The prescribed return is TTB Form 5630.5t, Special Tax Registration and Return—Tobacco. Special tax returns, with payment of tax, must be filed with TTB in accordance with the instructions on the form and the requirements of subpart D of part 46 of this chapter.

§ 44.32
Rate of special tax.
(a)
General.
Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(a)(3) imposes a special tax of $1,000 per year on every export warehouse proprietor.
(b)
Reduced rate for small proprietors.
Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(b) provides for a reduced rate of $500 per year with respect to any export warehouse proprietor whose gross receipts (for the most recent taxable year ending before the first day of the taxable period to which the special tax imposed by § 44.31 relates) are less than $500,000. The “taxable year” to be used for determining gross receipts is the taxpayer's income tax year. All gross receipts of the taxpayer shall be included, not just the gross receipts of the business subject to special tax. Proprietors of new businesses that have not yet begun a taxable year, as well as proprietors of existing businesses that have not yet ended a taxable year, who commence a new activity subject to special tax, qualify for the reduced special (occupational) tax rate, unless the business is a member of a “controlled group”; in that case, the rules of paragraph (c) of this section shall apply.
(c)
Controlled group.
All persons treated as one taxpayer under 26 U.S.C. 5061(e)(3) shall be treated as one taxpayer for the purpose of determining gross receipts under paragraph (b) of this section. “Controlled group” means a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563 and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except that the words “at least 80 percent” shall be replaced by the words “more than 50 percent” in each place they appear in subsection (a) of 26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the rules for a “controlled group of corporations” apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of this section.
(d)
Short taxable year.
Gross receipts for any taxable year of less than 12 months shall be annualized by multiplying the gross receipts for the short period by 12 and dividing the result by the number of months in the short period as required by 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).
(e)
Returns and allowances.
Gross receipts for any taxable year shall be reduced by returns and allowances made
during such year under 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).

Such articles delivered to a foreign-trade zone under this part shall be considered exported for the purpose of the statutes and bonds under which removed and for the purposes of the internal revenue laws generally and the regulations thereunder. However, export status is not acquired until an application for admission of the articles into the zone with zone restricted status has been approved by the district director of customs pursuant to the appropriate provisions of 19 CFR chapter I and the required certificate of receipt of the articles in the zone has been made on Form 5200.14 as prescribed in this part.

Deliveries may be made to vessels actually engaged in foreign, intercoastal, or noncontiguous territory trade (i.e., vessels operating on a regular schedule in trade or actually transporting passengers and/or cargo (a) between a port in the United States and a foreign port; (b) between the Atlantic and Pacific ports of the United States; or (c) between a port on the mainland of the United States and a port in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or a possession of the United States; between a port in Alaska and a port in Hawaii; or between a port in Alaska or Hawaii and a port in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or a possession of the United States); to vessels clearing through customs for a port beyond the jurisdiction of the internal revenue laws of the United States; to vessels of war or other governmental activity; or to vessels of the United States documented to engage in the fishing business (including the whaling business), and foreign fishing (including whaling) vessels of 5 net tons or over. Such deliveries to vessels shall be subject to lading under customs supervision as provided in §§ 44.207 and 44.263. As a condition to the lading of the tobacco products, and cigarette papers and
tubes, the customs authorities at the port of lading may, if they deem it necessary in order to protect the revenue, require assurances, satisfactory to them, from the master of the receiving vessel that the quantities to be laden are reasonable, considering the number of persons to be carried, the vessel's itinerary, the duration of its intended voyage, etc., and that such articles are to be used exclusively as supplies on the voyage. For this purpose, the customs authorities may require the master of the receiving vessel to submit, prior to lading, customs documentation for permission to lade the articles. Where the customs authorities allow only a portion of a shipment to be laden, the remainder of the shipment shall be returned to the bonded premises of the manufacturer, export warehouse proprietor, or customs warehouse proprietor making the shipment, or otherwise disposed of as approved by the appropriate TTB officer. Deliveries may be made to aircraft that are clearing through customs and that are enroute to a place beyond the jurisdiction of the internal revenue laws of the United States, and to aircraft operating on a regular schedule between U.S. customs areas as defined in the Air Commerce Regulations (19 CFR part 122). Deliveries may not be made to a vessel or aircraft stationed in the United States for an indefinite period and where its schedule does not include operations outside such jurisdiction.

(2) If copies of the notice of removal are not filed with the shippers export
declaration, or if a shipment is for the armed forces of the United States in the contiguous foreign country and a shipper's export declaration is not required, show all the information on the notice of removal when it is filed so that the customs officer is able to associate the notice with the related shipper's export declaration (if any) or other documents filed with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for the shipment.
(b) When a shipment has been cleared by CBP from the United States, and when the customs officer at the port of exit is satisfied that the products have departed from the United States, that officer shall—
(1) Complete the certificate of exportation on both copies of the notice of removal;

(3) Return the other copy to the manufacturer or export warehouse proprietor making the shipment for filing with the appropriate TTB officer.

If practical, the customs officer will give advance notice to the manufacturer or export warehouse proprietor of the type of transactions for which a landing certificate will be required. However, failure to notify the manufacturer or proprietor in advance will not prevent the customs officer from requiring a landing certificate for specific exportations when he considers it necessary to protect the revenue. In any case, the customs officer will advise the manufacturer or proprietor before departure of the shipment from the United States as to those exports for which a landing certificate will be required.
(d) The provisions of this section relating to landing certificates also apply when a Form 5200.14 is not required for each transaction (for example: When multiple exportations, individually documented by commercial records, are consolidated on a single Form 5200.14 pursuant to an approved alternate procedure under § 44.72). The provisions apply to each transaction, regardless of the manner in which it is documented, unless specifically provided otherwise in the alternate procedure.

Superseding bond.

§ 44.247
Termination of liability of surety under bond.
The liability of a surety on any bond required by this subpart shall be terminated only as to operations on and after the effective date of a superseding bond, or the date of approval of the customs warehouse proprietor's request for termination, or otherwise, in accordance with the termination provisions of the bond.

Multiple businesses of same ownership and location.
(a) Where more than one type of taxable business is conducted by the same person at the same place, special tax for each business must be paid at the rates prescribed for each.

(26 U.S.C. 5733)
§ 46.94
Relation to State and municipal law.
(a)
General.
The payment of special (occupational) tax does not exempt any person from any penalty or punishment provided by the laws of any State for carrying on any trade or business within that State, nor does it authorize the commencement or continuance of any trade or business contrary to State law or in places prohibited by county or municipal law. Payment of this tax does not prohibit any State from placing an additional duty or tax on the same trade or business, for State or other purposes.
(b)
Special tax stamps.
TTB officers are without authority to refuse to issue a special tax stamp to a person engaged in business in violation of State law. The stamp is not a Federal permit or license, but is merely a receipt for the tax. The stamp affords the holder no protection against prosecution for violation of State law.
(26 U.S.C. 5734)
§ 46.95
Liability of partners.
Any number of persons carrying on one business in partnership at any one place during any tax year are required to pay only one special tax.

# Payment of Special Tax
§ 46.101
Special tax returns.
(a)
Preparation of TTB Form 5630.5t.
Every manufacturer of tobacco products, manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes, and export warehouse proprietor is required to pay special (occupational) tax and file a return on TTB Form 5630.5t, “Special Tax Registration and Return—Tobacco.” TTB Form 5630.5t must be completed in accordance with the instructions on the form, and all of the information called for on the form must be provided, including the following:
(1) Name of the taxpayer.
(2) Trade name(s) (if any) of the business(es) subject to special (occupational) tax.
(3) Employer identification number (see § 46.102).
(4) Exact location of the place of business, by name and number of building or street, or if these do not exist, by some specific description in addition to the post office address. In the case of one return for two or more locations, the address to be shown must be the taxpayer's principal place of business (or principal office, in the case of a corporate taxpayer).
(5) Class(es) of special tax to which the taxpayer is subject.
(6) Ownership and control information. This consists of the name, position, and residence address of every owner of the business and of every person having power to control its management and policies with respect to the activity subject to special tax. “Owner of the business” includes every partner, if the taxpayer is a partnership, and every person owning 10 percent or more of its stock, if the taxpayer is a corporation. However, the ownership and control information required by this paragraph need not be stated if the same information has been previously provided to TTB in connection with a permit application and that previously provided information is still current.
(b)
Multiple locations and/or classes of tax.
A taxpayer subject to special tax for the same period at more than one location or for more than one class of tax must—
(1) File one special tax return, TTB Form 5630.5t, with payment of tax, to cover all such locations and classes of tax; and
(2) Prepare, in duplicate, a list identified with the taxpayer's name, address (as shown on TTB Form 5630.5t), employer identification number, and period covered by the return. The list must show, by State, the name, address, and tax class of each location for which special tax is being paid. The original of the list must be filed with TTB as an attachment to TTB Form 5630.5t, and the copy must be retained at the taxpayer's principal place of business (or principal office, in the case of a corporate taxpayer) for a period of three years from the date of the return.
(c)
Signing of TTB Form 5630.5t
—(1)
By principal.
The return of an individual proprietor must be signed by the individual. The return of a partnership must be signed by a general partner. The return of a corporation must be signed by an officer. In each case, the person signing the return must designate his or her capacity as “individual owner,” “member of firm,” or, in the case of a corporation, the officer's title.
(2)
By fiduciary.
A receiver, trustee, assignee, executor, administrator, or other legal representative who continues the business of a bankrupt, insolvent, deceased, or otherwise incapacitated person must indicate the capacity in which the fiduciary acts.
(3)
By agent or attorney in fact.
If a return is signed by an agent or attorney in fact, the signature must be preceded by the name of the principal and followed by the title of the agent or attorney in fact. A return signed by a person as agent will not be accepted unless there is filed, with the TTB office with which the return is required to be filed, a power of attorney authorizing the agent to perform the act.
(d)
Perjury statement.
Each TTB Form 5630.5t must contain, or be verified by, a written declaration that the return has been executed under the penalties of perjury.
(26 U.S.C. 5732, 6061, 6065, 6151, 7011)
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1513-0112)
§ 46.102
Employer identification number.
(a)
Requirement.
The employer identification number (as defined in 26 CFR 301.7701-12) of the taxpayer who has been assigned such a number must be shown on each special tax return, including each amended return, filed under this subpart. Failure of the taxpayer to include the employer identification number may result in the imposition of the penalty specified in § 70.113 of this chapter.
(b)
Application for employer identification number.
Each taxpayer who files a special tax return and who has not already been assigned an employer identification number must file Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form SS-4 to apply for one. The taxpayer must apply for and be assigned only one employer identification number, regardless of the number of places of business for which the taxpayer is required to file a special tax return. The taxpayer must apply for the employer identification number no later than 7 days after the filing of the taxpayer's first special (occupational) tax return. IRS Form SS-4 may be obtained from the director of an IRS service center, from any IRS district director, or from
https://www.irs.gov.
(26 U.S.C. 6109)
[T.D. TTB-79, 74 FR 37420, July 28, 2009, as amended by T.D. TTB-196, 89 FR 87950, Nov. 6, 2024]
§ 46.103
Time for filing return and paying tax.
The return, along with remittance of special tax, must be filed on or before the date of commencing business as a manufacturer of tobacco products, manufacturer of cigarette papers or tubes, or export warehouse proprietor, and thereafter every year on or before July 1. If the return and applicable tax are received in the mail and the U.S. postmark on the cover shows that it was deposited in the mail in the United States within the time prescribed for filing in an envelope or other appropriate wrapper which was properly addressed with postage prepaid, the return will be considered as timely filed. If the postmark is not legible, the sender has the burden of proving the date when the postmark was made. When registered mail is used, the date of registration will be accepted as the postmark date. When certified mail is used, the date of the postmark on the sender's receipt of certified mail is treated as the postmark date.
(26 U.S.C. 5732, 6011, 6071)
§ 46.104
Method of payment.
Payment of special tax must be made in cash, or by check or money order payable to Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. If a check or money order so tendered is not honored when presented for payment, the person who tendered the check or money order will remain liable for the payment of the special tax, and for all penalties and additions, to the same extent as if the check or money order had not been tendered. In addition, unless the person who tendered the check or money order can show that the check or money order was issued in good faith, and with reasonable cause to believe that it would be duly paid, there must be paid as penalty an amount equal to 1 percent of the amount of the check or money order, except that if the amount of the check or money order is less than $500, the penalty will be $5, or the amount of the check or money order, whichever is less.
(26 U.S.C. 6311, 6657)
§ 46.105
Receipt for taxes.
Subject to § 46.106, the appropriate TTB officer will issue a receipt to a taxpayer if cash is received as a remittance in payment of special tax (including penalties and interest, if any), or for any type of remittance received if the taxpayer requests a receipt.
§ 46.106
Receipt in lieu of stamp prohibited.
No receipt will be issued in lieu of issuance of a special tax stamp under § 46.116. A receipt may be given only pending the issuance of a stamp, or where the tax liability relates to a prior tax year.
(26 U.S.C. 6314)
§ 46.107
Penalty for failure to file return or to pay tax.
(a)
Failure to file return.
Any person required by this subpart to file a return on TTB Form 5630.5t who fails to file the return on or before the date for filing prescribed in § 46.103 must pay, in addition to the tax, a delinquency penalty, unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect (see § 46.109). The delinquency penalty for failure to file the return on or before the last date prescribed will be 5 percent of the amount required to be shown as tax on the return if the failure to file is for not more than one month; with an additional 5 percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which the delinquency continues, but not more than 25 percent in the aggregate.
(b)
Failure to pay tax.
Any person who files a return on TTB Form 5630.5t under this subpart and who fails to pay the amount shown as tax on the return on or before the date prescribed in § 46.103 for payment of such tax, must pay a penalty, in addition to the tax, unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect (see § 46.109). The penalty for failure to pay the tax on or before the date prescribed for payment is 0.5 percent of the amount shown as tax on the return if the failure to pay is not for more than one month; with an additional 0.5 percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which the failure continues, but not more than 25 percent in the aggregate. Any person required to pay the special tax who willfully fails to pay the tax shall be fined not more than $5,000, or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both, for each such offense.
(c)
Limitations.
With respect to any return on Form 5630.5t, the amount of the addition under paragraph (a) of this section will be reduced by the amount of the addition under paragraph (b) of this section for any month to which an addition to tax applies under both paragraph (a) and paragraph (b) of this section. If the amount of tax required to be shown as tax on the return is less than the amount shown as tax on such return, the penalties prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will be applied by substituting that lower amount.
(26 U.S.C. 5731, 6651)
§ 46.108
Interest on unpaid tax.
(a)
General.
Interest is due on unpaid special tax from the date the tax was required to be paid to the date paid. Interest will be charged for each day at the rate prescribed by law in effect on that day. Interest accruing after December 31, 1982, is compounded daily.
(b)
Adjusted interest rates.
Adjusted interest rates, determined in accordance with the procedure prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 6621(b), are announced quarterly by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The appropriate TTB officer will provide information, when requested, regarding interest rates applicable to specific time periods.
(26 U.S.C. 6601, 6621)
§ 46.109
Waiver of penalties.
In every case where a special tax return is not filed, or the tax is not paid, at the time prescribed in § 46.103, the delinquency penalties specified in § 46.107 for failure to file a return or for failure to pay the amount shown as tax on the return will be asserted and collected unless a reasonable cause for delay in filing the return or payment of the tax is clearly established. A taxpayer who believes the circumstances that delayed such taxpayer's filing of the return or payment of the tax are reasonable, and who desires to have the penalties waived, must submit with the return a written statement under the penalty of perjury, affirmatively showing all of the circumstances alleged as reasonable causes for delay. If the appropriate TTB officer determines that the delinquency was due to a reasonable cause and not to willful neglect or gross negligence, the addition to the tax will be waived. If the taxpayer exercised ordinary business care and prudence and was nevertheless unable to file the return within the prescribed time, or if the taxpayer made a satisfactory showing that the taxpayer exercised ordinary business care and prudence in providing for payment of the tax liability and was nevertheless either unable to pay the tax or would have suffered an undue hardship if the
taxpayer had paid on the due date, then the delay is due to reasonable cause. Mere ignorance of the law will not be considered a reasonable cause.
(26 U.S.C. 6651)

# Special Tax Stamps
§ 46.116
Issuance, distribution, and examination of special tax stamps.
(a)
Issuance of special tax stamps.
Upon filing a properly executed return on TTB Form 5630.5t together with the full tax remittance, the taxpayer will be issued an appropriately designated special tax stamp. If the return covers multiple locations, TTB will send to the taxpayer's principal place of business (or principal office in the case of a corporate taxpayer) one appropriately designated stamp for each location listed on the attachment to TTB Form 5630.5t required by § 46.101(b)(2).
(b)
Distribution of special tax stamps for multiple locations.
On receipt of the special tax stamps, the taxpayer must verify that there is one stamp for each location listed on the attachment to TTB Form 5630.5t and that the information on each stamp is correct. The taxpayer must then forward each stamp to the place of business designated on the stamp. Incorrect stamps must be returned to the appropriate TTB officer as provided in § 46.120.
(c)
Examination of special tax stamps.
Each stamp denoting payment of special tax must be kept available for inspection by an appropriate TTB officer during business hours at the location for which the stamp is designated.
(26 U.S.C. 5732)
§ 46.117
Lost or destroyed stamps.
If a special tax stamp has been lost or destroyed, the taxpayer must immediately notify the TTB officer who issued the stamp. A “Certificate in Lieu of Lost or Destroyed Special Tax Stamp” will be issued to the taxpayer who submits an affidavit explaining to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that the stamp was lost or destroyed. The certificate must be kept available for inspection in the same manner as prescribed for a special tax stamp in § 46.116(c).
§ 46.118
Certificate in lieu of lost or destroyed special tax stamp.
The provisions of this subpart relating to special tax stamps apply as well to certificates in lieu of lost or destroyed special tax stamps issued to taxpayers under § 46.117.
§ 46.119
Errors disclosed by taxpayers.
On receipt of a special tax stamp, the taxpayer must examine it to ensure that the name and address are correctly stated; if not, the taxpayer must return the stamp to the TTB officer who issued it, with a statement showing the nature of the error and the correct name or address. The appropriate TTB officer, on receipt of such stamp and statement, will compare the data on the stamp with that of the Form 5630.5t in TTB files, correct the error if made in the TTB office, and return the stamp to the taxpayer. However, if the error was in the taxpayer's preparation of the Form 5630.5t, the appropriate TTB officer will require the taxpayer to file a new Form 5630.5t, designated “Amended Return,” setting forth the taxpayer's correct name and address, and a statement explaining the error on the original Form 5630.5t. On receipt of the amended Form 5630.5t and a satisfactory explanation of the error, the appropriate TTB officer will make the proper correction on the stamp and return it to the taxpayer.
§ 46.120
Errors discovered on inspection.
When a TTB officer discovers on a special tax stamp a material error in the name, ownership, or address of the taxpayer, that officer will require the taxpayer to surrender the erroneous tax stamp and prepare a new Form 5630.5t, designated “Amended Return,” showing correctly all of the information required in § 46.101 and containing, in the body of the form or in an attachment thereto, a statement of the reason for requesting correction of the stamp. On receipt of the amended return and an acceptable explanation for the error, the officer will make the proper correction on the stamp and return it to the taxpayer. However, if the error found by the TTB officer is on a special tax stamp issued as a result of a return on Form 5630.5t filed under
§ 46.101(b), that officer will instruct the taxpayer to return the stamp, with a statement showing the nature of the error and the correct data, to the TTB officer who issued the stamp, for correction in accordance with § 46.119.

# Changes in Businesses Holding Special (Occupational) Tax Stamps
§ 46.126
Change in name or address.
(a)
Change in name.
If there is a change in the corporate or firm name, or in the trade name, as shown on TTB Form 5630.5t, the taxpayer must file an amended special tax return as soon as practicable after the change, covering the new corporate or firm name, or trade name. No new special tax is required to be paid. The taxpayer must attach the special tax stamp for endorsement of the change in name.
(b)
Change in location
—(1)
General.
If there is a change in location of a taxable place of business, the taxpayer must, within 30 days after the change, file with TTB an amended special tax return covering the new location. The taxpayer must attach the special tax stamp or stamps for endorsement of the change in location. No new special tax is required to be paid. However, if the taxpayer does not file the amended return within 30 days, the taxpayer is required to pay a new special tax and obtain a new special tax stamp.
(2)
Procedure.
If the taxpayer's original return on TTB Form 5630.5t covered only one location, the taxpayer may deliver the amended return and the stamp at any TTB office, or to any TTB officer inspecting the business, in lieu of mailing them to TTB. If the taxpayer's original return covered multiple locations under the provisions of § 46.101(b), he or she must forward with the amended return an attachment showing both the old and new address of any place of business which has been relocated, and the special tax stamp covering the location from which the business was removed. The appropriate TTB officer receiving such return or stamp will, if the return is submitted within the 30-day period, enter the proper endorsement on the stamp and return it to the taxpayer.
(26 U.S.C. 5733, 7011)
§ 46.127
Change in ownership.
(a)
General.
A special tax stamp is a receipt for tax, personal to the one to whom issued, and is not transferable from one manufacturer of tobacco products, manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes, or export warehouse proprietor to another. If there is a change in the ownership of a special-tax payer, the successor must pay a new special (occupational) tax and obtain the required special tax stamp(s). Examples of changes in ownership that require payment of a new special tax include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) Sale of business;
(2) Formation of a partnership by two persons who have paid special tax;
(3) Addition of a partner;
(4) Incorporation of the business;
(5) Creation of a new corporation to replace one or more corporations that have paid special tax; and
(6) Stockholder continuing the business of a corporation after its dissolution.
(b)
Changes that do not require payment of a new special tax.
The following changes do not require payment of a special tax:
(1) Increase in capital stock of a corporation.
(2) Change in ownership of any or all of the capital stock of a corporation.
(c)
Exemption for certain successors.
Persons identified in paragraph (d) of this section as having the right of succession may carry on the business for the remainder of the tax year for which the special tax was paid, without paying a new special tax, if within 30 days after the date on which the successor begins to carry on the business, the successor files with TTB a special tax return on TTB Form 5630.5t showing the basis of succession. A person who is a successor to a business for which special tax has been paid, and who fails to register the succession, is liable for special tax computed from the first day of the calendar month in which the successor began to carry on the business.
(d)
Persons having right of succession.
The right of succession referred to in paragraph (c) of this section will pass to the identified persons in the following circumstances:
(1)
Death.
The surviving spouse or child, or the executor, administrator, or other legal representative, of a deceased taxpayer;
(2)
Succession of spouse.
A husband or wife succeeding to the business of his or her living spouse;
(3)
Insolvency.
A receiver or trustee in bankruptcy, or an assignee for the benefit of creditors;
(4)
Withdrawal from firm.
The partner or partners remaining after the death or withdrawal of a member of a partnership.
(26 U.S.C. 5733)

# Stamps for Incorrect Period or Incorrect Liability
§ 46.131
General.
If a taxpayer through error has filed a return and paid special tax for an incorrect period of liability or for an incorrect class of business, the taxpayer must prepare a corrected TTB Form 5630.5t, designated “Amended Return,” for each tax year involved and must submit the amended return, or returns, with remittance for the total applicable tax and additions to the tax (delinquency penalties and interest), to TTB in accordance with the instructions on the Form 5630.5t or, if the error is discovered by a TTB officer inspecting the premises, to that officer. Subject to the limitations imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6511, the incorrectly paid tax (including additions thereto) may be allowed as a credit against the correct tax (including any additions thereto), as provided in § 46.132, on surrender of the incorrect stamp or stamps, with the amended return or returns noted to show that credit is requested. Any incorrectly paid tax (including additions thereto) that is not credited as provided in § 46.132, including any creditable tax and additions thereto in excess of the correct tax (including additions thereto), may be refunded pursuant to §§ 46.136 through 46.138 if the taxpayer files a corrected return on Form 5630.5t with remittance of the correct amount of tax (including any additions thereto). A new stamp will be issued only for a current period of liability.
(26 U.S.C. 6011)
§ 46.132
Credit for incorrect stamp.
(a)
General.
The appropriate TTB officer may credit the tax (including additions thereto) paid for an incorrect stamp if the taxpayer has filed an amended return showing the correct tax on TTB Form 5630.5t and has, with the amended return, surrendered the incorrect stamp for credit.
(b)
Underpayment.
Where the correct tax (including any additions thereto) exceeds the incorrect tax paid, the appropriate TTB officer may credit the tax paid against the correct tax upon remittance of the difference between the tax paid and the correct tax plus any additions thereto.
(c)
Overpayment.
Where the tax (and additions thereto) paid for the surrendered incorrect stamp exceeds the amount due, the appropriate TTB officer will advise the taxpayer to file a claim for refund of that excess on TTB Form 5620.8. Sections 46.136 through 46.138 apply to all claims for refund.
(26 U.S.C. 6402, 6511)

# Abatement or Refund of Special Taxes
§ 46.136
Claims.
Claims for abatement of assessment of special tax (including penalties and interest), or for refund of an overpayment of special tax (including interest and penalties), must be filed on TTB Form 5620.8. The claim must be filed with the appropriate TTB officer. Each claim must set forth in detail each ground on which it is based and must contain facts sufficient to explain to the appropriate TTB officer the exact basis for the claim. If the claim is for refund of special tax for which a stamp was issued, either the stamp must be attached to and be made a part of the claim, or the claimant must include in the claim a satisfactory explanation of the reason why the stamp cannot be submitted.
§ 46.137
Time limit on filing of claim for refund.
No claim for the refund of a special tax or penalty will be allowed unless presented within 3 years after the filing of the related tax return or within 2 years after the payment of such tax
or penalty, whichever of these periods expires later.
(26 U.S.C. 6511)
§ 46.138
Discontinuance of business.
A dealer who for any reason discontinues business is not entitled to a refund of special tax for the unexpired portion of the tax year for which the special tax stamp was issued.

(b) In the absence of State law governing the change of title between seller and buyer, the Uniform Commercial Code allows the seller and buyer to agree when title passes.
(c) If there is no State law or agreement between the seller and buyer, the Uniform Commercial Code states that title transfer depends on how the seller ships the articles.
(1) If the shipment is free on board (F.O.B.) destination, the title transfer occurs when the seller completes the physical delivery of the articles.

§ 46.206
Articles in a foreign trade zone.
If articles subject to floor stocks tax are stored in a foreign trade zone established under the Foreign Trade Zone Act (the Act of June 18, 1934, 48 Stat. 998, 19 U.S.C. 81a
et seq.
), the dealer is liable for the tax and must take an inventory in accordance with § 46.207 or when either of the following conditions apply:
(a) Internal revenue taxes have been determined or customs duties liquidated, with respect to the articles pursuant to the first proviso of section 3(a) of the Foreign Trade Zone Act; or
(b) Articles are held by a customs officer pursuant to the second proviso of section 3(a) of the Foreign Trade Zone Act.
§ 46.207
Articles held in bond.
If the dealer is a manufacturer or an export warehouse proprietor and holds articles in TTB bond on April 1, 2009, the floor stocks tax does not apply to
those articles. Likewise, if the dealer holds articles in a customs bonded warehouse on which tax has not been paid or determined, the floor stocks tax does not apply on those articles. However, if the dealer on April 1, 2009, holds articles in a customs bonded warehouse or foreign trade zone on which tax has been paid or determined pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 5703(b)(2)(B), the floor stocks tax applies to those articles.
§ 46.208
Unmerchantable articles.
Articles that the dealer holds for return to a supplier because of some defect are not subject to the floor stocks tax. However, the dealer must segregate any such unmerchantable articles and include them in a separate section of the inventory record. The dealer cannot include as unmerchantable any items that may be held because of poor market demand or to reduce the dealer's inventory. If, for any reason, the tobacco products or cigarette papers or tubes that were determined to be unmerchantable are not subsequently returned or destroyed, the dealer must file an additional floor stocks tax return and pay tax on such products plus any applicable penalties and interest.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1513-0129)
§ 46.209
Articles in vending machines.
There is no exemption for articles in vending machines. They are subject to the floor stocks tax and must be included in the dealer's inventory record.

# Subpart A—Introduction
§ 53.1
Introduction.
The regulations in this part (part 53, subchapter C, chapter I, title 27, Code of Federal Regulations) are designated “Manufacturers Excise Taxes—Firearms and Ammunition.” The regulations relate to the tax on the sale of firearms and ammunition imposed by section 4181 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and to certain related administrative provisions of chapter 32, subchapter F, of the Code. Chapter 32, subchapter D of the Code imposes taxes on the sale or use by the manufacturer, producer, or importer of certain recreational equipment specified in that chapter. References in the regulations in this part to the “Internal Revenue Code” or the “Code” are references to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (United States Code of 1986), as amended, unless otherwise indicated. References to a section or other provision of law are references to a section or other provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, unless otherwise indicated.
§ 53.2
Attachment of tax.
(a) For purposes of this part, the manufacturers excise tax generally attaches when the title to the article sold passes from the manufacturer to a purchaser.
(b) When title passes is dependent upon the intention of the parties as gathered from the contract of sale and the attendant circumstances. In the absence of expressed intention, the legal rules of presumption followed in the jurisdiction where the sale is made govern in determining when title passes.
(c) In the case of a sale on credit, the tax attaches whether or not the purchase price is actually collected.
(d) Where a consignor (such as a manufacturer) consigns articles to a consignee (such as a dealer), retaining ownership in them until they are disposed of by the consignee, title does not pass, and the tax does not attach until sale by the consignee. Where the relationship between a manufacturer and a dealer is that of principal and agent, title does not pass, and the tax does not attach, until sale by the dealer.
(e) In the case of a lease, an installment sale, a conditional sale, or a chattel mortgage arrangement or similar arrangement creating a security interest, a proportionate part of the tax attaches to each payment. See section 4217 and §§ 53.103 and 53.104 for a limitation on the amount of tax payable on lease payments.
(f) In the case of use by the manufacturer, the tax attaches at the time the use begins.
§ 53.3
Exemption certificates.
Several provisions of this part, relating to sales exempt from manufacturers excise tax, require the manufacturer to obtain an exemption certificate from the purchaser to substantiate the exempt character of the sale. Any form of exemption certificate will be acceptable if it includes all the information required by the provisions of this part. These certificates are available as preprinted forms, which are available for free download on the TTB website at
https://www.ttb.gov/forms,
or by request sent via postal mail to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, National Revenue Center, 550 Main Street, Room 8970, Cincinnati, OH 45202. The preprinted certificates may be reproduced as needed.
[T.D. TTB-44, 71 FR 16957, Apr. 4, 2006, as amended by T.D. TTB-196, 89 FR 87951, Nov. 6, 2024]

# Subpart B—Definitions
§ 53.11
Meaning of terms.
When used in this part and in forms prescribed under this part, where not otherwise distinctly expressed or manifestly incompatible with the intent thereof, terms shall have the meanings ascribed in this section. Words in the plural form shall include the singular, and vice versa, and words importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine. The terms “includes” and “including” do not exclude other things not enumerated which are in the same general class or are otherwise within the scope thereof.
Administrator.
The Administrator, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC.
Appropriate TTB officer.
An officer or employee of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) authorized to perform any functions relating to the administration or enforcement of this part by TTB Order 1135.53, Delegation of the Administrator's Authorities in 27 CFR Part 53, Manufacturers Excise Taxes—Firearms and Ammunition.
Calendar quarter.
A period of 3 calendar months ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, or December 31.
Calendar year.
The period which begins January 1 and ends on the following December 31.
Chapter 32.
For purposes of this part chapter 32 means section 4181, chapter 32, of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Code.
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Electronic fund transfer (EFT).
Any transfer of funds effected by a taxpayer's financial institution, either directly or through a correspondent banking relationship, via the Federal Reserve Communications System (FRCS) or Fedwire to the Treasury Account at the Federal Reserve Bank.
Exportation.
The severance of an article from the mass of things belonging within the United States with the intention of uniting it with the mass of things belonging within some foreign country or within a possession of the United States.
Exporter.
The person named as shipper or consignor in the export bill of lading.
Financial institution.
A bank or other financial institution, whether or not a member of the Federal Reserve System, which has access to the Federal Reserve Communications Systems (FRCS) or Fedwire. The “FRCS” or “Fedwire” is a communications network that allows Federal Reserve System member financial institutions to effect a transfer of funds for their customers (or other financial institutions) to the Treasury Account at the Federal Reserve Bank.
Firearms.
Any portable weapons, such as rifles, carbines, machine guns, shotguns, or fowling pieces, from which a shot, bullet, or other projectile may be discharged by an explosive.
Importer.
Any person who brings a taxable article into the United States from a source outside the United States, or who withdraws such an article from a customs bonded warehouse for sale or use in the United States. If the nominal importer of a taxable article is not its beneficial owner (for example, the nominal importer is a customs broker engaged by the beneficial owner), the beneficial owner is the “importer” of the article for purposes of chapter 32 of the Code and is liable
for tax on their sale or use of the article in the United States. See section 4219 of the Code and 27 CFR 53.121 for the circumstances under which sales by persons other than the manufacturer or importer are subject to the manufacturers excise tax.
Knockdown condition.
A taxable article that is unassembled but complete as to all component parts.
Manufacturer.
Includes any person who produces a taxable article from scrap, salvage, or junk material, or from new or raw material, by processing, manipulating, or changing the form of an article or by combining or assembling two or more articles. The term also includes a “producer” and an “importer.” Under certain circumstances, as where a person manufactures or produces a taxable article for another person who furnishes materials under an agreement whereby the person who furnished the materials retains title thereto and to the finished article, the person for whom the taxable article is manufactured or produced, and not the person who actually manufactures or produces it, will be considered the manufacturer.
A manufacturer who sells a taxable article in a knockdown condition is liable for the tax as a manufacturer. Whether the person who buys such component parts or accessories and assembles a taxable article from them will be liable for tax as a manufacturer of a taxable article will depend on the relative amount of labor, material, and overhead required to assemble the completed article and on whether the article is assembled for business or personal use.
Person.
An individual, trust, estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation. When used in connection with penalties, seizures, and forfeitures, the term includes an officer or employee of a partnership, who as an officer, employee or member, is under a duty to perform the act in respect of which the violation occurs.
Pistols.
Small projectile firearms which have a short one-hand stock or butt at an angle to the line of bore and a short barrel or barrels, and which are designed, made, and intended to be aimed and fired from one hand.

Possession of the United States.
Includes Guam, the Midway Islands, Palmyra, the Panama Canal Zone, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and Wake Island.
Purchaser.
Includes a lessee where the lessor is also the manufacturer of the article.

Secretary of the Treasury
or
Secretary.
The Secretary of the Treasury or a delegate of the Secretary.
Shells and cartridges.
Include any article consisting of a projectile, explosive, and container that is designed, assembled, and ready for use without further manufacture in firearms, pistols or revolvers. A person who reloads used shell or cartridge casings is a manufacturer of shells or cartridges within the meaning of section 4181 if such reloaded shells or cartridges are sold by the reloader. However, the reloader is not a manufacturer of shells or cartridges if, in return for a fee and expenses, he reloads casings of shells or cartridges submitted by a customer and returns the reloaded shells or cartridges with the identical casings provided by the customer to that customer. Under such circumstances, the customer would be the manufacturer of the shells or cartridges and may be liable for tax on the sale of articles. See section 4218 of the Code and § 53.112.
Taxable article.
Any article taxable under section 4181 of the Code.
Treasury Account.
The Department of Treasury's General Account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

§ 53.62
Exemptions.
(a)
Firearms subject to the National Firearms Act.
Section 4182(a) provides that the tax imposed by section 4181 of the Code shall not attach to the sale of any firearms on which the tax imposed by section 5811 of the Code (relating to tax on the transfer of machine guns, short-barreled firearms, and other weapons) has been paid. Any manufacturer, producer, or importer claiming such an exemption from the tax imposed by section 4181 of the Code must maintain such records and be prepared to produce such evidence as will establish the right to the exemption.
(b)
Sales to Defense Department or to U.S. Coast Guard
—(1)
Military department.
Section 4182(b) of the Code provides that the tax imposed by section 4181 of the Code shall not attach to the sale of firearms, pistols, revolvers, shells, or cartridges that are purchased with funds appropriated for a military department of the United States. For this purpose, the term “military department” means the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and Department of the Air Force. Included in the Department of the Navy are naval aviation and the Marine Corps.
(2)
Coast Guard.
Section 655, title 14, U.S.C., provides that no tax on the sale or transfer of firearms, pistols, revolvers, shells, or cartridges may be imposed on such articles when bought with funds appropriated for the United States Coast Guard.
(3)
Supporting evidence.
Any manufacturer, producer, or importer claiming an exemption from the tax imposed by section 4181 of the Code by reason of section 4182(b) and section 655, title 14 of the Code must maintain such records and be prepared to produce such evidence as will establish the right to the exemption. Generally, clearly identified orders or contracts of a military department signed by an authorized officer of the military department will be sufficient to establish the right to the exemption. In the absence of such orders or contracts, a statement, signed by an authorized officer of a military department or the Coast Guard, that the prescribed articles were purchased with funds appropriated for that military department or
the Coast Guard will constitute satisfactory evidence of the right to an exemption.
(c)
Small manufacturers, producers, and importers
—(1)
Exemption.
Section 4182(c) of the Code provides that the tax imposed by section 4181 of the Code shall not attach to any pistol, revolver, or firearm manufactured, produced, or imported by a person who manufactures, produces, and imports less than an aggregate of 50 of those articles during the calendar year, regardless of when the articles are sold.
(2)
Controlled groups.
All persons treated as a single employer for purposes of subsection (a) or (b) of section 52 of the Code are treated as one person for purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(3)
Applicability.
The exemption described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies to articles sold by the manufacturer, producer, or importer after September 30, 2005. Application of this exemption is based on the calendar year in which the manufacture, production, or importation of the articles in question took place and does not depend on when the sale occurs. In addition, each calendar year stands alone for purposes of applying the exemption.

# Subpart J—Special Provisions Applicable to Manufacturers Taxes
§ 53.91
Charges to be included in sale price.
(a)
In general.
The “price” for which an article is sold includes the total consideration paid for the article, whether that consideration is in the form of money, services, or other things. However, for purposes of the taxes imposed under chapter 32 of the Code, certain collateral charges made in connection with the sale of a taxable article must be included in the taxable sale price, whereas others may be excluded. Any charge which is required by a manufacturer, producer, or importer to be paid as a condition of its sale of a taxable article and which is not attributable to an expense falling within one of the exclusions provided in section 4216 of the Code or the regulations thereunder is includable in the taxable sale price. It is immaterial for this purpose that the charge may be paid to a person other than the manufacturer, producer, or importer, or that it may be separately billed to the purchaser as a charge earmarked for expenses incurred or to be incurred in his behalf, such as charges for demonstration or display of the article, for sales promotion programs, or otherwise. With respect to the rules relating to exclusion of charges for local advertising of a manufacturer's products, see section 4216(e) of the Code and § 53.100. In the case of sales on credit, a carrying, finance, or service charge is excludable from the sale price if it is reasonably related to the costs of carrying the deferred portion of the sale price (such as interest on the deferred portion of the sale price, expenses of bookkeeping necessary to keep the records of such sales, and expenses of correspondence and other communication in connection with collection).
(b)
Tools and dies.
Separate charges for tools and dies used in the manufacture or production of a taxable article are to be included, in whole or in part, in the sale price on which the tax is based. It is immaterial whether the charges for such items are billed in a lump sum or are amortized or allocated to each of the taxable articles. If, at the termination of a contract to manufacture taxable articles, the tools and dies used in production pass to the purchaser, only the amount of depreciation of the tools and dies incurred in production, computed on a “production output” basis, should be included in
the sale price. If the purchaser furnishes the tools and dies, the amount of the cost thereof, to the extent that such cost has been depreciated in the production of the taxable articles (computed on a “production output” basis), shall be included in determining the sale price of the articles for purposes of computing the tax.
(c)
Charges for warranty.
A charge for a warranty of an article which the manufacturer, producer, or importer requires the purchaser to pay in order to obtain the article shall be included in the sale price of the article on which the tax is computed. On the other hand, a charge for a warranty of a taxable article paid at the purchaser's option shall not be included in the sale price for purposes of computing tax thereon.
(d)
Charges for coverings, containers, and packing.
Any charge by the manufacturer, producer, or importer for coverings and containers of whatever nature used to pack an article for shipment shall be included as part of the sale price for the purpose of computing the tax, whether or not the charges are identified as such on the invoice or are billed separately. Even though there is an agreement that the manufacturer, producer, or importer will repay all or a portion of the charge for the coverings or containers upon the return thereof, the full charge nevertheless shall be included in the sale price. It is immaterial whether the charge made at the time of sale is more or less than the actual value of the covering or container. See § 53.173(b)(4) for provisions relating to the claiming of a credit or refund in the case of a price readjustment due to the return or repossession of a covering or container. Packing charges are to be included in the sale price whether the charges cover normal packing or special packing services, such as for extra protection of the article or for odd-lot quantities. This rule shall apply whether the packing services are initiated by the manufacturer, producer, or importer or are furnished at the request of the purchaser and whether the packing is performed by the manufacturer, producer, or importer or by another person at his request. If the purchaser supplies packing materials, the fair market value of such materials must be included in the tax base when computing tax liability on the sale of the article.
(e)
Taxable and nontaxable articles sold as a unit.
Where a taxable article and a nontaxable article are sold by the manufacturer as a unit, the tax attaches to that portion of the manufacturer's sale price of the unit which is properly allocable to the taxable article. Normally, the taxable portion of such a unit may be determined by applying to the manufacturer's sale price of the unit the ratio which the manufacturer's separate sale price of the taxable article bears to the sum of the sale prices of both the taxable and nontaxable articles, if such articles are sold separately by the manufacturer. Where the articles (or either one of them) are not sold separately by the manufacturer and do not have established sale prices, the taxable portion is to be determined from a comparison of the actual costs of the articles to the manufacturer. Thus, if the cost of the taxable article represents four-fifths of the total cost of the complete unit, the tax applies to four-fifths of the price charged by the manufacturer for the unit.
[T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991, as amended by T.D. ATF-312, 56 FR 31083, July 9, 1991]
§ 53.92
Exclusions from sale price.
(a)
Tax
—(1)
Tax not part of taxable sale price.
The tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of an article is not part of the taxable sale price of the article. Thus, if a manufacturer computes the tax on a sale price which is determined without regard to the tax, and it charges the proper tax as a separate item, the amount of tax so charged does not become a part of the taxable sale price and no tax is due on the tax so charged. Where no separate charge is made as tax, it will be presumed that the price charged to the purchaser for the article includes the proper tax, and the proper percentage of such price will be allocated to the tax.
(2)
Computation of tax.
If an article subject to tax at the rate of 10 percent is sold for $100 and an additional item of $10 is billed as tax, $100 is the taxable selling price and $10 is the amount
of tax due thereon. However, if the article is sold for $100 with no separate billing or indication of the amount of the tax, it will be presumed that the tax is included in the $100, and a computation will be necessary to determine what portion of the total amount represents the sale price of the article and what portion represents the tax. The computation is as follows:
ER25SE06.035
Thus, if the tax rate is 10 percent and the sale price including tax is $100, the taxable sale price is $90.91 (that is, $100 divided by (100+10)), and the tax is 10 percent of $90.91, or $9.09.
(b)
Transportation, delivery, insurance, or installation charges
—(1)
Charges incurred pursuant to sale.
Charges for transportation, delivery, insurance, installation, and other expenses actually incurred in connection with the delivery of an article to a purchaser pursuant to a bona fide sale shall be excluded from the sale price in computing the tax. Such charges include all items of transportation, delivery, insurance, installation, and similar expense incurred after shipment to a customer begins, in response to the customer's order, pursuant to a bona fide sale. However, costs of such nature incurred by a manufacturer, producer, or importer in transporting, in the normal course of business and for its benefit and convenience, articles from a factory or port of entry to a warehouse or other facility (regardless of the location of such warehouse or facility) are not considered as being incurred in connection with the delivery of an article to a purchaser pursuant to a bona fide sale, and charges therefor cannot be excluded from the sale price in computing tax liability. Similarly, an allowance granted by a manufacturer as reimbursement for expenses incurred by the purchaser in shipping used articles to the manufacturer for credit against the purchase price of taxable articles shall not be excluded from the sale price when computing tax due on the sale of the taxable articles. In any event, no charge may be excluded from the sale price unless the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are complied with. Said conditions are prescribed under the authority granted the Secretary in section 4216(a) of the Code.
(2)
Only actual expenses to be excluded.
Where a separate charge is made for transportation or other expenses incurred in connection with the delivery of an article to the purchaser pursuant to a bona fide sale, there shall be excluded in arriving at the sale price subject to tax only that portion of the charge which represents the actual expenses incurred for the transportation or other excludable expenses. Where a separate charge is less than the actual expense, the difference is presumed to be included in the billed price. Such difference, together with the separate charge, shall be excluded in arriving at the sale price on which the tax is computed. Similarly, where no separate charge is made but the manufacturer, producer, or importer incurs an expense of the type to which this paragraph has application, the amount of such expense actually incurred shall be excluded from the sale price on which the tax is computed. Where transportation expense is incurred in conjunction with a shipment composed of both taxable and nontaxable articles, only the portion of the expense allocable to the taxable articles shall be excludable. In general, unless the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that another method reasonably apportions such freight expense between taxable and nontaxable articles, such expense should be apportioned on the basis of the relative weights (or, if available, the relative published tariff rates) applicable to the taxable and nontaxable articles. Where it is not feasible to apportion such expense on the basis of
relative weights or tariff rates, the expense shall be apportioned on another reasonable basis; for example, in the case of a shipment including both taxable and nontaxable articles which are subject to the same tariff rate, it may be appropriate to apportion the transportation expense on the basis of the relative sale prices. A charge for insurance in connection with the delivery of an article to a purchaser is considered to represent an expense actually incurred only to the extent that an amount equivalent to such charge is paid or payable by the manufacturer to a person authorized to assume such insurance risk.
(3)
Transportation, delivery, or installation services performed by manufacturer.
For purposes of computing the taxable sale price of articles, it is immaterial whether the transportation, delivery, or other services of the type to which this paragraph has application are performed by a common carrier or independent agency for or on behalf of the manufacturer, producer, or importer, or are performed by the manufacturer, producer, or importer with the use of its own vehicles or other facilities. Thus, where a manufacturer, producer, or importer performs the transportation, delivery, or other services with its equipment, tools, employees, etc., the cost of such services allocable to the sale of the taxable article shall be excluded. In determining whether an expense is an excludable transportation or delivery expense, only those expenses incurred by reason of the fact that the purchaser accepts delivery at some point other than the manufacturer's place of business shall be considered excludable transportation or delivery expenses. All expenses incurred in placing an article packed, ready for shipment on the loading dock at the manufacturer's factory are not excludable transportation or delivery expenses. An allowance granted by the manufacturer, producer, or importer to the purchaser for transportation, delivery, or other expenses incurred or to be incurred by the purchaser in connection with the sale shall be excluded in computing the taxable sale price, if charges for similar expenses would be excludable if incurred by the manufacturer.
(4)
Records in support of exclusion.
Every manufacturer, producer, or importer making sales of taxable articles shall keep records which will disclose the amount of transportation, delivery, insurance, installation or other expense actually incurred by it in connection with the delivery of a taxable article to a purchaser pursuant to a bona fide sale.
(c)
Other charges.
A charge or expense not within the scope of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, whether or not separately stated, may not be excluded in computing the taxable sale price unless it can be shown by adequate records that the charge or expense is not properly included as a manufacturing or selling expense or is in no way incidental to placing the article in condition packed ready for shipment. Commissions to manufacturers' agents, or allowances, payments, or adjustments made to, and for the benefit of, persons other than the purchaser may not be excluded or deducted, under any condition, in computing the sale price upon which the tax is computed.
§ 53.93
Other items relating to tax on sale price.
(a)
Exchanges.
If, in connection with the sale of an article subject to a tax imposed under chapter 32 of the Code on the price for which sold, a manufacturer receives from its vendee another article in exchange, the tax on the manufacturer's sale shall be computed on the basis of the amount allowed for the article received from the vendee, plus any additional amount charged the vendee.
(b)
Replacements under warranty.
If an article, subject to a tax imposed under chapter 32 of the Code on the price for which sold, is returned to the manufacturer by reason of the failure of the article under a warranty as to its quality or service, and a new article is given by the manufacturer, free, or at a reduced price, the tax on the new article shall be computed on the actual amount, if any, to be paid to the manufacturer for the new article. See § 53.174(b) for the circumstances under which the allowance made by the manufacturer, producer, or importer upon the return of the first article constitutes a price readjustment of the sale price of the first
article and the extent, if any, to which a credit may be allowed, or refund made, of the tax paid by the manufacturer, producer, or importer on the sale of the first article.
(c)
Readjustments in sale price.
Readjustment in sale price (such as allowable discounts, rebates, bonuses, etc.) cannot be anticipated. The tax must be based upon the original price unless the readjustments have actually been made prior to the close of the period for which the tax upon the sale is returned. However, if the price upon which the tax was computed is subsequently readjusted, credit may be taken against the tax due on a subsequent return or a claim for refund filed as provided by section 6416(b)(1) of the Code and §§ 53.174-53.176.
[T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991, as amended by T.D. ATF-344, 58 FR 40354, July 28, 1993]
§ 53.94
Constructive sale price; scope and application.
(a)
In general.
Section 4216(b) of the Code pertains to those taxes imposed under chapter 32 of the Code that are based on the price for which an article is sold, and contains the provisions for constructing a tax base other than the actual sale price of the article, under certain defined conditions.
(b)
Specific applications.
(1) Section 4216(b)(1) of the Code applies to:
(i) Arm's-length sales at retail or on consignment, other than those sales at retail and to retailers to which section 4216(b)(2) of the Code and § 53.96 apply; and
(ii) Sales otherwise than at arm's length, and at less than fair market price.
(2) Section 4216(b)(2) of the Code applies generally to arm's-length sales of an article at retail or to retailers, or both, where the manufacturer also sells the same article to wholesale distributors.
(3) Section 4216(b)(3) of the Code provides a formula for determining a constructive sale price for sales of taxable articles between members of an affiliated group of corporations (as “affiliated group” is defined in section 1504(a) of the Code) in those instances where the purchasing corporation regularly resells to retailers but does not regularly resell to wholesale distributors, and except for situations where section 4216(b)(4) of the Code applies.
(4) Section 4216(b)(4) of the Code provides a special method for computing a constructive sale price for sales of taxable articles between affiliated corporations where the purchasing corporation sells only to retailers, and the normal method of selling within the industry is for manufacturers to sell to wholesale distributors.
(c)
Definitions.
For purposes of section 4216(b) of the Code and §§ 53.94-53.97 and unless otherwise indicated:
(1)
Sale at retail.
A “sale at retail,” or a “retail sale”, is a sale of an article to a purchaser who intends to use or lease the article rather than resell it. The fact that articles are sold in wholesale lots, or at wholesale prices, will not change the character of such sales as “sales at retail” if the purchaser is not engaged in the business of reselling such articles, and acquires them for the purpose of using them rather than reselling them.
(2)
Retail dealers.
A “retail dealer”, or “retailer”, is a person engaged in the business of selling articles at retail.
(3)
Wholesale distributor.
The term “wholesale distributor” means a person engaged in the business of selling articles to persons engaged in the business of reselling such articles.
§ 53.95
Constructive sale price; basic rules.
(a)
In general.
Section 4216(b)(1) of the Code sets forth the conditions that require the Secretary to construct a sale price on which to compute a tax imposed under chapter 32 of the Code on the price for which an article is sold. The section requires a constructive sale price to be established where a taxable article is:
(1) Sold at retail;
(2) Sold while on consignment; or,
(3) Sold otherwise than through an arm's-length transaction at less than fair market price.
(b)
Sales at retail.
Section 4216(b)(1)(A) of the Code relates to the determination of a constructive sale price for sales of taxable articles sold at arm's-length and at retail. In the case of such sales, the constructive sale price is the highest price for which such articles
are sold to wholesale distributors, in the ordinary course of trade, by manufacturers or producers thereof, as determined by the Secretary. If the constructive sale price is less than the actual sale price, the constructive sale price shall be used as the tax base. If the constructive sale price is not less than the actual sale price, the actual sale price shall be considered as not less than fair market, and shall be used as the tax base. In determining the highest price for which articles are sold by manufacturers to wholesale distributors, there must be taken into consideration the normal industry practices with respect to inclusions and exclusions under section 4216(a) of the Code. However, once a constructive sale price has been determined by the Secretary, no further adjustment of such price shall be made. The provisions of section 4216(b)(1)(A) of the Code and this paragraph shall not apply in those instances where the provisions of section 4216(b)(2) of the Code and § 53.96 apply.
(c)
Sales on consignment.
As in the case of sales at retail, the constructive sale price for sales on consignment shall be the price for which such articles are sold, in the ordinary course for trade, by manufacturers or producers thereof, as determined by the Secretary. For purposes of section 4216(b)(1)(B) of the Code and this paragraph, an article is considered to be sold on consignment if it is sold while it is on consignment to a person which has the right to sell, and does sell, such article in its own name, but never receives title to the article from the manufacturer. Ordinarily, the constructive sale price of an article sold on consignment is the net price received by the manufacturer from the consignee. The provisions of section 4216(b)(1)(B) of the Code and this paragraph shall not apply if the provisions of section 4216(b)(2) of the Code and § 53.96 apply.
(d)
Sales not at arm's-length.
For purposes of section 4216(b)(1)(C) of the Code and this paragraph, a sale is considered to be made under circumstances otherwise than at “arm's-length” if:
(1) One of the parties is controlled (in law or in fact) by the other, or there is common control, whether or not such control is actually exercised to influence the sale price, or
(2) The sale is made pursuant to special arrangements between a manufacturer and a purchaser.
In case of an article sold otherwise than at arm's-length, and at less than fair market price, the constructive sale price shall be the price for which such articles are sold, in the ordinary course of trade, by manufacturers or producers thereof, as determined by the Secretary. Once such a constructive sale price has been determined, no further adjustment of such price shall be made. See sections 4216(b) (3) and (4) of the Code, and § 53.97, for specific methods for determining constructive sale prices for intercompany sales under certain defined conditions.
§ 53.96
Constructive sale price; special rule for arm's-length sales.
(a)
In general.
Section 4216(b)(2) of the Code provides a special rule under which a manufacturer shall determine a constructive sale price for this sale of taxable articles at retail, and to retail dealers, under certain conditions. The rule is applicable where:
(1) The manufacturer regularly sells such articles at retail, or to retailers, or both, as the case may be,
(2) The manufacturer also regularly sells such articles to one or more wholesale distributors in arm's-length transactions, and the manufacturer establishes that its prices in such cases are determined without regard to any benefit to be derived under section 4216(b)(2) of the Code, and
(3) The transactions are arm's-length transactions.
(4) A manufacturer meeting the foregoing requirements shall base its tax liability for sales at retail and sales to retailers on the lower of its actual sale price or the highest price for which it sells the same articles under the same conditions to wholesale distributors.
(b)
Definitions.
For purposes of section 4216(b)(2) of the Code and this section:
(1)
Actual sale price.
“Actual sale price” means the actual selling price for an article determined in the same manner as sale price is determined for a taxable sale. Accordingly, such price
must reflect the inclusions and exclusions set forth in sections 4216(a) and (e) of the Code, and any price adjustments described in section 6416(b)(1) of the Code.
(2)
Highest price to wholesale distributors.
The “highest price” charged wholesale distributors for an article by a manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof, is the highest price at which the manufacturer, producer, or importer sells the article to wholesale distributors, determined without regard to quantity. Such price shall be determined in the same manner as sale price is determined for a taxable sale with respect to the inclusions and exclusions under sections 4216(a) and (e) of the Code; however, since the price is to be a “highest” price, no further adjustment may be made for price readjustments under section 6416(b)(1) of the Code.
(3)
Regular sales.
An article is considered to be sold “regularly” at retail or to retailers if sales are made at retail or to retailers periodically and recurringly as a regular part of the seller's business. If a seller makes only isolated or casual sales of an article at retail or to retailers, it is not considered to be selling “regularly” at retail or to retailers. Similarly, a manufacturer is considered to be making regular sales of an article to one or more distributors if it sells the article to at least one distributor periodically and recurringly as a regular part of its business.
(4)
Normal method of sales in industry.
In the absence of a showing to the appropriate TTB officer of a more appropriate manner of determining the normal method of sales within an industry which is practical in application, the normal method of sales within an industry shall be regarded as not being at retail or to retailers, or both, if the industry dollar volume of sales which are at retail or to retailers, or both, is less than half the total industry dollar volume of sales at all levels of distribution by manufacturers, producers, or importers, including sales to other manufacturers, producers, or importers.
[T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991, as amended by T.D. ATF-312, 56 FR 31083, July 9, 1991; T.D. TTB-91, 76 FR 5481, Feb. 1, 2011]
§ 53.97
Constructive sale price; affiliated corporations.
(a)
In general.
Sections 4216(b) (3) and (4) of the Code establish procedures for determining a constructive sale price under section 4216(b)(1)(C) of the Code for sales between corporations that are members of the same “affiliated group”, as that term is defined in section 1504(a) of the Code.
(b)
Sales to which section 4216(b)(3) of the Code applies.
Section 4216(b)(3) of the Code provides a procedure for determining a constructive sale price under section 4216(b)(1)(C) of the Code in those instances where:
(1) A manufacturer, producer or importer regularly sells a taxable article to a wholesale distributor which is a member of the same affiliated group as the manufacturer, producers or importer, and
(2) The wholesale distributor regularly sells such article to one or more independent retailers, but does not regularly sell to wholesale distributors. Under such circumstances the constructive sale price for the article shall be an amount equal to 90 percent of the lowest price for which the distributor regularly sells the article in arm's-length transactions to such independent retailers. Once the constructive sale price has been determined, no adjustment shall be made for inclusions or exclusions under section 4216(a) of the Code or price readjustments under section 6416(b)(1) of the Code. If both sections 4216(b)(3) and 4216(b)(4) of the Code apply with respect to the sale of an article, the constructive sale price for such article shall be the lower of the prices computed under sections 4216(b)(3) and 4216(b)(4).
(c)
Sales to which section 4216(b)(4) of the Code applies.
Section 4216(b)(4) of the Code provides a procedure for determining a constructive sale price under section 4216(b)(1)(C) of the Code in those instance where:
(1) A manufacturer, producer, or importer regularly sells (except for tax-free sales) a taxable article only to a wholesale distributor which is a member of the same affiliated group as the manufacturer, producer, or importer,
(2) The distributor regularly sells (except for tax-free sales) such article only to retail dealers, and
(3) The normal method of sales for such articles within the industry is to sell such articles in arm's-length transactions to wholesale distributors.
(4) Under section 4216(b)(4) of the Code, the constructive sale price of such article shall be the median price at which the distributor, at the time of the sale by the manufacturer, resells the article to retail dealers, reduced by a percentage of such price equal to the percentage which:
(i) The difference between the median price for which comparable articles are sold to wholesale distributors, in the ordinary course of trade, by manufacturers of producers thereof, and the median price at which such wholesale distributors in arm's-length transactions sell such comparable articles to retailers, is of
(ii) The median price at which such wholesale distributors in arm's-length transactions sell such comparable articles to retailers.
(iii) For purposes of this paragraph, the “median price” for which an article is sold at a particular level of distribution is the price midway between the highest and lowest prices charged vendees at the particular level of distribution. Where only one price is charged at a level of distribution, “median price” is equivalent to “actual price”. All sale prices referred to in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section are prices that must reflect the inclusions and exclusions set forth in section 4216(a) of the Code. However, once a constructive sale price has been determined under these paragraphs, no further adjustment of such price is allowed.
(d)
Application of section 4216(b)(4) of the Code.
The application of section 4216(b)(4) of the Code and paragraph (c) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
M, a corporation engaged in the manufacture of article X, sold 100 of such articles at $10.00 per article to a wholesale distributor N, a corporation engaged in the business of selling X articles to independent retail dealers. N is a member of the same affiliated group of corporations as M. M sells X articles only to N. The normal method of manufacturers' sales of X articles in the industry is to sell to independent wholesale distributors. N corporation sells X articles to retailers for $15.00 each. The price for which comparable X articles are sold to wholesale distributors in the ordinary course of trade by manufacturers thereof is $12.00 per article. Wholesale distributors sell X articles to retailers in the ordinary course of trade for $16.00 per article. Under the foregoing facts the constructive sale price determined under section 4216(b)(4) of the Code and this paragraph is $11.25, computed as follows:
EC05OC91.020
(e)
Determination of “lowest price”.
In addition to other considerations, in determining a “lowest price” for purposes of sections 4216(b) (1) and (3) of the Code and § 53.97, such price shall be determined:
(1) Without requiring that a given percentage of sales be made at that price (provided that the volume of sales made at that price is great enough to indicate that those sales have not been engaged in primarily to establish a lower tax base), and
(2) Without including any charge for a fixed amount that the purchaser has an unconditional right to recover on the basis of a contractual arrangement existing at the time of sale.
(f)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section and paragraphs (3) and (4) of section 4216(b) of the Code, the term “regularly sells” has the same meaning as that accorded the term “regular sales” in § 53.96(b)(3), and the term “normal method of sales in the industry” has the same meaning as accorded that term in § 53.96(b)(4).
[T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991, as amended by T.D. ATF-312, 56 FR 31083, July 9, 1991]
§ 53.98
Computation of tax on leases and installment sales.
(a)
Leases.
When a taxable article is leased by a manufacturer, producer, or importer, liability for tax is incurred, except as provided by section 4217(b) of the Code and § 53.104, on each payment made with respect to such lease. Tax is payable on each lease payment as long as the article is leased by the manufacturer, producer, or importer. The tax payable with respect to each lease payment is a percentage of each payment
based on the rate of tax, if any, in effect on the date the lease payment is due. If the article is subsequently sold by the manufacturer, producer, or importer, the tax applies also to such sale, without regard to the tax paid when the article was leased. For definition of the term “lease”, see § 53.103.
(b)
Installment sales.
When a taxable article is sold under an installment payment contract with title reserved in the seller, or under a conditional sale contract, chattel mortgage arrangement or other arrangement creating a security interest with payments to be made in installments, tax shall be computed and paid on each payment made by the purchaser. The tax payable with each payment is a percentage of each payment based on the rate of tax, if any, in effect on the date the payment is due. The part of each payment that is subject to tax is that portion of the payment equal to the percentage of the total portion of the payment equal to the percentage of the total charge for the article that is subject to tax. For example, if the total charge for the article is $1,000, and of the total amount charged only 90 percent thereof, or $900, is subject to tax by reason of exclusions, then only 90 percent of the installment payment is subject to tax. If the tax base is a constructive sale price computed under section 4216(b) of the Code that is less than the actual sale price of the article, the portion of each payment subject to tax is the percentage of such payment equal to the percentage that the constructive sale price bears to the actual sale price. For example, if an article is sold at retail for $100, and the constructive sale price for such an article computed under the provisions of section 4216(b)(1)(A) of the Code is $75, the percentage which the constructive sale price bears to the actual sale price is 75 percent. Accordingly, only 75 percent of each installment payment is subject to tax.
(c)
Sales on credit.
Where articles are sold on credit under conditions other than those specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the entire tax shall be reported and paid with the return covering the period in which the sale is made, even though the price may not be paid to the manufacturer, producer, or importer until a later date, or not paid at all.
§ 53.99
Sales of installment accounts.
(a)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, in case of a sale or other disposition by a manufacturer, producer, or importer of an installment account of the type specified in section 4216(c) of the Code, the tax shall not apply to subsequent installment payments on such account. Instead, there shall be paid an amount equal to the difference between the tax previously paid on such installment account and the total tax computed by applying:
(1) To each installment due before the sale of the installment account, the rate of tax applicable at the time payment thereof was due, and
(2) To each installment, the time for payment of which has not arrived, the rate of tax which, under the provisions of chapter 32 of the Code as in effect on the date of the sale of the installment account, is (or is to be) in effect on the date such installment is due. However, see paragraph (b) of this section if the sale is made in a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding. The tax due under this paragraph shall be included in the return for the period in which the account is sold.
(b)
Sale in bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding.
In the case of a sale of an installment account of a manufacturer, producer, or importer pursuant to the order of, or subject to the approval of, a court of competent jurisdiction in a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, the amount of tax due shall be computed and paid as provided in paragraph (a) of this section but shall not exceed the amount of tax computed by multiplying:
(1) The proportionate share of the amount for which such accounts are sold which is allocable to each unpaid installment payment, by
(2) The rate of tax which, under the provisions of chapter 32 of the Code as in effect on the date of the sale of the installment account, is (or is to be) in effect on the date such payment is due.
(c)
Collection of installment accounts on behalf of the manufacturer.
Where a manufacturer, producer, or importer retains title to an installment account
but turns it over to another person for collection on a fee basis, no sale of such account (or other disposition as contemplated in section 4216(d) of the Code) has been made. The tax shall continue to be paid as provided by section 4216(c) of the Code.
(d)
Returned installment accounts.
Where an installment account which has been sold or otherwise disposed of is returned to the manufacturer, producer, or importer who sold it under an agreement under which the account was sold, and credit or refund has been allowed under section 6416(b)(5) of the Code and § 53.183, the manufacturer, producer, or importer shall pay tax as provided by section 4216(c) of the Code and § 53.98 on any subsequent payments made on such returned installment account until such time as there shall have been paid the total tax liability with respect to the account as computed under paragraph (a) of this section.
(e)
Limitation.
The sum of the amounts payable under this section and § 53.98 or an installment account shall not exceed the total amount of tax which would be payable if such installment account had not been sold or otherwise disposed of (computed as provided in subsection (c)).
§ 53.100
Exclusion of local advertising charges from sale price.
(a)
In general.
Section 4216(e) of the Code deals with the treatment to be accorded charges made by a manufacturer for, and reimbursements by a manufacturer or expenditures in connection with the advertising of certain articles subject to excise tax under chapter 32 of the Code. Section 4216(e) of the Code provides an exclusion (which is in addition to the exclusions provided by section 4216(a) of the Code and § 53.92) in respect of charges for local advertising, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, for purposes of determining the price for which an article is sold. See paragraph (c) of this section. The exclusion provided by section 4216(e) of the Code and paragraph (c) of this section has application only if the advertising is broadcast over a radio or television station, appears in a newspaper or magazine, or is displayed by means of an outdoor advertising sign or poster. Section 4216(e) of the Code also provides an overall limitation in respect of the sum of the amount of the exclusions from price as charges for local advertising and the amount of the readjustments authorized under section 6416(b)(1) of the Code (relating to credits or refunds for price readjustments) in respect of reimbursements by a manufacturer of expenditures for local advertising. See § 53.101. For provisions prohibiting exclusion from price or readjustment of price in respect of charges for, and reimbursements of expenditures for, advertising other than local advertising, see § 53.102.
(b)
Definition of local advertising
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of the regulations under sections 4216(e) and 6416(b)(1) of the Code (§§ 53.100-53.102 and 53.173-53.176), the term “local advertising” means advertising which relates to an article with respect to which tax is imposed under chapter 32 of the Code on the price for which sold and which:
(i) Is initiated or obtained by the purchaser or any subsequent vendee,
(ii) Names the article for which the price is determinable under section 4216 and states the location at which such article may be purchased at retail, and
(iii) Is broadcast over a radio station or television station, appears in a newspaper or magazine, or is displayed by means of an outdoor advertising sign or poster.
(2)
Initiating or obtaining advertising.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the advertising must be initiated or obtained by one or more of the persons in the chain of distribution of the article (wholesale distributor, jobber, dealer, etc.) who purchased the article for resale. For purposes of this subparagraph, the manufacturer is not considered to be one of the persons in the chain of distribution of the article. In general, advertising of an article is considered to be initiated or obtained by one or more persons in the chain of distribution of the article if any such person:
(i) Takes an active part in the actual planning and development, or in the arrangements or negotiations leading to the development, of the form and content of the advertising, or
(ii) Contracts for the placement of the advertising.
The participation by the manufacturer of the article in the planning, development, or placement of the advertising is immaterial provided the advertising is in fact initiated or obtained by one or more persons in the chain of distribution of the article. Furthermore, it is immaterial whether or not the advertising is subject to the approval of the manufacturer of the article. However, if no person in the chain of distribution of the article takes an active part in the actual planning and development, or in the arrangements or negotiations leading to the development, of the form and content of the advertising, but, rather, all such planning, development, arrangements, and negotiations are accomplished by the manufacturer of the article, then such manufacturer is considered to have initiated the advertising, and if he also contracts for the placement of the advertising, such advertising does not qualify as “local advertising”.
(3)
Identification of article and sales location.
To meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the advertising must identify the article for which the price is determinable under section 4216 of the Code and give the location or locations at which the article may be purchased at retail. All products taxable at the same rate under the same section of chapter 32 of the Code shall be considered to be an “article” for purposes of the preceding sentence. No specific method or means of identification is prescribed. The identification of the article may be made through the use of the name of the manufacturer or the use of an established trade-mark, such as a seal, picture, letter or letters, etc., or a combination thereof. The advertising must identify the particular retail establishment or establishments at which the article may be purchased at retail but need not specify the location of any such establishment in terms of the number by which the premises are designated or the name of the street on which the retail premises are situated. However, the location of the retail premises must be described sufficiently, as, for example, by reference to a particular named shopping area or shopping center, to enable customers to find the retail establishment.
(4)
Determination of costs of local advertising.
Where an advertisement identifies more than one article, and all such articles are not taxable, or are not taxable at the same rate under the same section of chapter 32 of the Code, a reasonable allocation of the cost of the advertisement must be made among:
(i) Articles taxable at the same rate under the same section of the Code, and
(ii) Articles which are not taxable under chapter 32 of the Code.
For example, in the case of a single page newspaper or magazine advertisement, an allocation of costs reflecting the lineage or space devoted to the specified categories will be considered to reflect a reasonable allocation of the cost of advertising the different articles. As a general rule, only the cost of the “spot” portion identifying the retail establishment is considered “local advertising” in the case of national television or radio programs.
(5)
Meaning of “newspaper”.
The term
newspaper,
as used in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, is limited to those publications which are commonly understood to be newspapers and which are printed and distributed periodically at daily, weekly, or other short intervals for the dissemination of news of a general character and of a general interest. The term does not include handbills, circulars, flyers, or the like, unless printed and distributed as a part of a publication which constitutes a newspaper within the meaning of this subparagraph. Neither does the term include any publication which is issued to supply information on certain subjects of interest to particular groups unless such publication otherwise qualifies as a newspaper within the meaning of this subparagraph. For purposes of this subparagraph, advertising is not considered to be news of a general character and of a general interest.
(6)
Meaning of “magazine”.
The term
magazine,
as used in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, is limited to those publications which are:
(i) Commonly understood to be magazines,
(ii) Printed and distributed periodically at least twice a year, and
(iii) Published for the dissemination of information of a general nature or of special interest to particular groups.
(iv) The term does not include handbills, circulars, flyers or the like, unless printed and distributed as a part of a publication which constitutes a magazine within the meaning of this subparagraph. For purposes of this subparagraph, advertising is not considered to be information of a general nature or information of special interest to particular groups within the contemplation of paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section.
(7)
Meaning of “outdoor advertising sign or poster”.
The term “outdoor advertising sign or poster”, as used in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, means a sign or poster displaying advertising matter, which is located outside of a roofed enclosure. This term includes both signs or posters on billboards, whether placed on or affixed to land, buildings, or other structures, and those which are displayed on or attached to moving objects, provided the signs or posters are located outside of a roofed enclosure. The term “roofed enclosure” means a roof structure which is enclosed on more than one-half of its sides by walls, fences, or other barriers.
(c)
Exclusion
—(1)
Conditions and limitations.
A charge for local advertising which is required by a manufacturer to be paid as a condition to his sale of an article is not a part of the taxable price of the article, to the extent that such charge meets each of the following conditions and limitations:
(i) Such charge does not exceed 5 percent of the difference between:
(A) An amount which would constitute the taxable price of the article (computed at the time of the sale of the article) if no part of any charge for local advertising were excludable in computing taxable price, and
(B) The amount of any separate charge for local advertising, whatever the amount of such charge may be,
(ii) Such charge is specifically shown as a separate charge for local advertising on the invoice or statement covering the sale of the article.
(iii) Such charge is billed by the manufacturer with the intention on his part of repaying the amount of the charge to the person purchasing the article from him, or to any person who subsequently purchases the article for resale, in reimbursement of costs incurred for local advertising of such article or some other article or articles taxable at the same rate under the same section of the Code. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the fact of such intention will be assumed in all cases where the manufacturer and his vendees are parties to an advertising plan which calls for such repayments, or the manufacturer can otherwise establish that the vendees to whom he bills such charges understand and expect that such repayments will be made.
(2)
When exclusion ceases to apply.
To the extent that charges for local advertising meet the conditions and limitations stated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, such charge is excludable in computing the taxable price of the article in respect of which the charge was made. However, the exclusion will cease to apply in respect of any part of such charge which the manufacturer fails to repay before May 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the article was sold, to the person who purchased the article from him, or to some other person who subsequently purchases the article for resale, in reimbursement of costs incurred for local advertising of such article or some other article or articles taxable at the same rate under the same section of the Code. If, before such May 1, any part of the charge so excluded has not been so repaid, the manufacturer becomes liable for tax on such May 1 in the same manner as if an article taxable under such section of the Code had been sold by him on such May 1 at a taxable price equivalent to that part of the charge not so repaid. However, see paragraph (b)(2) of § 53.175, relating to price readjustments in cases where local advertising charges are not repaid before such May 1 but are subsequently paid over by the manufacturer to his vendees in reimbursement of costs for local advertising. For provisions relating to the method of determining whether a payment by a manufacturer is or is not attributable to an excluded local advertising
charge, see paragraph (b)(3) of § 53.101. In any case where the payment is determined to be attributable to such a charge, the date of the sale in connection with which the charge was made shall be determined on a first-in-first-out basis in respect of the vendee to whom the charge was billed by the manufacturer.
[T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991, as amended by T.D. ATF-312, 56 FR 31083, July 9, 1991]
§ 53.101
Limitation on aggregate of exclusions and price readjustments.
(a)
In general.
The sum of the amount excluded from taxable price in respect of charges for local advertising, as provided in section 4216(e)(1) of the Code and § 53.100, plus the amount of the readjustments for which credits or refunds may be claimed in respect of local advertising, as provided in section 6416(b)(1) of the Code and § 53.175, is subject to an overall 5 percent limitation. This limitation applies to each manufacturer, as of the close of each calendar quarter, in respect of all articles taxable under the same section of chapter 32 of the Code which were sold by such manufacturer in such quarter (and the preceding quarter or quarters, if any, in the calendar year).
(b)
Computation of overall 5 percent limitation
—(1)
In general.
The limitation prescribed by section 4216(e)(2) of the Code (the “overall 5 percent limitation” referred to in paragraph (a) of this section) as to the total of the exclusions from price and readjustments of price which may be claimed for local advertising in respect of all articles taxable under the same section of Chapter 32 of the Code shall be computed as of the close of each calendar quarter of the calendar year. The overall 5 percent limitation is 5 percent of the difference between:
(i) The amount which would constitute the total taxable price (computed at the time of sale) of all articles taxable under the same section of chapter 32 of the Code sold by the manufacturer during the elapsed calendar quarters of the calendar year, if no part of any charge for local advertising were excludable in computing taxable price, and
(ii) The total of all amounts billed as separate charges for local advertising of such articles (whatever the amount of any single charge of the total of all charges).
(iii) In making the computations under paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, credits or refunds under section 6416(b) of the Code of tax paid on the sale of any such articles are to be disregarded and articles sold tax-free by the manufacturer are to be excluded. The amount by which the overall 5 percent limitation computed as of the close of a particular calendar quarter in respect of articles taxable under the same section of chapter 32 of the Code exceeds the sum of the charges for local advertising excluded in computing the taxable price and the amount of reimbursements for local advertising of such articles made during the elapsed calendar quarters of the calendar year, in respect of which credit or refund has been claimed, represents the unused portion of the overall 5 percent limitation. Such unused portion is the maximum amount of reimbursements for local advertising in respect of which credit or refund may be claimed at the close of the particular calendar quarter, subject to the applicable conditions and limitations governing the right to claim a credit or refund in respect of local advertising (see § 53.175). The unused portion of the overall 5 percent limitation as of the close of the fourth calendar quarter of a calendar year in respect of which credit or refund may not be claimed as of the close of such quarter must be disregarded in computing the overall 5 percent limitation for any subsequent calendar quarter. Moreover, the amount of any reimbursements for local advertising made by a manufacturer in a calendar year which is in excess of the amount of such reimbursements in respect of which credit or refund may be claimed, within the overall limitation, as of the close of the calendar year, may not subsequently serve as the basis for a credit or refund.
(2)
Alternative method of computation in certain cases.
If during the portion of the calendar year ending with the date as of which the overall 5 percent limitation is being computed the amount of the local advertising charge separately
billed by the manufacturer has not, in respect of any sale of any articles taxable under the same section of chapter 32 of the Code, exceeded the amount excludable pursuant to § 53.100 in computing taxable price, the overall 5 percent limitation as of the close of a particular calendar quarter in respect of articles taxable under such section is 5 percent of the total taxable price (computed at the time of the sale) of all such articles sold taxpaid during the calendar year.
(3)
Allocation of amounts paid in reimbursement of expenditures for local advertising.
If a manufacturer makes contributions to a local advertising program in connection with which he makes excludable local advertising charges, it is necessary that reimbursements by the manufacturer for local advertising be attributed to the charges for local advertising, to the manufacturer's contributions, or allocated between them. Whether an amount paid by a manufacturer in reimbursement of expenses for local advertising is or is not a repayment of a local advertising charge which was excluded from taxable price under section 4216(e)(1) of the Code and § 53.100, shall be determined on the basis of an allocation made under the agreement between the manufacturer and his vendee (or any subsequent vendee).
(c)
Examples.
The application of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1).
During the first and second calendar quarters of the year, a manufacturer makes sales of articles taxable under section 4181 to his distributors. The total charges for such sales, exclusive of the tax, transportation charges, delivery charges, or other charges which are excludable, pursuant to section 4216(a) of the Code, in computing taxable price, are as follows:
First Quarter:
Articles taxable under Section 4181
$100,000
Local advertising charges
3,000
Total Charges
103,000
Second Quarter:
Articles taxable under Section 4181
$150,000
Local advertising charges
4,000
Total Charges
154,000
Assume further that the manufacturer contributes to the advertising plan and that the manufacturer pays $5,500 and $1,000 during the first and second calendar quarters of the year, respectively, to his distributors in reimbursement of expenses incurred by them for local advertising of the articles purchased from the manufacturer.
Computation as of close of first calendar quarter:
1. Amount which would constitute total taxable price (computed at time of sale) if no part of any charge for local advertising were excludable in computing taxable price
$103,000
2. Amounts billed as separate charges for local advertising
−3,000
3. Difference
100,000
4. Overall 5 percent limitation (5 percent of item 3)
$5,000
5. Amount excluded in computing taxable price
−3,000
6. Unused portion of limitation
2,000
7. Allocation, pursuant to agreement, of $5,500 paid to distributors:
Charges for local advertising
$3,000
Contributions by manufacturer
$2,500
Readjustment may be claimed in respect of that portion of the total amount repaid to the distributors which is allocated to the manufacturer's contribution ($2,500) to the extent that such portion does not exceed the unused portion of the overall 5 percent limitation ($2,000). Accordingly, as of the close of the first calendar quarter the manufacturer may claim credit or refund in respect of a readjustment of price in the amount of $2,000.
Computation as of close of second calendar quarter:
1. Amount which would constitute total taxable price (computed at time of sale) if no part of any charge for local advertising were excludable in computing taxable price ($103,000+$154,000)
$257,000
2. Amounts billed as separate charges for local advertising ($3,000+$4,000)
−7,000
3. Difference
250,000
4. Overall 5 percent limitation (5 percent of item 3)
$12,500
5. Amount excluded in computing taxable price ($3,000+$4,000) plus readjustment claimed at end of first calendar quarter ($2,000)
−9,000
6. Unused portion of limitation
3,500
7. Allocation, pursuant to agreement, of $6,500 ($5,500+$1,000) paid to distributors:
Charges for local advertising
$3,500
Contributions by manufacturer
$3,000
Although the total reimbursements for local advertising expenses attributable to contributions by the manufacturer ($3,000) does not exceed the unused portion of the overall 5 percent limitation ($3,500), the manufacturer, having taken, at the close of the first calendar quarter, a price readjustment in the amount of $2,000 in respect to his contributions, is entitled at the close of the second calendar quarter to claim credit or refund in respect of a price readjustment in the amount of $1,000 ($3,000−$2,000).

# Example (2).
During the first calendar quarter of the year, a manufacturer sold articles taxable under section 4181 to his distributors at a total charge of $106,000, exclusive of the tax, transportation charges, delivery charges, or other charges which are excludable, pursuant to section 4216(a) of the Code, in computing taxable price. This total charge of $106,000 was billed as follows:
Total Charge:
Articles taxable under Section 4181
$100,000
Local advertising charges
6,000
Total charges
106,000
Assume further that the manufacturer contributes to the advertising plan and that the manufacturer pays $3,000 during the first calendar quarter of the year to his distributors in reimbursement of expenses incurred by them for local advertising of the articles purchased from the manufacturer.
Computation as of close of first calendar quarter:
1. Amount which would constitute total taxable price (computed at time of sale) if no part of any charge for local advertising were excludable in computing taxable price
$106,000
2. Amounts billed as separate charges for local advertising
−6,000
d. Difference
100,000
4. Overall 5 percent limitation (5 percent of item 3)
5,000
5. Amount excluded in computing taxable price (see paragraph (c) of § 53.100
−5,000
6. Unused portion of limitation
0
7. Allocation, pursuant to agreement, of $3,000 paid to distributors:
Charges for local advertising
2,000
Contributions by manufacturer
1,000
Credit or refund may not be claimed in respect of that portion of the total amount repaid to the distributors ($3,000) which is allocated to the manufacturer's contribution ($1,000) since the amount excluded in computing taxable price is equal to the overall 5 percent limitation.
[T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991, as amended by T.D. ATF-312, 56 FR 31084, July 9, 1991]
§ 53.102
No exclusion or readjustment for other advertising charges or reimbursements.
(a)
Exclusions from price.
No exclusion in computing the taxable price of any article sold by the manufacturer may be allowed in respect of any charge for advertising if, and to the extent that, such charge:
(1) Is for advertising which does not qualify as local advertising within the meaning of section 4216(e)(4) of the Code and paragraphs (a) and (b) of § 53.100, or
(2) Does not satisfy all of the conditions and limitations stated in section 4216(e)(1) of the Code and paragraph (c) of § 53.100.
(b)
Readjustments of price.
No credit or refund under section 6416(b)(1) of the Code may be allowed in respect of any amount which was included in the taxable price of an article sold by the manufacturer and which was later paid by him to his vendee in reimbursement of costs incurred for advertising, if, and to the extent that, the amount so paid:
(1) Is for advertising which does not qualify as local advertising within the meaning of section 4216(e)(4) of the Code and paragraph (b) of § 53.100, or
(2) Is not within the limitation provided in section 4216(e)(2) of the Code, as computed in accordance with § 53.101, as of the close of the calendar
quarter in which the amount is so paid over or as of the close of any subsequent calendar quarter in the same calendar year. See, however, § 53.175, relating to redetermination of price readjustments in cases where local advertising charges excluded from taxable price in one calendar year become taxable as of May 1 of the following calendar year.

§ 53.103
Lease considered as sale.
For purposes of chapter 32 of the Code, the lease of an article by a manufacturer, producer, or importer shall be considered a sale of the article. The term
lease
means a contract or agreement, written or verbal, which gives the lessee an exclusive, continuous right to the possession or use of a particular article for a period of time. The term includes any renewal or extension of a lease or any subsequent lease of the article.
[T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991, as amended by T.D. ATF-312, 56 FR 31084, July 9, 1991; T.D. 372, 61 FR 20724, May 8, 1996]
§ 53.104
Limitation on amount of tax applicable to certain leases.
(a)
Conditions for eligibility.
Section 4217(b) of the Code provides for a limitation on the amount of tax that shall apply to the lease, any renewal, or further lease, of an article which, if sold, would be subject to tax on the basis of sale price. Such limitation on the amount of the tax applies with respect to the lease of an article only if, at the time of making the lease, the lessor is engaged in the business of selling in arm's length transactions the same type and model of article. In case of a lease to which section 4217(b) of the Code does not apply, tax shall be computed and paid as provided in section 4216(c) of the Code and paragraph (a) of § 53.98.
(b)
Lessor engaged in business of selling.
The lessor will be regarded as being engaged in the business of selling in arm's length transactions the same type and model of an article as the one being leased if it periodically and recurringly makes bona fide offers for sale of such articles in the regular course of operation of its business, which offers if accepted would constitute sales at arm's length. Whether the offers are bona fide shall be determined on the basis of the facts in each case, such as sales actually made, the nature of the advertising, sales literature, and other means used to effectuate sales. It is not necessary that the offers for sale be made to the same class of purchasers as those to whom the article is being leased.
(c)
Same type and model of article.
To qualify as the “same type and model of article”, the article offered for sale must be an unused article essentially the same in size, design, and function as the article being leased. Slight differences in appearance or accessories will not render articles dissimilar which are identical in all other respects.
(d)
Basis for tax
—(1)
Tax payable until total tax in paid.
In case of a lease of an article to which section 4217(b) of the Code applies, tax shall be paid on each lease payment in an amount computed by applying to such lease payment a percentage equal to the rate of tax in effect on the date of the lease payment. Such tax payments shall continue to be made under such lease, or any subsequent lease of the article, until the cumulative total of the tax payments equals the total tax. Lease payments made thereafter with respect to that article shall not be subject to tax. For definition of the term “total tax,” see paragraph (e) of this section.
(2)
Changes in tax rates.
If the rate of tax is increased or decreased during a lease period, the new rate shall apply to the lease payments made on and after the date of the change, but the amount of the total tax shall remain the same.
(e)
Total tax.
For purposes of this section, the term “total tax” means the amount of tax, computed at the rate in effect on the date of the first lease of the article to which section 4217(b) of the Code applies, which would be due on the constructive sale price of the article as determined under section 4216(b) of the Code and § 53.95, as if the article had been sold by a manufacturer at retail on such date.
(f)
Sale of article before total tax becomes payable.
If the lessor sells the article before the total tax has become payable, the tax payable on the sale shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
(1) The difference between:
(i) The total tax, and
(ii) The aggregate tax applicable to lease payments already received; or
(2) A tax computed, at the rate in effect on the date of the sale, on the price for which the article is sold. For purposes of (f)(2) of this section, the provisions of section 4216(b) of the Code for determining a constructive sale price shall not apply if the sale is at arm's length. If the sale is not at arm's length, the tax referred to in (f)(2) of this section shall be computed on a constructive sale price as provided in § 53.95.
(g)
Sale of article after total tax has become payable.
If the lessor sells an article after the total tax has become payable, the tax imposed under chapter 32 of the Code shall not apply to such sale.

# Use by Manufacturer or Importer Considered Sale
§ 53.111
Tax on use by manufacturer, producer, or importer.
(a)
In general.
Section 4218 of the Code imposes tax in respect of certain uses of articles by the actual manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof. This section also applies in respect of the use of articles by any other person who, pursuant to a provision of chapter 32 of the Code, is considered to be, or is treated as, the manufacturer or producer of the articles. See, for example, section 4223 of the Code relating to articles purchased tax free for use in further manufacture.
(b)
Taxable articles in general
—(1)
Application of tax.
If the manufacturer, producer, or importer of an article taxable under chapter 32 of the Code uses the article for any purpose other than that indicated in paragraph (b) (3) of this section, he shall be liable for tax with respect to the use of such article in the same manner as if the article were sold by him.
(2)
Taxable use in manufacturer of nontaxable articles
—(i)
In general.
In the case of an article to which paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies, tax attaches when the manufacturer, producer, or importer of the articles uses it as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, another article which is not taxable under chapter 32 of the Code, regardless of the disposition made of such other article. (See paragraph (c) of § 53.115 for computation of tax on such use.)
(ii)
Types of use in manufacture of nontaxable articles.
Taxable use may consist of the incorporation of a taxable article into a nontaxable article. Taxable use may also result from the combining of a taxable article (or the components thereof) with a nontaxable article (or the components of a nontaxable article) resulting in a combination end article which itself is not taxable. Although the taxable article may not be a completely separable unit, within the contemplation of the law a taxable article has been produced and incorporated in the combination end article.
(3)
Nontaxable use in manufacturer of taxable articles.
The tax on the use of an article to which paragraph (b)(1) of this section has application shall not apply if the article is used by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof as material in the manufacturer or production of, or as a component part of, another article taxable under chapter 32 of the Code to be manfactured or produced by him. It is immaterial what disposition is made of such other article.
(c)
Use after lease.
If the manufacturer, producer, or importer of a taxable article leases such article and thereafter uses the article, he incurs liability for tax on such use as provided in these regulations to the same extent as if the article were sold after being leased. See section 4217 of the Code and the regulations thereunder in this subpart for application and computation of tax in case of leased articles.
(d)
Time of application of tax.
In the case of a taxable use of an article by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof, the tax attaches at the time such use begins. If tax applies by reason of the sale of an article by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof on or in connection with his
sale of another article, the tax attaches at the time of the sale of such other article.
(e)
Exemptions because of other statutory provisions.
Tax does not apply on the use of an article by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof if under the applicable provisions of the Code the sale of the article for a similar use would not be subject to tax. Also, tax need not be paid with respect to the use of an article by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof if such use would qualify, under the provisions of section 6416(b) of the Code, for credit or refund of the tax paid.
[T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991]
§ 53.112
Business or personal use of articles.
(a)
Business use.
Section 4218 of the Code applies to the use by a person, in the operation of any business in which he is engaged, of a taxable article which has been manufactured, produced, or imported by him or his agent.
(b)
Personal use.
The tax on use of a taxable article does not attach in cases where an individual incidentially manufacturers, produces, or imports a taxable article for his personal use or causes a taxable article to be manufactured, produced, or imported for his personal use.
§ 53.113
Events subsequent to taxable use of article.
Liability for tax incurred on the use of an article is not extinguished or reduced because of any subsequent sale or lease of the article even if such sale or lease would have been exempt if the article had been so sold or leased prior to use. If a manufacturer, producer, or importer of an article incurs liability for tax on his use thereof, and thereafter sells or leases the article in a transaction which otherwise would be subject to tax, liability for tax is not incurred on such sale or lease.
[T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991, as amended by T.D. ATF-312, 56 FR 31084, July 9, 1991]
§ 53.114
Use in further manufacture.
For purposes of section 4218 and § 53.111, an article is used as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, another article, if it is incorporated in, or is a part or accessory of, the other article. In addition, an article is considered to be used as material in the manufacturer of another article if it is partly or entirely consumed in testing such other article; for example, shells or cartridges used in testing new firearms. Similarly, if an article is partly or wholly consumed in quality testing a production run of like articles, such article is also considered to have been used as material in the manufacture of another article. However, if a taxable article that has been used tax free and only partly consumed in testing is later sold, or put to a taxable use by the manufacturer, tax attaches to such sale or use. An article that is consumed in the manufacturing process other than in testing, so that it is not a physical part of the manufactured article, is not used as material in the manufacture or production of or as a component part of, such other article.
[T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991, as amended by T.D. ATF-312, 56 FR 31084, July 9, 1991]
§ 53.115
Computation of tax.
(a)
Tax based on price.
Tax liability incurred on the use of an article shall be computed on the price at which such or similar articles are sold in the ordinary course of trade by manufacturers, producers, or importers thereof and in the absence of special arrangements. For additional provisions applicable in computing the tax in the case of the use of an article by a manufacturer and producer who purchased the article free of tax under section 4221(a)(1) of the Code for use by him in further manufacture, see section 4223(b) of the Code and the regulations thereunder (§ 53.143).
(b)
Articles regularly sold by manufacturer.
If the manufacturer, producer, or importer of an article regularly sells such articles at wholesale in arm's length transactions, tax liability on his use of any such article shall be computed on his lowest established wholesale price for such articles in effect at the time of the taxable use. In establishing such price, there shall be included and excluded, as applicable, the charges and readjustments specified in
sections 4216(a) and 6416(b)(1) of the Code, as in effect at the time tax liability on the use of the article is incurred, and the regulations thereunder contained in this subpart and subpart L (§§ 53.91-53.94 and 53.173-53.176). If the manufacturer, producer, or importer of an article does not regularly sell such articles at wholesale in arm's length transactions, a constructive price on which the use tax shall be computed will be determined by the appropriate TTB officer. This price will be established after considering the selling practices and price structures of manfacturers, producers, and importers of similar articles.
(c)
Articles governed by section 4218(a) used in manufacture of nontaxable combination articles.
If the manufacturer, producer, or importer of an article to which section 4218(a) of the Code applies does not regularly sell such article separately but uses it as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, a nontaxable combination article consisting of a taxable and nontaxable article, liability for tax on his use shall be computed on the constructive price of the taxable article at the time of use. To determine the constructive price of the taxable article in such case, the combination article is considered to be composed of:
(1) Parts used exclusively in the functioning of the taxable article in the combination;
(2) Parts used exclusively in the functioning of the nontaxable article in the combination, and
(3) Parts, called common parts, which serve a dual function in connection with the parts in both paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section.
The ratio which the cost of the parts in paragraph (c)(1) of this section bears to the sum of the cost of such parts and the parts in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is applied to the lowest established wholesale price for which like combination articles are at the time of the taxable use being sold by the manufacturer or producer in the ordinary course of trade. The resulting amount is the constructive sale price for the taxable article on which tax is to be computed. The cost of the common parts is allocable to the parts in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section in the same ratio, and, therefore, need not be taken into account in the computation since the inclusion and allocation of the cost of such parts in the determination would not result in a different ratio. In determining the lowest establishment wholesale price for the combination article, there shall be included and excluded, as applicable, the charges and readjustments specified in sections 4216(a) and 6416(b)(1) of the Code, as in effect at the time tax liability on the use of the taxable article is incurred, and the regulations thereunder contained in this subpart and subpart L of this part (§§ 53.91-53.94 and §§ 53.173-53.176). The tax applicable to the use of the article for which a constructive sale price has been computed is not affected by any charges or readjustments of the price for which the nontaxable combination article is sold, whether by reason of the return or repossession of the nontaxable article or its covering or container, or by a bona fide discount, rebate, allowance, or other factor.
[T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991, as amended by T.D. ATF-312, 56 FR 31084, July 9, 1991]

# Application of Tax in Case of Sales by Other Than Manufacturer or Importer
§ 53.121
Sales of taxable articles by a person other than the manufacturer, producer, or importer.
(a)
General rule.
If the title to, or ownership of, an article taxable under chapter 32 of the Code is transferred from the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof, and, under the law, no tax attaches to such transfer, the subsequent sale, lease, or use of such article by the transferee is subject to tax to the same extent and manner as if such transferee were the manufacturer, producer, or importer of the article. The following examples illustrate this rule:
(1) The surviving spouse, child or children, executors or administrators, or other legal representatives, as the case may be, of a deceased manufacturer, producer, or importer of taxable articles, incur liability for tax on all such articles sold by them.
(2) A receiver or trustee in bankruptcy who under a court order conducts or liquidates the business of a manufacturer, producer, or importer of taxable articles, incurs liability for tax on all taxable articles sold by him, regardless of whether the articles were manufactured, produced, or imported before or after he took charge of the business.
(3) An assignee for the benefit of creditors of a manufacturer, producer, or importer incurs liability for tax with respect to all taxable articles sold by him as such assignee.
(4) If one or more member of a partnership withdraw, or if new partners are admitted, the new partnership so constituted incurs liability for tax on all taxable articles sold by it regardless of when such articles were manufactured, produced, or imported.
(5) A person who acquires title to taxable articles as a result of default of the manufacturer, producer, or importer pursuant to an agreement under the terms of which the articles were pledged as collateral incurs liability for tax with respect to his sale of the articles so acquired.
(6) A person who succeeds to the business of a manufacturer, producer, or importer of taxable articles, such as:
(i) A corporation which results from a consolidation, merger, or reorganization;
(ii) A corporation which acquires the business of an individual or partnership; or
(iii) A stockholder in a corporation who, after its dissolution, continues the business;
incurs liability for the tax on all taxable articles sold by such person. However, where a manufacturer, producer, or importer sells only his assets, rather than ownership of his business, he incurs liability for tax on the sale of any taxable articles included in such assets.
(b)
Transfer of title to damaged articles.
If title to a damaged taxable article is transferred by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof to a carrier or insurance company in adjustment of a damage claim, such transfer is not considered a taxable sale of the article. If the article is usable, even though damaged, the carrier or insurance company incurs liability for tax on its sale, lease, or use of the article. Where the article has been damaged to the extent that its only value is as scrap, and it is not restored to usable condition, sale thereof by the carrier or insurance company is not subject to tax.

# Subpart K—Exemptions, Registration, Etc.
§ 53.131
Tax-free sales; general rule.
(a)
In general.
Section 4221(a) of the Code sets forth the following exempt purposes for which an article subject to tax under chapter 32 of the Code may be sold tax-free by the manufacturer, producer, or importer:
(1) For use by the purchaser for further manufacture, or for resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for use by such second purchaser in further manufacture,
(2) For export, or for resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for export,
(3) For use by the purchaser as supplies for vessels or aircraft,
(4) To a State or local government for the exclusive use of a State or local government, and
(5) To a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use.
Section 4221(a) of the Code applies only in those cases where the exportation or use referred to is to occur before any other use, and where the seller, first purchaser, and second purchaser, as may be appropriate, have registered as required under section 4222 of the Code and paragraph (a) of § 53.140. See paragraph (c) of this section for provisions relating to evidence required in support of tax-free sales. See § 53.141 for exceptions to the requirement for registration. Where tax is paid on the sale of an article, but the article is used or resold for use for an exempt purpose, a claim for credit or refund may be filed in accordance with and to the extent provided in sections 6402(a) and 6416 of the Code, and the regulations thereunder (§§ 53.161 and 53.171-53.186).
(b)
Manufacturer relieved of liability in certain cases
—(1)
General rule.
Under the provisions of section 4221(c) of the Code, if an article subject to tax under Chapter 32 of the Code is sold free of tax by the manufacturer of the article
for an exempt purpose referred to in section 4221(c) of the Code and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the manufacturer shall be relieved of any tax liability under chapter 32 of the Code with respect to such sale if the manufacturer in good faith accepts a proper certification by the purchaser that the article or articles will be used by the purchaser in the stated exempt manner. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section for a list of the exempt purposes referred to in section 4221(c) of the Code.
(2)
Situations wherein section 4221(c) of the Code is applicable.
The following are situations wherein section 4221(c) of the Code is applicable with respect to sales made tax free on the assumption that one of the following sections of the Code provides exemption for such sales:
(i) Section 4221(a)(1) of the Code, to the extent that it relates to sales for further manufacture by a first purchaser (see § 53.132),
(ii) Section 4221(a)(3) of the Code, relating to supplies for vessels and aircraft (see § 53.134),
(iii) Section 4221(a)(4) of the Code, relating to sales to State or local governments (see § 53.135),
(iv) Section 4221(a)(5) of the Code, relating to sales to nonprofit educational organizations (see § 53.136).
(3)
Situations wherein section 4221(c) of the Code is not applicable.
The relief from liability for the payment of tax provided by section 4221(c) of the Code is not applicable with respect to sales made tax free on the assumption that one of the following sections of the Code provides exemption for such sales:
(i) Section 4221(a)(1) of the Code, to the extent that it relates to sales for resale to a second purchaser for use by the second purchaser in further manufacture (see § 53.132),
(ii) Section 4221(a)(2) of the Code, relating to sales for export (see § 53.133).
(4)
Duty of seller to ascertain validity of tax-free sale.
If the manufacturer at the time of its sale has reason to believe that the article sold by it is not intended for the exempt purpose indicated by the purchaser, or that the purchaser has failed to register as required, the manufacturer is not considered to have accepted certification from the purchaser in good faith, and is not relieved from liability under the provisions of section 4221(c) of the Code.
(5)
Information to be furnished to purchaser.
A manufacturer selling articles free of tax under this section shall indicate to the purchaser that:
(i) Certain articles normally subject to tax are being sold tax free, and
(ii) The purchaser is obtaining those articles tax free for an exempt purpose under an exemption certificate or its equivalent.
(6) The manufacturer may transmit this information by any convenient means, such as coding of sales invoices, provided that the information is presented with sufficient particularity so that the purchaser is informed that he has obtained the articles tax free and:
(i) The purchaser can compute and remit the tax due if an article sold tax free for further manufacture is diverted to a taxable use,
(ii) The manufacturer can remit the tax due with respect to an article purchased tax free for resale for use in further manufacture or for export if, within the 6-month period described in § 53.132(c) or § 53.133(c), the manufacturer does not receive proof that the article has been exported or resold for use in further manufacturer, or
(iii) The purchaser can notify the manufacturer if an article otherwise purchased tax free is diverted to a taxable use.
(c)
Evidence required in support of tax-free sales
—(1)
Purchasers required to be registered.
Every purchaser who is required to be registered (see § 53.140) shall furnish to the seller, as evidence in support of each tax-free sale made by the seller to such purchaser, the exempt purpose for which the article or articles are being purchased and the registration number of the purchaser. Such information must be in writing and may be noted on the purchase order or other document furnished by the purchaser to the seller in connection with each sale.
(2)
Purchasers not required to be registered.
For the evidence which purchasers not required to register must furnish to the seller in support of each tax-free sale made by the seller to such purchasers, see paragraph (b) of § 53.133
for sales or resales to a foreign purchaser for export, paragraph (d) of § 53.134 for sales of supplies to vessels or aircraft, paragraph (c) of § 53.135 for sales to State and local governments, and paragraph (c) of § 53.141 for sales and purchases by the United States.
[T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991, as amended by T.D. ATF-380, 61 FR 37005, July 16, 1996]
§ 53.132
Tax-free sale of articles to be used for, or resold for, further manufacture.
(a)
Further manufacture
—(1)
In general.
Under prescribed conditions, an article subject to tax under Chapter 32 of the Code may be sold tax free by the manufacturer, pursuant to section 4221(a)(1) of the Code, for use by the purchaser in further manufacture, or for resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for use by the second purchaser in further manufacture. See section 4221(d) (6) of the Code and paragraph (b) of this section for the circumstances under which an article is considered to have been sold for use in further manufacture. See section 6416(b)(3) of the Code and § 53.180 for the circumstances under which credit or refund is available when tax-paid articles are used in further manufacture.
(2)
Proof of resale for use in further manufacture.
See section 4221(b)(1) of the Code and paragraph (c) of this section for provisions under which the exemption provided in section 4221(a)(1) of the Code shall cease to apply in the case of an article sold by the manufacturer to a purchaser for resale to a second purchaser for use in further manufacture unless the manufacturer receives timely proof of resale for further manufacture.
(b)
Circumstances under which an article is considered to have been sold for use in further manufacture.
(1) For purposes of the exemption from the manufacturers excise tax provided by section 4221(a)(1) of the Code, an article shall be treated as sold for use in further manufacture if the article is sold for use by the purchaser as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, another article taxable under chapter 32 of the Code;
(2) An article is used as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component of, another article if it is incorporated in, or is a part or accessory of, the other article when the other article is sold by the manufacturer. In addition, an article is considered to be used as material in the manufacture of another article if it is consumed in whole or in part in testing such other article; for example, shells or cartridges that are used by the manufacturer of firearms to test new firearms. However, an article that is consumed in the manufacturing process other than in testing, so that it is not a physical part of the manufactured article, is not considered to have been used as material in the manufacture of, or as a component part of, another article.
(c)
Proof of resale for further manufacture
—(1)
Cessation of exemption.
The exemption provided in section 4221(a)(1) of the Code and described in paragraph (a) of this section in respect of an article sold by the manufacturer to a purchaser for resale to a second purchaser for use by the second purchaser in further manufacture shall cease to apply on the first day following the close of the 6-month period which begins on the date of the sale of such article by the manufacturer, or the date of shipment of the article by the manufacturer, whichever is earlier, unless, within such 6-month period, the manufacturer receives proof, in the form prescribed by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, that the article was actually resold by the purchaser to a second purchaser for such use. If, on the first day following the close of the 6-month period, such proof has not been received, the manufacturer shall become liable for tax at that time at the rate in effect when the sale was made but otherwise in the same manner as if the article had been sold by it on such first day at a taxable price equivalent to that at which the article was actually sold. If the manufacturer later obtains such proof, it may file a claim for refund or credit of this tax. The payment of this tax by the manufacturer is not considered an overpayment by the subsequent manufacturer or producer for which the subsequent manufacturer or producer is entitled to a credit or refund under section 6416(b)(3) of the Code. See section 4221(d)(6) of the Code and paragraph (b)
of this section for the circumstances under which an article is considered to have been sold for use in further manufacture.
(2)
Proof of resale
—(i)
Certificate of purchaser.
The proof of resale to be received by the manufacturer, as required under section 4221(b)(1) of the Code, may consist of either a copy of the invoice of the manufacturer's vendee directed to his purchaser which discloses the certificate of registry number held by each party or a statement described in this paragraph. In the case of an invoice of manufacturer's vendee, it must appear from such invoice (or by statement attached thereto) that the article was in fact resold for use in further manufacture. In lieu of such an invoice, proof of resale may consist of a statement, executed and signed by the manufacturer's vendee which includes the following:
(A) Date statement was executed.
(B) Name and address of manufacturer's vendee (if other than the person executing statement).
(C) Certificate of registry number held by vendee.
(D) Specify article(s) purchased tax-free, by whom purchased, certificate of registry number of second purchaser, date of purchase(s), whether articles were purchased as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part or parts of, an article or articles taxable under Chapter 32 of the Code.
(E) Statement that person executing statement or manufacturer's vendee possesses proof of tax-free resale of the article(s) in the form of purchase orders and sales invoices and identifying the person who will maintain custody of such proof for 3 years from the date of the statement and will make such proof available for inspection by TTB during such 3 year period.
(F) Statement that a previous statement has not been executed in respect of such certificate of resale and that the person signing the statement is aware that fraudulent use of the statement may subject the person signing the statement and all parties making fraudulent use of the statement to all applicable criminal penalties under the Code.
(G) Name, signature, and title of individual executing statement.
(ii)
Period covered.
Any statement executed and signed by the manufacturer's vendee, as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, may be executed with respect to any one or more articles purchased tax free from a manufacturer and resold for use in further manufacture within the 6-month period prescribed in section 4221(a)(1) of the Code and paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Such statement (or other prescribed proof of resale) must be retained for inspection by the appropriate TTB officer as provided in section 6001 of the Code.
(iii)

§ 53.133
Tax-free sale of articles for export, or for resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for export.
(a)
In general.
(1) An article subject to tax under chapter 32 of the Code may be sold tax free by the manufacturer, pursuant to section 4221(a)(2) of the Code and this section, for export, or for resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for export. See § 53.11 for the meaning of the term “exportation”. An article may be sold tax free by the manufacturer under the provisions of this section only if the person to whom the manufacturer sells the article intends either to export the article or to resell it to a person who intends to export it. An article may not be sold tax free under the provisions of this section by a manufacturer to a purchaser for resale to a second purchaser which does not intend to export the article itself but plans to resell it to a third purchaser for export. See section 6416(b)(2)(A) of the Code and § 53.177 for the circumstances under which credit or refund of tax is available where tax-paid articles are exported from the United States.
(2) If an article, otherwise taxable under chapter 32 of the Code:
(i) Is sold tax free by the manufacturer pursuant to section 4221(a)(2) of the Code and this section, and
(ii) Is returned subsequently to the United States in an unused and undamaged condition,
then the importer is liable for the tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code on the subsequent sale or use of the article in the United States. The provisions of this paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1).
Q, a U.S. manufacturer of shells and cartridges, previously sold shells and cartridges to R, a company in Canada. The sale was tax free under section 4221(a)(2). Prior to use, R sold the shells and cartridges to S, who imports the articles into the United States and sells them. The sale of the shells and cartridges subjects S to an excise tax liability under section 4181.

# Example (2).
X, a U.S. firearms manufacturer, sold a rifle to Y company in France. The sale was tax free under section 4221(a)(2). The rifle was sold by Y to W, an individual in the City of Nice, France. After initial use, W resold the rifle to X. X returned the rifle to the United States where it was resold. The resale of the rifle by X does not subject X to an excise tax liability under section 4181.
(b)
Sales or resales to a foreign purchaser for export.
In the case of sales or resales to a foreign purchaser for export, if the first or the second purchaser is located in a foreign country or possession of the United States, such purchaser is not required to register as provided in section 4222(a) of the Code and § 53.140. To establish the right to sell articles tax free for export to a purchaser who is not registered and who is located in a foreign country or a possession of the United States, the manufacturer must obtain from such purchaser at the time title to the article passes or at the time of shipment, whichever is earlier, either:
(1) A written order or contract of sale showing that the manufacturer is to ship the article to a foreign destination; or
(2) Where delivery by the manufacturer is to be made within the United States, a statement from the purchaser showing:
(i) That the article is purchased either to fill existing or future orders for delivery to a foreign destination or for resale to another person engaged in the business of exporting who will export the article, and
(ii) That such article will be transported to its foreign destination in due course prior to use or further manufacture and prior to any resale except for export. See section 4221(b) of the Code and paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section for requirements as to timely proof of exportation and cessation of the exemption for export unless the evidence to show actual exportation has been received by the manufacturer.
(c)
Cessation of exemption.
The exemption provided in section 4221(a)(2) of the Code and paragraph (a) of this section for an article sold by the manufacturer for export or for resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for export shall cease to apply on the first day following the close of the 6-month period which begins on the date of the sale of the article by the manufacturer, or the date of shipment of the article by the manufacturer, whichever is earlier, unless within the 6-month period the manufacturer receives proof, in the form prescribed by paragraph (d) of this section, that the article was actually exported. If, on the first day following the close of the 6-month period, the proof has not been received, the manufacturer shall become liable for tax at that time at the rate in effect when the sale was made but otherwise in the same manner as if the article had been sold by it on such first day at a taxable price equivalent to that at which the article was actually sold.
(d)
Proof of exportation.
(1) Exportation may be evidenced by:
(i) A copy of the export bill of lading issued by the delivering carrier,
(ii) A certificate by the agent or representative of the export carrier showing actual exportation of the article,
(iii) A certificate of landing signed by a customs officer of the foreign country to which the article is exported,
(iv) Where the foreign country has no customs administration, a statement of the foreign consignee showing receipt of the article, or
(v) Where a department or agency of the United States Government is unable to furnish any one of the foregoing four types of proof of exportation, a
statement or certification on the department or agency stationery, executed by an authorized officer, that the listed or identified articles have, in fact, been exported.
(2) In any case where the manufacturer is not the exporter, the manufacturer must have in its possession a statement from the vendee to whom the manufacturer sold the article stating the following:
(i) Date statement was executed.
(ii) Name and address of manufacturer's vendee (if other than the person executing statement).
(iii) Certificate of registry number held by vendee.
(iv) Specify article(s) purchased tax-free, by whom purchased, and date of purchase.
(v) Statement that article(s) was either exported in due course by the vendee or was sold to another person who in due course exported the article(s).
(vi) Name and address of vendee who will maintain possession of the proof of exportation documents, description of the documents, and statement that vendee will maintain documents for 3 years and make them available to TTB for inspection.
(vii) Statement that a previous statement has not been executed in respect of the articles covered by this statement and that fraudulent use of this statement may subject person executing statement and all parties making fraudulent use of statement to all applicable criminal penalties under the Code.
(viii) Name, signature, title, and address of individual executing certificate.
(3) The statement executed and signed by the manufacturer's vendee, as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, may be executed with respect to any one or more articles purchased tax free from a manufacturer and exported within the 6-month period prescribed in section 4221(b)(2) of the Code and paragraph (c) of this section. Such statement shall be kept for inspection by the appropriate TTB officer as provided in section 6001 of the Code.

See paragraph (b) of this section for the meaning of the term “supplies for vessels or aircraft.” An article may be sold tax free under the provisions of this section only in those cases where the sale of an article by the manufacturer is made directly to the owner, officer, charterer, or authorized agent of a vessel or aircraft for use as supplies for the vessel or aircraft. No sale may be made tax free to a dealer for resale for use as supplies for vessels or aircraft, even though it is known at the time of sale by the manufacturer that the article will be so resold.

§ 53.135
Tax-free sale of articles to State and local governments for their exclusive use.
(a)
In general.
An article subject to tax under Chapter 32 of the Code may be sold tax free by the manufacturer, pursuant to section 4221(a)(4) of the code and this section, to a State or local government for the exclusive use of such State or local government. See paragraph (b) of this section for the meaning of the term “State or local government”. An article may be sold tax free by the manufacturer under this paragraph only in those cases where the sale is made directly to a State or local government for its exclusive use. Accordingly, no sale may be made tax free to a dealer for resale to a State or local government for its exclusive use, even though it is known at the time of sale by the manufacturer that the article will be so resold. A sale of an article to a State or local government for resale is not considered to be a sale for the “exclusive use” of the State or local government, within the meaning of section 4221(a)(4) of the Code, and, therefore, such sales may not be made tax free. Such sales are not exempt regardless of whether the resales are made to government employees, or the fact that the article is an item of equipment the employee is required to possess in carrying out his duties. For example, pistols or revolvers may not be sold tax free to a State or local government for resale to its police officers. See section 6416(b)(2)(C) of the Code, and paragraph (d) of § 53.178, for the circumstances under which credit or refund of tax is available where tax-paid articles are sold for the exclusive use of a State or local government.
(b)
State or local government.
The term
State or local government
includes any State, the District of Columbia, and any political subdivision of any of the foregoing.
See,
section 7871(a)(2)(B) of the Code and 26 CFR 305.7701-1
et seq.,
which provide that an Indian tribal government shall be treated as a State for purposes of exemption from an excise tax imposed by chapter 32. Section 7871(b) of the Code provides that the exemption from tax applies only if the transaction involves the exercise of an essential governmental function of the Indian tribal government.
(c)
Evidence required in support of tax-free sales to State or local governments.
(1) In the case of a State or local government which is registered (see § 53.141 for provisions under which a State or local government may register if it so desires), the provisions of paragraph (c) of § 53.131 have application as to the evidence required in support of tax-free sales. If a State or local government is not registered, the evidence required in support of a tax-free sale to the State or local government shall, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, consist of a certificate, executed
and signed by an officer or employee authorized by the State or local government to execute and sign the certificate. If it is impracticable to furnish a separate certificate for each order or contract because of frequency of purchases, a certificate covering all orders between given dates (such period not to exceed 12 calendar quarters) will be acceptable. The certificates and proper records of invoices, orders, etc., relative to tax-free sales must be retained by the manufacturer as provided in § 53.24(d). A certificate of exemption to support tax-free sales under this section must contain the following:
(i) Title of official executing certificate, branch of government, date executed, and statement that official is authorized to execute certificate.
(ii) List articles covered by the certificate or beginning and ending dates during which orders will be placed by the purchaser (period not to exceed 12 calendar quarters).
(iii) Name of manufacturer from which articles purchased.
(iv) Governmental unit purchasing articles.
(v) Statement that is understood that articles purchased under this certificate of exemption are limited to use exclusively by the purchasing governmental entity.
(vi) Statement that is understood that any fraudulent use of this certificate may subject the person executing the certificate and all parties making fraudulent use of the certificate to all applicable criminal penalties under the Code.
(vii) Name, address, and signature of person executing the certificate.
(2) A purchase order, provided that all of the information required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section is included therein, is acceptable in lieu of a separate exemption certificate.
(3)
TTB F 5600.35.
A preprinted certificate, TTB F 5600.35, Exemption Certificate, which is available as provided in § 53.21(b), when completed, contains all necessary information for a properly executed certificate. Extra copies of TTB F 5600.35 may be reproduced as needed.
(d)
Resale of articles purchased tax free by a State or local government.
If articles purchased tax free for the exclusive use of a State or local government (whether on the basis of a registration number or an exemption certificate) are, prior to use by the State or local government, resold under circumstances that do not amount to an exclusive use by the State or local government (such as pistols or revolvers that are resold by a police department to its police officers), the parties responsible in the State or local government are required to inform the manufacturer, producer, or importer from whom the articles were purchased that they were disposed of in a manner that did not amount to an exclusive use by the State or local government. A willful failure to supply the manufacturer, producer, or importer with the information required by this subparagraph will subject responsible parties to the penalties provided by section 7203 of the Code.

§ 53.136
Tax-free sales of articles to nonprofit educational organizations.
(a)
In general.
An article subject to tax under chapter 32 of the Code may be sold tax free by the manufacturer, pursuant to section 4221(a)(5) of the Code and this section, to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use. See paragraph (b) of this section for the meaning of the term “nonprofit educational organization”. An article may be sold tax free by the manufacturer under this paragraph only in those cases where the sale of an article by the manufacturer is made directly to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use. Accordingly, no sale may be made tax free to a dealer for resale to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use even though it is known at the time of sale by the manufacturer that the article will be so resold. See section 6416(b)(2)(D) of the Code, and paragraph (e) of § 53.178, for the circumstances under which credit or refund of tax is available where tax-paid articles are sold for the exclusive use of a nonprofit educational organization.
(b)
Nonprofit educational organization.
The term “nonprofit educational organization” means an organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code that is exempt from income tax under section 501(a) of the Code. Section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) describes an “educational organization” as one that normally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled body of pupils or students in attendance at the place where its educational activities are regularly carried on. The term also includes a school operated as an activity of an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Code which is exempt from income tax under section 501(a) of the Code, provided the primary function of such school is the presentation of formal instruction and provided such school normally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled body of pupils or students in attendance at the place where its educational activities are regularly carried on.
(c)
Evidence required in support of tax-free sales to nonprofit educational organizations.
Every nonprofit educational organization purchasing tax free under section 4221(a)(5) of the Code must furnish the following information to the seller:
(1) The tax exempt purpose for which the article or articles are being purchased, and
(2) Its registration number. Such information must be in writing and may be noted on the purchase order or other document furnished by the purchaser to the seller in connection with each sale “except that a single notification containing the information described in this paragraph may cover all sales by the seller to the purchaser made during a designated period not to exceed 12 successive calendar quarters.”. See paragraph (c) of § 53.131 for the evidence required to establish exemption.

§ 53.141
Exceptions to the requirement for registration.
(a)
State and local governments.
(1) A State or local government purchasing articles direct from the manufacturer for its exclusive use may, but is not required to, register as provided in § 53.140. To establish the right to sell articles tax free to a State or local government that is not registered, the manufacturer must obtain from an authorized official of the State or local government and retain in the manufacturer's possession either a properly executed exemption certificate, or a purchase order that contains the same information required to be furnished in an exemption certificate. See § 53.135(c) for the information necessary to substantiate a tax-free sale under such circumstances.
(2) Each State requesting registration will be assigned one Certificate of Registry. The registration number shown on this certificate may be used by all agencies, boards, and commissions of the State that are authorized by the State to make purchases for the exclusive use of the State. However, the registration number assigned to a State may not be used by any political subdivision of that State, such as a county or municipality. Each political subdivision of a State desiring to obtain a Certificate of Registry must obtain a separate registration number.
(b)
Sales or resales to foreign purchasers for export.
Persons whose principal place of business is not within the United States may, but are not required to, register in order to purchase articles tax free for export. To establish the right to sell articles tax free for export to a purchaser who is not registered and who is located in a foreign country or a possession of the United States, the manufacturer must obtain the evidence required by § 53.133(b).
(c)
United States.
The registration requirements of the regulations in this part do not apply to purchases and sales by the United States or any of its agencies or instrumentalities. The evidence required in support of such tax-free purchases and sales is a notation on the purchase order or other document furnished to the seller clearly indicating that the article or articles are being purchased tax free as authorized by chapter 32 of the Code.
(d)
Supplies for vessels and aircraft.
An article subject to an excise tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code may be sold tax free by the manufacturer under the provisions of § 53.134 for use by the purchaser as supplies for a vessel or aircraft if both the manufacturer and the purchaser are registered under the provisions of § 53.140. The article also may be sold tax free for such use even though neither the manufacturer nor the purchaser is so registered if the provisions of paragraph (d) of § 53.134 are satisfied.
[T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991, as amended by T.D. ATF-312, 56 FR 31084, July 9, 1991]
§ 53.142
Denial, revocation or suspension of registration.
(a) The appropriate TTB officer is authorized to deny, revoke or temporarily suspend, upon written notice, the registration of any person and the right of such person to sell or purchase articles tax free under section 4221 of the Code in any case in which he finds that:
(1) The registrant is not a bona fide manufacturer, or a purchaser reselling direct to manufacturers or exporters;
(2) The registrant is for some other reason not eligible under these regulations to retain a Certificate of Registry; or
(3) The registrant has used his registration to avoid payment of the tax imposed by section 4181 of the Code, or to postpone or interfere in any manner with the collection of such tax;
(4) Such denial, revocation, or suspension is necessary to protect the revenue; or
(5) The registrant failed to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of § 53.140, relating to the evidence required to support a tax-free sale.
(b) The denial, revocation, or suspension of registration is in addition to any other penalty that may apply under the law for any act or failure to act.
[T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991, as amended by T.D. ATF-365, 60 FR 33671, June 28, 1995]
§ 53.143
Special rules relating to further manufacture.
(a)
Purchasing manufacturer to be treated as the manufacturer.
For purposes of Chapter 32 of the Code, a manufacturer or producer to whom an article is sold or resold tax free under section 4221(a)(1) of the Code for use by it in further manufacture shall be treated as the manufacturer or producer of such article. If a manufacturer who purchases an article tax free for further manufacture does not use the article for further manufacture, the sale of the article by it, or its use of the article other than in further manufacture, shall, for purposes of the taxes imposed by chapter 32 of the Code, be treated as a sale or use of the article by the manufacturer thereof. See paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section for determination of taxable sale price where an article purchased tax free for further manufacture is resold, or used other than in further manufacture.
(b)
Computation of tax.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the tax liability referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall be based on the price for which the article was sold by the purchasing manufacturer, or, where the manufacturer uses the article for a purpose other than that for which it was purchased, the tax shall be based on the price at which such or similar articles are sold, in the ordinary course of trade, by manufacturers, producers, or importers thereof. See section 4218(e) of the Code and § 53.115.
(c)
Election.
(1) Instead of computing the tax as described under paragraph (b) of this section, the purchasing manufacturer who has incurred liability for tax on its sale or use of an article as provided by paragraph (a) of this section may compute the tax incurred under chapter 32 of the Code by using as the tax base either the price for which the article was sold to it by the first purchaser, if any, or the price for which such article was sold by the actual manufacturer, producer, or importer of such article. The purchasing manufacturer must have in its possession information upon which to substantiate such basis for tax. For purposes of this paragraph, the price for which the article was sold by the actual manufacturer or by the first purchaser shall be determined as provided in section 4216 of the Code and §§ 53.91-53.102. However, such price shall not be adjusted for any discount, rebate, allowance, return, or repossession of a container or covering, or otherwise.
(2) The election under this paragraph shall be in the form of a statement attached to the return reporting the tax applicable to the sale or use of the article which gave rise to such tax liability. Such election, once made, may not be revoked.

(b)
Monthly and semimonthly returns
—(1)
Requirement.
If the appropriate TTB officer determines that any taxpayer who is required to deposit taxes under the provision of §§ 53.157 or 53.159 has failed to make deposits of those taxes, the taxpayer shall be required, if so notified in writing by the appropriate TTB officer, to file a monthly or semimonthly return on TTB Form 5300.26. Every person so notified by the appropriate TTB officer shall file a return for the calendar month or semimonthly period in which the notice is received and for each calendar month or semimonthly period thereafter until the person has filed a final return in accordance with § 53.152 or is required to file returns on the basis of a different return period pursuant to notification as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(ii) If a taxpayer who has been filing monthly or semimonthly returns receives notice to file a quarterly return, the last month or semimonthly period for which a return shall be filed is the last month or semimonthly period of the calendar quarter in which the notice is received.
(iii) If a taxpayer who has been filing semimonthly returns receives notice to file a monthly return, the last semimonthly period for which a return shall be made is the last semimonthly period of the month in which the notice is received.
[T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991, as amended by T.D. ATF-330, 57 FR 40325, Sept. 3, 1992; T.D. ATF-365, 60 FR 33671, June 28, 1995; T.D. TTB-91, 76 FR 5481, Feb. 1, 2011]
§ 53.152
Final returns.
(a)
In general.
Any person who is required to make a return on TTB Form 5300.26 pursuant to § 53.151 and who in any return period ceases operations in respect of which the person is required to make a return on the form, shall make the return for that return period as a final return. A return made as a final return shall be marked “Final Return” by the person filing the return. A taxpayer who has only temporarily ceased to incur liability for tax required to be reported on TTB Form 5300.26 because of temporary or seasonal suspension of business or for other reasons, shall not make a final return until such operations are permanently ceased.
(b)
Statement to accompany final return.
Each final return shall have attached a statement showing the address at which the records required by the regulations in this part will be kept, the name of the person keeping the records, and, if the business of the taxpayer has been sold or otherwise transferred to another person, the name and address of that person and the date on which the sale or transfer
took place. If no sale or transfer occurred or if the taxpayer does not know the name of the person to whom the business was sold or transferred, that fact should be included in the statement.
[T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991, as amended by T.D. ATF-330, 57 FR 40325, Sept. 3, 1992. Redesignated in part by T.D. ATF-365, 60 FR 33670, June 28, 1995]
§ 53.153
Time for filing returns.
(a)
Quarterly returns.
Each return required to be made under § 53.151(a) for a return period of one calendar quarter shall be filed on or before the last day of the first calendar month following the close of the period for which it is made. However, a return may be filed on or before the 10th day of the second calendar month following the close of the period if timely deposits under section 6302(c) of the Code and § 53.157 have been made in full payment of the taxes due for the period. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a deposit which is not required by regulations in respect of the return period may be made on or before the last day of the first calendar month following the close of the period.
(b)
Monthly, semimonthly and annual returns
—(1)
Monthly returns.
Each return required to be made under § 53.151(b) for a monthly period shall be filed not later than the 15th day of the month following the close of the period for which it is made.
(2)
Semimonthly returns.
Each return required to be made under § 53.151(b) for a semimonthly period shall be filed not later than the 10th day of the semimonthly period following the close of the period for which it is made.
(3)
Annual returns.
Each return filed under the provisions of § 53.151(a) for a return period of one calendar year shall be filed not later than the 31st day following the close of the calendar year.
(c)
Last day for filing.
If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the return and remittance shall be due on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. For purposes of this section, “legal holiday” is defined by section 7503 of the Code and 26 CFR 301.7503(b).
(d)
Late filing.
The taxpayer is subject to a penalty for failure to file a return or to pay tax within the prescribed time as imposed by section 6651 of the Code, if the return and remittance are not filed before the close of business on the prescribed last day of filing. For additions to the tax in the case of failure to file a return within the prescribed time, see 27 CFR 70.96.
[T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991, as amended by T.D. ATF-330, 57 FR 40325, Sept. 3, 1992]
§ 53.154
Manner of filing returns.
(a) Each return on TTB Form 5300.26 shall be filed with TTB, in accordance with the instructions on the form.
(b) When the taxpayer sends the return on TTB Form 5300.26 by U.S. Mail, the official postmark of the U.S. Postal Service stamped on the cover in which the return was mailed shall be considered the date of delivery of the return. When the postmark on the cover is illegible, the burden of proving when the postmark was made will be on the taxpayer. When the taxpayer sends the return with or without remittance by registered mail or by certified mail, the date of registry or the date of the postmark on the sender's receipt of certified mail, as the case may be, shall be treated as the date of delivery of the return and, if accompanied, of the remittance.
[T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991, as amended by T.D. ATF-330, 57 FR 40325, Sept. 3, 1992]
§ 53.155
Extension of time for filing returns.
(a)
In general.
Ordinarily, no extension of time will be granted for filing any return statement or other document required with respect to the taxes impose by chapter 32, because the information required for the filing of those documents is under normal circumstances readily available. However, if because of temporary conditions beyond the taxpayer's control, a taxpayer believes an extension of time for filing is justified, the taxpayer may apply to the appropriate TTB officer for an extension. An extension of time for filing a return does not operate to extend the time for payment of the tax or any part of the tax unless so specified in
the extension. For extensions of time for payment of the tax, see § 53.156.
(b)
Application for extension of time.
The application for an extension of time for filing the return shall be addressed to the appropriate TTB officer with whom the return is to be filed and must contain a full recital of the causes for the delay. It should be made on or before the due date of the return, and failure to do so many indicate negligence and constitute sufficient cause for denial. It should, where possible, be made sufficiently early to permit consideration of the matter and reply before what otherwise would be the due date of the return.
(c)
Filing the return.
If an extension of time for filing the return is granted, a return shall be filed before the expiration of the period of extension.
§ 53.156
Extension of time for paying tax shown on return.
(a)
In general.
(1) Ordinarily, no extensions of time will be granted for payment of any tax imposed by Chapter 32 of the Code, and shown or required to be shown on any return. However, if because of temporary conditions beyond the taxpayer's control a taxpayer believes an extension of time for payment is justified, the taxpayer may apply for an extension filing TTB Form 5600.38. The period of an extension shall not be in excess of 6 months from the date fixed for payment of the tax, except that if the taxpayer is abroad the period of the extension may be in excess of 6 months.
(2) The granting of an extension of time for filing a return does not operate to extend the time for the payment of the tax or any part of the tax unless so specified in the extension. See § 53.155.
(b)
Undue hardship required for extension.
An extension of the time for payment shall be granted only upon a satisfactory showing that payment on the due date of the amount with respect to which the extension is desired will result in an undue hardship. The extension will not be granted upon a general statement of hardship. The term “undue hardship” means more than an inconvenience to the taxpayer. It must appear that substantial financial loss, for example, loss due to the sale of property at a sacrifice price, will result to the taxpayer from making payment on the due date of the amount with respect to which the extension is desired. If a market exists, the sale of property at the current market price is not ordinarily considered as resulting in an undue hardship.
(c)
Application for extension.
An application for an extension of time for payment of the tax shown or required to be shown on any return shall be made on TTB Form 5600.38, Application for Extension of Time for Payment of Tax, and shall be accompanied by evidence showing the undue hardship that would result to the taxpayer if the extension were refused. The application shall also be accompanied by a statement of the assets and liabilities of the taxpayer and an itemized statement showing all receipts and disbursements for each of the 3 months immediately preceding the due date of the amount to which the application relates. The application, with supporting documents, must be filed on or before the date prescribed for payment of the amount with respect to which the extension is desired. The application will be examined, and within 30 days, if possible, will be denied, granted, or tentatively granted subject to certain conditions of which the taxpayer will be notified. If an additional extension is desired, the request for it must be made on or before the expiration of the period for which the prior extension is granted.
(d)
Payment pursuant to extension.
If an extension of time for payment is granted, the payment shall be made on or before the expiration of the period of the extension without the necessity of notice and demand. The granting of an extension of time for payment of the tax does not relieve the taxpayer from liability for the payment of interest on the tax during the period of the extension. See section 6601 of the Code and 26 CFR 301.6601-1.
[T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991, as amended by T.D. ATF-312, 56 FR 31084, July 9, 1991; T.D. ATF-447, 66 FR 19088, Apr. 13, 2001]

(C) If the semimonthly periods occur in a calendar month other than the last month in a calendar quarter, the person deposits any underpayment for the month by the 9th day of the second month following the calendar month.
(3)(i) Paragraph (b)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section shall not apply to any person who normally incurs in the first semimonthly period in each calendar month more than 75 percent of the person's total excise tax liability under this part for the month.

Taxpayers electing to remit deposits by EFT pursuant to § 53.158 shall prepare and submit TTB Form 5300.26 or TTB Form 5300.27 in accordance with the instructions on the form. The timeliness of the deposit will be determined by the date it is received (or is deemed received under section 7502(e) and 26 CFR 301.7502-1) by the lockbox financial institution, or the TTB officer designated on TTB Form 5300.27 or TTB Form 5300.26 accompanying the deposit, or when made by electronic fund transfer, the Treasury Account.

§ 53.158
Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.
(a)
In general.
For return periods after September 30, 1992, any taxpayer liable for firearms and ammunition excise taxes incurred under this part may elect to remit payments and deposits of the taxes (taxpayments) by electronic fund transfer (EFT). A taxpayer who elects to make remittance by EFT must use that method of remitting excise taxes on firearms and ammunition for a minimum of four consecutive calendar quarters. A taxpayer who makes remittance by EFT for a calendar quarter may not use any other method of remitting and ammunition excise taxes for that quarter.
(b)
Requirements.
(1) On or before the 10th day of the calendar quarter preceding the calendar quarter in which the taxpayer will begin remitting taxes by EFT, each taxpayer who elects to make remittances by EFT of firearms and ammunition excise taxes incurred under this part shall give written notice to the appropriate TTB officer, indicating that remittances will be paid by EFT. Taxpayers who gave written notification in a previous calendar quarter electing to make remittances of tax by EFT are not required to give additional written notifications to continue remitting tax by EFT for succeeding calendar quarters.
(2) For each deposit made or return filed in accordance with this subpart, the taxpayer shall direct the taxpayer's financial institution to make an EFT in the amount of the taxpayment to the Treasury Account as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. The request will be made to the financial institution early enough for the transfer of funds to be made to the Treasury Account no later than the close of business on the last day for making the deposit or filing the return as prescribed in §§ 53.157 or 53.159, and 53.153. The request will take into account any time limit established by the financial institution.
(3) Taxpayers who elect to discontinue making remittances by EFT of firearms and ammunition excise taxes may make such election at any time following four consecutive calendar quarters in which tax is remitted by EFT. Taxpayers electing to discontinue making remittances by EFT shall remit the tax with the next deposit or return as prescribed in §§ 53.157 or 53.159, and 53.151 for remittances not made by EFT and notify the appropriate TTB officer by attaching a written notification to the tax deposit form or return stating that remittance of firearms and ammunition excise taxes will no longer be made by EFT.
(c)
Remittance.
(1) Taxpayers who elect to make firearms and ammunition excise taxpayments by EFT shall file the deposit form and/or return with TTB in accordance with the applicable instructions on the forms.
(2) Remittances will be considered as made when the taxpayment by EFT is received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a Federal Reserve Bank.
(3) When the taxpayer directs the financial institution to effect an electronic fund transfer message as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the transfer data record furnished to the taxpayer through normal banking procedures will serve as the record of payment and will be retained as part of the required records.
(d)
Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT.
The taxpayer is subject to penalties imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6651 and 6656, as applicable, for failure to make a payment or deposit of tax by EFT on or before the close of business on the prescribed last day for making such payment or deposit.
(e)
Procedure.
Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will issue to the taxpayer an TTB Procedure entitled Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund Transfer. This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer follows when preparing deposits,
returns and EFT remittances in accordance with this subpart.

§ 53.159
Deposit requirement for deposits made for calendar quarters beginning on or after July 1, 1995.
(a)
Definitions
—(1)
Definition of tax liability.
For purposes of this section, the term “tax liability” means the total tax liability for the specified period plus or minus any allowable adjustments made in accordance with the instructions applicable to the form on which the return is made.
(2)
Semimonthly period.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the term “semimonthly period” means the first 15 days of a calendar month or the remaining portion of a calendar month following the 15th day of that month.
(b)
In general
—(1)
Semimonthly deposits.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2), (c)(2), and (j) of this section, any person required to file a quarterly excise tax return on TTB Form 5300.26 must make a deposit of tax for each semimonthly period as prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
One-time or occasional filings.
No deposit is required in the case of any taxes reportable on a one-time or occasional filing (as defined in § 53.151(a)(5)).
(c)
Amount of deposit
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3) and (c)(6) of this section, the deposit of tax for each semimonthly period must be equal to the amount of tax liability incurred during that semimonthly period. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, no deposit is required for any semimonthly period in which no tax liability is incurred.
(2)
De minimis exception.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, any person who has a tax liability for the current calendar quarter of $2,000 or less is not required to make deposits for that quarter. However, semimonthly deposits of tax are required beginning with the semimonthly period in which unpaid tax liability exceeds $2,000 and for every semimonthly period thereafter in which tax liability is incurred. The first deposit for the current quarter shall be equal to the unpaid tax liability; thereafter, deposits shall be equal to the amount of tax liability incurred during that semimonthly period.
(3)
Amount of deposit; safe harbor rule based on look-back quarter liability
;
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, any person who made a return of tax on TTB Form 5300.26 reporting taxes for the second preceding calendar quarter (the “look-back quarter”), or who did not file a return for the look-back quarter because of the provisions of § 53.151(a)(2), is considered to have complied with the requirement for deposit of taxes for the current calendar quarter if—
(i) The deposit of taxes for each semimonthly period in the current calendar quarter is an amount equal to not less than
1/6
(16.67 percent) of the total tax liability incurred for the look-back quarter;
(ii) Each deposit is made on time; and
(iii) The amount of any underpayment of taxes for the current calendar quarter is paid by the due date of the return.
(4)
Modification for third calendar quarter.
The safe harbor rule in paragraph (c)(3) of this section does not apply for the third calendar quarter unless—
(i) The deposit of taxes for the semimonthly period July 1-September 15 meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and
(ii) Each deposit of taxes for the periods September 16-25 and September 26-30 is not less than 1/12th (8.34 percent) of the total tax liability incurred for the look-back quarter.
(5)
Modification for tax rate increase
—(i)
Application.
The safe harbor rule as prescribed in paragraph (c)(3) is modified for the first and second calendar quarters beginning on or after the effective date of an increase in the rate of any tax prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 4181 to which this part 53 applies.
(ii)
Modification.
The amount of deposit for calendar quarters referred to in paragraph (c)(3) of this section must be adjusted so that the deposit of taxes for each semimonthly period in the calendar quarter is not less than
1/6
(16.67 percent) of the tax liability the person
would have had with respect to the tax for the look-back quarter if the increased rate of tax had been in effect for that look-back quarter.
(6)
First time filers.
Any person who did not file a return of tax on TTB Form 5300.26 for the first and second preceding calendar quarters because they were not engaged in any activity with respect to which tax is reportable on the return in the course of a trade or business, is considered to have complied with the requirement for deposit of taxes for the current calendar quarter if—
(i) The deposit of taxes for each semimonthly period in the calendar quarter is not less than 95 percent of the tax liability incurred with respect to those taxes during the semimonthly period;
(ii) Each deposit is made on time; and
(iii) The amount of any underpayment of taxes for the current calendar quarter is paid by the due date of the return.
(d)
Failure to comply with deposit requirements.
(1) If a person fails to make deposits as required under this part, the appropriate TTB officer may withdraw the person's right to use the safe harbor rule provided by paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(2)
Cross reference.
The appropriate TTB officer may also require a taxpayer who fails to make deposits of tax to file a monthly or semimonthly return, see § 53.151(b)(1).
(e)
Time for making deposit.
Except for deposits for the period September 16-25, each deposit required to be made by this section shall be made not later than the 9th day of the semimonthly period following the close of the period for which it is made. The deposit for the period September 16-25 shall be made not later than September 28. The deposit for the period September 26-30, is due not later than October 9.
(f)
Last day for filing.
(1) Except as provided by paragraph (f)(2) of this section, if the due date of the deposit falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the deposit and remittance shall be due on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. For purposes of this section, “legal holiday” is defined by section 7503 of the Code and 27 CFR 70.306(b) of this chapter.
(2) If the required due date of the deposit for the period September 16-25 falls on a Saturday, the deposit and remittance shall be due on the preceding day. If such required due date falls on a Sunday, the return and remittance shall be due on the following day.
(g)
Forms and procedures.
Each remittance of amounts required to be deposited shall be accompanied by Form 5300.27, Federal Firearms and Ammunition Excise Tax Deposit form, or Form 5300.26, Federal Firearms and Ammunition Excise Tax Return, which shall be prepared in accordance with the applicable instructions. Taxpayers electing to remit deposits by EFT pursuant to § 53.158 shall prepare and submit Form 5300.26 or Form 5300.27 in accordance with the instructions contained in Procedure 92-1, Publication 5000.11. The timeliness of the deposit will be determined by the date it is received by the lockbox financial institution, or the TTB officer designated on the form accompanying the deposit, or the Treasury Account, when made by EFT. In order for deposits of less than $20,000 made by U.S. Mail to be considered received timely, the date of mailing must be on or before the second day preceding the due date of the deposit as evidenced by the official postmark of the U.S. Postal Service stamped on the cover in which the deposit was mailed. When the postmark on the cover is illegible, the burden of proving when the postmark was made will be on the taxpayer. When the taxpayer sends the deposit by registered mail or by certified mail, the date of registry or the date of the postmark on the sender's receipt of certified mail, as the case may be, shall be treated as the date of delivery of the deposit. Any deposit of $20,000 or more must be received by the last day prescribed for making such deposit, regardless of when mailed. Amounts deposited pursuant to this paragraph shall be considered to be paid on the last day prescribed for filing the return in respect of the tax (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the returns), or at the time deposited, whichever is later.
(h)
Number of remittances.
A person required by this section to make deposits shall make one deposit for a semimonthly period.
(i)
Procurement of prescribed forms.
Copies of the Federal Firearms and Ammunition Excise Tax Deposit form will be furnished, so far as possible, to persons required to make deposits under this section. Such a person will not be excused from making a deposit however, by the fact that no form has been furnished. A person not supplied with the form is required to obtain the form in ample time to make the required deposits within the time prescribed. Copies of the Federal Firearms and Ammunition Excise Tax Deposit form are available as provided in § 53.21(b).
(j)
Taxpayers required to file monthly or semimonthly returns.
This section does not apply to taxes for:
(1) Any month or semimonthly period in which the taxpayer receives notice pursuant to section 53.151(b) to file TTB Form 5300.26; or
(2) Any subsequent month or semimonthly period for which a return on TTB Form 5300.26 is required.
(3) Taxpayers required to file monthly returns shall make semimonthly deposits of 100 percent of the liability incurred during each semimonthly period by the 9th day of the month following the last day of the semimonthly period. Taxpayers required to file semimonthly returns shall pay any tax due for the semimonthly period with each return.
(k)
Examples.

# Example 1. One-time filing or occasional filing.
(1)
Facts.
On October 18, 1995, A, an individual who lives in the United States purchases a custom made rifle outside the United States and imports it into the United States. A uses the rifle on October 20, 1995. A is liable for the firearms excise tax imposed by sections 4181 and 4218(a). Since A does not regularly sell rifles in arm's length transactions, a constructive sale price of $20,000 is determined (§ 53.115(b)). The amount of A's tax liability is $2200, 11 percent of the constructive sale price of the rifle. The liability is incurred during the fourth calendar quarter of 1995, the quarter during which the rifle is used (§ 53.111(d)). A did not import the rifle in the course of its trade or business and does not engage in any activities with respect to which tax is reportable on TTB Form 5300.26 in the course of a trade or business.
(2)
Filing requirement.
A must file a return on Form 5300.26 (§ 53.151(a)) for the fourth calendar quarter of 1995 reporting A's $2200 firearms excise tax liability. The Form 5300.26 is due by January 31, 1996, the last day of the first month following the calendar quarter (§ 53.153(a)). Because A did not import the firearm in the course of its trade or business and does not engage in any activities with respect to which tax is reportable in the course of a trade or business, the return is a one-time filing or occasional filing.
(3)
Payment requirement.
Because A's Form 5300.26 is a one-time filing, A is not required to make deposits of tax (§ 53.159(b)(2)). Instead, A pays the $2200 of tax with the return.

# Example 2. Deposit requirement; based on look-back quarter liability.
(1)
Facts.
B is a manufacturer of firearms. B sells 75 pistols which have a taxable sale price of $500 each during the second calendar quarter of 1996. B sold 50 of the pistols in the first semimonthly period of May, 1996, and the other 25 pistols in the second semimonthly period of April, 1996. B did not incur tax liability in any other semimonthly period in the second quarter. The amount of B's tax liability for the second calendar quarter is $3,750, 10 percent of the taxable sale price of the pistols. B filed Form 5300.26 for the second preceding calendar quarter, the look-back quarter, on January 31, 1996 reporting tax liability in the amount of $2,700.
(2)
Deposit requirement.
B is required to make deposits of tax for each semimonthly period in the calendar quarter because B has incurred more than $2,000 in liability for the current quarter. B may use the safe harbor rule based on look-back quarter liability to determine the amount of the required deposits (§ 53.159(c)(3)). Under this safe harbor rule, B's deposit for each semimonthly period must equal at least $450.00,
1/6
(16.67 percent) of the tax liability incurred for the look-back quarter. B's deposit must be timely and B must pay the amount of any underpayment by the due date of the return. Accordingly, B meets the deposit requirement if B makes the following deposits:
Semimonthly period
Deposit due by
Amount of deposit
April 1-15
April 24, 1996
$450.00
April 16-31
May 9, 1996
450.00
May 1-15
May 24, 1996
450.00
May 16-30
June 10, 1996
450.00
June 1-15
June 24, 1996
450.00
June 16-30
July 9, 1996
450.00
The deposit due on June 10, 1996, would ordinarily be due on June 9, 1996. However, because June 9, 1996 is a Sunday, under section 7503, B has an additional day to make the required deposit.
(3)
Filing requirement.
B must file a return on Form 5300.26 for the second calendar quarter of 1996 reporting B's $3750 tax liability (§ 53.151(a)). The form 5300.26 is due by July
31, 1996, the last day of the first month following the calendar quarter (§ 53.153(a)). B must also pay $1050.00, the underpayment amount by which the total tax liability for the second calendar quarter exceeds the total tax liability for the look-back quarter, by the due date of the return.

# Example 3. Deposit amount; no liability in look-back quarter.
(1)
Facts.
C, a manufacturer of ammunition, filed returns for the first, second and third quarters of 1995 reporting C's tax liability. During the fourth quarter of 1995, C did not make any taxable sales of shells or cartridges, thereby incurring no tax liability for that return period. C did not file Form 5300.26 for the fourth calendar quarter since no tax liability was incurred (§ 53.151(a)(2)). C made taxable sales in the second quarter of 1996 amounting to $25,500.00, incurring a tax liability of $2805.
(2)
Deposit requirement.
Ordinarily, C would be required to make deposits of tax for each semimonthly period in the calendar quarter because C's total liability for the current calendar quarter exceeds $2,000. However, since C incurred a tax liability of $0 in the second preceding calendar quarter (the look-back quarter) (§ 53.159(c)(3)), under the safe harbor rule, C is not required to make deposits of tax.
(3)
Filing requirement.
C is required to file a return on Form 5300.26 reporting C's $2805 ammunition excise tax liability. The form 5300.26 is due by July 31, 1996.
(4)
Payment requirement.
C must pay the $2805 tax with the return.

# Example 4. Deposit requirement; First time Filer.
(1)
Facts.
D, a manufacturer of firearms, began business on 2/16/96. D sold 300 shotguns which had a taxable sales price of $210 each during the first quarter of 1996. D sold 70 shotguns in the second semimonthly period of February, 1996, 130 shotguns in the first semimonthly period of March, 1996 and 100 shotguns in the second semimonthly period of March, 1996. The amount of D's tax liability for the first quarter of 1996 is $6,930, 11 percent of the taxable sale price of the shotguns.
(2)
Deposit requirement.
D is required to make a deposit of tax when D's tax liability exceeds $2,000 (§ 53.159(c)(2)). Therefore, D must make a deposit of tax beginning with the first semimonthly period in March, the semimonthly period in which D's unpaid tax liability exceeded $2,000. Because D, a first time filer, does not have an established look-back quarter, D's deposit of tax must be at least 95 percent of the incurred tax liability. D is required to make deposits of at least 95 percent of incurred tax liability for every semimonthly period in the quarter thereafter. D's deposits must be timely and any underpayment of tax must be paid by the due date of the return. Accordingly, D meets the deposit requirement if D makes the following deposits:
Semimonthly period
Deposit due by
Amount of deposit
Feb. 16-29
March 11, 1996
$0
March 1-15
March 25, 1996
4,389
March 16-31
April 9, 1996
2,194.50
The deposits due on March 11, 1996, and March 25, 1996, would ordinarily be due on March 9, 1996, and March 24, 1996, respectively. However, because March 9, 1996, is a Saturday, and March 24, 1996, is a Sunday, under section 7503, D has until March 11, 1996, to make the deposit due on March 9, 1996, and until March 25, 1996, to make the deposit due on March 24, 1996.
(3)
Filing requirement.
D must file a return on Form 5300.26 for the first calendar quarter of 1996 reporting D's $6,930 tax liability (§ 53.151(a)). The form 5300.26 is due by April 30, 1996, the last day of the first month following the calendar quarter (§ 53.153(a)). D must also pay $346.50, the amount by which the tax liability for the quarter was underpaid, by the due date of the return.

# Example 5. Deposit amount; third calendar quarter.
(1)
Facts.
E, a manufacturer of firearms, is a semimonthly depositor who makes deposits of tax using the safe harbor rule based on the look-back quarter to determine the amount of tax required to be deposited for the third calendar quarter of 1995. E incurred a tax liability amounting to $38,000 for the third quarter. E filed Form 5300.26 for the second preceding calendar quarter, the look-back quarter on May 1, 1995, reporting tax liability in the amount of $30,000.
(2)
Deposit requirement.
Because E has incurred more than $2,000 in liability and has chosen to make deposits of tax based on the look-back quarter, E is required to make deposits of tax equal to $5,000,
1/6
(16.67 percent) of the tax liability incurred in the look-back quarter, for each semimonthly period in the calendar quarter. However, because of the special rule which modifies the safe harbor rule for deposits of tax for the month of September (§ 53.159(c)(4)), E must make deposits equal to $2500.00 each, 1/12th (8.34 percent) of the tax liability incurred in the look-back quarter for the periods September 16-25 and September 26-30. E's deposits must be timely and E must pay the amount of any underpayment by the due date of the return. Accordingly, E meets the deposit requirement if E makes the following deposits:
Semimonthly period
Deposit due by
Amount of deposit
July 1-15
July 24, 1995
$5000.00
July 16-31
August 9, 1995
5000.00
Aug. 1-15
August 24, 1995
5000.00
Aug. 16-31
Sept. 11, 1995
5000.00
Sept. 1-15
Sept. 25, 1995

Sept. 16-25
Sept. 28, 1995
2500.00
Sept. 26-30
October 9, 1995
2500.00
The deposits due on September 11, 1995, and September 25, 1995, would ordinarily be due on September 9, 1995, and September 24, 1995, respectively. However, because September 9, 1995, is a Saturday, and September 24, 1995, is a Sunday, under section 7503, D has until September 11, 1995, to make the deposit due on September 9, 1995, and until September 25, 1995, to make the deposit due on September 24, 1995.
(3)
Filing requirement.
E must file a return on Form 5300.26 for the third calendar quarter of 1995 reporting E's $38,000 tax liability (§ 53.153(a)). E must also pay $8,000, the underpayment amount by which the total tax liability for the third calendar quarter exceeds the total tax liability for the look-back quarter, by the due date of the return.

Any claims for credit or refund of an overpayment of a tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code shall be made in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart and the applicable provisions of 27 CFR 70.123 (Procedure and Administration). A claim on TTB Form 2635 (5620.8) is not required in the case of a claim for credit, but the amount of the credit shall be claimed by entering that amount as a credit on a return of tax under this subpart filed by the person making the claim. In this regard, see § 53.185.
§ 53.172
Credit or refund of manufacturers tax under chapter 32.
(a)
Overpayment not described in section 6416(b)(2) of the Code
—(1)
Claims included.
This paragraph applies only to claims for credit or refund of an overpayment of manufacturers tax imposed by Chapter 32. It does not apply, however, to a claim for credit or refund on any overpayment described in paragraph (b) of this section which arises by reason of the application of section 6416(b)(2) of the Code.
(2)
Supporting evidence required.
No credit or refund of any overpayment to which this paragraph (a) applies shall be allowed unless the person who paid the tax submits with the claim a written consent of the ultimate purchaser to the allowance of the credit or refund, or submits with the claim a statement, supported by sufficient available evidence, asserting that:
(i) The person has neither included the tax in the price of the article with respect to which it was imposed nor collected the amount of the tax from a vendee, and identifying the nature of the evidence available to establish these facts, or
(ii) The person has repaid the amount of the tax to the ultimate purchaser of the article.
(3)
Ultimate purchaser
—(i)
General rule.
The term “ultimate purchaser”, as used in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, means the person who purchased the article for consumption, or for use in the manufacture of other articles and not for resale in the form in which purchased.
(ii)
Special rule under section 6416(a)(3)
—(A)
Conditions to be met.
If tax under chapter 32 of the Code is paid in respect of an article and the appropriate TTB officer determines that the article is not subject to tax under chapter 32, the term “ultimate purchaser”, as used in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, includes any wholesaler, jobber, distributor, or retailer who, on the 15th day after the date of the determination holds for sale any such article with respect to which tax has been paid, if the claim for credit or refund of the overpayment in respect of the articles held for sale by wholesaler, jobber, distributor, or retailer is filed on or before the date on which the person who
paid the tax is required to file a return for the period ending with the first calendar quarter which begins more than 60 days after the date of the determination by the appropriate TTB officer.
(B)
Supporting statement.
A claim for credit or refund of an overpayment of tax in respect of an article as to which a wholesaler, jobber, distributor, or retailer is the ultimate purchaser, as provided in this paragraph (a)(3)(ii), must be supported by a statement that the person filing the claim has a statement, by each wholesaler, jobber, distributor, or retailer whose articles are covered by the claim, showing total inventory, by model number and quantity, of all such articles purchased tax-paid and held for sale as of 12:01 a.m. of the 15th day after the date of the determination by the appropriate TTB officer that the article is not subject to tax under chapter 32 of the Code.
(C)
Inventory requirement.
The inventory shall not include any such article, title to which, or possession of which, has previously been transferred to any person for purposes of consumption unless the entire purchase price was repaid to the person or credited to the person's account and the sale was rescinded or any such article purchased by the wholesaler, jobber, distributor, or retailer as a component part of, or on or in connection with, another article. An article in transit at the first moment of the 15th day after the date of the determination is regarded as being held by the person to whom it was shipped, except that if title to the article does not pass until delivered to the person the article is deemed to be held by the shipper.
(b)
Overpayments described in section 6416(b)(2) of the Code
—(1)
Claims included.
This paragraph applies only to claims for credit or refund of amounts paid as tax under chapter 32 of the Code that are determined to be overpayments by reason of section 6416(b)(2) of the Code (relating to tax payments in respect of certain uses, sales, or resales of a taxable article).
(2)
Supporting evidence required.
No credit or refund of an overpayment to which this paragraph (b) applies shall be allowed unless the person who paid the tax submits with the claim a statement, supported by sufficient available evidence, asserting that:
(i) The person neither included the tax in the price of the article with respect to which it was imposed nor collected the amount of the tax from a vendee, and identifying the nature of the evidence available to establish these facts, or
(ii) The person repaid, or agreed to repay, the amount of the tax to the ultimate vendor of the article, or
(iii) The person has secured, and will submit upon request of the appropriate TTB officer, the written consent of the ultimate vendor to the allowance of the credit or refund.
(3)
Ultimate vendor—General rule.
The term
ultimate vendor,
as used in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, means the seller making the sale which gives rise to the overpayment or which last precedes the exportation or use which has given rise to the overpayment.
(c)
Overpayments not included.
This section does not apply to any overpayment determined under section 6416(b)(1) of the Code (relating to price readjustments), section 6416(b)(3)(A) of the Code (relating to certain cases in which refund or credit is allowable to the manufacturer who uses, in the further manufacture of a second article, a taxable article purchased by the manufacturer taxpaid), or section 6416(b)(5) of the Code (relating to the return to the seller of certain installment accounts which the seller had previously sold). In this regard, see §§ 53.173, 53.180, and 53.183.
[T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991, as amended by T.D. ATF-312, 56 FR 31084, July 9, 1991]
§ 53.173
Price readjustments causing overpayments of manufacturers tax.
In the case of any payment of tax under chapter 32 of the Code that is determined to be an overpayment by reason of a price readjustment within the meaning of section 6416(b)(1) of the Code and § 53.174 or § 53.175, the person who paid the tax may file a claim for refund of the overpayment or may claim credit for the overpayment on any return of tax under this subpart which the person subsequently files. Price readjustments may not be anticipated. However, if the readjustment
has actually been made before the return is filed for the period in which the sale was made, the tax to be reported in respect of the sale may, at the election of the taxpayer, be based either:
(a) On the price as so readjusted, or
(b) On the original sale price and a credit or refund claimed in respect of the price readjustment.
A price readjustment will be deemed to have been made at the time when the amount of the readjustment has been refunded to the vendor or the vendor has been informed that the vendor's account has been credited with the amount. No interest shall be paid on any credit or refund allowed under this section. For provisions relating to the evidence required in support of a claim for credit or refund, see 27 CFR 70.123 (Procedure and Administration), § 53.172(a)(2) and § 53.176. For provisions authorizing the taking of a credit in lieu of filing a claim for refund, see section 6416(d) of the Code and § 53.185.
[T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991, as amended by T.D. ATF-312, 56 FR 31084, July 9, 1991]
§ 53.174
Determination of price readjustments.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Rules of usual application
—(i)
Amount treated as overpayment.
If the tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code has been paid and thereafter the price of the article on which the tax was based is readjusted, that part of the tax which is proportionate to the part of the price which is repaid or credited to the purchaser is considered to be an overpayment. A readjustment of price to the purchaser may occur by reason of:
(A) The return of the article,
(B) The repossession of the article,
(C) The return or repossession of the covering or container of the article, or
(D) A bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance against the price at which the article was sold.
(ii)
Requirements of price readjustment.
A price readjustment will not be deemed to have been made unless the person who paid the tax either:
(A) Repays part or all of the purchase price in cash to the vendee,
(B) Credits the vendee's account for part or all of the purchase price, or
(C) Directly or indirectly reimburses a third party for part or all of the purchase price for the direct benefit of the vendee.
In addition, to be deemed a price readjustment, the payment or credit must be contractually or economically related to the taxable sale that the payment or credit purports to adjust. Thus, commissions or bonuses paid to a manufacturer's own agents or salesperson for selling the manufacturer's taxable products are not price readjustments for purposes of this section, since those commissions or bonuses are not paid or credited either to the manufacturer's vendee or to a third party for the vendee's benefit. On the other hand, a bonus paid by the manufacturer to a dealer's salesperson for negotiating the sale of a taxable article previously sold to the dealer by the manufacturer is considered to be a readjustment of the price on the original sale of the taxable article, regardless of whether the payment to the salesperson is made directly by the manufacturer or to the salesperson through the dealer. In such a case, the payment is related to the sale of a taxable article and is made for the benefit of the dealer because it is made to the dealer's salesperson to encourage the sale of a product owned by the dealer. Similarly, payments or credits made by a manufacturer to a vendee as reimbursement of interest expense incurred by the vendee in connection with a so-called “free flooring” arrangement for the purchase of taxable articles is a price readjustment, regardless of whether the payment or credit is made directly to the vendee or to the vendee's creditor on behalf of the vendee.
(iii)
Limitation on credit or refund.
The credit or refund allowable by reason of a price readjustment in respect of the sale of a taxable article may not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to the total tax originally due and payable on the article as the amount of the tax-included readjustment bears to the original tax-included sale price of the article.
(2)
Rules of special application
—(i)
Constructive sale price.
If, in the case of a taxable sale, the tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code is based on a constructive sale price determined
under any paragraph of section 4216(b) of the Code and §§ 53.94-53.97, as determined without reference to section 4218 of the Code, then any price readjustment made with respect to the sale may be taken into account under this section only to the extent that the price readjustment reduces the actual sale price of the article below the constructive sale price.

# Examples:
(A) A manufacturer sells a taxable article at retail for $110 tax included. Under section 4216(b)(1) of the Code the constructive sale price (tax included) of the article is determined to be $93. Thereafter, the manufacturer grants an allowance of $10 to the purchaser, which reduces the actual selling price (tax included) to $100. Since the readjustment price exceeds the amount of the constructive sale price, this readjustment is not recognized as a price readjustment under this section.
(B) Subsequently, the manufacturer extends to the purchaser an additional price allowance of $10, thereby reducing the actual sale price to $90. Since the actual sale price is now $3 less than the constructive sale price of $93, the manufacturer has overpaid by the amount of tax attributable to the $3. Assuming the tax rate involved is 10 percent, and the prices involved are tax-included, the overpayment of tax would be $0.27, determined as follows:
EC05OC91.021
(ii)
Price determined under section 4223(b)(2) of the Code.
If a manufacturer (within the meaning of section 4223(a) of the Code) to whom an article is sold or resold free of tax in accordance with the provisions of section 4221(a)(1) of the Code for use in further manufacture diverts the article to a taxable use or sells it in a taxable sale, and pursuant to the provisions of section 4223(b)(2) of the Code computes the tax liability in respect of the use or sale on the price for which the article was sold to the manufacturer or on the price at which the article was sold by the actual manufacturer, a reduction of the price on which the tax was based does not result in an overpayment within the meaning of section 6416(b)(1) of the Code of this section. Moreover, if a manufacturer purchases an article tax free and computes the tax in respect of a subsequent sale of the article pursuant to the provisions of section 4223(b)(2) of the Code, an overpayment does not arise by reason of readjustment of the price for which the article was sold by the manufacturer except where the readjustment results from the return or repossession of the article by the manufacturer, and all of the purchase price is refunded by the manufacturer. See, however, paragraph (b)(4) of this section as to repurchased articles.
(b)
Return of an article
—(1)
Price readjustment.
If a taxable article is returned to the manufacturer who paid the tax imposed by Chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of the article, a price readjustment giving rise to an overpayment results:
(i) If the article is returned before use, and all of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account, or
(ii) If the article is returned under an express or implied warranty as to quality or service, and all or a part of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account, or
(iii) If title is still in the seller, as, for example, in the case of certain installment sales contracts, and all or a part of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account.
(2)
Return of purchase price.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if all of the purchase price of an article has been returned to the vendee, except for an amount retained by the manufacturer pursuant to contract as reimbursement of expense incurred in connection with the sale (such as a handling or restocking charge), all of the purchase price is considered to have been returned to the vendee.
(3)
Taxability of subsequent sale or use.
If, under any of the conditions described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an article is returned to the manufacturer who paid the tax and all of the purchase price is returned to the vendee, the sale is considered to have been rescinded. Any subsequent sale or use of the article by the manufacturer will be considered to be an original sale or use of the article by the manufacturer which is subject to tax under Chapter 32 of the Code unless otherwise exempt. If under any such condition an article is returned to the manufacturer who paid the tax and only part of the purchase price is returned to the vendee, a subsequent sale of the article by the manufacturer will be subject to tax to the extent that the sale price exceeds the adjusted sale price of the first taxable sale.
(4)
Treatment of other transactions as repurchases.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a price readjustment will not result when a taxable article is returned to the manufacturer who paid the tax on the sale of the article, even though all or a part of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account, since such a transaction will be considered to be a repurchase of the article by the manufacturer.
(c)
Repossession of an article.
If a taxable article is repossessed by the manufacturer who paid the tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of the article, and all or a part of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account, a price readjustment giving rise to an overpayment will result. However, if the manufacturer later resells the repossessed article for a price in excess of the original adjusted sale price, the manufacturer will be liable for tax under chapter 32 of the Code to the extent that the resale price exceeds the original adjusted sale price.
(d)
Return or repossession of covering or container.
If the covering or container of a taxable article is returned to, or repossessed by the manufacturer who paid the tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of the article, and all or a portion of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account by reason of the return or repossession of the covering or container, a price adjustment giving rise to an overpayment will result. If a taxable article is considered to have been repurchased, as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, and the covering or container accompanies the taxable article as part of the transaction, the covering or container will also be considered to have been repurchased.
(e)
Bona fide discounts, rebates, or allowances
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in § 53.175 (relating to readjustments in respect of local advertising), the basic consideration in determining, for purposes of this section, whether a bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance has been made is whether the price actually by, or charged against, the purchaser has in fact been reduced by subsequent transactions between the parties. Generally, the price will be considered to have been readjusted by reason of a bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance, only if the manufacturer who made the taxable sale repays a part of the purchase price in cash to the vendee, or credits the vendee's account, or directly or indirectly reimburses a third party for part or all of the purchase price for the direct benefit of the vendee, in consideration of factors which, if taken into account at the time of the original transaction, would have resulted at that time in a lower sale price. For example, a price readjustment will be considered to have been made when a bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance is given in consideration of such factors as prompt payment, quantity buying over a specified period, the vendee's inventory of an article when new models are introduced, or a general price reduction affecting articles held in stock by the vendee as of a certain date. On the other hand, repayments made to the vendee do not effectuate price readjustments if given in consideration of circumstances under which the vendee has incurred, or is required to incur, an expense which, if treated as a separate item in the original transaction, would have been incudable in the price of the article for purposes of computing the tax.
Examples.
The provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1).
B, a manufacturer of shotguns, bills its distributors in a specified amount per shotgun purchased by them. Thereafter, B issues to each distributor a credit memorandum in the amount of X dollars for each demonstration by the distributor of the shotguns at a sporting goods exhibition. The credit which B allows the distributor for demonstration of B's product does not effect a readjustment of price.

# Example (2).
C, a manufacturer of firearms, bills its dealers in a specified amount per firearm purchased by them. Thereafter, C remits to the dealer X dollars of the original sale price for each firearm sold by the dealer. An additional amount of Y dollars is paid to the dealer upon a showing by the dealer that the dealer has paid Y dollars to the salesperson who made the sale. In this case, the X dollars paid to the dealer by C constitutes a bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance since payment of such amount is in the nature of a price reduction. In addition, the Y dollars paid to the dealer in reimbursement for the amount paid by the dealer to the salesperson who made the sale, also constitutes a bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance.
(2)
Inability to collect price.
A charge-off of an amount outstanding in an open account, due to inability to collect, is not a bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance and does not, in and of itself, give rise to a price readjustment within the meaning of this section.
(3)
Loss or damage in transit.
If title to an article has passed to the vendee, the subsequent loss, damage, or destruction of the article while in the possession of a carrier for delivery to the vendee does not, in and of itself, affect the price at which the article was sold. However, if the article was sold under a contract providing that, if the article was lost, damaged, or destroyed in transit, title would revert to the vendor and the vendor would reimburse the vendee in full for the sale price, then the original sale is considered to have been rescinded. The vendor is entitled to credit or refund of the tax paid upon reimbursement of the full tax-included sale price to the vendee.
§ 53.175
Readjustment for local advertising charges.
(a)
In general.
If a manufacturer has paid the tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code on the price of any article sold by the manufacturer and thereafter has repaid a portion of the price to the purchaser or any subsequent vendee in reimbursement of expenses for local advertising of the article or any other article sold by the manufacturer which is taxable at the same rate under the same section of chapter 32 of the Code, the reimbursement will be considered a price readjustment constituting an overpayment which the manufacturer may claim as a credit or refund. The amount of the reimbursement may not, however, exceed the limitation provided by section 4216(e)(2) of the Code and § 53.101, determined as of the close of the calendar quarter in which the reimbursement is made or as of the close of any subsequent calendar quarter of the same calendar year in which it is made. The term “local advertising,” as used in this section, has the same meaning as prescribed by section 4216(e)(4) of the Code and includes generally, advertising which is broadcast over a radio station or television station, or appears in a newspaper or magazine, or is displayed by means of an outdoor advertising sign or poster.
(b)
Local advertising charges excluded from taxable price in one year but repaid in following year
—(1)
Determination of price readjustments for year in which charge is repaid.
If the tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code was paid with respect to local advertising charges that were excluded in computing the taxable price of an article sold in any calendar year but are not repaid to the manufacturer's purchaser or any subsequent vendee before May 1 of the following calendar year, the subsequent repayment of those charges by the manufacturer in reimbursement of expenses for local advertising will be considered a price readjustment constituting an overpayment which the manufacturer may claim as a credit or refund. The amount of the reimbursement may not, however, exceed the limitation provided by section 4216(e)(2) of the Code and § 53.101, determined as of the close of the calendar quarter in which the reimbursement is made or as of the close of any subsequent calendar quarter of the same calendar year in which it is made.
(2)
Redetermination of price readjustments for year in which charge was made.
If the tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code was paid with respect to local advertising charges that were excluded in computing the taxable price of an article sold in any calendar year but are not repaid to the manufacturer's purchaser or any subsequent vendor before May 1 of the following calendar year, the manufacturer may make a redetermination, in respect of the calendar year in which the charge was made, of the price readjustments constituting an overpayment which the manufacturer may claim as a credit or refund. This redetermination may be made by excluding the local advertising charges made in the calendar year that became taxable as of May 1 of the following calendar year.
§ 53.176
Supporting evidence required in case of price readjustments.
No credit or refund of an overpayment arising by reason of a price readjustment described in § 53.174 or § 53.175 shall be allowed unless the manufacturer who paid the tax submits a statement, supported by sufficient available evidence:
(a) Describing the circumstances which gave rise to the price readjustment,
(b) Identifying the article in respect of which the price readjustment was allowed,
(c) Showing the price at which the article was sold, the amount of tax paid in respect of the article, and the date on which the tax was paid,
(d) Giving the name and address of the purchaser to whom the article was sold, and
(e) Showing the amount repaid to the purchaser or credited to the purchaser's account.
§ 53.177
Certain exportations, uses, sales, or resales causing overpayments of tax.
In the case of any payment of tax under chapter 32 of the Code that is determined to be an overpayment by reason of certain exportations, uses, sales, or resales described in section 6416(b)(2) of the Code and § 53.178, the person who paid the tax may file a claim for refund of the overpayment or, in the case of overpayments under chapter 32 of the Code, may claim credit for the overpayment on any return of tax under this subpart which the person subsequently files. However, under the circumstances described in section 6416(c) of the Code and § 53.184, the overpayments under chapter 32 may be refunded to an exporter or shipper. No interest shall be paid on any credit or refund allowed under this section. For provisions relating to the evidence required in support of a claim for credit or refund under this section, see 27 CFR 70.123 (Procedure and Administration) and 53.179. For provisions authorizing the taking of a credit in lieu of filing a claim for refund, see section 6416(d) of the Code and § 53.185.
§ 53.178
Exportations, uses, sales, and resales included.
(a)
In general.
The payment of tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of any article, will be considered to be an overpayment by reason of any exportation, use, sale, or resale described in any one of paragraphs (b) to (e), inclusive, of this section. This section applies only in those cases where the exportation, use, sale, or resale (or any combination thereof) referred to in any one or more of these paragraphs occurs before any other use. If any article is sold or resold for a use described in any one of these paragraphs and is not in fact so used, the paragraph is treated in all respects as inapplicable.
(b)
Exportation of tax-paid articles.
A payment of tax under chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of any article will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(2)(A) of the Code if the article is by any person exported to a foreign country or shipped to a possession of the United States. It is immaterial for purposes of this paragraph, whether the person who made the taxable sale had knowledge at the time of the sale that the article was being purchased for export to a foreign country or shipment to a possession of the United States. See § 53.184 for the circumstances under which a claim for refund by reason of the exportation of an article may be claimed by the exporter or shipper, rather than by the person who paid the tax. For definition of the
term “possession of the United States”, see § 53.11.
(c)
Supplies for vessels or aircraft.
A payment of tax under chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of any article, will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(2)(B) of the Code if the article is used by any person, or is sold by any person for use by the purchaser, as supplies for vessels or aircraft. The term “supplies for vessels or aircraft”, as used in this paragraph, has the same meaning as when used in sections 4221(a)(3), 4221(d)(3), and 4221(e)(1) of the Code, and the regulations thereunder (§ 53.134(b)(1)).
(d)
Use by State or local government.
A payment of tax under chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of any article will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(2)(C) of the Code if the article is sold by any person to a State, any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia for the exclusive use of a State, any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia. For provisions relating to tax-free sales to a State, any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, see section 4221(a)(4) of the Code and § 53.131.
(e)
Use by nonprofit educational organization.
A payment of tax under chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of any article will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(2)(D) of the Code if the article is sold by any person to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use. The term “nonprofit educational organization”, as used in this paragraph (e), has the same meaning as when used in section 4221 (a)(5) or (d)(5) of the Code, whichever applies, and the regulations under § 53.136.
§ 53.179
Supporting evidence required in case of manufacturers tax involving exportations, uses, sales, or resales.
(a)
Evidence to be submitted by claimant.
No claim for credit or refund of an overpayment, within the meaning of section 6416(b)(2) of the Code and § 53.178, of tax under chapter 32 of the Code shall be allowed unless the person who paid the tax submits with the claim the evidence required by § 53.172(b)(2) and a statement, supported by sufficient available evidence:
(1) Showing the amount claimed in respect of each category of exportations, uses, sales, or resales on which the claim is based and which give rise to a right of credit or refund under section 6416(b)(2) of the Code and § 53.177,
(2) Identifying the article, both as to nature and quantity, in respect of which credit or refund is claimed,
(3) Showing the amount of tax paid in respect of the article or articles and the dates of payment, and
(4) Indicating that the person claiming a credit or refund possesses evidence (as set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) that the article has been exported, or has been used, sold, or resold in a manner or for a purpose which gives rise to an overpayment within the meaning of section 6416(b)(2) of the Code and § 53.178.
(b)
Evidence required to be in possession of claimant
—(1)
Evidence required under paragraph (a)(4)
—(i)
In general.
The evidence required to be retained by the person who paid the tax, as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, must, in the case of an article exported, consist of proof of exportation in the form prescribed in § 53.133 or must, in the case of other articles sold tax-paid by that person, consist of a certificate, executed and signed by the ultimate purchaser of the article, in the form prescribed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. However, if the article to which the claim relates has passed through a chain of sales from the person who paid the tax to the ultimate purchaser, the evidence required to be retained by the person who paid the tax may consist of a certificate, executed and signed by the ultimate vendor of the article, in the form provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, rather than the proof of exportation itself or the certificate of the ultimate purchaser.
(ii)
Certificate of ultimate purchaser.
(A) The certificate executed and signed by the ultimate purchaser of the article to which the claim relates must identify the article, both as to nature and quantity; show the address of the ultimate purchaser of the article, and the name and address of the ultimate vendor of the article; and describe the
use actually made of the article in sufficient detail to establish that credit or refund is due, except that the use to be made of the article must be described in lieu of actual use if the claim is made by reason of the sale or resale of an article for a specified use which gives rise to the overpayment.
(B) If the certificate sets forth the use to be made of any article, rather than its actual use, it must show that the ultimate purchaser has agreed to notify the claimant if the article is not in fact used as specified in the certificate.
(C) The certificate must also contain a statement that the ultimate purchaser understands that the ultimate purchaser and any other party may, for fraudulent use of the certificate, be subject to all applicable criminal penalties under the Internal Revenue Code.
(D) A purchase order will be acceptable in lieu of a separate certificate of the ultimate purchaser if it contains all the information required by this paragraph.
(iii)
Certificate of ultimate vendor.
Any certificate executed and signed by an ultimate vendor as evidence to be retained by the person who paid the tax as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section may be executed with respect to any one or more overpayments by the person which arose under section 6416(b)(2) and § 53.178 by reason of exportations, uses, sales or resales, occurring within any period of not more than 12 consecutive calendar quarters, the beginning and ending dates of which are specified in the certificate. A certificate supporting a claim for credit or refund under this section shall contain the following:
(A) Name of ultimate vendor if other than person executing the certificate.
(B) Statement that article(s) was purchased by the ultimate vendor tax-paid and was thereafter exported, used, sold, or resold.
(C) Description of proof which supports exportation or certificate as to use executed by ultimate purchaser.
(D) Statement that ultimate vendor retains such proof for 3 years from the date of the statement and will, upon request, supply such proof at any time within such 3 year period to the taxpayer to establish that credit or refund is due in respect of the article.
(E) Statement that to the best knowledge and belief of the person executing the certificate, no statement in respect of the proof of exportation or certificate has previously been executed and that the person executing the certificate understands that any fraudulent use of the certificate may subject the person executing the certificate or any other party to all applicable criminal penalties under the Code.
(F) Name, title, address and signature of person executing certificate and date signed.
(G) Description of all articles covered by the certificate, with the corresponding vendor's invoice number, date of resale of article, quantity, whether articles were exported or used and the use made of article or to be made of article.
(iv)
TTB F 5600.33.
TTB F 5600.33, Statement of Ultimate Vendor, which is available as provided in § 53.21(b), when completed, contains all necessary information for a properly executed certificate. Additional copies may be reproduced as needed.
(2)
Repayment or consent of ultimate vendor.
If the person claiming credit or refund or an overpayment to which this section applies has repaid, or agreed to repay, the amount of the overpayment to the ultimate vendor or if the ultimate vendor consents to the allowance of the credit or refund, a statement to that effect, signed by the ultimate vendor, must be shown on, or made a part of, the supporting evidence required under this section to be retained by the person claiming the credit or refund. In this regard, see § 53.172(b)(2).
[T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991, as amended by T.D. ATF-380, 61 FR 37007, July 16, 1996; T.D. TTB-44, 71 FR 16958, Apr. 4, 2006; T.D. TTB-196, 89 FR 87950, Nov. 6, 2024]
§ 53.180
Tax-paid articles used for further manufacture and causing overpayments of tax.
In the case of any payment of tax under chapter 32 of the Code that is determined to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(3) of the Code and
§ 53.181 by reason of the sale of an article, directly or indirectly, by the manufacturer of the article to a subsequent manufacturer who uses the article in further manufacture of a second article or who sells the article with, or as a part of, the second article manufactured or produced by the subsequent manufacturer, the subsequent manufacturer may file claim for refund of the overpayment or may claim credit for the overpayment on any return of tax under this subpart subsequently filed. No interest shall be paid on any credit or refund allowed under this section. For provisions relating to the evidence required in support of a claim for credit or refund, see 27 CFR § 70.123 (Procedure and Administration), 53.172 and 53.182. For provisions authorizing the taking of a credit in lieu of filing a claim for refund, see section 6416(d) of the Code and § 53.185.
§ 53.181
Further manufacture included.
(a)
In general.
The payment of tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of any article by a manufacturer of the article will be considered to be an overpayment by reason of any use in further manufacture, or sale as part of a second manufactured article, described in paragraph (b) of this section. This section applies in those cases where the exportation, use, or sale (or any combination of those activities) referred to in this paragraph occurs before any other use.
(b)
Use of tax-paid articles in further manufacture described in section 6416(b)(3)(A) of the Code.
A payment of tax under chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of any article, directly or indirectly, by the manufacturer of the article to a subsequent manufacturer will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(3)(A) of the Code if the article is used by the subsequent manufacturer as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, a second article manufactured or produced by the subsequent manufacturer which is taxable under chapter 32 of the Code. For this purpose it is immaterial whether the second article is sold or otherwise disposed of, or if sold, whether the sale is a taxable sale. Any article to which this paragraph applies which would have been used in the manufacture or production of a second article, except for the fact that it was broken or rendered useless in the process of manufacturing or producing the second article, will be considered to have been used as a component part of the second article.
[T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991, as amended by T.D. ATF-312, 56 FR 31084, July 9, 1991]
§ 53.182
Supporting evidence required in case of tax-paid articles used for further manufacture.
(a)
Evidence to be submitted by claimant.
No claim for credit or refund of an overpayment, within the meaning of section 6416(b)(3) of the Code and § 53.181 shall be allowed unless the subsequent manufacturer submits with the claim the evidence required by § 53.132 and a statement, supported by sufficient available evidence:
(1) Showing the amount claimed in respect of each category of exportations, uses, or sales on which the claim is based and which give rise to a right of credit or refund under section 6416(b)(3) of the Code and § 53.180,
(2) Showing the name and address of the manufacturer, producer, or importer of the article in respect of which credit or refund is claimed,
(3) Identifying the article, both as to nature and quantity, in respect of which credit or refund is claimed,
(4) Showing the amount of tax paid in respect of the article by the manufacturer or producer of the article and the date of payment.
(5) Indicating that the article was used by the claimant as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, a second article manufactured or produced by the manufacturer or was sold on or in connection with, or with the sale of, a second article manufactured or produced by the manufacturer, and
(6) Identifying the second article, both as to nature and quantity.
(b)
Evidence required to be in possession of claimant

§ 53.183
Return of installment accounts causing overpayments of tax.
(a)
In general.
In the case of any payment of tax under section 4216(d)(1) of the Code in respect of the sale of any installment account that is determined to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(5) of the Code and paragraph (b) of this section upon return of the installment account, the person who paid the tax may file a claim for refund of the overpayment or may claim credit for the overpayment on any return of tax under this subpart which that person subsequently files. No interest shall be paid on any credit or refund allowed under this section. For provisions relating to the evidence required in support of a claim for credit or refund under this section, see 27 CFR 70.123 (Procedure and Administration) and paragraph (c) of this section. For provisions authorizing the taking of a credit in lieu of filing a claim for refund, see section 6416(d) of the Code and § 53.185.
(b)
Overpayment of tax allocable to repaid consideration.
The payment of tax imposed by section 4216(d)(1) of the Code on the sale of an installment account by the manufacturer will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(5) of the Code to the extent of the tax allocable to any consideration repaid or credited to the purchaser of the installment account upon the return of the account to the manufacturer pursuant to the agreement under which the account originally was sold, if the readjustment of the consideration occurs pursuant to the provisions of the agreement. The tax allocable to the repaid or credited consideration is the amount which bears the same ratio to the total tax paid under section 4216(d)(1) of the Code with respect to the installment account as the amount of consideration repaid or credited to the purchaser bears to the total consideration for which the account was sold. This paragraph (b) does not apply where an installment account is originally sold pursuant to the order of, or subject to the approval of, a court of competent jurisdiction in a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding.
(c)
Evidence to be submitted by claimant.
No claim for credit or refund of an overpayment, within the meaning of section 6416(b)(5) of the Code and paragraph (b) of this section, of tax under section 4216(d)(1) of the Code shall be allowed unless the person who paid the tax submits with the claim a statement, supported by sufficient available evidence, indicating:
(1) The name and address of the person to whom the installment account was sold,
(2) The amount of tax due under section 4216(d)(1) of the Code by reason of the sale of the installment account, the amount of the tax paid under section 4216(d)(1) with respect to the sale, and the date of payment,
(3) The amount for which the installment account was sold,
(4) The amount which was repaid or credited to the purchaser of the account by reason of the return of the account to the person claiming the credit or refund, and
(5)(i) The fact that the amount repaid or credited to the purchaser of the account was so repaid or credited pursuant to the agreement under which the account was sold, and
(ii) The fact that the account was returned to the manufacturer pursuant to that agreement.
§ 53.184
Refund to exporter or shipper.
(a)
In general.
Any payment of tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code that is determined to be an overpayment within the meaning of section 6416(b)(2)(A) of the Code and §§ 53.178 and 53.179, by reason of the exportation of any article may be refunded to the exporter or shipper of the article pursuant to section 6416(c) of the Code, if:
(1) The exporter or shipper files a claim for refund of the overpayment, and
(2) The person who paid the tax waives the right to claim credit or refund of the tax.
No interest shall be paid on any refund allowed under this section. For provisions relating to the evidence required in support of a claim under this paragraph, see 27 CFR 70.123 (Procedure and Administration) and paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Supporting evidence required.
No claim for refund of any overpayment of tax to which this section applies shall be allowed unless the exporter or shipper submits with that claim proof of exportation in the form prescribed by § 53.133, and a statement, signed by the person who paid the tax, showing:
(1) That the person who paid the tax waives the right to claim credit or refund of the tax, and
(2) The amount of tax paid on the sale of the article and the date of payment.
§ 53.185
Credit on returns.
Any person entitled to claim refund of any overpayment of tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code may, in lieu of claiming refund of the overpayment, claim credit for the overpayment on any return of tax under this subpart subsequently filed. Any such credit claimed on a return must be supported by the evidence prescribed in the applicable regulations in this subpart and 27 CFR 70.123 (Procedure and Administration).
§ 53.186
Accounting procedures for like articles.
(a)
Identification of manufacturer.
In applying section 6416 of the Code and the regulations thereunder, a person who has purchased like articles from various manufacturers may determine the particular manufacturer from whom that person purchased any one of those articles by a first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, by a last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or by any other consistent method approved by the appropriate TTB officer. For the first year for which a person makes a determination under this section, the person may adopt any one of the following methods without securing prior approval by the appropriate TTB officer.
(1) FIFO method.
(2) LIFO method.
(3) Any method by which the actual manufacturer of the article is in fact identified.
(4) Any other method of determining the manufacturer of a particular article must be approved by the appropriate TTB officer before its adoption. After any method for identifying the manufacturer has been properly adopted, it may not be changed without first securing the consent of the appropriate TTB officer.
(b)
Determining amount of tax paid.
In applying section 6416 and §§ 53.171-53.186, if the identity of the manufacturer of any article has been determined by a person pursuant to a method prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, that manufacturer of the article must determine the tax paid under Chapter 32 of the Code with respect to that article consistently with the method used in identifying the manufacturer.

Canvass for taxable persons and objects.
Each appropriate TTB officer shall, to the extent deemed practicable, cause officers or employees under the appropriate TTB officer's supervision and control to proceed, from time to time, and inquire after and concerning all persons therein who may be liable to pay any tax, imposed under provisions of 26 U.S.C. enforced and administered by the Bureau, and all persons owning or having the care and management of any objects with respect to which such tax is imposed.
[T.D. ATF-331, 57 FR 40327, Sept. 3, 1992, as amended by T.D. ATF-450, 66 FR 29023, May 29, 2001]
§ 70.22
Examination of books and witnesses.
(a)
In general.
For the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any return, making a return where none has been made, determining the liability of any person for any tax (including any interest, additional amount, addition to the tax, or civil penalty) imposed under provisions of the IRC enforced and administered by the Bureau or the liability at law or in equity of any transferee or fiduciary of any person in respect of any such tax, or collecting any such liability, or inquiring into any offense connected with the administration or enforcement of the internal revenue laws that are administered and enforced by the Bureau, any appropriate TTB officer may examine any books, papers, records or other data which may be relevant or material to such inquiry; and take such testimony of the person concerned, under oath, as may be relevant to such inquiry.
(b)
Summonses.
For the purposes described in paragraph (a) of this section the appropriate TTB officers are authorized to summon the person liable for tax or required to perform the act, or any officer or employee of such person, or any person having possession, custody, or care of books of accounts
containing entries relating to the business of the person liable for tax or required to perform the act, or any person deemed proper, to appear before a designated officer or employee of the Bureau at a time and place named in the summons and to produce such books, papers, records, or other data, and to give such testimony, under oath, as may be relevant or material to such inquiry; and take such testimony of the person concerned, under oath, as may be relevant or material to such inquiry. Such TTB officer may designate an appropriate TTB officer as the individual before whom a person summoned pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 7602 shall appear. Any such officer, when so designated in a summons, is authorized to take testimony under oath of the person summoned and to receive and examine books, papers, records, or other data produced in compliance with the summons. The authority to issue a summons may not be redelegated. See § 70.302 of this part for rules concerning payments to certain persons who are summoned to give information to the Bureau under 26 U.S.C. 7602 and this section.

(a)
In general.
A summons issued under 26 U.S.C. 7602 shall be served by an attested copy delivered in hand to the person to whom it is directed, or left at his last and usual place of abode. The certificate of service signed by the person serving the summons shall be evidence of the facts it states on the hearing of an application for the enforcement of the summons. When the summons requires the production of books, papers, records, or other data, it shall be sufficient if such books, papers, records, or other data are described with reasonable certainty.
(b)
Persons who may serve summonses.
Any appropriate TTB officer may serve a summons issued under 26 U.S.C. 7602.

(b)
Persons who may apply for an attachment.
Appropriate TTB officers are authorized to apply for an attachment as provided in paragraph (a) of this section. The authority to apply for an attachment for the enforcement of a summons may not be redelegated.

§ 70.25
Special procedures for third-party summonses.
(a) When the Bureau summons the records of persons defined by 26 U.S.C. 7609(a)(3) as “third-party recordkeepers”, the person about whom information is being gathered must be notified in advance, except when:
(1) The summons is served on the person about whom information is being gathered, or any officer or employee of such person, or
(2) The summons is served to determine whether or not records of the business transactions or affairs of an identified person have been made or kept, or
(3) The summons does not identify the person with respect to whose liability the summons is issued (a “John Doe” summons issued under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 7609(f)), or
(4) The appropriate TTB officer petitions, and the court determines, on the basis of the facts and circumstances alleged, that there is reasonable cause to believe the giving of notice may lead to attempts to conceal, destroy, or alter records relevant to the examination, to prevent the communication of information from other persons through intimidation, bribery, or collusion, or to flee to avoid prosecution, testifying or production of records.
(b) Within 3 days of the day on which the summons was served, the notice required by paragraph (a) of this section shall be served upon the person entitled to notice, or mailed by certified or registered mail to the last known address of such person, or, in the absence of a last known address, left with the person summoned. No examination of any records required to be produced under a summons as to which notice is required under paragraph (a) of this section may be made:
(1) Before the close of the 23rd day after the day notice with respect to the summons is given in the manner provided in this paragraph, or
(2) Where a proceeding under paragraph (c) of this section was begun within the 20-day period referred to in that paragraph and the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section have been met, expect in accordance with an order of the court having jurisdiction of such proceeding or with the consent of the person beginning the proceeding to quash.
(c) If the person about whom information is being gathered has been given notice, that person has the right to institute, until and including the 20th day following the day such notice was served on or mailed, by certified or registered mail, to such notified person, a proceeding to quash the summons. During the time the validity of the summons is being litigated, the statutes of limitation are suspended under 26 U.S.C. 7609(e). Title 26 U.S.C. 7609 does not restrict the authority under 26 U.S.C. 7602 (or under any other provision of law) to examine records and witnesses without serving a summons and without giving notice of an examination.
(26 U.S.C. 7609)
[T.D. ATF-301, 55 FR 47608, Nov. 14, 1990]
§ 70.26
Third-party recordkeepers.
(a)
Definitions
—(1)
Accountant.
A person is an “accountant” under 26 U.S.C. 7609(a)(3)(F) for purposes of determining whether that person is a third-party recordkeeper if the person is registered, licensed, or certified under State law as an accountant.
(2)
Attorney.
A person is an “attorney” under 26 U.S.C. 7609(a)(3)(E) for purposes of determining whether that person is a third-party recordkeeper if the person is admitted to the bar of a State or the District of Columbia.
(3)
Credit cards
—(i)
Person extending credit through credit cards.
The term “person extending credit through credit cards or similar devices” under 26 U.S.C. 7609(a)(3)(C) generally includes any person who issues a credit card. It does not include a seller of goods or services that honors credit cards issued by other parties but does not extend credit on the basis of credit cards or similar devices issued by itself.
(ii) [Reserved]
(iii)
Similar devices to credit cards.
An object is a “similar device” to a credit card under 26 U.S.C. 7609(a)(3)(C) only if it is physical in nature, such as a coupon book, a charge plate, or a letter of credit. Thus, a person who extends credit by requiring credit customers to sign sales slips without requiring use of physical objects issued by that person is not a third-party recordkeeper under 26 U.S.C. 7609(a)(3)(C).
(b)
When third-party recordkeeper status arises.
A person is a “third-party recordkeeper” with respect to a given set of records only if the person made or kept the records in the person's capacity as a third-party recordkeeper. Thus, for instance, an accountant is not a third-party recordkeeper (by reason of being an accountant) with respect to the accountant's records of a sale of property by the accountant to another person. Similarly, a credit card issuer is not a third-party recordkeeper (by reason of being a person extending credit through the use of credit
cards or similar devices) with respect to:
(1) Records relating to noncredit card transactions, such as a cash sale by the issuer to a holder of the issuer's credit card; or
(2) Records relating to transactions involving the use of another issuer's credit card.
(c)
Duty of third-party recordkeeper
—(1)
In General.
Upon receipt of a summons, the third-party recordkeeper (“recordkeeper”) must begin to assemble the summoned records. The recordkeeper must be prepared to produce the summoned records on the date which the summons states the records are to be examined regardless of the institution or anticipated institution of a proceeding to quash or the recordkeeper's intervention (as allowed under 26 U.S.C. 7609(a)(3)(C)) into a proceeding to quash.
(2)
Disclosing recordkeepers not liable
—(i)
In general.
A recordkeeper, or an agent or employee thereof, who makes a disclosure of records as required by this section, in good faith reliance on the “Certificate of the Secretary” (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) or an order of a court requiring production of records, will not be liable for such disclosure to any customer, or to any party with respect to whose tax liability the summons was issued, or to any other person.
(ii)
Certificate of the Secretary.
The appropriate TTB officer may issue to the recordkeeper a “Certificate of the Secretary” stating both:
(A) That the 20-day period, within which a notified person may institute a proceeding to quash the summons has expired; and
(B) That no proceeding has been properly instituted within that period.
The appropriate TTB officer may also issue a “Certificate of the Secretary” to the recordkeeper if the taxpayer, with respect to whose tax liability the summons was issued, expressly consents to the examination of the records summoned.
(3)
Reimbursement of costs.
Recordkeepers may be entitled to reimbursement of their costs of assembling and preparing to produce summoned records, to the extent allowed by 26 U.S.C. 7610, even if the summons ultimately is not enforced.
(26 U.S.C. 7609)
[T.D. ATF-301, 55 FR 47608, Nov. 14, 1990]
§ 70.27
Right to intervene; right to institute a proceeding to quash.
(a)
Notified person.
Under 26 U.S.C. 7609(a), the Bureau must give a notice of summons to any person, other than the person summoned, who is identified in the description of the books and records contained in the summons in order that such person may contest the right of the Bureau to examine the summoned records by instituting a proceeding to quash the summons. Thus, if the Bureau issues a summons to a bank requesting checking account records of more than one person all of whom are identified in the description of the records contained in the summons, then all such persons are notified persons entitled to notice under 26 U.S.C. 7609(a). Therefore, if the Bureau requests the records of a joint bank account of A and B, both of whom are named in the summons, then both A and B are notified persons entitled to notice under 26 U.S.C. 7609(a).
(b)
Right to institute a proceeding to quash
—(1)
In general.
Title 26 U.S.C. 7609(b) grants a notified person the right to institute a proceeding to quash the summons in the United States district court for the district within which the person summoned resides or is found. Jurisdiction of the court is based on 26 U.S.C. 7609(b). The act of filing a petition in district court does not in and of itself institute a proceeding to quash under 26 U.S.C. 7609(b)(2). Rather, the filing of the petition must be coupled with notice as required by 26 U.S.C. 7609(b)(2)(B).
(2)
Elements of institution of a proceeding to quash.
In order to institute a proceeding to quash a summons, the notified person (or the notified person's agent, nominee, or other person acting under the direction or control of the notified person) must, not later than the 20th day following the day the notice of the summons was served on or mailed to such notified person:
(i) File a petition to quash in the name of the notified person in a district court having jurisdiction.
(ii) Notify the Bureau by sending a copy of that petition by registered or certified mail to the Bureau employee and office designated to receive the copy in the notice of summons that was given to the notified person, and
(iii) Notify the recordkeeper by sending to that recordkeeper by registered or certified mail a copy of the petition.
Failure to give timely notice to either the summoned party or the Bureau in the manner described in this paragraph means that the notified person has failed to institute a proceeding to quash and the district court has no jurisdiction to hear the proceeding. Thus, for example, if the notified person mails a copy of the petition to the summoned person but not to the designated Bureau employee and office, the notified person has failed to institute a proceeding to quash. Similarly, if the notified person mails a copy of such petition to the summoned person, but instead of sending a copy of the petition by registered or certified mail to the designated employee and office, the notified person gives the designated employee and office the petition by some other means, the notified person has failed to institute a proceeding to quash.
(3)
Failure to institute a proceeding to quash.
If the notified person fails to institute a proceeding to quash within 20 days following the day the notice was served on or mailed to such notified person, the Bureau may examine the summoned records following the 23rd day after notice of the summons was served on or mailed to the notified person (see 26 U.S.C. 7609(d)(1)).
(c)
Presumption no notice has been mailed.
Title 26 U.S.C. 7609(b)(2)(B) permits a notified person to institute a proceeding to quash by filing a petition in district court and notifying both the Bureau and the summoned person. Unless the notified person has notified both the Bureau and the summoned person in the appropriate manner, the notified person has failed to institute a proceeding to quash. If the copy of the petition has not been delivered to the summoned person or the person and office designated to receive the notice on behalf of the Bureau within 3 days from the close of the 20-day period allowed to institute a proceeding to quash, it is presumed that the notification has not been timely mailed.

§ 70.28
Summonses excepted from 26 U.S.C. 7609 procedures.
(a)
In aid of the collection of certain liabilities
—(1)
In general.
Title 26 U.S.C. 7609(c)(2)(B) contains an exception to the general notice requirement when a summons is issued to a third-party recordkeeper. That section excepts summonses issued in aid of the collection of the liability of any person against whom an assessment has been made or judgment rendered or the liability at law or in equity of any transferee of such a person.
(2)
Examples.
Examples of summonses referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are:
(i) Summonses issued to determine the amount held in a bank in the name of a person against whom an assessment has been made or judgment rendered;
(ii) Summonses issued to enforce transferee liability for a tax which has been assessed.
(b)
Numbered account (or similar arrangement).
Under 26 U.S.C. 7609(c)(2), a summons issued solely to determine the identity of a person having a numbered account (or similar arrangement) with a bank or other institution is excepted from the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 7609. A “numbered account (or similar arrangement)” under 26 U.S.C. 7609(c)(2) is an account through which a person may authorize transactions solely through the use of a number, symbol, code name, or other device not involving the disclosure of the person's identity. A “person having a numbered account (or similar arrangement)” includes the person who opened the account and any person authorized to use the account or to receive records or statements concerning it.
(26 U.S.C. 7609)
[T.D. ATF-301, 55 FR 47610, Nov. 14, 1990]
§ 70.29
Suspension of statutes of limitations.
(a)
Suspension while a proceeding under 26 U.S.C. 7609(b) is pending.
Under
26 U.S.C. 7609(e)(1), the statutes of limitations of 26 U.S.C. 6501 and 6531 are suspended if a notified person with respect to whose liability a summons is issued, or the notified person's agent, nominee, or other person acting under the direction or control of the notified person, takes any action as provided in 26 U.S.C. 7609(b).
(1)
Agent, nominee, etc.
A person is a notified person's agent, nominee, or other person acting under the direction or control of a notified person for purposes of 26 U.S.C. 7609(e) if the person with respect to whose liability the summons is issued has the ability in fact or at law to cause the agent, etc., to take the actions permitted under 26 U.S.C. 7609(b). Thus, in the case of a corporation, direction or control by the notified person may exist even though less than 50 percent of the voting power of the corporation is held by the notified person.
(2)
Period during which a proceeding, etc., is pending.
Under 26 U.S.C. 7609(e), the statute of limitations shall be suspended for the period during which a proceeding and any appeals regarding the enforcement of such summons is pending. This period begins on the date the petition to quash the summons is filed in district court. The period continues until all appeals are disposed of, or until the expiration of the period in which an appeal may be taken or a request for a rehearing may be made. Full compliance, partial compliance, and noncompliance have no effect on the suspension provisions. The periods of limitations which are suspended under 26 U.S.C. 7609(e) are those which apply to the taxable periods to which the summons relates.
(3)
Taking of action as provided in 26 U.S.C. 7609(b).
Title 26 U.S.C. 7609(b) allows intervention by a notified person as a matter of right upon compliance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The phrase “takes any action as provided in subsection (b)”, found in 26 U.S.C. 7609(e), includes any intervention whether or not 26 U.S.C. 7609(b) is specifically mentioned in the order of the court allowing intervention. The phrase also includes the fulfilling of only part of the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 7609(b)(2), relating to the right of a person to institute a proceeding to quash. Thus, for instance, if a notified person notifies a person who has been summoned by sending a copy of the petition by registered or certified mail but does not mail a copy of that notice to the appropriate person and office under 26 U.S.C. 7609(b)(2)(B), the notified person has taken an action under 26 U.S.C. 7609(e).
(b)
Suspension after 6 months of service of summons.
In the absence of the resolution of the third-party recordkeeper's response to the summons described in 26 U.S.C. 7609(c) or the summoned party's response to a summons described in 26 U.S.C. 7609(f) the running of any period of limitations under 26 U.S.C. 6501 or under 26 U.S.C. 6531 with respect to any person with respect to whose liability the summons is issued (other than a person taking action as provided in 26 U.S.C. 7609(b)) shall be suspended for the period:
(1) Beginning on the date which is 6 months after the service of such summons, and
(2) Ending with the final resolution of such response.

The appropriate TTB officer may accept such checks or money orders in payment for internal revenue stamps (authorized under Subtitle E of the Internal Revenue Code or any provision of Subtitle F which relates to Subtitle E) to the extent and under the conditions prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. A check or money order in payment for internal revenue taxes or internal revenue stamps should be made payable to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.

Ultimate liability.
The person who tenders any check (whether certified or uncertified, cashier's, treasurer's, or other form of check) or money order in payment for taxes is not released from liability until the check or money order is paid; and, if the check or money order is not duly paid, the person shall also be liable for all legal penalties and additions, to the same extent as if such check or money order had not been tendered. For the penalty in case a check or money order is not duly paid, see section 6657 of the Internal Revenue Code. For assessment of the amount of a check or money order not duly paid see section 6201(a)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code.

§ 70.63
Computations on returns or other documents.
(a)
Amounts shown on forms.
To the extent permitted by any TTB form or instructions prescribed for use with respect to any TTB return, declaration, statement, or other document, or supporting schedules, any amount required to be reported in such form may be entered at the nearest whole dollar amount. The extent to which, and the conditions under which, such whole dollar amounts may be entered on any form will be set forth in the instructions issued with respect to such form. For the purpose of the computation to the nearest dollar, a fractional part of a dollar shall be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half dollar or more, in which case the amount (determined without regard to the fractional part of a dollar) shall be increased by $1. The following illustrates the application of this paragraph:
Exact amount
To be reported as
$18.49
$18
$18.50
19
$18.51
19
(b)
Election not to use whole dollar amounts
—(1)
Method of election.
Where any TTB form, or the instructions issued with respect to such form, provide that whole dollar amounts shall be reported, any person making a return, declaration, statement, or other document on such form may elect not to use whole dollar amounts by reporting thereon all amounts in full, including cents.
(2)
Time of election.
The election not to use whole dollar amounts must be made at the time of filing the return, declaration, statement, or other document. Such election may not be revoked after the time prescribed for filing such return, declaration, statement, or other document, including extensions of time granted for such filing. Such election may be made on any return, declaration, statement, or other document which is filed after the time prescribed for filing (including extensions of time), and such an election is irrevocable.
(3)
Effect of election.
The taxpayer's election shall be binding only on the return, declaration, statement, or other document filed for a taxable year or period, and a new election may be made on the return, declaration, statement, or other document filed for a subsequent taxable year or period.
(4)
Fractional part of a cent.
For treatment of the fractional part of a cent in the payment of taxes, see 26 U.S.C. 6313 and § 70.62 of this part.
(c)
Inapplicability to computation of amount.
The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section apply only to amounts required to be reported on a return, declaration, statement, or other document. They do not apply to items which must be taken into account in making the computations necessary to determine such amounts. For example, each item of liability must be taken into account at its exact amount, including cents, in computing the amount of total liability required to be reported on a tax return or supporting schedule. It is the amount of total liability, so computed, which is to be reported at the nearest whole dollar on the return or supporting schedule.

(a)
Taxes shown on return.
The appropriate TTB officer shall assess all taxes determined by the taxpayer or by the appropriate TTB officer and disclosed on a return or list.
(b)
Unpaid taxes payable by stamp.

However, the appropriate TTB officer may not assess any tax which is payable by stamp unless the taxpayer fails to pay such tax at the time and in the manner provided by law or regulations.
(2) If a taxpayer gives a check or money order as a payment for stamps but the check or money order is not paid upon presentment, then the appropriate TTB officer shall assess the amount of the check or money order against the taxpayer as if it were a tax due at the time the check or money order was received by appropriate TTB officer.

The amount of the assessment shall, in the case of tax shown on a return by the taxpayer, be the amount so shown, and in all other cases the amount of the assessment shall be the amount shown on the supporting list or record. The date of the assessment is the date the summary record is signed by an appropriate TTB officer. If the taxpayer requests a copy of the record of assessment, the taxpayer shall be furnished a copy of the pertinent parts of the assessment which set forth the name of the taxpayer, the date of assessment, the character of the liability assessed, the taxable period, if applicable, and the amounts assessed.

(1) A decedent or an estate of a decedent may be liable, or
(2) A corporation which is contemplating dissolution, is in the process of dissolution, or has been dissolved, may be liable, shall be assessed, or a proceeding in court without assessment for the collection of such tax shall be begun, within 18 months after the receipt of a written request for prompt assessment thereof.
