To verify that the waste does not exceed the delisting concentrations specified in Condition 1 (except for cobalt), the Petitioner must collect and analyze one representative waste sample of every group of 14 roll-off boxes of wastewater treatment sludge, with the sample being obtained from the 10th box of each group of 14. If this sampling is expected to occur on a weekend or a Federal holiday, the Petitioner may substitute sampling of the 9th or 11th box in each batch of 14 boxes, with sampling of subsequent batches resuming the original schedule of sampling the 10th roll-off box of each batch of 14 boxes. The Petitioner may manage the 10th through 14th box of each group of 14 according to the verification sampling results of the previous group of 14 boxes pending receipt of verification sample results from the 10th box of the current set of boxes. The EPA notes that the Washington State Department of Ecology does not currently accredit any laboratory in the state of Washington for analysis of acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, or formic acid in samples of solid material. The EPA will accept laboratory analyses result for acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde and formic acid from a laboratory that otherwise holds accreditations for all other analytes. For cobalt, sampling must occur once per batch (as defined by a single roll-off box). All sampling and analysis must be conducted using methods with appropriate detection concentrations and elements of quality control. Sampling data must be provided to the EPA no later 60 days following each anniversary of the effective date of this delisting, or such later date as the EPA may agree to in writing. No earlier than the first anniversary of the effective date of this delisting, the Petitioner may request that the EPA approve changes to the sampling frequency under this condition. Such a request must include data and analysis that demonstrated that the revised sampling frequency will ensure that all wastes subject to this exclusion will consistently satisfy the delisting exclusion criteria under Condition 1. The Petitioner must conduct all verification sampling according to a written sampling plan and associated quality assurance project plan which is approved in advance by the EPA that ensures analytical data are suitable for their intended use. The Petitioner's annual submission must also include a certification that all wastes satisfying the delisting concentrations in Condition 1 have been disposed of in a Subtitle D landfill which is licensed, permitted, or otherwise authorized by a state to accept the delisted wastewater treatment sludge.
4.
Changes in Operating Conditions:
The Petitioner must notify the EPA in writing if it significantly changes the manufacturing process, the chemicals used in the manufacturing process, the treatment process, or the chemicals used in the treatment process. The Petitioner must handle wastes generated after the process change as hazardous until it has demonstrated that the wastes continue to meet the delisting concentrations in Condition 1, demonstrated that no new hazardous constituents listed in Appendix VIII of part 261 have been introduced into the manufacturing process or waste treatment process, and it has received written approval from the EPA that it may continue to manage the waste as non-hazardous.

(B) Levels of constituents measured in the samples of the WWTP sludge that do not exceed the levels set forth in paragraph (1) are non-hazardous. GM-Arlington can manage and dispose of the non-hazardous WWTP sludge according to all applicable solid waste regulations.
(C) If constituent levels in a sample exceed any of the delisting levels set in paragraph (1), GM-Arlington can collect one additional sample and perform expedited analyses to verify if the constituent exceeds the delisting level. If this sample confirms the exceedance, GM-Arlington must, from that point forward, treat the waste as hazardous until it is demonstrated that the waste again meets the levels in paragraph (1). GM-Arlington must manage and dispose of the waste generated under Subtitle C of RCRA from the time it becomes aware of any exceedance.
(D) Upon completion of the Verification Testing described in paragraph 3(A) and (B), as appropriate, and the transmittal of the results to EPA, and if the testing results meet the requirements of paragraph (1), GM-Arlington may proceed to manage its WWTP sludge as non-hazardous waste. If subsequent Verification Testing indicates an exceedance of the Delisting Levels in paragraph (1), GM-Arlington must manage the WWTP sludge as a hazardous waste until two consecutive quarterly testing samples show levels below the Delisting Levels in paragraph (1).
(3)
Verification Testing Requirements:
GM-Arlington must perform sample collection and analyses, including quality control procedures, according to appropriate methods such as those found in SW-846 or other reliable sources (with the exception of analyses requiring the use of SW-846 methods incorporated by reference in 40 CFR 260.11, which must be used without substitution) for all constituents listed in paragraph (1). If EPA judges the process to be effective under the operating conditions used during the initial verification testing, GM-Arlington may replace the testing required in paragraph (3)(A) with the testing required in paragraph (3)(B). GM-Arlington Plant must continue to test as specified in paragraph (3)(A) until and unless notified by EPA in writing that testing in paragraph (3)(A) may be replaced by paragraph (3)(B).
(A)
Initial Verification Testing:
After EPA grants the final exclusion, GM-Arlington must do the following:
(i) Within 30 days of this exclusion becoming final, collect two (2) samples, before disposal, of the WWTP sludge.
(ii) The samples are to be analyzed and compared against the Delisting Levels in paragraph (1).
(iii) Within 60 days of the exclusion becoming final, GM-Arlington must report to EPA the initial verification analytical test data for the WWTP sludge, including analytical quality control information for the first thirty (30) days of operation after this exclusion becomes final.
If levels of constituents measured in these samples of the WWTP sludge do not exceed the levels set forth in paragraph (1), GM-Arlington can manage and dispose of the WWTP sludge according to all applicable solid waste regulations.
(B)
Subsequent Verification Testing:
Following written notification by EPA, GM-Arlington may substitute the testing conditions in paragraph (3)(B) for paragraph (3)(A). GM-Arlington must continue to monitor operating conditions, and analyze two representative samples of the WWTP sludge for the next three quarters of operation during the first year of waste generation. The samples must represent the waste generated during the quarter. Quarterly reports are due to EPA, thirty days after the samples are taken.
After the first year of analytical sampling, verification sampling can be performed on a single annual sample of the WWTP sludge. The results are to be compared to the delisting levels in paragraph (1).
(C)
Termination of Testing:
(i) After the first year of quarterly testing, if the delisting levels in paragraph (1) are being met, GM-Arlington may then request that EPA not require quarterly testing.
(ii) Following cancellation of the quarterly testing by EPA letter, GM-Arlington must continue to test one representative sample for all constituents listed in paragraph (1) annually. Results must be provided to EPA within 30 days of the testing.
(4)

The residue generated from the use of the Chemfix ® treatment process on sludge (EPA Hazardous Waste No. F006) generated from electroplating operations and contained in three on-site surface impoundments on November 14, 1986. To assure that stabilization occurs, the following conditions apply to this exclusion:
(1) Mixing ratios shall be monitored continuously to assure consistent treatment.
(2) One grab sample of the treated waste shall be taken each hour as it is pumped to the holding area (cell) from each trailer unit. At the end of each production day, the grab samples from the individual trailer units will be composited and the EP toxicity test will be run on each composite sample. If lead or total chromium concentrations exceed 0.315 ppm or if nickel exceeds 2.17 ppm, in the EP extract, the waste will be removed and retreated or disposed of as a hazardous waste.
(3) The treated waste shall be pumped into bermed cells which are constructed to assure that the treated waste is identifiable and retrievable (
i.e.,
the material can be removed and either disposed of as a hazardous waste or retreated if conditions 1 or 2 are not met).
Failure to satisfy any of these conditions would render the exclusion void. This is a one-time exclusion, applicable only to the residue generated from the use of the Chemfix ® treatment process on the sludge currently contained in the three on-site surface impoundments.

Morrisville, Pennsylvania
Wastewater treatment sludge filter cake from the treatment of EPA Hazardous Waste No. F039, generated at a maximum annual rate of 2000 cubic yards, after December 4, 2001, and disposed of in a Subtitle D landfill. The exclusion covers the filter cake resulting from the treatment of hazardous waste leachate derived from only “old” GROWS and non-hazardous leachate derived from only non-hazardous waste sources. The exclusion does not address the waste disposed of in the “old” GROWS' Landfill or the grit generated during the removal of heavy solids from the landfill leachate. To ensure that hazardous constituents are not present in the filter cake at levels of regulatory concern, GROWS must implement a testing program for the petitioned waste. This testing program must meet the conditions listed below in order for the exclusion to be valid:
(1)
Testing:
Sample collection and analyses, including quality control (QC) procedures, must be performed using appropriate methods. As applicable to the method-defined parameters of concern, analyses requiring the use of SW-846 methods incorporated by reference in 40 CFR 260.11 must be used without substitution. As applicable, the SW-846 methods might include Methods 0010, 0011, 0020, 0023A, 0030, 0031, 0040, 0050, 0051, 0060, 0061, 1010B, 1020C, 1110A, 1310B, 1311, 1312, 1320, 1330A, 9010C, 9012B, 9040C, 9045D, 9060A, 9070A (uses EPA Method 1664, Rev. A), 9071B, and 9095B.
(A)
Sample Collection:
Each batch of waste generated over a four-week period must be collected in containers with a maximum capacity of 20-cubic yards. At the end of the four-week period, each container must be divided into four quadrants and a single, full-depth core sample shall be collected from each quadrant. All of the full-depth core samples then must be composited under laboratory conditions to produce one representative composite sample for the four-week period.
(B)
Sample Analysis:
Each four-week composite sample must be analyzed for all of the constituents listed in Condition (3). The analytical data, including quality control information, must be submitted to The Waste and Chemicals Management Division, U.S. EPA Region III, 1650 Arch Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103, and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, Bureau of Land Recycling and Waste Management, Rachel Carson State Office Building, 400 Market Street, 14th Floor, Harrisburg, PA 17105. Data from the annual verification testing must be compiled and submitted to EPA and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection within sixty (60) days from the end of the calendar year. All data must be accompanied by a signed copy of the statement set forth in 40 CFR 260.22(i)(12) to certify to the truth and accuracy of the data submitted. Records of operating conditions and analytical data must be compiled, summarized, and maintained on-site for a minimum of three years and must be furnished upon request by any employee or representative of EPA or the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, and made available for inspection.
(2)
Waste Holding:
The dewatered filter cake must be stored as hazardous until the verification analyses are completed. If the four-week composite sample does not exceed any of the delisting levels set forth in Condition (3), the filter cake waste corresponding to this sample may be managed and disposed of in accordance with all applicable solid waste regulations. If the four-week composite sample exceeds any of the delisting levels set forth in Condition (3), the filter cake waste generated during the time period corresponding to the four-week composite sample must be retreated until it meets these levels (analyses must be repeated) or managed and disposed of in accordance with Subtitle C of RCRA. Filter cake which is generated but for which analyses are not complete or valid must be managed and disposed of in accordance with Subtitle C of RCRA, until valid analyses demonstrate that the waste meets the delisting levels.
(3)
Delisting Levels:
If the concentrations in the four-week composite sample of the filter cake waste for any of the hazardous constituents listed below exceed their respective maximum allowable concentrations (mg/l or mg/kg) also listed below, the four-week batch of failing filter cake waste must either be retreated until it meets these levels or managed and disposed of in accordance with Subtitle C of RCRA. GROWS has the option of determining whether the filter cake waste exceeds the maximum allowable concentrations for the organic constituents by either performing the analysis on a TCLP leachate of the waste or performing total constituent analysis on the waste, and then comparing the results to the corresponding maximum allowable concentration level.

GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. 2 LLC must implement a testing program that meets the following conditions for the exclusion to be valid: 1. Delisting Levels: (A) All leachable concentrations for the following constituents must not exceed the following levels (mg/L for TCLP): Arsenic—5.0; Barium—100.0; Cadmium—1.0; Chromium—5.0; Lead—5.0; Mercury 0.2; and, Nickel—32.4.
2. Waste Handling and Holding:
(A) GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. 2 LLC must manage as hazardous all WWTP sludge generated until it has completed initial verification testing described in paragraph (3)(A) and valid analyses show that paragraph (1) is satisfied and written approval is received by EPA. (B) Levels of constituents measured in the samples of the WWTP sludge that do not exceed the levels set forth in paragraph (1) for two consecutive quarterly sampling events are non-hazardous. After approval is received from EPA, GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. 2 LLC can manage and dispose of the non-hazardous WWTP sludge according to all applicable solid waste regulations. (C) Not withstanding having received the initial approval from EPA, if constituent levels in a later sample exceed any of the Delisting Levels set in paragraph (1), from that point forward, GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. 2 LLC must treat all the waste covered by this exclusion as hazardous until it is demonstrated that the waste again meets the levels in paragraph (1). GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. 2 LLC must manage and dispose of the waste generated under Subtitle C of RCRA from the time that it becomes aware of any exceedance.
3.
Verification Testing Requirements:
GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. 2 LLC must perform sample collection and analyses in accordance with the approved Quality Assurance Project Plan dated January 27, 2011. All samples shall be representative composite samples according to appropriate methods. As applicable to the method-defined parameters of concern, analyses requiring the use of SW-846 methods incorporated by reference in 40 CFR 260.11 must be used without substitution. As applicable, the SW-846 methods might include Methods 0010, 0011, 0020, 0023A, 0030, 0031, 0040, 0050, 0051, 0060, 0061, 1010B, 1020C,1110A, 1310B, 1311, 1312, 1320, 1330A, 9010C, 9012B, 9040C, 9045D, 9060A, 9070A (uses EPA Method 1664, Rev. A), 9071B, and 9095B. Methods must meet Performance Based Measurement System Criteria in which the Data Quality Objectives are to demonstrate that samples of the GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. 2 LLC sludge are representative for all constituents listed in paragraph (1). To verify that the waste does not exceed the specified delisting concentrations, for one year after the final exclusion is granted GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. 2 LLC must perform quarterly analytical testing by sampling and analyzing the WWTP sludge as follows: (A) Quarterly Testing: (i) Collect two representative composite samples of the WWTP sludge at quarterly intervals after EPA grants the final exclusion. The first composite samples must be taken within 30 days after EPA grants the final approval. The second set of samples must be taken at least 30 days after the first set. (ii) Analyze the samples for all constituents listed in paragraph (1). Any waste regarding which a composite sample is taken that exceeds the delisting levels listed in paragraph (1) for the sludge must be disposed as hazardous waste in accordance with the applicable hazardous waste requirements from the time that GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. 2 LLC becomes aware of any exceedance. (iii) Within thirty (30) days after taking each quarterly sample, GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. 2 LLC will report its analytical test data to EPA. If levels of constituents measured in the samples of the sludge do not exceed the levels set forth in paragraph (1) of this exclusion for two consecutive quarters, and EPA concurs with those findings, GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. 2 LLC can manage and dispose the non-hazardous sludge according to all applicable solid waste regulations. (B) Annual Testing: (i) If GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. 2 LLC completes the quarterly testing specified in paragraph (3) above and no sample contains a constituent at a level which exceeds the limits set forth in paragraph (1), GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. 2 LLC may begin annual testing as follows: GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. 2 LLC must test two representative composite samples of the wastewater treatment sludge (following the same protocols as specified for quarterly sampling, above) for all constituents listed in paragraph (1) at least once per calendar year. (ii) The samples for the annual testing taken for the second and subsequent annual testing events shall be taken within the same calendar month as the first annual sample taken. (iii) GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. 2 LLC shall submit an annual testing report to EPA with all of its annual test results, within thirty (30) days after taking the two annual samples. (iv) GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. 2 LLC shall submit to EPA in January of each year the total amount of waste in cubic yards disposed during the previous calendar year.

If EPA judges the incineration process to be effective under the operating conditions used during the initial verification testing, Occidental Chemical may replace the testing required in Condition (3)(A) with the testing required in Condition (3)(B). Occidental Chemical must continue to test as specified in Condition (3)(A) until and unless notified by EPA in writing that testing in Condition (3)(A) may be replaced by Condition (3)(B).
(A)
Initial Verification Testing:
(i) During the first 40 operating days of the Incinerator Offgas Treatment System after the final exclusion is granted, Occidental Chemical must collect and analyze composites of the Limestone Sludge. Daily composites must be representative grab samples collected every 6 hours during each unit operating cycle. The two wastes must be analyzed, prior to disposal, for all of the constituents listed in Paragraph 1. The waste must also be analyzed for pH. Occidental Chemical must report the operational and analytical test data, including quality control information, obtained during this initial period no later than 90 days after the generation of the two wastes.
(ii) When the Rockbox unit is decommissioned for cleanout, after the final exclusion is granted, Occidental Chemical must collect and analyze composites of the Rockbox Residue. Two composites must be composed of representative grab samples collected from the Rockbox unit. The waste must be analyzed, prior to disposal, for all of the constituents listed in Paragraph 1. The waste must be analyzed for pH. No later than 90 days after the Rockbox is decommissioned for cleanout the first two times after this exclusion becomes final, Occidental Chemical must report the operational and analytical test data, including quality control information.
(B)
Subsequent Verification Testing:
Following written notification by EPA, Occidental Chemical may substitute the testing conditions in (3)(B) for (3)(A)(i). Occidental Chemical must continue to monitor operating conditions, analyze samples representative of each quarter of operation during the first year of waste generation. The samples must represent the waste generated over one quarter. (This provision does not apply to the Rockbox Residue.)
(C)
Termination of Organic Testing for the Limestone Sludge:
Occidental Chemical must continue testing as required under Condition (3)(B) for organic constituents specified under Condition (3)(B) for organic constituents specified in Condition (1)(A)(ii) and (1)(B)(ii) until the analyses submitted under Condition (3)(B) show a minimum of two consecutive quarterly samples below the delisting levels in Condition (1)(A)(ii) and (1)(B)(ii), Occidental Chemical may then request that quarterly organic testing be terminated. After EPA notifies Occidental Chemical in writing it may terminate quarterly organic testing. Following termination of the quarterly testing, Occidental Chemical must continue to test a representative composite sample for all constituents listed in Condition (1) on an annual basis (no later than twelve months after exclusion).
(4)
Changes in Operating Conditions:
If Occidental Chemical significantly changes the process which generate(s) the waste(s) and which may or could affect the composition or type waste(s) generated as established under Condition (1) (by illustration, but not limitation, change in equipment or operating conditions of the treatment process), Occidental Chemical must notify the EPA in writing and may no longer handle the wastes generated from the new process or no longer discharges as nonhazardous until the wastes meet the delisting levels set Condition (1) and it has received written approval to do so from EPA.

Methods must meet Performance Based Measurement System Criteria in which the Data Quality Objectives are to demonstrate that representative samples of the Tyco Sludge meet the delisting levels in Condition (3).
(A)
Initial Verification Testing:
Tyco must collect and analyze a representative sample of every batch, for eight sequential batches of Tyco sludge generated in its wastewater treatment system after May 14, 2001. A batch is the Tyco Sludge generated during one day of wastewater treatment. Tyco must analyze for the constituents listed in Condition (3). A minimum of four composite samples must be collected as representative of each batch. Tyco must report analytical test data, including quality control information, no later than 60 days after generating the first batch of Tyco Sludge to be disposed in accordance with the delisting Conditions (1) through (7).
(B)
Subsequent Verification Testing:
If the initial verification testing in Condition (1)(A) is successful, i.e., delisting levels of condition (3) are met for all of the eight initial batches, Tyco must test a minimum of 5% of the Tyco Sludge generated each year. Tyco must collect and analyze at least one composite sample representative of that 5%. The composite must be made up of representative samples collected from each batch included in the 5%. Tyco may, at its discretion, analyze composite samples gathered more frequently to demonstrate that smaller batches of waste are non-hazardous.
(2)
Waste Holding and Handling:
Tyco must store as hazardous all Tyco Sludge generated until verification testing as specified in Condition (1)(A) or (1)(B), as appropriate, is completed and valid analyses demonstrate that Condition (3) is satisfied. If the levels of constituents measured in the samples of Tyco Sludge do not exceed the levels set forth in Condition (3), then the Tyco Sludge is non-hazardous and must be managed in accordance with all applicable solid waste regulations. If constituent levels in a sample exceed any of the delisting levels set forth in Condition (3), the batch of Tyco Sludge generated during the time period corresponding to this sample must be retreated until it meets the delisting levels set forth in Condition (3), or managed and disposed of in accordance with Subtitle C of RCRA.
(3)
Delisting Levels:
All leachable concentrations for these metals and cyanide must not exceed the following levels (ppm): Barium—100; Cadmium—0.5; Chromium—5.0; Cyanide—20, Lead—1.5; and Nickel—73. These metal and cyanide concentrations must be measured in the waste leachate obtained by the method specified in 40 CFR 261.24, except that for cyanide, deionized water must be the leaching medium. The total concentration of cyanide (total, not amenable) in the waste, not the waste leachate, must not exceed 200 mg/kg. Cyanide concentrations in waste or leachate must be measured by the method specified in 40 CFR 268.40, Note 7. The total concentrations of metals in the waste, not the waste leachate, must not exceed the following levels (ppm): Barium—2,000; Cadmium—500; Chromium—1,000; Lead—2,000; and Nickel—20,000.

Bethlehem Steel Corp.
Steelton, PA
Uncured and cured chemically stabilized electric arc furnace dust/sludge (CSEAFD) treatment residue (K061) generated from the primary production of steel after May 22, 1989. This exclusion is conditioned upon the data obtained from Bethlehem's full-scale CSEAFD treatment facility because Bethlehem's original data were obtained from a laboratory-scale CSEAFD treatment process. To ensure that hazardous constituents are not present in the waste at levels of regulatory concern once the full-scale treatment facility is in operation, Bethlehem must implement a testing program for the petitioned waste. This testing program must meet the following conditions for the exclusion to be valid:
(1)
Testing:
(A)
Initial Testing:
During the first four weeks of operation of the full-scale treatment system, Bethlehem must collect representative grab samples of each treated batch of the CSEAFD and composite the grab samples daily. The daily composites, prior to disposal, must be analyzed for the EP leachate concentrations of all the EP toxic metals, nickel and cyanide (using distilled water in the cyanide extractions). Analyses must be performed using appropriate methods. As applicable to the method-defined parameters of concern, analyses requiring the use of SW-846 methods incorporated by reference in 40 CFR 260.11 must be used without substitution. As applicable, the SW-846 methods might include Methods 0010, 0011, 0020, 0023A, 0030, 0031, 0040, 0050, 0051, 0060, 0061, 1010B, 1020C, 1110A, 1310B, 1311, 1312, 1320, 1330A, 9010C, 9012B, 9040C, 9045D, 9060A, 9070A (uses EPA Method 1664, Rev. A), 9071B, and 9095B. Bethlehem must report the analytical test data obtained during this initial period no later than 90 days after the treatment of the first full-scale batch.
(B)
Subsequent Testing:
Bethlehem must collect representative grab samples from every treated batch of CSEAFD generated daily and composite all of the grab samples to produce a weekly composite sample. Bethlehem then must analyze each weekly composite sample for the EP leachate concentrations of all the EP toxic metals and nickel. Analyses must be performed using appropriate methods. As applicable to the method-defined parameters of concern, analyses requiring the use of SW-846 methods incorporated by reference in 40 CFR 260.11 must be used without substitution. As applicable, the SW-846 methods might include Methods 0010, 0011, 0020, 0023A, 0030, 0031, 0040, 0050, 0051, 0060, 0061, 1010B, 1020C , 1110A, 1310B, 1311, 1312, 1320, 1330A, 9010C, 9012B, 9040C, 9045D, 9060A, 9070A (uses EPA Method 1664, Rev. A), 9071B, and 9095B. The analytical data, including all quality control information, must be compiled and maintained on site for a minimum of three years. These data must be furnished upon request and made available for inspection by any employee or representative of EPA or the State of Pennsylvania.

Residual solids (at a maximum annual generation rate of 1,000 cubic yards) generated from the thermal desorption treatment and, where necessary, stabilization of wastewater treatment plant API/DAF filter cake (EPA Hazardous Waste Nos. K048 and K051), after [insert date of publication]. Marathon must implement a testing program that meets the following conditions for the exclusion to be valid:
(1)
Testing:
Sample collection and analyses (including quality control (QC) procedures) must be performed using appropriate methods. As applicable to the method-defined parameters of concern, analyses requiring the use of SW-846 methods incorporated by reference in 40 CFR 260.11 must be used without substitution. As applicable, the SW-846 methods might include Methods 0010, 0011, 0020, 0023A, 0030, 0031, 0040, 0050, 0051, 0060, 0061, 1010B, 1020C, 1110A, 1310B, 1311, 1312, 1320, 1330A, 9010C, 9012B, 9040C, 9045D, 9060A, 9070A (uses EPA Method 1664, Rev. A), 9071B, and 9095B. If EPA judges the treatment process to be effective under the operating conditions used during the initial verification testing, Marathon may replace the testing required in Condition (1)(A) with the testing required in Condition (1)(B). Marathon must continue to test as specified in Condition (1)(A), including testing for organics in Conditions (3)(B) and (3)(C), until and unless notified by EPA in writing that testing in Condition (1)(A) may be replaced by Condition (1)(B), or that testing for organics may be terminated as described in (1)(C) (to the extent directed by EPA).
(A)
Initial Verification Testing:
During at least the first 40 operating days of full-scale operation of the thermal desorption unit, Marathon must monitor the operating conditions and analyze 5-day composites of residual solids. 5-day composites must be composed of representative grab samples collected from every batch during each 5-day period of operation. The samples must be analyzed prior to disposal of the residual solids for constituents listed in Condition (3). Marathon must report the operational and analytical test data, including quality control information, obtained during this initial period no later than 90 days after the treatment of the first full-scale batch.
(B)
Subsequent Verification Testing:
Following notification by EPA, Marathon may substitute the testing conditions in (1)(B) for (1)(A). Marathon must continue to monitor operating conditions, and analyze samples representative of each month of operation. The samples must be composed of representative grab samples collected during at least the first five days of operation of each month. These monthly representative samples must be analyzed for the constituents listed in Condition (3) prior to the disposal of the residual solids. Marathon may, at its discretion, analyze composite samples gathered more frequently to demonstrate that smaller batches of waste are nonhazardous.
(C)
Termination of Organic Testing:
Marathon must continue testing as required under Condition (1)(B) for organic constituents specified in Conditions (3)(B) and (3)(C) until the analyses submitted under Condition (1)(B) show a minimum of four consecutive monthly representative samples with levels of specific constituents significantly below the delisting levels in Conditions (3)(B) and (3)(C), and EPA notifies Marathon in writing that monthly testing for specific organic constituents may be terminated. Following termination of monthly testing, Marathon must continue to test a representative 5-day composite sample for all constituents listed in Conditions (3)(B) and (3)(C) on an annual basis. If delisting levels for any constituents listed in Conditions (3)(B) and (3)(C) are exceeded in the annual sample, Marathon must reinstitute complete testing as required in Condition (1)(B).
(2)
Waste Holding and Handling:
Marathon must store as hazardous all residual solids generated until verification testing (as specified in Conditions (1)(A) and (1)(B)) is completed and valid analysis demonstrates that Condition (3) is satisfied. If the levels of hazardous constituents in the samples of residual solids are below all of the levels set forth in Condition (3), then the residual solids are non-hazardous and may be managed and disposed of in accordance with all applicable solid waste regulations. If hazardous constituent levels in any 5-day composite or other representative sample equal or exceed any of the delisting levels set in Condition (3), the residual solids generated during the corresponding time period must be retreated and/or stabilized as allowed below, until the residual solids meet these levels, or managed and disposed of in accordance with Subtitle C of RCRA.
If the residual solids contain leachable inorganic concentrations at or above the delisting levels set forth in Condition (3)(A), then Marathon may stabilize the material with Type 1 portland cement as demonstrated in the petition to immobilize the metals. Following stabilization, Marathon must repeat analyses in Condition (3)(A) prior to disposal.
(3)

Initial Verification Testing:
After EPA grants the final exclusion, OxyVinyls must do the following: (i) Within 60 days of this exclusion becoming final, collect four samples, before disposal, of the incinerator offgas treatment scrubber water. (ii) The samples are to be analyzed and compared against the delisting levels in Paragraph (1) (iii). Within sixty (60) days after the exclusion becomes final, OxyVinyls will report initial verification analytical test data, including analytical quality control information for the first sixty (30) days of operation after this exclusion becomes final of the incinerator offgas treatment scrubber water. If levels of constituents measured in the samples of the incinerator offgas treatment scrubber water that do not exceed the levels set forth in Paragraph (1) and are also non-hazardous in two consecutive quarters after the first thirty (30) days of operation after this exclusion, OxyVinyls can manage and dispose of the incinerator offgas treatment scrubber water according to all applicable solid water regulations after reporting the analytical results to EPA.
(B)
Subsequent Verification Testing:
Following written notification by EPA, OxyVinyls may substitute the testing conditions in Paragraph (3)(B) for (3)(A). OxyVinyls must continue to monitor operating conditions, and analyze representative samples of each quarter of operation during the first year of waste generation. The samples must represent the waste generated during the quarter. After the first year of analytical sampling verification sampling can be performed on a single annual composite sample of the incinerator offgas treatment scrubber water. The results are to be compared to the delisting levels in Condition (1).
(C)
Termination of Testing:
(i) After the first year of quarterly testing, if the Delisting Levels in Paragraph (1) are being met, OxyVinyls may then request that EPA stop requiring quarterly testing. After EPA notifies OxyVinyls in writing, the company may end quarterly testing. (ii) Following cancellation of the quarterly testing, OxyVinyls must continue to test a representative sample for all constituents listed in Paragraph (1) annually.
(4)
Changes in Operating Conditions:
If OxyVinyls significantly changes the process described in its petition or starts any processes that generate(s) the waste that may or could significantly affect the composition or type of waste generated as established under Paragraph (1) (by illustration, but not limitation, changes in equipment or operating conditions of the treatment process), it must notify EPA in writing; OxyVinyls may no longer handle the wastes generated from the new process as nonhazardous until the wastes meet the delisting levels set in Paragraph (1) and it has received written approval to do so from EPA.

F006-F012, F019 and F027 provided that the as-generated waste streams bearing these waste numbers prior to treatment in the 200 Area ETF is in the form of dilute wastewater containing a maximum of 1.0 weight percent of any hazardous constituent. In addition, this conditional exclusion applies to all other U- and P-listed waste numbers that meet the following criteria: The U/P listed substance has a treatment standard established for wastewater forms of F039 multi-source leachate under 40 CFR 268.40,”Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes”; and the as-generated waste stream prior to treatment in the 200 Area ETF is in the form of dilute wastewater containing a maximum of 1.0 weight percent of any hazardous constituent. This exclusion shall apply at the point of discharge from the 200 Area ETF verification tanks after satisfaction of Conditions 1-7.
Conditions:
(1) Waste Influent Characterization and Processing Strategy Preparation
(a) Prior to treatment of any waste stream in the 200 Area ETF, Energy must:
(i) Complete sufficient characterization of the waste stream to demonstrate that the waste stream is within the treatability envelope of 200 Area ETF as specified in Tables C-1 and C-2 of the delisting petition dated November 29, 2001, as amended. Results of the waste stream characterization and the treatability evaluation must be in writing and placed in the facility operating record, along with a copy of Tables C-1 and C-2 of the November 29, 2001 petition, as amended. Waste stream characterization may be carried out in whole or in part using the waste analysis procedures in the Hanford Facility RCRA Permit, WA7 89000 8967;
(ii) Prepare a written waste processing strategy specific to the waste stream, based on the ETF process model documented in the November 29, 2001 petition, the March 31, 2021 modification request, and Tables C-1 and C-2 of the November 29, 2001 petition, as amended. For waste processing strategies applicable to waste streams for which organic envelope data is provided in Table C-2 of the November 29, 2001 petition, as amended, Energy shall use envelope data specific to that waste stream, if available. Otherwise, Energy shall use the minimum envelope in Table C-2.
(b) Energy may modify the 200 Area ETF treatability envelope specified in Tables C-1 and C-2 of the November 29, 2001 delisting petition, as amended, to reflect changes in treatment technology or operating practices upon written approval of the Regional Administrator. Requests for modification shall be accompanied by an engineering report detailing the basis for a modified treatment envelope. Data supporting modified envelopes must be based on at least four influent waste stream characterization data points and corresponding treated effluent verification sample data points for wastes managed under a particular waste processing strategy. Treatment efficiencies must be calculated based on a comparison of upper 95 percent confidence level constituent concentrations. Upon written EPA approval of the engineering report, the associated inorganic and organic treatment efficiency data may be used in lieu of those in Tables C-1 and C-2 for purposes of condition (1)(a)(i).
(c) Where operation of the 200 Area ETF for purposes of gathering data supporting a modified treatability envelope pursuant to Condition (1)(b) requires operation outside of an existing treatability envelope or where a new treatability envelope is to be proposed, Energy may request interim approval to conduct such demonstration testing for purposes of developing a new or modified treatability envelope. Such a request must include the following documentation:
(i) An Engineering Report documenting the basis for a modified treatability envelope. The Engineering Report shall, based on best available information, document that operation of the 200 Area ETF during the period of interim approval can be reasonably expected to produce treated effluent satisfying the delisting levels in Condition (5). The Engineering Report shall include, but is not limited to, engineering calculations, process modelling results, or performance data provided by equipment manufacturers;
(ii) A demonstration test plan documenting the following:
(A) The quantity and characterization of the waste stream to be used in conducting demonstration testing, and information that will be included in the waste processing strategy required by Condition (1)(a)(ii) for the demonstration testing. The test plan shall document, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that data gathered from the demonstration testing will be suitable for use in modifying the treatability envelope pursuant to Condition (1)(b). The test plan may include provisions for “spiking” the demonstration test waste feed to ensure that a waste feed meeting the requirements of the test plan is available;
(B) A sampling and analysis plan with supporting systematic planning documentation (
e.g.,
Data Quality Objectives) and with an associated Quality Assurance Project Plan, for all sampling and analysis specific to the demonstration testing. A minimum of four independent sample sets over the course of the demonstration test are required from both the influent to the 200 Area ETF and the effluent to the verification tanks;
(C) A schedule for conducting the demonstration testing. The demonstration testing schedule may be based on functional criteria in addition to or in lieu of fixed calendar dates. The testing schedule may contain contingencies for revising the test plan should additional testing be required to obtain the required performance data points.
Energy may not commence demonstration testing until written interim approval is obtained from the Regional Administrator. The effect of interim approval shall be limited to relief from the requirement of operating within the treatability envelope specified in Tables C-1 and C-2 of the November 29, 2001 delisting petition, as amended, during the period of demonstration testing. Interim approval shall remain in effect only for the duration of the demonstration testing as documented in the required testing schedule. Within 60 days following completion of demonstration testing, or such other time as may be approved in writing by the EPA, Energy shall submit a written completion report documenting analysis of data gathered during the demonstration test. Energy may request an extension of interim approval for the period of time between completion of the demonstration testing and final approval of the modified treatability envelope. The EPA may approve amendments to the demonstration test plan, including the associated schedule, as necessary to successfully complete demonstration testing. The EPA's written approval of the completion report shall be considered approval of the modified treatability envelope pursuant to Condition (1)(b).
(d) Energy shall conduct all 200 Area ETF treatment operations for a particular waste stream according to the written waste processing strategy, as may be modified by Condition 3(b)(i).
(e) The following definitions apply:
(i) A waste stream is defined as all wastewater received by the 200 Area ETF that meet the 200 Area ETF waste acceptance criteria as defined by the Hanford Facility RCRA Permit, WA7 89000 8967 and are managed under the same 200 Area ETF waste processing strategy.
(ii) A waste processing strategy is defined as a specific 200 Area ETF unit operation configuration, primary operating parameters and expected maximum influent total dissolved solids (TDS) and total organic carbon (TOC). Each waste processing strategy shall require monitoring and recording of treated effluent conductivity for purposes of Condition (2)(b)(i)(E), and for monitoring and recording of primary operating parameters as necessary to demonstrate that 200 Area ETF operations are in accordance with the associated waste processing strategy.
(iii) Primary operating parameters are defined as ultraviolet oxidation (UV/OX) peroxide addition rate, reverse osmosis reject ratio, and processing flow rate as measured at the 200 Area ETF surge tank outlet.
(iv) Key unit operations are defined as filtration, UV/OX, reverse osmosis, ion exchange, steam stripping, and secondary waste treatment.
(2) Testing. Energy shall perform verification testing of treated effluents according to Conditions (a), (b), and (c) below.
(a) No later than 45 days after the effective date of this rule, or such other time as may be approved of in advance and in writing by EPA, Energy shall submit to EPA a report proposing required data quality parameters and data acceptance criteria (parameter values) for sampling and analysis which may be conducted pursuant to the requirements of this rule. This report shall explicitly consider verification sampling and analysis for purposes of demonstrating compliance with exclusion limits in Condition 5, as well as any sampling and analysis which may be required pursuant to Conditions (1)(a)(i) and (1)(d)(ii). This report shall contain a detailed justification for the proposed data quality parameters and data acceptance criteria. Following review and approval of this report, the proposed data quality parameters and data acceptance criteria shall become enforceable conditions of this exclusion. Pending EPA approval of this report, Energy may demonstrate compliance with sampling and analysis requirements of this rule through application of methods appearing in EPA Publication SW-846 or equivalent methods. Energy shall maintain a written sampling and analysis plan, including QA/QC requirements and procedures, based upon these enforceable data quality parameters and data acceptance criteria in the facility operating record, and shall conduct all sampling and analysis conducted pursuant to this rule according to this written plan. Records of all sampling and analysis, including quality assurance QA/QC information, shall be placed in the facility operating record. As applicable to the method-defined parameters of concern, analyses requiring the use of SW-846 methods incorporated by reference in 40 CFR 260.11 must be used without substitution. As applicable, the SW-846 methods might include Methods 0010, 0011, 0020, 0023A, 0030, 0031, 0040, 0050, 0051, 0060, 0061, 1010B, 1020C, 1110A, 1310B, 1311, 1312, 1320, 1330A, 9010C, 9012B, 9040C, 9045D, 9060A, 9070A (uses EPA Method 1664, Rev. A), 9071B, and 9095B.
(b) Initial verification testing.
(i) Verification sampling shall consist of a representative sample of one filled effluent discharge tank, analyzed for all constituents in Condition (5), and for conductivity for purposes of establishing a conductivity baseline with respect to Condition (2)(b)(i)(E). Verification sampling shall be required under each of the following conditions:
(A) Any new or modified waste strategy;
(B) Influent wastewater total dissolved solids or total organic carbon concentration increases by an order of magnitude or more above values established in the waste processing strategy;
(C) Changes in primary operating parameters;
(D) Changes in influent flow rate outside a range of 150 to 570 liters per minute;
(E) Increase greater than a factor of ten (10) in treated effluent conductivity (conductivity changes indicate changes in dissolved ionic constituents, which in turn are a good indicator of 200 Area ETF treatment efficiency).
(F) Any failure of initial verification required by this condition, or subsequent verification required by Condition (2)(c).
(ii) Treated effluents shall be managed according to Condition 3. Once Condition (3)(a) is satisfied, subsequent verification testing shall be performed according to Condition (2)(c).
(c) Subsequent Verification: Following successful initial verification associated with a specific waste processing strategy, Energy must continue to monitor primary operating parameters, and collect and analyze representative samples from every fifteenth (15th) verification tank filled with 200 Area ETF effluents processed according to the associated waste processing strategy. These representative samples must be analyzed prior to disposal of 200 Area ETF effluents for all constituents in Condition (5). Treated effluent from tanks sampled according to this condition must be managed according to Condition (3).
(3) Waste Holding and Handling: Energy must store as hazardous waste all 200 Area ETF effluents subject to verification testing in Condition (2)(b) and (2)(c), that is, until valid analyses demonstrate Condition (5) is satisfied.
(a) If the levels of hazardous constituents in the samples of 200 Area ETF effluent are equal to or below the levels set forth in Condition (5), the 200 Area ETF effluents are not listed as hazardous wastes provided they are disposed of in the State Authorized Land Disposal Site (SALDS) (except as provided pursuant to Condition (7)) according to applicable requirements and permits. Subsequent treated effluent batches shall be subject to verification requirements of Condition (2)(c).
(b) If hazardous constituent levels in any representative sample collected from a verification tank exceed any of the delisting levels set in Condition (5), Energy must:
(i) Review waste characterization data, and review and change accordingly the waste processing strategy as necessary to ensure subsequent batches of treated effluent do not exceed delisting criteria;
(ii) Retreat the contents of the failing verification tank;
(iii) Perform verification testing on the retreated effluent. If constituent concentrations are at or below delisting levels in Condition (5), the treated effluent are not listed hazardous waste provided they are disposed at SALDS according to applicable requirements and permits (except as provided pursuant to Condition (7)), otherwise repeat the requirements of Condition (3)(b).
(iv) Perform initial verification sampling according to Condition (2)(b) on the next treated effluent tank once testing required by Condition (3)(b)(iii) demonstrates compliance with delisting requirements.
(4) Re-opener Language
(a) If, anytime before, during, or after treatment of waste in the 200 Area ETF, Energy possesses or is otherwise made aware of any data (including but not limited to groundwater monitoring data, as well as data concerning the accuracy of site conditions or the validity of assumptions upon which the November 29, 2001 petition was based) relevant to the delisted waste indicating that the treated effluent no longer meets delisting criteria (excluding record keeping and data submissions required by Condition (6)), or that groundwater affected by discharge of the treated effluent exhibits hazardous constituent concentrations above health-based limits, Energy must report such data, in writing, to the Regional Administrator within 10 days of first possessing or being made aware of that data.
(b) Energy shall provide written notification to the Regional Administrator no less than 180 days prior to any planned or proposed substantial modifications to the 200 Area ETF, exclusive of routine maintenance activities, that could affect waste processing strategies or primary operating parameters. This condition shall specifically include, but not be limited to, changes that do or would require Class II or III modification to the Hanford Facility RCRA Permit WA7 89000 8967 (in the case of permittee-initiated modifications) or equivalent modifications in the case of agency-initiated permit modifications operations. Energy may request a modification to the 180-day notification requirement of this condition in the instance of agency-initiated permit modifications for purposes of ensuring coordination with permitting activities.
(c) Based on the information described in paragraph (4)(a) or (4)(b) or any other relevant information received from any source, the Regional Administrator will make a preliminary determination as to whether the reported information requires Agency action to protect human health or the environment. Further action could include suspending or revoking the exclusion, or other appropriate response necessary to protect human health and the environment.
(5) Delisting Levels: All total constituent concentrations in treated effluents managed under this exclusion must be equal to or less than the following levels, expressed as mg/L:

(6) Recordkeeping and Data Submittals.
(a) Energy shall maintain records of all waste characterization, and waste processing strategies required by Condition (1), and verification sampling data, including QA/QC results, in the facility operating record for a period of no less than three (3) years. However, this period is automatically extended during the course of any unresolved enforcement action regarding the 200 Area ETF or as requested by EPA.
(b) No less than thirty (30) days after receipt of verification data indicating a failure to meet delisting criteria of Condition (5), Energy shall notify the Regional Administrator. This notification shall include a summary of waste characterization data for the associated influent, verification data, and any corrective actions taken according to Condition (3)(b)(i).
(c) Records required by Condition (6)(a) must be furnished on request by EPA or the State of Washington and made available for inspection. All data must be accompanied by a signed copy of the following certification statement to attest to the truth and accuracy of the data submitted:
“Under civil and criminal penalty of law for the making or submission of false or fraudulent statements or representations (pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Federal Code, which include, but may not be limited to, 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 42 U.S.C. 6928). I certify that the information contained in or accompanying this document is true, accurate, and complete.
As to the (those) identified section(s) of the document for which I cannot personally verify its (their) truth and accuracy, I certify as the official having supervisory responsibility of the persons who, acting under my direct instructions, made the verification that this information is true, accurate, and complete.
In the event that any of this information is determined by EPA in its sole discretion to be false, inaccurate, or incomplete, and upon conveyance of this fact to Energy, I recognize and agree that this exclusion of waste will be void as if it never had effect to the extent directed by EPA and that Energy will be liable for Energy's reliance on the voided exclusion.”
(7) Treated Effluent Disposal Requirements. Energy may at any time propose alternate reuse practices for treated effluent managed under terms of this exclusion in lieu of disposal at the SALDS. Such proposals must be in writing to the Regional Administrator, and demonstrate that the risks and potential human health or environmental exposures from alternate treated effluent disposal or reuse practices do not warrant retaining the waste as a hazardous waste. Upon written approval by EPA of such a proposal, non-hazardous treated effluents may be managed according to the proposed alternate practices in lieu of the SALDS disposal requirement in paragraph (3)(a). The effect of such approved proposals shall be explicitly limited to approving alternate disposal practices in lieu of the requirements in paragraph (3)(a) to dispose of treated effluent in SALDS.
USX Steel Corporation, USS ­Division, Southworks Plant, Gary Works
Chicago, ­Illinois
Fully-cured chemically stabilized electric arc furnace dust/sludge (CSEAFD) treatment residue (EPA Hazardous Waste No. K061) generated from the primary production of steel after April 29, 1991. This exclusion (for 35,000 tons of CSEAFD per year) is conditioned upon the data obtained from USX's full-scale CSEAFD treatment facility. To ensure that hazardous constituents are not present in the waste at levels of regulatory concern once the full-scale treatment facility is in operation, USX must implement a testing program for the petitioned waste. This testing program must meet the following conditions for the exclusion to be valid:
(1)
Testing:
Sample collection and analyses (including quality control (QC) procedures) must be performed using appropriate methods. As applicable to the method-defined parameters of concern, analyses requiring the use of SW-846 methods incorporated by reference in 40 CFR 260.11 must be used without substitution. As applicable, the SW-846 methods might include Methods 0010, 0011, 0020, 0023A, 0030, 0031, 0040, 0050, 0051, 0060, 0061, 1010B, 1020C, 1110A, 1310B, 1311, 1312, 1320, 1330A, 9010C, 9012B, 9040C, 9045D, 9060A, 9070A (uses EPA Method 1664, Rev. A), 9071B, and 9095B.
(A)
Initial Testing:
During the first four weeks of operation of the full-scale treatment system, USX must collect representative grab samples of each treated batch of the CSEAFD and composite the grab samples daily. The daily composites, prior to disposal, must be analyzed for the EP leachate concentrations of all the EP toxic metals, nickel, and cyanide (using distilled water in the cyanide extractions). USX must report the analytical test data, including quality control information, obtained during this initial period no later than 90 days after the treatment of the first full-scale batch.
(B)
Subsequent Testing:
USX must collect representative grab samples from every treated batch of CSEAFD generated daily and composite all of the grab samples to produce a weekly composite sample. USX then must analyze each weekly composite sample for all of the EP toxic metals, and nickel. The analytical data, including quality control information, must be compiled and maintained on site for a minimum of three years. These data must be furnished upon request and made available for inspection by any employee or representative of EPA or the State of Illinois.
(2)
Delisting levels:
If the EP extract concentrations for chromium, lead, arsenic, or silver exceed 0.315 mg/l; for barium exceeds 6.3 mg/l; for cadmium or selenium exceed 0.063 mg/l; for mercury exceeds 0.0126 mg/l; for nickel exceeds 3.15 mg/l; or for cyanide exceeds 4.42 mg/l, the waste must either be re-treated until it meets these levels or managed and disposed in accordance with subtitle C of RCRA.
(3)
Data submittals:
Within one week of system start-up USX must notify the Section Chief, Delisting Section (see address below) when their full-scale stabilization system is on-line and waste treatment has begun. The data obtained through condition (1)(A) must be submitted to the Section Chief, Delisting Section, CAD/OSW (OS-333), U.S. EPA, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460 within the time period specified. At the Section Chief's request, USX must submit any other analytical data obtained through conditions (1)(A) or (1)(B) within the time period specified by the Section Chief. Failure to submit the required data obtained from conditions (1)(A) or (1)(B) within the specified time period or maintain the required records for the specified time will be considered by the Agency, at its discretion, sufficient basis to revoke USX's exclusion to the extent directed by EPA. All data must be accompanied by the following certification statement: “Under civil and criminal penalty of law for the making or submission of false or fraudulent statements or representations (pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Federal Code which include, but may not be limited to, 18 U.S.C. § 6928), I certify that the information contained in or accompanying this document is true, accurate and complete. As to the (those) identified section(s) of this document for which I cannot personally verify its (their) truth and accuracy, I certify as the company official having supervisory responsibility for the persons who, acting under my direct instructions, made the verification that this information is true, accurate and complete. In the event that any of this information is determined by EPA in its sole discretion to be false, inaccurate or incomplete, and upon conveyance of this fact to the company, I recognize and agree that this exclusion of wastes will be void as if it never had effect or to the extent directed by EPA and that the company will be liable for any actions taken in contravention of the company's RCRA and CERCLA obligations prem­ised upon the company's reliance on the void exclusion.”

§ 262.11
Hazardous waste determination and recordkeeping.
A person who generates a solid waste, as defined in 40 CFR 261.2, must make an accurate determination as to whether that waste is a hazardous waste in order to ensure wastes are properly managed according to applicable RCRA regulations. A hazardous waste determination is made using the following steps:
(a) The hazardous waste determination for each solid waste must be made at the point of waste generation, before any dilution, mixing, or other alteration of the waste occurs, and at any time in the course of its management that it has, or may have, changed its properties as a result of exposure to the environment or other factors that may change the properties of the waste such that the RCRA classification of the waste may change.
(b) A person must determine whether the solid waste is excluded from regulation under 40 CFR 261.4.
(c) If the waste is not excluded under 40 CFR 261.4, the person must then use knowledge of the waste to determine whether the waste meets any of the listing descriptions under subpart D of 40 CFR part 261. Acceptable knowledge that may be used in making an accurate determination as to whether the waste is listed may include waste origin, composition, the process producing the waste, feedstock, and other reliable and relevant information. If the waste is listed, the person may file a delisting petition under 40 CFR 260.20 and 260.22 to demonstrate to the Administrator that the waste from this particular site or operation is not a hazardous waste.
(d) The person then must also determine whether the waste exhibits one or more hazardous characteristics as identified in subpart C of 40 CFR part 261 by following the procedures in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, or a combination of both.
(1) The person must apply knowledge of the hazard characteristic of the waste in light of the materials or the processes used to generate the waste. Acceptable knowledge may include process knowledge (
e.g.,
information about chemical feedstocks and other inputs to the production process); knowledge of products, by-products, and intermediates produced by the manufacturing process; chemical or physical characterization of wastes; information on the chemical and physical properties of the chemicals used or produced by the process or otherwise contained in the waste; testing that illustrates the properties of the waste; or other reliable and relevant information about the properties of the waste or its constituents. A test other than a test method set forth in subpart C of 40 CFR part 261, or an equivalent test method approved by the Administrator under 40 CFR 260.21, may be used as part of a person's knowledge to determine whether a solid waste exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste. However, such tests do not, by themselves, provide definitive results. Persons testing their waste must obtain a representative sample of the waste for the testing, as defined at 40 CFR 260.10.
(2) When available knowledge is inadequate to make an accurate determination, the person must test the waste according to the applicable methods set forth in subpart C of 40 CFR part 261 or according to an equivalent method approved by the Administrator under 40 CFR 260.21 and in accordance with the following:
(i) Persons testing their waste must obtain a representative sample of the waste for the testing, as defined at 40 CFR 260.10.
(ii) Where a test method is specified in subpart C of 40 CFR part 261, the results of the regulatory test, when properly performed, are definitive for determining the regulatory status of the waste.
(e) If the waste is determined to be hazardous, the generator must refer to parts 261, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, and 273 of this chapter for other possible exclusions or restrictions pertaining to management of the specific waste.
(f)
Recordkeeping for small and large quantity generators.
A small or large quantity generator must maintain records supporting its hazardous waste determinations, including records that identify whether a solid waste is a hazardous waste, as defined by 40 CFR 261.3. Records must be maintained for at least three years from the date that the waste was last sent to on-site or off-site treatment, storage, or disposal. These records must comprise the generator's knowledge of the waste and support the generator's determination, as described at paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The records must include, but are not limited to, the following types of information: The results of any tests, sampling, waste analyses, or other determinations made in accordance with this section; records documenting the tests, sampling, and analytical methods used to demonstrate the validity and relevance of such tests; records consulted in order to determine the process by which the waste was generated, the composition of the waste, and the properties of the waste; and records which explain the knowledge basis for the generator's determination, as described at paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The periods of record retention referred to in this section are extended automatically during the course of any unresolved enforcement action regarding the regulated activity or as requested by the Administrator.
(g)
Identifying hazardous waste numbers for small and large quantity generators.
If the waste is determined to be hazardous, small quantity generators and large quantity generators must identify all applicable EPA hazardous waste numbers (EPA hazardous waste codes) in subparts C and D of part 261 of this chapter. Prior to shipping the waste off site, the generator also must mark its containers with all applicable EPA hazardous waste numbers (EPA hazardous waste codes) according to § 262.32.
[81 FR 85807, Nov. 28, 2016]
§ 262.12
[Reserved]
§ 262.13
Generator category determination.
A generator must determine its generator category. A generator's category is based on the amount of hazardous waste generated each month and may change from month to month. This section sets forth procedures to determine whether a generator is a very small quantity generator, a small quantity generator, or a large quantity generator for a particular month, as defined in § 260.10 of this chapter.
(a)
Generators of either acute hazardous waste or non-acute hazardous waste.
A generator who either generates acute hazardous waste or non-acute hazardous waste in a calendar month shall determine its generator category for that month by doing the following:
(1) Counting the total amount of hazardous waste generated in the calendar month;
(2) Subtracting from the total any amounts of waste exempt from counting as described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section; and
(3) Determining the resulting generator category for the hazardous waste generated using Table 1 of this section.
(b)
Generators of both acute and non-acute hazardous wastes.
A generator who generates both acute hazardous waste and non-acute hazardous waste in the same calendar month shall determine its generator category for that month by doing the following:
(1) Counting separately the total amount of acute hazardous waste and the total amount of non-acute hazardous waste generated in the calendar month;
(2) Subtracting from each total any amounts of waste exempt from counting as described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section;
(3) Determining separately the resulting generator categories for the
quantities of acute and non-acute hazardous waste generated using Table 1 of this section; and
(4) Comparing the resulting generator categories from paragraph (b)(3) of this section and applying the more stringent generator category to the accumulation and management of both non-acute hazardous waste and acute hazardous waste generated for that month.

(c) When making the monthly quantity-based determinations required by this part, the generator must include all hazardous waste that it generates, except hazardous waste that:
(1) Is exempt from regulation under 40 CFR 261.4(c) through (f), 261.6(a)(3), 261.7(a)(1), or 261.8;
(2) Is managed immediately upon generation only in on-site elementary neutralization units, wastewater treatment units, or totally enclosed treatment facilities as defined in 40 CFR 260.10;
(3) Is recycled, without prior storage or accumulation, only in an on-site process subject to regulation under 40 CFR 261.6(c)(2);
(4) Is used oil managed under the requirements of 40 CFR 261.6(a)(4) and 40 CFR part 279;
(5) Is spent lead-acid batteries managed under the requirements of 40 CFR part 266 subpart G;
(6) Is universal waste managed under 40 CFR 261.9 and 40 CFR part 273;
(7) Is a hazardous waste that is an unused commercial chemical product (listed in 40 CFR part 261 subpart D or exhibiting one or more characteristics in 40 CFR part 261 subpart C) that is generated solely as a result of a laboratory clean-out conducted at an eligible academic entity pursuant to § 262.213. For purposes of this provision, the term eligible academic entity shall have the meaning as defined in § 262.200; or
(8) Is managed as part of an episodic event in compliance with the conditions of subpart L of this part.
(9) Is a hazardous waste pharmaceutical, as defined in § 266.500, that is subject to or managed in accordance with 40 CFR part 266 subpart P or is a hazardous waste pharmaceutical that is also a Drug Enforcement Administration controlled substance and is conditionally exempt under § 266.506.
(d) In determining the quantity of hazardous waste generated in a calendar month, a generator need not include:
(1) Hazardous waste when it is removed from on-site accumulation, so long as the hazardous waste was previously counted once;
(2) Hazardous waste generated by on-site treatment (including reclamation) of the generator's hazardous waste, so long as the hazardous waste that is treated was previously counted once; and
(3) Hazardous waste spent materials that are generated, reclaimed, and subsequently reused on site, so long as such spent materials have been previously counted once.
(e) Based on the generator category as determined under this section, the generator must meet the applicable independent requirements listed in § 262.10. A generator's category also determines which of the provisions of §§ 262.14, 262.15, 262.16 or 262.17 must be met to obtain an exemption from the storage facility permit, interim status,
and operating requirements when accumulating hazardous waste.
(f)
Mixing hazardous wastes with solid wastes
—(1)
Very small quantity generator wastes.
(i) Hazardous wastes generated by a very small quantity generator may be mixed with solid wastes. Very small quantity generators may mix a portion or all of its hazardous waste with solid waste and remain subject to § 262.14 even though the resultant mixture exceeds the quantity limits identified in the definition of very small quantity generator at § 260.10 of this chapter, unless the mixture exhibits one or more of the characteristics of hazardous waste identified in part 261 subpart C of this chapter.
(ii) If the resulting mixture exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste, this resultant mixture is a newly-generated hazardous waste. The very small quantity generator must count both the resultant mixture amount plus the other hazardous waste generated in the calendar month to determine whether the total quantity exceeds the very small quantity generator calendar month quantity limits identified in the definition of generator categories found in § 260.10 of this chapter. If so, to remain exempt from the permitting, interim status, and operating standards, the very small quantity generator must meet the conditions for exemption applicable to either a small quantity generator or a large quantity generator. The very small quantity generator must also comply with the applicable independent requirements for either a small quantity generator or a large quantity generator.
(iii) If a very small quantity generator's wastes are mixed with used oil, the mixture is subject to 40 CFR part 279. Any material produced from such a mixture by processing, blending, or other treatment is also regulated under 40 CFR part 279.
(2)
Small quantity generator and large quantity generator wastes.
(i) Hazardous wastes generated by a small quantity generator or large quantity generator may be mixed with solid waste. These mixtures are subject to the following: the mixture rule in §§ 261.3(a)(2)(iv), (b)(2) and (3), and (g)(2)(i); the prohibition of dilution rule at § 268.3(a); the land disposal restriction requirements of § 268.40 if a characteristic hazardous waste is mixed with a solid waste so that it no longer exhibits the hazardous characteristic; and the hazardous waste determination requirement at § 262.11.
(ii) If the resulting mixture is found to be a hazardous waste, this resultant mixture is a newly-generated hazardous waste. A small quantity generator must count both the resultant mixture amount plus the other hazardous waste generated in the calendar month to determine whether the total quantity exceeds the small quantity generator calendar monthly quantity limits identified in the definition of generator categories found in § 260.10 of this chapter. If so, to remain exempt from the permitting, interim status, and operating standards, the small quantity generator must meet the conditions for exemption applicable to a large quantity generator. The small quantity generator must also comply with the applicable independent requirements for a large quantity generator.

(g)(1) A generator may use manifests printed by any source so long as the source of the printed form has received approval from EPA to print the manifest under paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section. A registered source may be a:
(i) State agency;
(ii) Commercial printer;
(iii) Hazardous waste generator, transporter or TSDF; or
(iv) Hazardous waste broker or other preparer who prepares or arranges shipments of hazardous waste for transportation.
(2) A generator must determine whether the generator state or the consignment state for a shipment regulates any additional wastes (beyond those regulated Federally) as hazardous wastes under these states' authorized programs. Generators also must determine whether the consignment state or generator state requires the generator to submit any copies of the manifest to these states. In cases where the generator must supply copies to either the generator's state or the consignment state, the generator is responsible for supplying legible photocopies of the manifest to these states.
(h)(1) If an approved registrant would like to update any of the information provided in its application approved under paragraph (c) of this section (e.g., to update a company phone number or name of contact person), the registrant must revise the application and submit it to the EPA Director of the Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery, along with an indication or explanation of the update, as soon as practicable after the change occurs. The Agency either will approve or deny the revision. If the Agency denies the revision, it will explain the reasons for the denial, and it will contact the registrant and request further modification before approval.
(2) If the registrant would like a new tracking number suffix, the registrant must submit a proposed suffix to the EPA Director of the Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery, along with the reason for requesting it. The Agency will either approve the suffix or deny the suffix and provide an explanation why it is not acceptable.
(3) If a registrant would like to change the paper type, paper weight, ink color of the manifest instructions, or binding method of its manifest or continuation sheet subsequent to approval under paragraph (e) of this section, then the registrant must submit three samples of the revised form for EPA review and approval. If the approved registrant would like to use a new printer, the registrant must submit three manifest samples printed by the new printer, along with a brief description of the printer's qualifications to print the manifest. EPA will evaluate the manifests and either approve the registrant to print the forms as proposed or request additional information or modification to them before approval. EPA will notify the registrant of its decision by mail. The registrant cannot use or distribute its revised forms until EPA approves them.
(i) If, subsequent to its approval under paragraph (e) of this section, a registrant typesets its manifest or continuation sheet instead of using the electronic file of the forms provided by EPA, it must submit three samples of the manifest or continuation sheet to the registry for approval. EPA will evaluate the manifests or continuation sheets and either approve the registrant to print them as proposed or request additional information or modification to them before approval. EPA will notify the registrant of its decision by mail. The registrant cannot use or distribute its typeset forms until EPA approves them.
(j) EPA may exempt a registrant from the requirement to submit form samples under paragraph (d) or (h)(3) of this section if the Agency is persuaded that a separate review of the registrant's forms would serve little purpose in informing an approval decision (e.g., a registrant certifies that it will print the manifest using the same paper type, paper weight, ink color of the instructions and binding method of the form samples approved for some other registrant). A registrant may request an exemption from EPA by indicating why an exemption is warranted.
(k) An approved registrant must notify EPA by phone or email as soon as it becomes aware that it has duplicated tracking numbers on any manifests that have been used or distributed to other parties.
(l) If, subsequent to approval of a registrant under paragraph (e) of this section, EPA becomes aware that the approved paper type, paper weight, ink color of the instructions, or binding
method of the registrant's form is unsatisfactory, EPA will contact the registrant and require modifications to the form.
(m)(1) EPA may suspend and, if necessary, revoke printing privileges if we find that the registrant:
(i) Has used or distributed forms that deviate from its approved form samples in regard to paper weight, paper type, ink color of the instructions, or binding method; or
(ii) Exhibits a continuing pattern of behavior in using or distributing manifests that contain duplicate manifest tracking numbers.
(2) EPA will send a warning letter to the registrant that specifies the date by which it must come into compliance with the requirements. If the registrant does not come in compliance by the specified date, EPA will send a second letter notifying the registrant that EPA has suspended or revoked its printing privileges. An approved registrant must provide information on its printing activities to EPA if requested.

§ 262.24
Use of the electronic manifest.
(a)
Legal equivalence to paper manifests.
Electronic manifests that are obtained, completed, and transmitted in accordance with § 262.20(a)(3), and used in accordance with this section in lieu of EPA Forms 8700-22 and 8700-22A are the legal equivalent of paper manifest forms bearing handwritten signatures, and satisfy for all purposes any requirement in these regulations to obtain, complete, sign, provide, use, or retain a manifest.
(1) Any requirement in these regulations to sign a manifest or manifest certification by hand, or to obtain a handwritten signature, is satisfied by signing with or obtaining a valid and enforceable electronic signature within the meaning of 262.25.
(2) Any requirement in these regulations to give, provide, send, forward, or return to another person a copy of the manifest is satisfied when an electronic manifest is transmitted to the other person by submission to the system.
(3) Any requirement in these regulations for a generator to keep or retain a copy of each manifest is satisfied by retention of a signed electronic manifest in the generator's account on the national e-Manifest system, provided that such copies are readily available for viewing and production if requested by any EPA or authorized state inspector.
(4) No generator may be held liable for the inability to produce an electronic manifest for inspection under this section if the generator can demonstrate that the inability to produce the electronic manifest is due exclusively to a technical difficulty with the electronic manifest system for which the generator bears no responsibility.
(b) A generator may participate in the electronic manifest system either by accessing the electronic manifest system from its own electronic equipment, or by accessing the electronic manifest system from portable equipment brought to the generator's site by the transporter who accepts the hazardous waste shipment from the generator for off-site transportation.
(c)
Restriction on use of electronic manifests.
A generator may use an electronic manifest for the tracking of waste shipments involving any RCRA hazardous waste only if it is known at the time the manifest is originated that all waste handlers named on the manifest participate in the use of the electronic manifest, except that:
(1) A generator may sign by hand and retain a paper copy of the manifest signed by hand by the initial transporter, in lieu of executing the generator copy electronically, thereby enabling the transporter and subsequent waste handlers to execute the remainder of the manifest copies electronically.
(2) [Reserved]
(d)
Requirement for one printed copy.
To the extent the Hazardous Materials regulation on shipping papers for carriage by public highway requires shippers of hazardous materials to supply a paper document for compliance with 49 CFR 177.817, a generator originating an electronic manifest must also provide the initial transporter with one printed copy of the electronic manifest.
(e)
Special procedures when electronic manifest is unavailable.
If a generator has prepared an electronic manifest for a hazardous waste shipment, but the electronic manifest system becomes unavailable for any reason prior to the time that the initial transporter has signed electronically to acknowledge the receipt of the hazardous waste from the generator, then the generator must obtain and complete a paper manifest and if necessary, a continuation sheet (EPA Forms 8700-22 and 8700-22A) in accordance with the manifest instructions, and use these paper forms from this point forward in accordance with the requirements of § 262.23.
(f)
Special procedures for electronic signature methods undergoing tests.
If a generator has prepared an electronic manifest for a hazardous waste shipment, and signs this manifest electronically using an electronic signature method which is undergoing pilot
or demonstration tests aimed at demonstrating the practicality or legal dependability of the signature method, then the generator shall also sign with an ink signature the generator/offeror certification on the printed copy of the manifest provided under paragraph (d) of this section.

(i) Green wastes that are not hazardous wastes are subject to existing controls normally applied to commercial transactions, and are not subject to the requirements of this subpart.
(ii) Green wastes that are hazardous wastes are subject to the requirements of this subpart.
(2)
Amber list wastes.
(i) Amber wastes that are hazardous wastes are subject to the requirements of this subpart, even if they are imported to or exported from a country that does not consider the waste to be hazardous or control the transboundary shipment as a hazardous waste import or export.
(A) For exports, the exporter must comply with § 262.83.
(B) For imports, the recovery or disposal facility and the importer must comply with § 262.84.
(ii) Amber wastes that are not hazardous wastes, but are considered hazardous by the other country are subject to the Amber control procedures in the country that considers the waste hazardous, and are not subject to the requirements of this subpart. All responsibilities of the importer or exporter shift to the foreign importer or foreign exporter in the other country that considers the waste hazardous unless the parties make other arrangements through contracts.

# Note to paragraph (
a

# )(2):
Some Amber list wastes are not listed or otherwise identified as hazardous under RCRA, and therefore are not subject to the requirements of this subpart. Regardless of the status of the waste under RCRA, however, other Federal environmental statutes (
e.g.,
the Toxic Substances Control Act) restrict certain waste imports or exports. Such restrictions continue to apply with regard to this subpart.
(3)
Mixtures of wastes.
(i) A Green waste that is mixed with one or more other Green wastes such that the resulting mixture is not hazardous waste is not subject to the requirements of this subpart.

# Note to paragraph (
a

# )(3)(
i

# ):
The regulated community should note that some countries may require, by domestic law, that mixtures of different Green wastes be subject to the Amber control procedures.
(ii) A Green waste that is mixed with one or more Amber wastes, in any amount, de minimis or otherwise, or a mixture of two or more Amber wastes, such that the resulting waste mixture is hazardous waste is subject to the requirements of this subpart.

# Note to paragraph (
a

# )(3)(
ii

# ):
The regulated community should note that some countries may require, by domestic law, that a mixture of a Green waste and more than a de minimis amount of an Amber waste or a mixture of two or more Amber wastes be subject to the Amber control procedures.
(4) Wastes not yet assigned to an OECD waste list are eligible for transboundary movements, as follows:
(i) If such wastes are hazardous wastes, such wastes are subject to the requirements of this subpart.
(ii) If such wastes are not hazardous wastes, such wastes are not subject to the requirements of this subpart.
(b)
General conditions applicable to transboundary movements of hazardous waste.
(1) The hazardous waste must be destined for recovery or disposal operations at a facility that, under applicable domestic law, is operating or is authorized to operate in the country of import;
(2) The transboundary movement must be in compliance with applicable international transport agreements; and

# Note to paragraph (
b

# )(2):
These international agreements include, but are not limited to, the Chicago Convention (1944), ADR (1957), ADNR (1970), MARPOL Convention (1973/1978), SOLAS Convention (1974), IMDG Code (1985), COTIF (1985), and RID (1985).
(3) Any transit of hazardous waste through one or more countries must be conducted in compliance with all applicable international and national laws and regulations.
(c)
Duty to return wastes subject to the Amber control procedures during transit through the United States.
When a transboundary movement of hazardous wastes transiting the United States and subject to the Amber control procedures does not comply with the requirements of the notification and movement documents or otherwise constitutes illegal shipment, and if alternative arrangements cannot be made to recover or dispose of these wastes in an environmentally sound manner, the waste must be returned to the country of export. The U.S. transporter must inform EPA at the specified mailing address in paragraph (e) of this section of the need to return the shipment. EPA will then inform the competent authority of the country of export, citing the reason(s) for returning the waste. The U.S. transporter must complete the return within ninety (90) days from the time EPA informs the country of export of the need to return the waste, unless informed in writing by EPA of another timeframe agreed to by the concerned countries.

When the exporter wishes to change any of the information specified on the original notification (including increasing the estimate of the total quantity of hazardous waste specified in the original notification or adding transporters), the exporter must submit a renotification of the changes to EPA using the allowable methods in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Any shipment using the requested changes cannot take place until the countries of import and transit consent to the changes and the exporter receives an EPA AOC letter documenting the countries' consents to the changes.
(5) For cases where the proposed country of import and recovery or disposal operations are not covered under an international agreement to which both the United States and the country of import are parties, EPA will coordinate with the Department of State to provide the complete notification to country of import and any countries of transit. In all other cases, EPA will provide the notification directly to the country of import and any countries of transit. A notification is complete when EPA receives a notification which EPA determines satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (xiii) of this section.
(6) Where the countries of import and transit consent to the proposed transboundary movement(s) of the hazardous waste(s), EPA will forward an EPA AOC letter to the exporter documenting the countries' consents. Where any of the countries of import and transit objects to the proposed transboundary movement(s) of the hazardous waste or withdraws a prior consent, EPA will notify the exporter.
(7) Export of hazardous wastes for recycling or disposal operations that were originally imported into the United States for recycling or disposal operations in a third country is prohibited unless an exporter in the United States complies with the export requirements in § 262.83, including providing notification to EPA in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section. In addition to listing all required information in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xiii) of this section, the exporter must provide the original consent number issued for the initial import of the wastes in the notification, and receive an AOC from EPA documenting the consent of the competent authorities in new country of import, the original country of export, and any transit countries prior to re-export.

If the waste must be returned, the exporter must provide for the return of the hazardous waste shipment within ninety days from the time the country of import informs EPA of the need to return the waste or such other period of time as the concerned countries agree. In all cases, the exporter must submit an exception report to EPA in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
(f)
Export contract requirements.
(1) Exports of hazardous waste are prohibited unless they occur under the terms of a valid written contract, chain of contracts, or equivalent arrangements (when the movement occurs between parties controlled by the same corporate or legal entity). Such contracts or equivalent arrangements must be
executed by the exporter, foreign importer (if different from the foreign receiving facility), and the owner or operator of the foreign receiving facility, and must specify responsibilities for each. Contracts or equivalent arrangements are valid for the purposes of this section only if persons assuming obligations under the contracts or equivalent arrangements have appropriate legal status to conduct the operations specified in the contract or equivalent arrangements.
(2) Contracts or equivalent arrangements must specify the name and EPA ID number, where available, of paragraph (f)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section:
(i) The company from where each export shipment of hazardous waste is initiated;
(ii) Each person who will have physical custody of the hazardous wastes;
(iii) Each person who will have legal control of the hazardous wastes; and
(iv) The foreign receiving facility.
(3) Contracts or equivalent arrangements must specify which party to the contract will assume responsibility for alternate management of the hazardous wastes if their disposition cannot be carried out as described in the notification of intent to export. In such cases, contracts must specify that:
(i) The transporter or foreign receiving facility having actual possession or physical control over the hazardous wastes will immediately inform the exporter, EPA, and either the competent authority of the country of transit or the competent authority of the country of import of the need to make alternate management arrangements;
(ii) The person specified in the contract will assume responsibility for the adequate management of the hazardous wastes in compliance with applicable laws and regulations including, if necessary, arranging the return of hazardous wastes and, as the case may be, shall provide the notification for re-export to the competent authority in the country of import and include the equivalent of the information required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the original consent number issued for the initial export of the hazardous wastes in the notification, and obtain consent from EPA and the competent authorities in the new country of import and any transit countries prior to re-export; and
(iii) Transmittals made by the transporter or foreign receiving facility under paragraph (i) of this section being sent to the exporter or the EPA from a country with which the EPA has established an electronic exchange of movement document tracking data may be sent via the electronic exchange.
(4) Contracts must specify that the foreign receiving facility send a copy of the signed movement document to confirm receipt within three working days of shipment delivery to the exporter and to the competent authorities of the countries of import and transit that control the shipment as an import and transit of hazardous waste respectively. For shipments sent to a country with which the EPA has established an electronic exchange of movement document tracking data, foreign receiving facility transmittal to the exporter of the confirmation of receipt may be sent via the electronic exchange.
(5) Contracts must specify that the foreign receiving facility shall send a copy of the signed and dated confirmation of recovery or disposal, as soon as possible, but no later than thirty days after completing recovery or disposal on the waste in the shipment and no later than one calendar year following receipt of the waste, to the exporter and to the competent authority of the country of import that controls the shipment as an import of hazardous waste. For shipments sent to a country with which the EPA has established an electronic exchange of movement document tracking data, foreign receiving facility transmittal to the exporter of the confirmation of recovery or disposal may be sent via the electronic exchange.
(6) Contracts must specify that the foreign importer or the foreign receiving facility that performed interim recycling operations R12, R13, or RC3, or interim disposal operations D13 through D15, (recovery and disposal operations defined in 40 CFR 262.81) as appropriate, will:
(i) Provide the notification required in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section prior to any re-export of the hazardous
wastes to a final foreign recovery or disposal facility in a third country; and
(ii) Promptly send copies of the confirmation of recovery or disposal that it receives from the final foreign recovery or disposal facility within one year of shipment delivery to the final foreign recovery or disposal facility that performed one of recovery operations R1 through R11, or RC1, or one of disposal operations D1 through D12, DC1 or DC2 to the competent authority of the country of import that controls the shipment as an import of hazardous waste and to the exporter. For shipments sent to a country with which the EPA has established an electronic exchange of movement document tracking data, foreign receiving facility transmittal to the exporter of the confirmation of recovery or disposal may be sent via the electronic exchange.
(7) Contracts or equivalent arrangements must include provisions for financial guarantees, if required by the competent authorities of the country of import and any countries of transit, in accordance with applicable national or international law requirements.

# Note 1 to paragraph (
f

# )(7):
Financial guarantees so required are intended to provide for alternate recycling, disposal or other means of sound management of the wastes in cases where arrangements for the shipment and the recovery operations cannot be carried out as foreseen. The United States does not require such financial guarantees at this time; however, some OECD Member countries and other foreign countries do. It is the responsibility of the exporter to ascertain and comply with such requirements; in some cases, persons or facilities located in those OECD Member countries or other foreign countries may refuse to enter into the necessary contracts absent specific references or certifications to financial guarantees.
(8) Contracts or equivalent arrangements must contain provisions requiring each contracting party to comply with all applicable requirements of this subpart.
(9) Upon request by EPA, U.S. exporters, importers, or recovery facilities must submit to EPA copies of contracts, chain of contracts, or equivalent arrangements (when the movement occurs between parties controlled by the same corporate or legal entity).

The United States does not currently require financial assurance for these waste shipments.
(2) Notifications listing interim recycling operations or interim disposal operations. If the receiving facility listed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section will engage in any of the interim recovery operations R12, R13 or RC3 or interim disposal operations D13 through D15, the notification submitted according to paragraph (b)(1) of this section must also include the final recovery or disposal facility name, site address, telephone, fax numbers, email address, technologies employed, and which of the applicable recovery or disposal operations R1 through R11, RC1, and D1 through D12, will be employed at the final recovery or disposal facility. The recovery and disposal operations in this paragraph are defined in § 262.81.
(3)
Renotifications.
When the foreign exporter wishes to change any of the conditions specified on the original notification (including increasing the estimate of the total quantity of hazardous waste specified in the original notification or adding transporters), the importer must submit a renotification of the changes to EPA using the allowable methods in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Any shipment using the requested changes cannot take place until EPA and the countries of transit consent to the changes and the importer receives an EPA AOC letter documenting the consents to the changes.
(4) A notification is complete when EPA determines the notification satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (xiii) of this section.
(5) Where EPA and the countries of transit consent to the proposed transboundary movement(s) of the hazardous waste(s), EPA will forward an EPA AOC letter to the importer documenting the countries' consents and EPA's consent. Where any of the countries of transit or EPA objects to the proposed transboundary movement(s) of the hazardous waste or withdraws a prior consent, EPA will notify the importer.
(6) Export of hazardous wastes originally imported into the United States. Export of hazardous wastes that were originally imported into the United States for recycling or disposal operations is prohibited unless an exporter in the United States complies with the export requirements in § 262.83(b)(7).
(c)
RCRA Manifest instructions for import shipments.
(1) When importing hazardous waste, the importer must meet all the requirements of § 262.20 for the manifest except that:
(i) In place of the generator's name, mailing and site addresses and EPA identification number, the name and site address of the foreign generator and the importer's name, mailing address and EPA identification number must be used.
(ii) In place of the generator's signature on the certification statement, the importer or his agent must sign and date the certification and obtain the signature of the initial transporter.
(2) The importer may obtain the manifest form from any source that is registered with the EPA as a supplier of manifests (
e.g.,
states, waste handlers, and/or commercial forms printers).
(3) In the International Shipments block on the Continuation Sheet (EPA Form 8700-22A), the importer must check the import box and enter the port of entry (city and State) into the United States.
(4) In lieu of the requirements of § 262.20(d), where a shipment cannot be
delivered for any reason to the receiving facility, the importer must instruct the transporter in writing via fax, email or mail to:
(i) Return the hazardous waste to the foreign exporter or designate another facility within the United States; and
(ii) Revise the manifest in accordance with the importer's instructions.
(d)
Movement document requirements for import shipments.
(1) The importer must ensure that a movement document meeting the conditions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section accompanies each transboundary movement of hazardous wastes from the initiation of the shipment in the country of export until it reaches the receiving facility, including cases in which the hazardous waste is stored and/or sorted by the importer prior to shipment to the receiving facility, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) For shipments of hazardous waste within the United States by water (bulk shipments only), the importer must forward the movement document to the last water (bulk shipment) transporter to handle the hazardous waste in the United States if imported by water.
(ii) For rail shipments of hazardous waste within the United States which start from the company originating the export shipment, the importer must forward the movement document to the next non-rail transporter, if any, or the last rail transporter to handle the hazardous waste in the United States if imported by rail.
(2) The movement document must include the following paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (xv) of this section:
(i) The corresponding AOC number(s) and waste number(s) for the listed waste and if required to be accompanied by a RCRA uniform hazardous waste manifest within the United States, the manifest tracking number from block 4;
(ii) The shipment number and the total number of shipments under the AOC number or the movement tracking number;
(iii) Foreign exporter name, site address, telephone, fax numbers, and email address;
(iv) Receiving facility name, EPA ID number, site address, telephone, fax numbers, email address, technologies employed, and the applicable recovery or disposal operations as defined in § 262.81;

(xiv) Each person that has physical custody of the waste from the time the movement commences until it arrives at the receiving facility must sign the movement document (
e.g.,
transporter, importer, and owner or operator of the receiving facility); and
(xv) The receiving facility must send a copy of the signed movement document to confirm receipt within three working days of shipment delivery to the foreign exporter and to the competent authorities of the countries of export and transit that control the shipment as an export and transit of
hazardous waste respectively. For shipments received on or after the electronic import-export reporting compliance date, the receiving facility must close out the movement document to confirm receipt within three working days of shipment delivery using the EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system. For shipments sent from a country with which the EPA has established an electronic exchange of movement document tracking data, the receiving facility may use WIETS or its successor system to send movement document confirmation data back through the electronic exchange to the foreign exporter and the country of export.
(e)
Duty to return or export hazardous wastes.
When a transboundary movement of hazardous wastes cannot be completed in accordance with the terms of the contract or the consent(s), the provisions of paragraph (f)(4) of this section apply. If alternative arrangements cannot be made to recover the hazardous waste in an environmentally sound manner in the United States, the hazardous waste must be returned to the country of export or exported to a third country. The provisions of paragraph (b)(6) of this section apply to any hazardous waste shipments to be exported to a third country. If the return shipment will cross any transit country, the return shipment may only occur after EPA provides notification to and obtains consent from the competent authority of the country of transit, and provides a copy of that consent to the importer.
(f)
Import contract requirements.
(1) Imports of hazardous waste must occur under the terms of a valid written contract, chain of contracts, or equivalent arrangements (when the movement occurs between parties controlled by the same corporate or legal entity). Such contracts or equivalent arrangements must be executed by the foreign exporter, importer, and the owner or operator of the receiving facility, and must specify responsibilities for each. Contracts or equivalent arrangements are valid for the purposes of this section only if persons assuming obligations under the contracts or equivalent arrangements have appropriate legal status to conduct the operations specified in the contract or equivalent arrangements.
(2) Contracts or equivalent arrangements must specify the name and EPA ID number, where available, of paragraph (f)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section:
(i) The foreign company from where each import shipment of hazardous waste is initiated;
(ii) Each person who will have physical custody of the hazardous wastes;
(iii) Each person who will have legal control of the hazardous wastes; and
(iv) The receiving facility.
(3) Contracts or equivalent arrangements must specify the use of a movement document in accordance with § 262.84(d).
(4) Contracts or equivalent arrangements must specify which party to the contract will assume responsibility for alternate management of the hazardous wastes if their disposition cannot be carried out as described in the notification of intent to export submitted by either the foreign exporter or the importer. In such cases, contracts must specify that:
(i) The transporter or receiving facility having actual possession or physical control over the hazardous wastes will immediately inform the foreign exporter and importer, and the competent authority where the shipment is located of the need to arrange alternate management or return; and
(ii) The person specified in the contract will assume responsibility for the adequate management of the hazardous wastes in compliance with applicable laws and regulations including, if necessary, arranging the return of the hazardous wastes and, as the case may be, shall provide the notification for re-export required in § 262.83(b)(7).
(iii) Transmittals made by the transporter or receiving facility under paragraph (i) of this section being sent to a competent authority or foreign exporter in a country with which the EPA has established an electronic exchange of movement document tracking data may be sent via the electronic exchange.
(5) Contracts must specify that the importer or the receiving facility that performed interim recycling operations R12, R13, or RC3, or interim disposal
operations D13 through D15, as appropriate, will provide the notification required in § 262.83(b)(7) prior to the re-export of hazardous wastes. The recovery and disposal operations in this paragraph are defined in § 262.81.
(6) Contracts or equivalent arrangements must include provisions for financial guarantees, if required by the competent authorities of any countries concerned, in accordance with applicable national or international law requirements.

# Note to paragraph (
f

# )(6):
Financial guarantees so required are intended to provide for alternate recycling, disposal or other means of sound management of the wastes in cases where arrangements for the shipment and the recovery operations cannot be carried out as foreseen. The United States does not require such financial guarantees at this time; however, some OECD Member countries or other foreign countries do. It is the responsibility of the importer to ascertain and comply with such requirements; in some cases, persons or facilities located in those countries may refuse to enter into the necessary contracts absent specific references or certifications to financial guarantees.
(7) Contracts or equivalent arrangements must contain provisions requiring each contracting party to comply with all applicable requirements of this subpart.
(8) Upon request by EPA, importers or disposal or recovery facilities must submit to EPA copies of contracts, chain of contracts, or equivalent arrangements (when the movement occurs between parties controlled by the same corporate or legal entity).
(g)
Confirmation of recovery or disposal.
The receiving facility must do the following:
(1) Send copies of the signed and dated confirmation of recovery or disposal, as soon as possible, but no later than thirty days after completing recovery or disposal on the waste in the shipment and no later than one calendar year following receipt of the waste, to the foreign exporter, to the competent authority of the country of export that controls the shipment as an export of hazardous waste, and for shipments recycled or disposed of on or after the electronic import-export reporting compliance date, to the EPA electronically using the EPA's WIETS, or its successor system. For shipments sent from a country with which the EPA has established an electronic exchange of movement document tracking data, the receiving facility may use WIETS or its successor system to send confirmation of recovery or disposal data back through the electronic exchange to the foreign exporter and the country of export.
(2) If the receiving facility performed any of recovery operations R12, R13, or RC3, or disposal operations D13 through D15, the receiving facility shall promptly send copies of the confirmation of recovery or disposal that it receives from the final recovery or disposal facility within one year of shipment delivery to the final recovery or disposal facility that performed one of recovery operations R1 through R11, or RC1 to RC2, or one of disposal operations D1 through D12, or DC1 to DC2, to the competent authority of the country of export that controls the shipment as an export of hazardous waste, and for confirmations received on or after the electronic import-export reporting compliance date, to the EPA electronically using the EPA's WIETS, or its successor system. The recovery and disposal operations in this paragraph (g)(2) are defined in § 262.81. For shipments sent from a country with which the EPA has established an electronic exchange of movement document tracking data, the receiving facility may use WIETS or its successor system to send confirmation of recovery or disposal data back through the electronic exchange to the country of export.
(h)
Recordkeeping.
(1) The importer shall keep the following records and provide them to EPA or authorized state personnel upon request:
(i) A copy of each notification that the importer sends to EPA under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and each EPA AOC it receives in response for a period of at least three (3) years from the date the hazardous waste was accepted by the initial foreign transporter; and
(ii) A copy of each contract or equivalent arrangement established per paragraph (f) of this section for at least three (3) years from the expiration date of the contract or equivalent arrangement.
(2) The receiving facility shall keep the following records:
(i) A copy of each confirmation of receipt (
i.e.,
movement document) that the receiving facility sends to the foreign exporter for at least three (3) years from the date it received the hazardous waste;
(ii) A copy of each confirmation of recovery or disposal that the receiving facility sends to the foreign exporter for at least three (3) years from the date that it completed processing the waste shipment;
(iii) For the receiving facility that performed any of recovery operations R12, R13, or RC3, or disposal operations D13 through D15 (recovery and disposal operations defined in § 262.81), a copy of each confirmation of recovery or disposal that the final recovery or disposal facility sent to it for at least three (3) years from the date that the final recovery or disposal facility completed processing the waste shipment; and
(iv) A copy of each contract or equivalent arrangement established per paragraph (f) of this section for at least three (3) years from the expiration date of the contract or equivalent arrangement.
(3) Importers and receiving facilities may satisfy these recordkeeping requirements by retaining electronically submitted documents in the importer's or receiving facility's account on EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system, provided that copies are readily available for viewing and production if requested by any EPA or authorized state inspector. No importer or receiving facility may be held liable for the inability to produce such documents for inspection under this section if the importer or receiving facility can demonstrate that the inability to produce the document is due exclusively to technical difficulty with EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system for which the importer or receiving facility bears no responsibility.
(4) The periods of retention referred to in this section are extended automatically during the course of any unresolved enforcement action regarding the regulated activity or as requested by the Administrator.

# Subpart K—Alternative Requirements for Hazardous Waste Determination and Accumulation of Unwanted Material for Laboratories Owned by Eligible Academic Entities

# Source:
73 FR 72954, Dec. 1, 2008, unless otherwise noted.
§ 262.200
Definitions for this subpart.
The following definitions apply to this subpart:
College/University
means a private or public, post-secondary, degree-granting, academic institution, that is accredited by an accrediting agency listed annually by the U.S. Department of Education.
Eligible academic entity
means a college or university, or a non-profit research institute that is owned by or has a formal written affiliation agreement with a college or university, or a teaching hospital that is owned by or has a formal written affiliation agreement with a college or university.
Formal written affiliation agreement
for a non-profit research institute means a written document that establishes a relationship between institutions for the purposes of research and/or education and is signed by authorized representatives, as defined by § 260.10, from each institution. A relationship on a project-by-project or grant-by-grant basis is not considered a formal written affiliation agreement. A
formal written affiliation agreement
for a teaching hospital means a master affiliation agreement and program letter of agreement, as defined by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, with an accredited medical program or medical school.
Laboratory
means an area owned by an eligible academic entity where relatively small quantities of chemicals
and other substances are used on a non-production basis for teaching or research (or diagnostic purposes at a teaching hospital) and are stored and used in containers that are easily manipulated by one person. Photo laboratories, art studios, and field laboratories are considered laboratories. Areas such as chemical stockrooms and preparatory laboratories that provide a support function to teaching or research laboratories (or diagnostic laboratories at teaching hospitals) are also considered laboratories.
Laboratory clean-out
means an evaluation of the inventory of chemicals and other materials in a laboratory that are no longer needed or that have expired and the subsequent removal of those chemicals or other unwanted materials from the laboratory. A clean-out may occur for several reasons. It may be on a routine basis (e.g., at the end of a semester or academic year) or as a result of a renovation, relocation, or change in laboratory supervisor/occupant. A regularly scheduled removal of unwanted material as required by § 262.208 does not qualify as a laboratory clean-out.
Laboratory worker
means a person who handles chemicals and/or unwanted material in a laboratory and may include, but is not limited to, faculty, staff, post-doctoral fellows, interns, researchers, technicians, supervisors/managers, and principal investigators. A person does not need to be paid or otherwise compensated for his/her work in the laboratory to be considered a laboratory worker. Undergraduate and graduate students in a supervised classroom setting are not laboratory workers.
Non-profit research institute
means an organization that conducts research as its primary function and files as a non-profit organization under the tax code of 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3).
Reactive acutely hazardous unwanted material
means an unwanted material that is one of the acutely hazardous commercial chemical products listed in § 261.33(e) for reactivity.
Teaching hospital
means a hospital that trains students to become physicians, nurses or other health or laboratory personnel.
Trained professional
means a person who has completed the applicable RCRA training requirements of § 262.17(a)(7) for large quantity generators, or is knowledgeable about normal operations and emergencies in accordance with § 262.16(b)(9)(iii) for small quantity generators and for very small quantity generators that opt into subpart K of this part. A trained professional may be an employee of the eligible academic entity or may be a contractor or vendor who meets the requisite training requirements.
Unwanted material
means any chemical, mixtures of chemicals, products of experiments or other material from a laboratory that is no longer needed, wanted or usable in the laboratory and that is destined for hazardous waste determination by a trained professional. Unwanted materials include reactive acutely hazardous unwanted materials and materials that may eventually be determined not to be solid waste pursuant to § 261.2, or a hazardous waste pursuant to § 261.3. If an eligible academic entity elects to use another equally effective term in lieu of “unwanted material,” as allowed by § 262.206(a)(1)(i), the equally effective term has the same meaning and is subject to the same requirements as “unwanted material” under this subpart.
Working container
means a small container (
i.e.
, two gallons or less) that is in use at a laboratory bench, hood, or other work station, to collect unwanted material from a laboratory experiment or procedure.
[73 FR 72954, Dec. 1, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 79308, Dec. 20, 2010; 81 FR 85819, Nov. 28, 2016; 88 FR 54111, Aug. 9, 2023]

# Subpart M—Preparedness, Prevention, and Emergency Procedures for Large Quantity Generators

# Source:
81 FR 85823, Nov. 28, 2016, unless otherwise noted.
§ 262.250
Applicability.
The regulations of this subpart apply to those areas of a large quantity generator where hazardous waste is generated or accumulated on site.
§ 262.251
Maintenance and operation of facility.
A large quantity generator must maintain and operate its facility to minimize the possibility of a fire, explosion, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents to air, soil, or surface water which could threaten human health or the environment.
§ 262.252
Required equipment.
All areas deemed applicable by § 262.250 must be equipped with the items in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section (unless none of the hazards posed by waste handled at the facility could require a particular kind of equipment specified below or the actual hazardous waste generation or accumulation area does not lend itself for safety reasons to have a particular kind of equipment specified below). A large quantity generator may determine the most appropriate locations within its facility to locate equipment necessary to prepare for and respond to emergencies:
(a) An internal communications or alarm system capable of providing immediate emergency instruction (voice or signal) to facility personnel;
(b) A device, such as a telephone (immediately available at the scene of operations) or a hand-held two-way radio, capable of summoning emergency assistance from local police departments, fire departments, or state or local emergency response teams;
(c) Portable fire extinguishers, fire control equipment (including special extinguishing equipment, such as that using foam, inert gas, or dry chemicals), spill control equipment, and decontamination equipment; and
(d) Water at adequate volume and pressure to supply water hose streams, or foam producing equipment, or automatic sprinklers, or water spray systems.
§ 262.253
Testing and maintenance of equipment.
All communications or alarm systems, fire protection equipment, spill control equipment, and decontamination equipment, where required, must be tested and maintained as necessary
to assure its proper operation in time of emergency.
§ 262.254
Access to communications or alarm system.
(a) Whenever hazardous waste is being poured, mixed, spread, or otherwise handled, all personnel involved in the operation must have immediate access (
e.g.,
direct or unimpeded access) to an internal alarm or emergency communication device, either directly or through visual or voice contact with another employee,
unless
such a device is not required under § 262.252.
(b) In the event there is just one employee on the premises while the facility is operating, the employee must have immediate access (
e.g.,
direct or unimpeded access) to a device, such as a telephone (immediately available at the scene of operation) or a hand-held two-way radio, capable of summoning external emergency assistance,
unless
such a device is not required under § 262.252.
§ 262.255
Required aisle space.
The large quantity generator must maintain aisle space to allow the unobstructed movement of personnel, fire protection equipment, spill control equipment, and decontamination equipment to any area of facility operation in an emergency, unless aisle space is not needed for any of these purposes.
§ 262.256
Arrangements with local authorities.
(a) The large quantity generator must attempt to make arrangements with the local police department, fire department, other emergency response teams, emergency response contractors, equipment suppliers, and local hospitals, taking into account the types and quantities of hazardous wastes handled at the facility. Arrangements may be made with the Local Emergency Planning Committee, if it is determined to be the appropriate organization with which to make arrangements.
(1) A large quantity generator attempting to make arrangements with its local fire department must determine the potential need for the services of the local police department, other emergency response teams, emergency response contractors, equipment suppliers and local hospitals.
(2) As part of this coordination, the large quantity generator shall attempt to make arrangements, as necessary, to familiarize the above organizations with the layout of the facility, the properties of the hazardous waste handled at the facility and associated hazards, places where personnel would normally be working, entrances to roads inside the facility, and possible evacuation routes as well as the types of injuries or illnesses which could result from fires, explosions, or releases at the facility.
(3) Where more than one police or fire department might respond to an emergency, the large quantity generator shall attempt to make arrangements designating primary emergency authority to a specific fire or police department, and arrangements with any others to provide support to the primary emergency authority.
(b) The large quantity generator shall maintain records documenting the arrangements with the local fire department as well as any other organization necessary to respond to an emergency. This documentation must include documentation in the operating record that either confirms such arrangements actively exist or, in cases where no arrangements exist, confirms that attempts to make such arrangements were made.
(c) A facility possessing 24-hour response capabilities may seek a waiver from the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) over the fire code within the facility's state or locality as far as needing to make arrangements with the local fire department as well as any other organization necessary to respond to an emergency, provided that the waiver is documented in the operating record.
§ 262.260
Purpose and implementation of contingency plan.
(a) A large quantity generator must have a contingency plan for the facility. The contingency plan must be designed to minimize hazards to human health or the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous waste
or hazardous waste constituents to air, soil, or surface water.
(b) The provisions of the plan must be carried out immediately whenever there is a fire, explosion, or release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents which could threaten human health or the environment.
§ 262.261
Content of contingency plan.
(a) The contingency plan must describe the actions facility personnel must take to comply with §§ 262.260 and 262.265 in response to fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents to air, soil, or surface water at the facility.
(b) If the generator has already prepared a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan in accordance with part 112 of this chapter, or some other emergency or contingency plan, it need only amend that plan to incorporate hazardous waste management provisions that are sufficient to comply with the standards of this part. The generator may develop one contingency plan that meets all regulatory standards. EPA recommends that the plan be based on the National Response Team's Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance (“One Plan”).
(c) The plan must describe arrangements agreed to with the local police department, fire department, other emergency response teams, emergency response contractors, equipment suppliers, local hospitals or, if applicable, the Local Emergency Planning Committee, pursuant to § 262.256.
(d) The plan must list names and emergency telephone numbers of all persons qualified to act as emergency coordinator (see § 262.264), and this list must be kept up to date. Where more than one person is listed, one must be named as primary emergency coordinator and others must be listed in the order in which they will assume responsibility as alternates. In situations where the generator facility has an emergency coordinator continuously on duty because it operates 24 hours per day, every day of the year, the plan may list the staffed position (
e.g.,
operations manager, shift coordinator, shift operations supervisor) as well as an emergency telephone number that can be guaranteed to be answered at all times.
(e) The plan must include a list of all emergency equipment at the facility (such as fire extinguishing systems, spill control equipment, communications and alarm systems (internal and external), and decontamination equipment), where this equipment is required. This list must be kept up to date. In addition, the plan must include the location and a physical description of each item on the list, and a brief outline of its capabilities.
(f) The plan must include an evacuation plan for generator personnel where there is a possibility that evacuation could be necessary. This plan must describe signal(s) to be used to begin evacuation, evacuation routes, and alternate evacuation routes (in cases where the primary routes could be blocked by releases of hazardous waste or fires).
§ 262.262
Copies of contingency plan.
A copy of the contingency plan and all revisions to the plan must be maintained at the large quantity generator and—
(a) The large quantity generator must submit a copy of the contingency plan and all revisions to all local emergency responders (
i.e.,
police departments, fire departments, hospitals and State and local emergency response teams that may be called upon to provide emergency services). This document may also be submitted to the Local Emergency Planning Committee, as appropriate.
(b) A large quantity generator that first becomes subject to these provisions after May 30, 2017 or a large quantity generator that is otherwise amending its contingency plan must at that time submit a quick reference guide of the contingency plan to the local emergency responders identified at paragraph (a) of this section or, as appropriate, the Local Emergency Planning Committee. The quick reference guide must include the following elements:
(1) The types/names of hazardous wastes in layman's terms and the associated hazard associated with each hazardous waste present at any one time
(
e.g.,
toxic paint wastes, spent ignitable solvent, corrosive acid);
(2) The estimated maximum amount of each hazardous waste that may be present at any one time;
(3) The identification of any hazardous wastes where exposure would require unique or special treatment by medical or hospital staff;
(4) A map of the facility showing where hazardous wastes are generated, accumulated and treated and routes for accessing these wastes;
(5) A street map of the facility in relation to surrounding businesses, schools and residential areas to understand how best to get to the facility and also evacuate citizens and workers;
(6) The locations of water supply (
e.g.,
fire hydrant and its flow rate);
(7) The identification of on-site notification systems (
e.g.,
a fire alarm that rings off site, smoke alarms); and
(8) The name of the emergency coordinator(s) and 7/24-hour emergency telephone number(s) or, in the case of a facility where an emergency coordinator is continuously on duty, the emergency telephone number for the emergency coordinator.
(c) Generators must update, if necessary, their quick reference guides, whenever the contingency plan is amended and submit these documents to the local emergency responders identified at paragraph (a) of this section or, as appropriate, the Local Emergency Planning Committee.
§ 262.263
Amendment of contingency plan.
The contingency plan must be reviewed, and immediately amended, if necessary, whenever:
(a) Applicable regulations are revised;
(b) The plan fails in an emergency;
(c) The generator facility changes—in its design, construction, operation, maintenance, or other circumstances—in a way that materially increases the potential for fires, explosions, or releases of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents, or changes the response necessary in an emergency;
(d) The list of emergency coordinators changes; or
(e) The list of emergency equipment changes.
§ 262.264
Emergency coordinator.
At all times, there must be at least one employee either on the generator's premises or on call (
i.e.,
available to respond to an emergency by reaching the facility within a short period of time) with the responsibility for coordinating all emergency response measures and implementing the necessary emergency procedures outlined in § 262.265. Although responsibilities may vary depending on factors such as type and variety of hazardous waste(s) handled by the facility, as well as type and complexity of the facility, this emergency coordinator must be thoroughly familiar with all aspects of the generator's contingency plan, all operations and activities at the facility, the location and characteristics of hazardous waste handled, the location of all records within the facility, and the facility's layout. In addition, this person must have the authority to commit the resources needed to carry out the contingency plan.
§ 262.265
Emergency procedures.
(a) Whenever there is an imminent or actual emergency situation, the emergency coordinator (or his designee when the emergency coordinator is on call) must immediately:
(1) Activate internal facility alarms or communication systems, where applicable, to notify all facility personnel; and
(2) Notify appropriate state or local agencies with designated response roles if their help is needed.
(b) Whenever there is a release, fire, or explosion, the emergency coordinator must immediately identify the character, exact source, amount, and areal extent of any released materials. The emergency coordinator may do this by observation or review of the facility records or manifests and, if necessary, by chemical analysis.
(c) Concurrently, the emergency coordinator must assess possible hazards to human health or the environment that may result from the release, fire, or explosion. This assessment must consider both direct and indirect effects of the release, fire, or explosion (
e.g.,
the effects of any toxic, irritating, or asphyxiating gases that are
generated, or the effects of any hazardous surface water run-offs from water or chemical agents used to control fire and heat-induced explosions).
(d) If the emergency coordinator determines that the facility has had a release, fire, or explosion which could threaten human health, or the environment, outside the facility, the emergency coordinator must report the findings as follows:
(1) If the assessment indicates that evacuation of local areas may be advisable, the emergency coordinator must immediately notify appropriate local authorities. The emergency coordinator must be available to help appropriate officials decide whether local areas should be evacuated; and
(2) The emergency coordinator must immediately notify either the government official designated as the on-scene coordinator for that geographical area, or the National Response Center (using their 24-hour toll free number 800/424-8802). The report must include:
(i) Name and telephone number of reporter;
(ii) Name and address of the generator;
(iii) Time and type of incident (
e.g.,
release, fire);
(iv) Name and quantity of material(s) involved, to the extent known;
(v) The extent of injuries, if any; and
(vi) The possible hazards to human health, or the environment, outside the facility.
(e) During an emergency, the emergency coordinator must take all reasonable measures necessary to ensure that fires, explosions, and releases do not occur, recur, or spread to other hazardous waste at the generator's facility. These measures must include, where applicable, stopping processes and operations, collecting and containing released hazardous waste, and removing or isolating containers.
(f) If the generator stops operations in response to a fire, explosion or release, the emergency coordinator must monitor for leaks, pressure buildup, gas generation, or ruptures in valves, pipes, or other equipment, wherever this is appropriate.
(g) Immediately after an emergency, the emergency coordinator must provide for treating, storing, or disposing of recovered waste, contaminated soil or surface water, or any other material that results from a release, fire, or explosion at the facility. Unless the generator can demonstrate, in accordance with § 261.3(c) or (d) of this chapter, that the recovered material is not a hazardous waste, then it is a newly generated hazardous waste that must be managed in accordance with all the applicable requirements and conditions for exemption in parts 262, 263, and 265 of this chapter.
(h) The emergency coordinator must ensure that, in the affected area(s) of the facility:
(1) No hazardous waste that may be incompatible with the released material is treated, stored, or disposed of until cleanup procedures are completed; and
(2) All emergency equipment listed in the contingency plan is cleaned and fit for its intended use before operations are resumed.
(i) The generator must note in the operating record the time, date, and details of any incident that requires implementing the contingency plan. Within 15 days after the incident, the generator must submit a written report on the incident to the Regional Administrator. The report must include:
(1) Name, address, and telephone number of the generator;
(2) Date, time, and type of incident (
e.g.,
fire, explosion);
(3) Name and quantity of material(s) involved;
(4) The extent of injuries, if any;
(5) An assessment of actual or potential hazards to human health or the environment, where this is applicable; and
(6) Estimated quantity and disposition of recovered material that resulted from the incident.

# Subpart A—General
§ 263.10
Scope.
(a) These regulations establish standards which apply to persons transporting hazardous waste within the United States if the transportation requires a manifest under 40 CFR part 262.

# Note:
The regulations set forth in parts 262 and 263 establish the responsibilities of generators and transporters of hazardous waste in the handling, transportation, and management of that waste. In these regulations, EPA has expressly adopted certain regulations of the Department of Transportation (DOT) governing the transportation of hazardous materials. These regulations concern, among other things, labeling, marking, placarding, using proper containers, and reporting discharges. EPA has expressly adopted these regulations in order to satisfy its statutory obligation to promulgate regulations which are necessary to protect human health and the environment in the transportation of hazardous waste. EPA's adoption of these DOT regulations ensures consistency with the requirements of DOT and thus avoids the establishment of duplicative or conflicting requirements with respect to these matters. These EPA regulations which apply to both interstate and intrastate transportation of hazardous waste are enforceable by EPA.
DOT has revised its hazardous materials transportation regulations in order to encompass the transportation of hazardous waste and to regulate intrastate, as well as interstate, transportation of hazardous waste. Transporters of hazardous waste are cautioned that DOT's regulations are fully applicable to their activities and enforceable by DOT. These DOT regulations are codified in title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, subchapter C.
(b) These regulations do not apply to on-site transportation of hazardous waste by generators or by owners or operators of permitted hazardous waste management facilities.
(c) A transporter of hazardous waste must also comply with 40 CFR part 262, Standards Applicable to Generators of Hazardous Waste, if he:
(1) Transports hazardous waste into the United States from abroad; or
(2) Mixes hazardous wastes of different DOT shipping descriptions by placing them into a single container.
(d) A transporter of hazardous waste that is being imported from or exported to any other country for purposes of recovery or disposal is subject to this Subpart and to all other relevant requirements of subpart H of 40 CFR part 262, including, but not limited to, 40 CFR 262.83(d) and 262.84(d) for movement documents.
(e) The regulations in this part do not apply to transportation during an explosives or munitions emergency response, conducted in accordance with 40 CFR 264.1(g)(8)(i)(D) or (iv) or 265.1(c)(11)(i)(D) or (iv), and 270.1(c)(3)(i)(D) or (iii).
(f) Section 266.203 of this chapter identifies how the requirements of this part apply to military munitions classified as solid waste under 40 CFR 266.202.
[45 FR 33151, May 19, 1980, as amended at 45 FR 86968, Dec. 31, 1980; 61 FR 16314, Apr. 12, 1996; 62 FR 6651, Feb. 12, 1997; 75 FR 1259, Jan. 8, 2010; 81 FR 85724, Nov. 28, 2016]
§ 263.11
EPA identification number.
(a) A transporter must not transport hazardous wastes without having received an EPA identification number from the Administrator.
(b) A transporter who has not received an EPA identification number may obtain one by applying to the Administrator using EPA Form 8700-12. Upon receiving the request, the Administrator will assign an EPA identification number to the transporter.
§ 263.12
Transfer facility requirements.
(a) A transporter who stores manifested shipments of hazardous waste in containers meeting the independent requirements of § 262.30 of this chapter at a transfer facility for a period of ten
(10) days or less is not subject to regulation under parts 264, 265, 267, 268, and 270 of this chapter with respect to the storage of those wastes.
(b) When consolidating the contents of two or more containers with the same hazardous waste into a new container, or when combining and consolidating two different hazardous wastes that are compatible with each other, the transporter must mark its containers of 119 gallons or less with the following information:
(1) The words “Hazardous Waste” and
(2) The applicable EPA hazardous waste number(s) (EPA hazardous waste codes) in subparts C and D of part 261 of this chapter, or in compliance with § 262.32(c).
[81 FR 85825, Nov. 28, 2016]

# Subpart B—Compliance With the Manifest System and Recordkeeping
§ 263.20
The manifest system.
(a)(1)
Manifest requirement.
A transporter may not accept hazardous waste from a generator unless the transporter is also provided with a manifest form (EPA Form 8700-22, and if necessary, EPA Form 8700-22A) signed in accordance with the requirement of § 262.23, or is provided with an electronic manifest that is obtained, completed, and transmitted in accordance with § 262.20(a)(3) of this chapter, and signed with a valid and enforceable electronic signature as described in 40 CFR 262.25.
(2)
Exports.
For exports of hazardous waste subject to the requirements of 40 CFR part 262, subpart H a transporter may not accept hazardous waste without a manifest signed by the generator in accordance with this section, as appropriate, and a movement document that includes all information required by § 262.83 of this chapter.
(3)
Compliance date for form revisions.
The revised Manifest form and procedures in 40 CFR 260.10, 261.7, 263.20, and 263.21, had an effective date of September 5, 2006. The Manifest form and procedures in 40 CFR 260.10, 261.7, 263.20, and 263.21, contained in the 40 CFR, parts 260 to 265, edition revised as of July 1, 2004, were applicable until September 5, 2006.
(4)
Use of electronic manifest—legal equivalence to paper forms for participating transporters.
Electronic manifests that are obtained, completed, and transmitted in accordance with § 262.20(a)(3) of this chapter, and used in accordance with this section in lieu of EPA Forms 8700-22 and 8700-22A, are the legal equivalent of paper manifest forms bearing handwritten signatures, and satisfy for all purposes any requirement in these regulations to obtain, complete, sign, carry, provide, give, use, or retain a manifest.
(i) Any requirement in these regulations to sign a manifest or manifest certification by hand, or to obtain a handwritten signature, is satisfied by signing with or obtaining a valid and enforceable electronic signature within the meaning of 40 CFR 262.25.
(ii) Any requirement in these regulations to give, provide, send, forward, or return to another person a copy of the manifest is satisfied when a copy of an electronic manifest is transmitted to the other person by submission to the system.
(iii) Any requirement in these regulations for a manifest to accompany a hazardous waste shipment is satisfied when a copy of an electronic manifest is accessible during transportation and forwarded to the person or persons who are scheduled to receive delivery of the waste shipment, except that to the extent that the Hazardous Materials regulation on shipping papers for carriage by public highway requires transporters of hazardous materials to carry a paper document to comply with 49 CFR 177.817, a hazardous waste transporter must carry one printed copy of the electronic manifest on the transport vehicle.
(iv) Any requirement in these regulations for a transporter to keep or retain a copy of a manifest is satisfied by the retention of an electronic manifest in the transporter's account on the e-Manifest system, provided that such copies are readily available for viewing and production if requested by any EPA or authorized state inspector.
(v) No transporter may be held liable for the inability to produce an electronic manifest for inspection under
this section if that transporter can demonstrate that the inability to produce the electronic manifest is exclusively due to a technical difficulty with the EPA system for which the transporter bears no responsibility.
(5) A transporter may participate in the electronic manifest system either by accessing the electronic manifest system from the transporter's own electronic equipment, or by accessing the electronic manifest system from the equipment provided by a participating generator, by another transporter, or by a designated facility.
(6)
Special procedures when electronic manifest is not available.
If after a manifest has been originated electronically and signed electronically by the initial transporter, and the electronic manifest system should become unavailable for any reason, then:
(i) The transporter in possession of the hazardous waste when the electronic manifest becomes unavailable shall reproduce sufficient copies of the printed manifest that is carried on the transport vehicle pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, or obtain and complete another paper manifest for this purpose. The transporter shall reproduce sufficient copies to provide the transporter and all subsequent waste handlers with a copy for their files, plus two additional copies that will be delivered to the designated facility with the hazardous waste.

§ 263.21
Compliance with the manifest.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the transporter must deliver the entire quantity of hazardous waste which he or she has accepted from a generator or a transporter to:
(1) The designated facility listed on the manifest; or
(2) The alternate designated facility, if the hazardous waste cannot be delivered to the designated facility because an emergency prevents delivery; or
(3) The next designated transporter; or
(4) The place outside the United States designated by the generator.
(b)(1)
Emergency condition.
If the hazardous waste cannot be delivered in accordance with paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (4) of this section because of an emergency condition other than rejection of the waste by the designated facility or alternate designated facility, then the transporter must contact the generator for further instructions and must revise the manifest according to the generator's instructions.
(2)
Transporters without agency authority.
If the hazardous waste is not delivered to the next designated transporter in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and the current transporter is without contractual authorization from the generator to act as the generator's agent with respect
to transporter additions or substitutions, then the current transporter must contact the generator for further instructions prior to making any revisions to the transporter designations on the manifest. The current transporter may thereafter make such revisions if:
(i) The hazardous waste is not delivered in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section because of an emergency condition; or
(ii) The current transporter proposes to change the transporter(s) designated on the manifest by the generator, or to add a new transporter during transportation, to respond to an emergency, or for purposes of transportation efficiency, convenience, or safety; and
(iii) The generator authorizes the revision.
(3)
Transporters with agency authority.
If the hazardous waste is not delivered to the next designated transporter in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and the current transporter has authorization from the generator to act as the generator's agent, then the current transporter may change the transporter(s) designated on the manifest, or add a new transporter, during transportation without the generator's prior, explicit approval, provided that:
(i) The current transporter is authorized by a contractual provision that provides explicit agency authority for the transporter to make such transporter changes on behalf of the generator;
(ii) The transporter enters in Item 14 of each manifest for which such a change is made, the following statement of its agency authority: “Contract retained by generator confers agency authority on initial transporter to add or substitute additional transporters on generator's behalf;” and
(iii) The change in designated transporters is necessary to respond to an emergency, or for purposes of transportation efficiency, convenience, or safety.
(4)
Generator liability.
The grant by a generator of authority to a transporter to act as the agent of the generator with respect to changes to transporter designations under paragraph (b)(3) of this section does not affect the generator's liability or responsibility for complying with any applicable requirement under this chapter, or grant any additional authority to the transporter to act on behalf of the generator.
(c) If hazardous waste is rejected by the designated facility while the transporter is on the facility's premises, then the transporter must obtain the following:
(1) For a partial load rejection or for regulated quantities of container residues, a copy of the original manifest that includes the facility's date and signature, and the Manifest Tracking Number of the new manifest that will accompany the shipment, and a description of the partial rejection or container residue in the discrepancy block of the original manifest. The transporter must retain a copy of this manifest in accordance with § 263.22, and give the remaining copies of the original manifest to the rejecting designated facility. If the transporter is forwarding the rejected part of the shipment or a regulated container residue to an alternate facility or returning it to the generator, the transporter must obtain a new manifest to accompany the shipment, and the new manifest must include all of the information required in 40 CFR 264.72(e)(1) through (6) or (f)(1) through (6) or 40 CFR 265.72(e)(1) through (6) or (f)(1) through (6).
(2) For a full load rejection that will be taken back by the transporter, a copy of the original manifest that includes the rejecting facility's signature and date attesting to the rejection, the description of the rejection in the discrepancy block of the manifest, and the name, address, phone number, and Identification Number for the alternate facility or generator to whom the shipment must be delivered. The transporter must retain a copy of the manifest in accordance with § 263.22, and give a copy of the manifest containing this information to the rejecting designated facility. If the original manifest is not used, then the transporter must obtain a new manifest for the shipment and comply with 40 CFR 264.72(e)(1) through (6) or 40 CFR 265.72(e)(1) through (6).
[83 FR 452, Jan. 3, 2018]
§ 263.22
Recordkeeping.
(a) A transporter of hazardous waste must keep a copy of the manifest signed by the generator, himself, and the next designated transporter or the owner or operator of the designated facility for a period of three years from the date the hazardous waste was accepted by the initial transporter.
(b) For shipments delivered to the designated facility by water (bulk shipment), each water (bulk shipment) transporter must retain a copy of the shipping paper containing all the information required in § 263.20(e)(2) for a period of three years from the date the hazardous waste was accepted by the initial transporter.
(c) For shipments of hazardous waste by rail within the United States:
(1) The initial rail transporter must keep a copy of the manifest and shipping paper with all the information required in § 263.20(f)(2) for a period of three years from the date the hazardous waste was accepted by the initial transporter; and
(2) The final rail transporter must keep a copy of the signed manifest (or the shipping paper if signed by the designated facility in lieu of the manifest) for a period of three years from the date the hazardous waste was accepted by the initial transporter.

# Note:
Intermediate rail transporters are not required to keep records pursuant to these regulations.
(d) A transporter who transports hazardous waste out of the United States must keep a copy of the manifest indicating that the hazardous waste left the United States for a period of three years from the date the hazardous waste was accepted by the initial transporter.
(e) The periods of retention referred to in this Section are extended automatically during the course of any unresolved enforcement action regarding the regulated activity or as requested by the Administrator.

# Subpart C—Hazardous Waste Discharges
§ 263.30
Immediate action.
(a) In the event of a discharge of hazardous waste during transportation, the transporter must take appropriate immediate action to protect human health and the environment (e.g., notify local authorities, dike the discharge area).
(b) If a discharge of hazardous waste occurs during transportation and an official (State or local government or a Federal Agency) acting within the scope of his official responsibilities determines that immediate removal of the waste is necessary to protect human health or the environment, that official may authorize the removal of the waste by transporters who do not have EPA identification numbers and without the preparation of a manifest.
(c) An air, rail, highway, or water transporter who has discharged hazardous waste must:
(1) Give notice, if required by 49 CFR 171.15, to the National Response Center (800-424-8802 or 202-426-2675); and
(2) Report in writing as required by 49 CFR 171.16 to the Director, Office of Hazardous Materials Regulations, Materials Transportation Bureau, Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590.
(d) A water (bulk shipment) transporter who has discharged hazardous waste must give the same notice as required by 33 CFR 153.203 for oil and hazardous substances.
§ 263.31
Discharge clean up.
A transporter must clean up any hazardous waste discharge that occurs during transportation or take such action as may be required or approved by Federal, State, or local officials so that the hazardous waste discharge no longer presents a hazard to human health or the environment.

(j) The requirements of subparts B, C, and D of this part and § 264.101 do not apply to remediation waste management sites. (However, some remediation waste management sites may be a part of a facility that is subject to a traditional RCRA permit because the facility is also treating, storing or disposing of hazardous wastes that are not remediation wastes. In these cases, Subparts B, C, and D of this part, and § 264.101 do apply to the facility subject to the traditional RCRA permit.) Instead of the requirements of subparts B, C, and D of this part, owners or operators of remediation waste management sites must:
(1) Obtain an EPA identification number by applying to the Administrator using EPA Form 8700-12;
(2) Obtain a detailed chemical and physical analysis of a representative sample of the hazardous remediation wastes to be managed at the site. At a minimum, the analysis must contain all of the information which must be known to treat, store or dispose of the waste according to this part and part 268 of this chapter, and must be kept accurate and up to date;
(3) Prevent people who are unaware of the danger from entering, and minimize the possibility for unauthorized people or livestock to enter onto the active portion of the remediation waste management site, unless the owner or operator can demonstrate to the Director that:
(i) Physical contact with the waste, structures, or equipment within the active portion of the remediation waste management site will not injure people or livestock who may enter the active portion of the remediation waste management site; and
(ii) Disturbance of the waste or equipment by people or livestock who enter onto the active portion of the remediation waste management site, will not cause a violation of the requirements of this part;
(4) Inspect the remediation waste management site for malfunctions, deterioration, operator errors, and discharges that may be causing, or may lead to, a release of hazardous waste constituents to the environment, or a threat to human health. The owner or operator must conduct these inspections often enough to identify problems in time to correct them before they harm human health or the environment, and must remedy the problem before it leads to a human health or environmental hazard. Where a hazard is imminent or has already occurred, the owner/operator must take remedial action immediately;
(5) Provide personnel with classroom or on-the-job training on how to perform their duties in a way that ensures the remediation waste management site complies with the requirements of this part, and on how to respond effectively to emergencies;
(6) Take precautions to prevent accidental ignition or reaction of ignitable or reactive waste, and prevent threats to human health and the environment from ignitable, reactive and incompatible waste;
(7) For remediation waste management sites subject to regulation under subparts I through O and subpart X of this part, the owner/operator must design, construct, operate, and maintain a unit within a 100-year floodplain to prevent washout of any hazardous waste by a 100-year flood, unless the owner/operator can meet the demonstration of § 264.18(b);
(8) Not place any non-containerized or bulk liquid hazardous waste in any salt dome formation, salt bed formation, underground mine or cave;
(9) Develop and maintain a construction quality assurance program for all

(10) Develop and maintain procedures to prevent accidents and a contingency and emergency plan to control accidents that occur. These procedures must address proper design, construction, maintenance, and operation of remediation waste management units at the site. The goal of the plan must be to minimize the possibility of, and the hazards from a fire, explosion, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents to air, soil, or surface water that could threaten human health or the environment. The plan must explain specifically how to treat, store and dispose of the hazardous remediation waste in question, and must be implemented immediately whenever a fire, explosion, or release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents which could threaten human health or the environment;
(11) Designate at least one employee, either on the facility premises or on call (that is, available to respond to an emergency by reaching the facility quickly), to coordinate all emergency response measures. This emergency coordinator must be thoroughly familiar with all aspects of the facility's contingency plan, all operations and activities at the facility, the location and characteristics of waste handled, the location of all records within the facility, and the facility layout. In addition, this person must have the authority to commit the resources needed to carry out the contingency plan;
(12) Develop, maintain and implement a plan to meet the requirements in paragraphs (j)(2) through (j)(6) and (j)(9) through (j)(10) of this section; and
(13) Maintain records documenting compliance with paragraphs (j)(1) through (j)(12) of this section.

§ 264.3
Relationship to interim status standards.
A facility owner or operator who has fully complied with the requirements for interim status—as defined in section 3005(e) of RCRA and regulations under § 270.70 of this chapter—must comply with the regulations specified in part 265 of this chapter in lieu of the regulations in this part, until final administrative disposition of his permit application is made, except as provided under 40 CFR part 264 subpart S.
[
Comment:
As stated in section 3005(a) of RCRA, after the effective date of regulations under that section, i.e., parts 270 and 124 of this chapter, the treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste is prohibited except in accordance with a permit. Section 3005(e) of RCRA provides for the continued operation of an existing facility which meets certain conditions until final administrative disposition of the owner's or operator's permit application is made.]

§ 264.12
Required notices.
(a) The owner or operator of a facility that is arranging or has arranged to receive hazardous waste subject to 40 CFR part 262, subpart H from a foreign source must submit the following required notices:
(1) As per 40 CFR 262.84(b), for imports where the competent authority of the country of export does not require the foreign exporter to submit to it a notification proposing export and obtain consent from EPA and the competent authorities for the countries of transit, such owner or operator of the facility, if acting as the importer, must provide notification of the proposed transboundary movement in English to EPA using the allowable methods listed in 40 CFR 262.84(b)(1) at least 60 days before the first shipment is expected to depart the country of export. The notification may cover up to one year of shipments of wastes having similar physical and chemical characteristics, the same United Nations classification, the same RCRA waste codes and OECD waste codes, and being sent from the same foreign exporter.
(2) As per 40 CFR 262.84(d)(2)(xv), a copy of the movement document bearing all required signatures within three (3) working days of receipt of the shipment to the foreign exporter and to the competent authorities of the countries of export and transit that control the shipment as an export and transit shipment of hazardous waste respectively. For shipments received on or after the electronic import-export reporting compliance date, the receiving facility must close out the movement document to confirm receipt within three working days of shipment delivery using the EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system. For shipments sent from a country with which the EPA has established an electronic exchange of movement document tracking data, the receiving facility may use WIETS or its successor system to send movement document confirmation data back through the electronic exchange to the foreign exporter and the country of export. The original of the signed movement document must be maintained at the facility for at least three (3) years. The owner or operator of a facility may satisfy this recordkeeping requirement by retaining electronically submitted documents in the facility's account on WIETS, or its successor system, provided that copies are readily available for viewing and production if requested by any the EPA or authorized State inspector. No owner or operator of a facility may be held liable for the inability to produce the documents for inspection under this section if the owner or operator of a facility can demonstrate that the inability to produce the document is due exclusively to technical difficulty with WIETS, or its successor system for which the owner or operator of a facility bears no responsibility.
(3) As per 40 CFR 262.84(f)(4), if the facility has physical control of the waste and it must be sent to an alternate facility or returned to the country of export, such owner or operator of the facility must inform EPA, using the allowable methods listed in 40 CFR 262.84(b)(1) of the need to return or arrange alternate management of the shipment.
(4) As per 40 CFR 262.84(g), such owner or operator shall:
(i) Send copies of the signed and dated confirmation of recovery or disposal, as soon as possible, but no later than thirty days after completing recovery or disposal on the waste in the shipment and no later than one calendar year following receipt of the waste, to the foreign exporter, to the competent authority of the country of export that controls the shipment as an export of hazardous waste, and for shipments recycled or disposed of on or after the electronic import-export reporting compliance date, to the EPA electronically using WIETS, or its successor system. For shipments sent from a country with which the EPA has established an electronic exchange of movement document tracking data, the receiving facility may use WIETS or its successor system to send confirmation of recovery or disposal data back through the electronic exchange
to the foreign exporter and the country of export.
(ii) If the facility performed any of recovery operations R12, R13, or RC3, or disposal operations D13 through D15, promptly send copies of the confirmation of recovery or disposal that it receives from the final recovery or disposal facility within one year of shipment delivery to the final recovery or disposal facility that performed one of recovery operations R1 through R11, or RC1, or one of disposal operations D1 through D12, or DC1 to DC2, to the competent authority of the country of export that controls the shipment as an export of hazardous waste, and on or after the electronic import-export reporting compliance date, to the EPA electronically using WIETS, or its successor system. The recovery and disposal operations in this paragraph (a)(4)(ii) are defined in § 262.81 of this chapter. For shipments sent from a country with which the EPA has established an electronic exchange of movement document tracking data, the receiving facility may use WIETS or its successor system to send confirmation of recovery or disposal data back through the electronic exchange to the country of export.
(b) The owner or operator of a facility that receives hazardous waste from an off-site source (except where the owner or operator is also the generator) must inform the generator in writing that he has the appropriate permit(s) for, and will accept, the waste the generator is shipping. The owner or operator must keep a copy of this written notice as part of the operating record.
(c) Before transferring ownership or operation of a facility during its operating life, or of a disposal facility during the post-closure care period, the owner or operator must notify the new owner or operator in writing of the requirements of this part and part 270 of this chapter.
[
Comment:
An owner's or operator's failure to notify the new owner or operator of the requirements of this part in no way relieves the new owner or operator of his obligation to comply with all applicable requirements.]

§ 264.13
General waste analysis.
(a)(1) Before an owner or operator treats, stores, or disposes of any hazardous wastes, or nonhazardous wastes if applicable under § 264.113(d), he must obtain a detailed chemical and physical analysis of a representative sample of the wastes. At a minimum, the analysis must contain all the information which must be known to treat, store, or dispose of the waste in accordance with this part and part 268 of this chapter.
(2) The analysis may include data developed under part 261 of this chapter, and existing published or documented data on the hazardous waste or on hazardous waste generated from similar processes.
[
1:
For example, the facility's records of analyses performed on the waste before the effective date of these regulations, or studies conducted on hazardous waste generated from processes similar to that which generated the waste to be managed at the facility, may be included in the data base required to comply with paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The owner or operator of an off-site facility may arrange for the generator of the hazardous waste to supply part of the information required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except as otherwise specified in 40 CFR 268.7 (b) and (c). If the generator does not supply the information, and the owner or operator chooses to accept a hazardous waste, the owner or operator is responsible for obtaining the information required to comply with this section.]
(3) The analysis must be repeated as necessary to ensure that it is accurate and up to date. At a minimum, the analysis must be repeated:
(i) When the owner or operator is notified, or has reason to believe, that the process or operation generating the hazardous wastes, or non-hazardous wastes if applicable under § 264.113(d), has changed; and
(ii) For off-site facilities, when the results of the inspection required in paragraph (a)(4) of this section indicate that the hazardous waste received at the facility does not match the waste
designated on the accompanying manifest or shipping paper.
(4) The owner or operator of an off-site facility must inspect and, if necessary, analyze each hazardous waste movement received at the facility to determine whether it matches the identity of the waste specified on the accompanying manifest or shipping paper.
(b) The owner or operator must develop and follow a written waste analysis plan which describes the procedures which he will carry out to comply with paragraph (a) of this section. He must keep this plan at the facility. At a minimum, the plan must specify:
(1) The parameters for which each hazardous waste, or non-hazardous waste if applicable under § 264.113(d), will be analyzed and the rationale for the selection of these parameters (i.e., how analysis for these parameters will provide sufficient information on the waste's properties to comply with paragraph (a) of this section);
(2) The test methods which will be used to test for these parameters;
(3) The sampling method which will be used to obtain a representative sample of the waste to be analyzed. A representative sample may be obtained using either:
(i) One of the sampling methods described in appendix I of part 261 of this chapter; or
(ii) An equivalent sampling method.
[
Comment:
See § 260.21 of this chapter for related discussion.]
(4) The frequency with which the initial analysis of the waste will be reviewed or repeated to ensure that the analysis is accurate and up to date; and
(5) For off-site facilities, the waste analyses that hazardous waste generators have agreed to supply.
(6) Where applicable, the methods that will be used to meet the additional waste analysis requirements for specific waste management methods as specified in §§ 264.17, 264.314, 264.341, 264.1034(d), 264.1063(d), 264.1083, and 268.7 of this chapter.
(7) For surface impoundments exempted from land disposal restrictions under § 268.4(a), the procedures and schedules for:
(i) The sampling of impoundment contents;
(ii) The analysis of test data; and,
(iii) The annual removal of residues which are not delisted under § 260.22 of this chapter or which exhibit a characteristic of hazardous waste and either:
(A) Do not meet applicable treatment standards of part 268, subpart D; or
(B) Where no treatment standards have been established:
(
1
) Such residues are prohibited from land disposal under § 268.32 or RCRA section 3004(d); or
(
2
) Such residues are prohibited from land disposal under § 268.33(f).
(8) For owners and operators seeking an exemption to the air emission standards of subpart CC in accordance with § 264.1082—
(i) If direct measurement is used for the waste determination, the procedures and schedules for waste sampling and analysis, and the results of the analysis of test data to verify the exemption.
(ii) If knowledge of the waste is used for the waste determination, any information prepared by the facility owner or operator or by the generator of the hazardous waste, if the waste is received from off-site, that is used as the basis for knowledge of the waste.
(c) For off-site facilities, the waste analysis plan required in paragraph (b) of this section must also specify the procedures which will be used to in-spect and, if necessary, analyze each movement of hazardous waste received at the facility to ensure that it matches the identity of the waste designated on the accompanying manifest or shipping paper. At a minimum, the plan must describe:
(1) The procedures which will be used to determine the identity of each movement of waste managed at the facility; and
(2) The sampling method which will be used to obtain a representative sample of the waste to be identified, if the identification method includes sampling.
(3) The procedures that the owner or operator of an off-site landfill receiving containerized hazardous waste will use to determine whether a hazardous waste generator or treater has added a biodegradable sorbent to the waste in the container.

Comment:
Part 270 of this chapter requires that an owner or operator who wishes to make the demonstration referred to above must do so with part B of the permit application.]
(b) Unless the owner or operator has made a successful demonstration under paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section, a facility must have:
(1) A 24-hour surveillance system (e.g., television monitoring or surveillance by guards or facility personnel) which continuously monitors and controls entry onto the active portion of the facility; or
(2)(i) An artificial or natural barrier (e.g., a fence in good repair or a fence combined with a cliff), which completely surrounds the active portion of the facility; and
(ii) A means to control entry, at all times, through the gates or other entrances to the active portion of the facility (e.g., an attendant, television monitors, locked entrance, or controlled roadway access to the facility).
[
Comment:
The requirements of paragraph (b) of this section are satisfied if the facility or plant within which the active portion is located itself has a surveillance system, or a barrier and a means to control entry, which complies with the requirements of paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section.]
(c) Unless the owner or operator has made a successful demonstration under paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section, a sign with the legend, “Danger—Unauthorized Personnel Keep Out”, must be posted at each entrance to the active portion of a facility, and at other locations, in sufficient numbers to be seen from any approach to this active portion. The legend must be written in English and in any other language predominant in the area surrounding the facility (e.g., facilities in counties bordering the Canadian province of Quebec must post signs in French; facilities in counties bordering Mexico must post signs in Spanish), and must be legible from a distance of at least 25 feet. Existing signs with a legend other than “Danger—Unauthorized Personnel Keep Out” may be used if the legend on the sign indicates that only authorized personnel are allowed to enter the active portion, and that entry onto the active portion can be dangerous.

§ 264.15
General inspection requirements.
(a) The owner or operator must inspect his facility for malfunctions and deterioration, operator errors, and discharges which may be causing—or may lead to—(1) release of hazardous waste constituents to the environment or (2) a threat to human health. The owner or operator must conduct these inspections often enough to identify problems in time to correct them before they harm human health or the environment.
(b)(1) The owner or operator must develop and follow a written schedule for inspecting monitoring equipment, safety and emergency equipment, security devices, and operating and structural
equipment (such as dikes and sump pumps) that are important to preventing, detecting, or responding to environmental or human health hazards.
(2) He must keep this schedule at the facility.
(3) The schedule must identify the types of problems (e.g., malfunctions or deterioration) which are to be looked for during the inspection (e.g., inoperative sump pump, leaking fitting, eroding dike, etc.).
(4) The frequency of inspection may vary for the items on the schedule. However, the frequency should be based on the rate of deterioration of the equipment and the probability of an environmental or human health incident if the deterioration, malfunction, or operator error goes undetected between inspections. Areas subject to spills, such as loading and unloading areas, must be inspected daily when in use. At a minimum, the inspection schedule must include the items and frequencies called for in §§ 264.174, 264.193, 264.195, 264.226, 264.254, 264.278, 264.303, 264.347, 264.602, 264.1033, 264.1052, 264.1053, 264.1058, and 264.1083 through 264.1089, where applicable. Part 270 of this chapter requires the inspection schedule to be submitted with part B of the permit application. EPA will evaluate the schedule along with the rest of the application to ensure that it adequately protects human health and the environment. As part of this review, EPA may modify or amend the schedule as may be necessary.
(c) The owner or operator must remedy any deterioration or malfunction of equipment or structures which the inspection reveals on a schedule which ensures that the problem does not lead to an environmental or human health hazard. Where a hazard is imminent or has already occurred, remedial action must be taken immediately.
(d) The owner or operator must record inspections in an inspection log or summary. He must keep these records for at least three years from the date of inspection. At a minimum, these records must include the date and time of the inspection, the name of the inspector, a notation of the observations made, and the date and nature of any repairs or other remedial actions.

§ 264.17
General requirements for ignitable, reactive, or incompatible wastes.
(a) The owner or operator must take precautions to prevent accidental ignition or reaction of ignitable or reactive waste. This waste must be separated and protected from sources of ignition or reaction including but not limited to: open flames, smoking, cutting and welding, hot surfaces, frictional heat, sparks (static, electrical, or mechanical), spontaneous ignition (e.g., from heat-producing chemical reactions), and radiant heat. While ignitable or reactive waste is being handled, the owner or operator must confine smoking and open flame to specially designated locations. “No Smoking” signs must be conspicuously placed wherever there is a hazard from ignitable or reactive waste.
(b) Where specifically required by other sections of this part, the owner or operator of a facility that treats, stores or disposes ignitable or reactive waste, or mixes incompatible waste or incompatible wastes and other materials, must take precautions to prevent reactions which:
(1) Generate extreme heat or pressure, fire or explosions, or violent reactions;
(2) Produce uncontrolled toxic mists, fumes, dusts, or gases in sufficient quantities to threaten human health or the environment;
(3) Produce uncontrolled flammable fumes or gases in sufficient quantities to pose a risk of fire or explosions;
(4) Damage the structural integrity of the device or facility;
(5) Through other like means threaten human health or the environment.
(c) When required to comply with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the owner or operator must document that compliance. This documentation may be based on references to published scientific or engineering literature, data from trial tests (e.g., bench scale or pilot scale tests), waste analyses (as
specified in § 264.13), or the results of the treatment of similar wastes by similar treatment processes and under similar operating conditions.
[46 FR 2848, Jan. 12, 1981, as amended at 50 FR 4514, Jan. 31, 1985; 71 FR 40272, July 14, 2006]
§ 264.18
Location standards.
(a)
Seismic considerations.
(1) Portions of new facilities where treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste will be conducted must not be located within 61 meters (200 feet) of a fault which has had displacement in Holocene time.
(2) As used in paragraph (a)(1) of this section:
(i) “Fault” means a fracture along which rocks on one side have been displaced with respect to those on the other side.
(ii) “Displacement” means the relative movement of any two sides of a fault measured in any direction.
(iii) “Holocene” means the most recent epoch of the Quaternary period, extending from the end of the Pleistocene to the present.
[
Comment:
Procedures for demonstrating compliance with this standard in part B of the permit application are specified in § 270.14(b)(11). Facilities which are located in political jurisdictions other than those listed in appendix VI of this part, are assumed to be in compliance with this requirement.]
(b)
Floodplains.
(1) A facility located in a 100-year floodplain must be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained to prevent washout or any hazardous waste by a 100-year flood,
unless
the owner or operator can demonstrate to the Regional Administrator's satisfaction that:
(i) Procedures are in effect which will cause the waste to be removed safely, before flood waters can reach the facility, to a location where the wastes will not be vulnerable to flood waters; or
(ii) For existing surface impoundments, waste piles, land treatment units, landfills, and miscellaneous units, no adverse effects on human health or the environment will result if washout occurs, considering:
(A) The volume and physical and chemical characteristics of the waste in the facility;
(B) The concentration of hazardous constituents that would potentially affect surface waters as a result of washout;
(C) The impact of such concentrations on the current or potential uses of and water quality standards established for the affected surface waters; and
(D) The impact of hazardous constituents on the sediments of affected surface waters or the soils of the 100- year floodplain that could result from washout.
[
Comment:
The location where wastes are moved must be a facility which is either permitted by EPA under part 270 of this chapter, authorized to manage hazardous waste by a State with a hazardous waste management program authorized under part 271 of this chapter, or in interim status under parts 270 and 265 of this chapter.]
(2) As used in paragraph (b)(1) of this section:
(i) “100-year floodplain” means any land area which is subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year from any source.
(ii) “Washout” means the movement of hazardous waste from the active portion of the facility as a result of flooding.
(iii) “100-year flood” means a flood that has a one percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year.
[
Comment:
(1) Requirements pertaining to other Federal laws which affect the location and permitting of facilities are found in § 270.3 of this chapter. For details relative to these laws, see EPA's manual for SEA (special environmental area) requirements for hazardous waste facility permits. Though EPA is responsible for complying with these requirements, applicants are advised to consider them in planning the location of a facility to help prevent subsequent project delays.]
(c)
Salt dome formations, salt bed formations, underground mines and caves.
The placement of any noncontainerized or bulk liquid hazardous waste in any salt dome formation, salt bed formation, underground mine or cave is prohibited, except for the Department of
Energy Waste Isolation Pilot Project in New Mexico.

# Subpart D—Contingency Plan and Emergency Procedures
§ 264.50
Applicability.
The regulations in this subpart apply to owners and operators of all hazardous waste facilities, except as § 264.1 provides otherwise.
§ 264.51
Purpose and implementation of contingency plan.
(a) Each owner or operator must have a contingency plan for his facility. The contingency plan must be designed to minimize hazards to human health or the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents to air, soil, or surface water.
(b) The provisions of the plan must be carried out immediately whenever there is a fire, explosion, or release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents which could threaten human health or the environment.
[45 FR 33221, May 19, 1980, as amended at 50 FR 4514, Jan. 31, 1985]
§ 264.52
Content of contingency plan.
(a) The contingency plan must describe the actions facility personnel must take to comply with §§ 264.51 and 264.56 in response to fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents to air, soil, or surface water at the facility.
(b) If the owner or operator has already prepared a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan in accordance with part 112 of this chapter, or some other emergency or contingency plan, he need only amend that plan to incorporate hazardous waste management provisions that are sufficient to comply with the requirements of this part. The owner or operator may develop one contingency plan which meets all regulatory requirements. EPA recommends that the plan be based on the National Response Team's Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance (“One Plan”). When modifications are made to non-RCRA provisions in an integrated contingency plan, the changes do not trigger the need for a RCRA permit modification.
(c) The plan must describe arrangements agreed to by local police departments, fire departments, hospitals, contractors, and State and local emergency response teams to coordinate emergency services, pursuant to § 264.37.
(d) The plan must list names, addresses, and phone numbers (office and
home) of all persons qualified to act as emergency coordinator (see § 264.55), and this list must be kept up to date. Where more than one person is listed, one must be named as primary emergency coordinator and others must be listed in the order in which they will assume responsibility as alternates.
For new facilities,
this information must be supplied to the Regional Administrator at the time of certification, rather than at the time of permit application.
(e) The plan must include a list of all emergency equipment at the facility (such as fire extinguishing systems, spill control equipment, communications and alarm systems (internal and external), and decontamination equipment), where this equipment is required. This list must be kept up to date. In addition, the plan must include the location and a physical description of each item on the list, and a brief outline of its capabilities.
(f) The plan must include an evacuation plan for facility personnel where there is a possibility that evacuation could be necessary. This plan must describe signal(s) to be used to begin evacuation, evacuation routes, and alternate evacuation routes (in cases where the primary routes could be blocked by releases of hazardous waste or fires).
[45 FR 33221, May 19, 1980, as amended at 46 FR 27480, May 20, 1981; 50 FR 4514, Jan. 31, 1985; 71 FR 16903, Apr. 4, 2006; 75 FR 13005, Mar. 18, 2010]
§ 264.53
Copies of contingency plan.
A copy of the contingency plan and all revisions to the plan must be:
(a) Maintained at the facility; and
(b) Submitted to all local police departments, fire departments, hospitals, and State and local emergency response teams that may be called upon to provide emergency services.
[
Comment:
The contingency plan must be submitted to the Regional Administrator with Part B of the permit application under part 270, of this chapter and, after modification or approval, will become a condition of any permit issued.]

The contingency plan must be reviewed, and immediately amended, if necessary, whenever:
(a) The facility permit is revised;
(b) The plan fails in an emergency;
(c) The facility changes—in its design, construction, operation, maintenance, or other circumstances—in a way that materially increases the potential for fires, explosions, or releases of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents, or changes the response necessary in an emergency;
(d) The list of emergency coordinators changes; or
(e) The list of emergency equipment changes.
[45 FR 33221, May 19, 1980, as amended at 50 FR 4514, Jan. 31, 1985; 53 FR 37935, Sept. 28, 1988]
§ 264.55
Emergency coordinator.
At all times, there must be at least one employee either on the facility premises or on call (i.e., available to respond to an emergency by reaching the facility within a short period of time) with the responsibility for coordinating all emergency response measures. This emergency coordinator must be thoroughly familiar with all aspects of the facility's contingency plan, all operations and activities at the facility, the location and characteristics of waste handled, the location of all records within the facility, and the facility layout. In addition, this person must have the authority to commit the resources needed to carry out the contingency plan.
[
Comment:
The emergency coordinator's responsibilities are more fully spelled out in § 264.56. Applicable responsibilities for the emergency coordinator vary, depending on factors such as type and variety of waste(s) handled by the facility, and type and complexity of the facility.]
§ 264.56
Emergency procedures.
(a) Whenever there is an imminent or actual emergency situation, the emergency coordinator (or his designee when the emergency coordinator is on call) must immediately:
(1) Activate internal facility alarms or communication systems, where applicable, to notify all facility personnel; and
(2) Notify appropriate State or local agencies with designated response roles if their help is needed.
(b) Whenever there is a release, fire, or explosion, the emergency coordinator must immediately identify the character, exact source, amount, and areal extent of any released materials. He may do this by observation or review of facility records or manifests, and, if necessary, by chemical analysis.
(c) Concurrently, the emergency coordinator must assess possible hazards to human health or the environment that may result from the release, fire, or explosion. This assessment must consider both direct and indirect effects of the release, fire, or explosion (e.g., the effects of any toxic, irritating, or asphyxiating gases that are generated, or the effects of any hazardous surface water run-off from water or chemical agents used to control fire and heat-induced explosions).
(d) If the emergency coordinator determines that the facility has had a release, fire, or explosion which could threaten human health, or the environment, outside the facility, he must report his findings as follows:
(1) If his assessment indicates that evacuation of local areas may be advisable, he must immediately notify appropriate local authorities. He must be available to help appropriate officials decide whether local areas should be evacuated; and
(2) He must immediately notify either the government official designated as the on-scene coordinator for that geographical area, or the National Response Center (using their 24-hour toll free number 800/424-8802). The report must include:
(i) Name and telephone number of reporter;
(ii) Name and address of facility;
(iii) Time and type of incident (e.g., release, fire);
(iv) Name and quantity of material(s) involved, to the extent known;
(v) The extent of injuries, if any; and
(vi) The possible hazards to human health, or the environment, outside the facility.
(e) During an emergency, the emergency coordinator must take all reasonable measures necessary to ensure that fires, explosions, and releases do not occur, recur, or spread to other hazardous waste at the facility. These measures must include, where applicable, stopping processes and operations, collecting and containing release waste, and removing or isolating containers.
(f) If the facility stops operations in response to a fire, explosion, or release, the emergency coordinator must monitor for leaks, pressure buildup, gas generation, or ruptures in valves, pipes, or other equipment, wherever this is appropriate.
(g) Immediately after an emergency, the emergency coordinator must provide for treating, storing, or disposing of recovered waste, contaminated soil or surface water, or any other material that results from a release, fire, or explosion at the facility.
[
Comment:
Unless the owner or operator can demonstrate, in accordance with § 261.3(c) or (d) of this chapter, that the recovered material is not a hazardous waste, the owner or operator becomes a generator of hazardous waste and must manage it in accordance with all applicable requirements of parts 262, 263, and 264 of this chapter.]
(h) The emergency coordinator must ensure that, in the affected area(s) of the facility:
(1) No waste that may be incompatible with the released material is treated, stored, or disposed of until cleanup procedures are completed; and
(2) All emergency equipment listed in the contingency plan is cleaned and fit for its intended use before operations are resumed.
(i) The owner or operator must note in the operating record the time, date, and details of any incident that requires implementing the contingency plan. Within 15 days after the incident, he must submit a written report on the incident to the Regional Administrator. The report must include:
(1) Name, address, and telephone number of the owner or operator;
(2) Name, address, and telephone number of the facility;
(3) Date, time, and type of incident (e.g., fire, explosion);
(4) Name and quantity of material(s) involved;
(5) The extent of injuries, if any;
(6) An assessment of actual or potential hazards to human health or the environment, where this is applicable; and
(7) Estimated quantity and disposition of recovered material that resulted from the incident.

§ 264.71
Use of manifest system.
(a)(1) If a facility receives hazardous waste accompanied by a manifest, the owner, operator or his/her agent must sign and date the manifest as indicated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to certify that the hazardous waste covered by the manifest was received, that the hazardous waste was received except as noted in the discrepancy space of the manifest, or that the hazardous waste was rejected as noted in the manifest discrepancy space.
(2) If the facility receives a hazardous waste shipment accompanied by a manifest, the owner, operator, or his agent must:
(i) Sign and date, by hand, each copy of the manifest;
(ii) Note any discrepancies (as defined in § 264.72(a)) on each copy of the manifest;
(iii) Immediately give the transporter at least one copy of the manifest;
(iv) [Reserved]
(v) Paper manifest submission requirements are:
(A) [Reserved]
(B)
Options for compliance on June 30, 2021.
Send to the EPA e-Manifest system an image file of the top copy (Page 1) of the manifest and any continuation sheet, or send to the EPA e-Manifest system both a data file and the image file corresponding to Page 1 of the manifest and any continuation sheet, within 30 days of the date; of delivery; and
(vi) Retain at the facility a copy of each manifest for at least three years from the date of delivery.
(3) The owner or operator of a facility receiving hazardous waste subject to 40 CFR part 262, subpart H from a foreign source must:
(i) Additionally, list the relevant waste stream consent number from consent documentation supplied by EPA to the facility for each waste listed on the manifest in the International Shipments block on the Continuation Sheet (EPA Form 8700-22A), matched to the relevant list number for the waste from block 9b. If additional space is needed, the owner or operator should use an additional Continuation Sheet(s) (EPA Form 8700-22A); and
(ii) Send a copy of the manifest within thirty (30) days of delivery to the EPA e-Manifest system per paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section.
(b) If a facility receives, from a rail or water (bulk shipment) transporter, hazardous waste which is accompanied by a shipping paper containing all the information required on the manifest
(excluding the EPA identification numbers, generator's certification, and signatures), the owner or operator, or his agent, must:
(1) Sign and date each copy of the manifest or shipping paper (if the manifest has not been received) to certify that the hazardous waste covered by the manifest or shipping paper was received;
(2) Note any significant discrepancies (as defined in § 264.72(a)) in the manifest or shipping paper (if the manifest has not been received) on each copy of the manifest or shipping paper.
[
Comment:
The Agency does not intend that the owner or operator of a facility whose procedures under § 264.13(c) include waste analysis must perform that analysis before signing the shipping paper and giving it to the transporter. Section 264.72(b), however, requires reporting an unreconciled discrepancy discovered during later analysis.]
(3) Immediately give the rail or water (bulk shipment) transporter at least one copy of the manifest or shipping paper (if the manifest has not been received);
(4) Within 30 days of delivery, send a copy (Page 1) of the signed and dated manifest to the EPA e-Manifest system; and
(5) Retain at the facility a copy of the manifest and shipping paper (if signed in lieu of the manifest at the time of delivery) for at least three years from the date of delivery.
(c) Whenever a shipment of hazardous waste is initiated from a facility, the owner or operator of that facility must comply with the requirements of part 262 of this chapter. The provisions of §§ 262.15, 262.16, and 262.17 of this chapter are applicable to the on-site accumulation of hazardous wastes by generators. Therefore, the provisions of §§ 262.15, 262.16, and 262.17 of this chapter only apply to owners or operators who are shipping hazardous waste which they generated at that facility or operating as a large quantity generator consolidating hazardous waste from very small quantity generators under § 262.17(f).
(d)
International movement documents.
As per 40 CFR 262.84(d)(2)(xv), within three (3) working days of the receipt of a shipment subject to 40 CFR part 262, subpart H, the owner or operator of a facility must provide a copy of the movement document bearing all required signatures to the foreign exporter and to the competent authorities of the countries of export and transit that control the shipment as an export and transit of hazardous waste respectively. For shipments received on or after the electronic import-export reporting compliance date, the receiving facility must close out the movement document to confirm receipt within three working days of shipment delivery using EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system. For shipments sent from a country with which EPA has established an electronic exchange of movement document tracking data, the receiving facility may use WIETS or its successor system to send movement document confirmation data back through the electronic exchange to the foreign exporter and the country of export. The original copy of the movement document must be maintained at the facility for at least three (3) years from the date of signature. The owner or operator of a facility may satisfy this recordkeeping requirement by retaining electronically submitted documents in the facility's account on WIETS, or its successor system, provided that copies are readily available for viewing and production if requested by any EPA or authorized State inspector. No owner or operator of a facility may be held liable for the inability to produce the documents for inspection under this section if the owner or operator of a facility can demonstrate that the inability to produce the document is due exclusively to technical difficulty with WIETS, or its successor system, for which the owner or operator of a facility bears no responsibility.
(e) A facility must determine whether the consignment state for a shipment regulates any additional wastes (beyond those regulated Federally) as hazardous wastes under its state hazardous waste program. Facilities must also determine whether the consignment state or generator state requires the facility to submit any copies of the manifest to these states.
(f)
Legal equivalence to paper manifests.
Electronic manifests that are obtained, completed, and transmitted in accordance with § 262.20(a)(3) of this chapter, and used in accordance with this section in lieu of the paper manifest form are the legal equivalent of paper manifest forms bearing handwritten signatures, and satisfy for all purposes any requirement in these regulations to obtain, complete, sign, provide, use, or retain a manifest.
(1) Any requirement in these regulations for the owner or operator of a facility to sign a manifest or manifest certification by hand, or to obtain a handwritten signature, is satisfied by signing with or obtaining a valid and enforceable electronic signature within the meaning of 40 CFR 262.25.
(2) Any requirement in these regulations to give, provide, send, forward, or to return to another person a copy of the manifest is satisfied when a copy of an electronic manifest is transmitted to the other person.
(3) Any requirement in these regulations for a manifest to accompany a hazardous waste shipment is satisfied when a copy of an electronic manifest is accessible during transportation and forwarded to the person or persons who are scheduled to receive delivery of the waste shipment.
(4) Any requirement in these regulations for an owner or operator to keep or retain a copy of each manifest is satisfied by the retention of the facility's electronic manifest copies in its account on the e-Manifest system, provided that such copies are readily available for viewing and production if requested by any EPA or authorized state inspector.
(5) No owner or operator may be held liable for the inability to produce an electronic manifest for inspection under this section if the owner or operator can demonstrate that the inability to produce the electronic manifest is due exclusively to a technical difficulty with the electronic manifest system for which the owner or operator bears no responsibility.
(g) An owner or operator may participate in the electronic manifest system either by accessing the electronic manifest system from the owner's or operator's electronic equipment, or by accessing the electronic manifest system from portable equipment brought to the owner's or operator's site by the transporter who delivers the waste shipment to the facility.
(h)
Special procedures applicable to replacement manifests.
If a facility receives hazardous waste that is accompanied by a paper replacement manifest for a manifest that was originated electronically, the following procedures apply to the delivery of the hazardous waste by the final transporter:
(1) Upon delivery of the hazardous waste to the designated facility, the owner or operator must sign and date each copy of the paper replacement manifest by hand in Item 20 (Designated Facility Certification of Receipt) and note any discrepancies in Item 18 (Discrepancy Indication Space) of the paper replacement manifest,
(2) The owner or operator of the facility must give back to the final transporter one copy of the paper replacement manifest,
(3) Within 30 days of delivery of the waste to the designated facility, the owner or operator of the facility must send one signed and dated copy of the paper replacement manifest to the generator, and send an additional signed and dated copy of the paper replacement manifest to the electronic manifest system, and
(4) The owner or operator of the facility must retain at the facility one copy of the paper replacement manifest for at least three years from the date of delivery.
(i)
Special procedures applicable to electronic signature methods undergoing tests.
If an owner or operator using an electronic manifest signs this manifest electronically using an electronic signature method which is undergoing pilot or demonstration tests aimed at demonstrating the practicality or legal dependability of the signature method, then the owner or operator shall also sign with an ink signature the facility's certification of receipt or discrepancies on the printed copy of the manifest provided by the transporter. Upon executing its ink signature on this printed copy, the owner or operator shall retain this original copy among its records for at least 3 years from the date of delivery of the waste.
(j)
Imposition of user fee for manifest submissions.
(1) As prescribed in § 264.1311, and determined in § 264.1312, an owner or operator who is a user of the electronic manifest system shall be assessed a user fee by EPA for the submission and processing of each electronic and paper manifest. EPA shall update the schedule of user fees and publish them to the user community, as provided in § 264.1313.
(2) An owner or operator subject to user fees under this section shall make user fee payments in accordance with the requirements of § 264.1314, subject to the informal fee dispute resolution process of § 264.1316, and subject to the sanctions for delinquent payments under § 264.1315.
(k)
Electronic manifest signatures.
Electronic manifest signatures shall meet the criteria described in § 262.25 of this chapter.
(l)
Post-receipt manifest data corrections.
After facilities have certified that the manifest is complete, by signing it at the time of submission to the EPA e-Manifest system, any post-receipt data corrections may be submitted at any time by any interested person (
e.g.,
waste handler) named on the manifest. If corrections are requested by the Director for portions of the manifest that a designated facility is required to complete, the facility must make the data correction within 30 days from the date of the request.
(1) Interested persons must make all corrections to manifest data by electronic submission, either by directly entering corrected data to the web based service provided in e-Manifest for such corrections, or by an upload of a data file containing data corrections relating to one or more previously submitted manifests.
(2) Each correction submission must include the following information:
(i) The Manifest Tracking Number and date of receipt by the facility of the original manifest(s) for which data are being corrected;
(ii) The item number(s) of the original manifest that is the subject of the submitted correction(s); and
(iii) For each item number with corrected data, the data previously entered and the corresponding data as corrected by the correction submission.
(3) Each correction submission shall include a statement that the person submitting the corrections certifies that to the best of his or her knowledge or belief, the corrections that are included in the submission will cause the information reported about the previously received hazardous wastes to be true, accurate, and complete:
(i) The certification statement must be executed with a valid electronic signature; and
(ii) A batch upload of data corrections may be submitted under one certification statement.
(4) Upon receipt by the system of any correction submission, other interested persons shown on the manifest will be provided electronic notice of the submitter's corrections.
(5) Other interested persons shown on the manifest may respond to the submitter's corrections with comments to the submitter, or by submitting another correction to the system, certified by the respondent as specified in paragraph (l)(3) of this section, and with notice of the corrections to other interested persons shown on the manifest.

§ 264.72
Manifest discrepancies.
(a) Manifest discrepancies are:
(1) Significant differences (as defined by paragraph (b) of this section) between the quantity or type of hazardous waste designated on the manifest or shipping paper, and the quantity and type of hazardous waste a facility actually receives;
(2) Rejected wastes, which may be a full or partial shipment of hazardous waste that the TSDF cannot accept; or
(3) Container residues, which are residues that exceed the quantity limits for “empty” containers set forth in 40 CFR 261.7(b) and 266.507.
(b) Significant differences in quantity are: For bulk waste, variations greater than 10 percent in weight; for batch waste, any variation in piece count, such as a discrepancy of one
drum in a truckload. Significant differences in type are obvious differences which can be discovered by inspection or waste analysis, such as waste solvent substituted for waste acid, or toxic constituents not reported on the manifest or shipping paper.
(c) Upon discovering a significant difference in quantity or type, the owner or operator must attempt to reconcile the discrepancy with the waste generator or transporter (
e.g.,
with telephone conversations). If the discrepancy is not resolved within 20 days after receiving the waste, the owner or operator must:
(1) Immediately submit to the Regional Administrator a letter describing the discrepancy and attempts to reconcile it, and a copy of the manifest or shipping paper at issue.
(2) Beginning on December 1, 2025, immediately submit a Discrepancy Report to the EPA e-Manifest system describing the discrepancy and attempts to reconcile it, and a copy of the manifest or shipping paper at issue. Beginning on December 1, 2025, the EPA will no longer accept mailed paper Discrepancy Reports from facilities.
(d)(1) Upon rejecting waste or identifying a container residue that exceeds the quantity limits for “empty” containers set forth in 40 CFR 261.7(b), the facility must consult with the generator prior to forwarding the waste to another facility that can manage the waste. If it is impossible to locate an alternative facility that can receive the waste, the facility may return the rejected waste or residue to the generator. The facility must send the waste to the alternative facility or to the generator within 60 days of the rejection or the container residue identification.
(2) While the facility is making arrangements for forwarding rejected wastes or residues to another facility under this section, it must ensure that either the delivering transporter retains custody of the waste, or, the facility must provide for secure, temporary custody of the waste, pending delivery of the waste to the first transporter designated on the manifest prepared under paragraph (e) or (f) of this section.
(e) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(7) of this section, for full or partial load rejections and residues that are to be sent off-site to an alternate facility, the facility is required to prepare a new manifest in accordance with § 262.20(a) of this chapter and the following instructions:
(1) Write the generator's U.S. EPA ID number in Item 1 of the new manifest. Write the generator's name and mailing address in Item 5 of the new manifest. If the mailing address is different from the generator's site address, then write the generator's site address in the designated space for Item 5.
(2) Write the name of the alternate designated facility and the facility's U.S. EPA ID number in the designated facility block (Item 8) of the new manifest.
(3) Copy the manifest tracking number found in Item 4 of the old manifest to the Special Handling and Additional Information Block of the new manifest, and indicate that the shipment is a residue or rejected waste from the previous shipment.
(4) Copy the manifest tracking number found in Item 4 of the new manifest to the manifest reference number line in the Discrepancy Block of the old manifest (Item 18a).
(5) Write the DOT description for the rejected load or the residue in Item 9 (U.S. DOT Description) of the new manifest and write the container types, quantity, and volume(s) of waste.
(6) Sign the Generator's/Offeror's Certification to certify, as the offeror of the shipment, that the waste has been properly packaged, marked and labeled and is in proper condition for transportation, and mail a signed copy of the manifest to the generator identified in Item 5 of the new manifest.
(7) For full load rejections that are made while the transporter remains present at the facility, the facility may forward the rejected shipment to the alternate facility by completing Item 18b of the original manifest and supplying the information on the next destination facility in the Alternate Facility space. The facility must retain a copy of this manifest for its records, and then give the remaining copies of the manifest to the transporter to accompany the shipment. If the original
manifest is not used, then the facility must use a new manifest and comply with paragraphs (e)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) of this section.
(f) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(7) of this section, for rejected wastes and residues that must be sent back to the generator, the facility is required to prepare a new manifest in accordance with § 262.20(a) of this chapter and the following instructions:
(1) Write the facility's U.S. EPA ID number in Item 1 of the new manifest. Write the facility's name and mailing address in Item 5 of the new manifest. If the mailing address is different from the facility's site address, then write the facility's site address in the designated space for Item 5 of the new manifest.
(2) Write the name of the initial generator and the generator's U.S. EPA ID number in the designated facility block (Item 8) of the new manifest.
(3) Copy the manifest tracking number found in Item 4 of the old manifest to the Special Handling and Additional Information Block of the new manifest, and indicate that the shipment is a residue or rejected waste from the previous shipment.
(4) Copy the manifest tracking number found in Item 4 of the new manifest to the manifest reference number line in the Discrepancy Block of the old manifest (Item 18a).
(5) Write the DOT description for the rejected load or the residue in Item 9 (U.S. DOT Description) of the new manifest and write the container types, quantity, and volume(s) of waste.
(6) Sign the Generator's/Offeror's Certification to certify, as offeror of the shipment, that the waste has been properly packaged, marked and labeled and is in proper condition for transportation.
(7) For full load rejections that are made while the transporter remains at the facility, the facility may return the shipment to the generator with the original manifest by completing Item 18a and 18b of the manifest and supplying the generator's information in the Alternate Facility space. The facility must retain a copy for its records and then give the remaining copies of the manifest to the transporter to accompany the shipment. If the original manifest is not used, then the facility must use a new manifest and comply with paragraphs (f)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (8) of this section.
(8) For full or partial load rejections and container residues contained in non-empty containers that are returned to the generator, the facility must also comply with the exception reporting requirements in § 262.42(a).
(g) If a facility rejects a waste or identifies a container residue that exceeds the quantity limits for “empty” containers set forth in § 261.7(b) of this chapter after it has signed, dated, and returned a copy of the manifest to the delivering transporter or to the generator, the facility must amend its copy of the manifest to indicate the rejected wastes or residues in the discrepancy space of the amended manifest. The facility must also copy the manifest tracking number from Item 4 of the new manifest to the Discrepancy space of the amended manifest and must re-sign and date the manifest to certify to the information as amended. The facility must retain the amended manifest for at least three years from the date of amendment, and must within 30 days, send a copy of the amended manifest to the transporter that received copies prior to their being amended. Facilities are not required to send the amended manifest to any transporter who is registered in the EPA's e-Manifest system. Registered transporters may obtain the signed and dated copy of a completed manifest from the EPA e-Manifest system in lieu of receiving the manifest through U.S. postal mail.

# Subpart F—Releases From Solid Waste Management Units

# Source:
47 FR 32350, July 26, 1982, unless otherwise noted.
§ 264.90
Applicability.
(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the regulations in this subpart apply to owners or operators of facilities that treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste. The owner or operator must satisfy the requirements identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for all wastes (or constituents thereof) contained in solid waste management units at the facility, regardless of the time at which waste was placed in such units.
(2) All solid waste management units must comply with the requirements in § 264.101. A surface impoundment, waste pile, and land treatment unit or landfill that receives hazardous waste after July 26, 1982 (hereinafter referred to as a “regulated unit”) must comply with the requirements of §§ 264.91 through 264.100 in lieu of § 264.101 for purposes of detecting, characterizing and responding to releases to the uppermost aquifer. The financial responsibility requirements of § 264.101 apply to regulated units.
(b) The owner or operator's regulated unit or units are not subject to regulation for releases into the uppermost aquifer under this subpart if:
(1) The owner or operator is exempted under § 264.1; or
(2) He operates a unit which the Regional Administrator finds:
(i) Is an engineered structure,
(ii) Does not receive or contain liquid waste or waste containing free liquids,
(iii) Is designed and operated to exclude liquid, precipitation, and other run-on and run-off,
(iv) Has both inner and outer layers of containment enclosing the waste,
(v) Has a leak detection system built into each containment layer,
(vi) The owner or operator will provide continuing operation and maintenance of these leak detection systems during the active life of the unit and the closure and post-closure care periods, and
(vii) To a reasonable degree of certainty, will not allow hazardous constituents to migrate beyond the outer containment layer prior to the end of the post-closure care period.
(3) The Regional Administrator finds, pursuant to § 264.280(d), that the treatment zone of a land treatment unit that qualifies as a regulated unit does not contain levels of hazardous constituents that are above background levels of those constituents by an amount that is statistically significant, and if an unsaturated zone monitoring program meeting the requirements of § 264.278 has not shown a statistically significant increase in hazardous constituents below the treatment zone during the operating life of the unit. An exemption under this paragraph can only relieve an owner or operator of responsibility to meet the requirements of this subpart during the post-closure care period; or
(4) The Regional Administrator finds that there is no potential for migration of liquid from a regulated unit to the uppermost aquifer during the active life of the regulated unit (including the closure period) and the post-closure care period specified under § 264.117. This demonstration must be certified by a qualified geologist or geotechnical
engineer. In order to provide an adequate margin of safety in the prediction of potential migration of liquid, the owner or operator must base any predictions made under this paragraph on assumptions that maximize the rate of liquid migration.
(5) He designs and operates a pile in compliance with § 264.250(c).
(c) The regulations under this subpart apply during the active life of the regulated unit (including the closure period). After closure of the regulated unit, the regulations in this subpart:
(1) Do not apply if all waste, waste residues, contaminated containment system components, and contaminated subsoils are removed or decontaminated at closure;
(2) Apply during the post-closure care period under § 264.117 if the owner or operator is conducting a detection monitoring program under § 264.98; or
(3) Apply during the compliance period under § 264.96 if the owner or operator is conducting a compliance monitoring program under § 264.99 or a corrective action program under § 264.100.
(d) Regulations in this subpart may apply to miscellaneous units when necessary to comply with §§ 264.601 through 264.603.
(e) The regulations of this subpart apply to all owners and operators subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 270.1(c)(7), when the Agency issues either a post-closure permit or an enforceable document (as defined in 40 CFR 270.1(c)(7)) at the facility. When the Agency issues an enforceable document, references in this subpart to “in the permit” mean “in the enforceable document.”
(f) The Regional Administrator may replace all or part of the requirements of §§ 264.91 through 264.100 applying to a regulated unit with alternative requirements for groundwater monitoring and corrective action for releases to groundwater set out in the permit (or in an enforceable document) (as defined in 40 CFR 270.1(c)(7)) where the Regional Administrator determines that:
(1) The regulated unit is situated among solid waste management units (or areas of concern), a release has occurred, and both the regulated unit and one or more solid waste management unit(s) (or areas of concern) are likely to have contributed to the release; and
(2) It is not necessary to apply the groundwater monitoring and corrective action requirements of §§ 264.91 through 264.100 because alternative requirements will protect human health and the environment.
[47 FR 32350, July 26, 1982, as amended at 50 FR 28746, July 15, 1985; 52 FR 46963, Dec. 10, 1987; 63 FR 56733, Oct. 22, 1998]
§ 264.91
Required programs.
(a) Owners and operators subject to this subpart must conduct a monitoring and response program as follows:
(1) Whenever hazardous constituents under § 264.93 from a regulated unit are detected at a compliance point under § 264.95, the owner or operator must institute a compliance monitoring program under § 264.99. Detected is defined as statistically significant evidence of contamination as described in § 264.98(f);
(2) Whenever the ground-water protection standard under § 264.92 is exceeded, the owner or operator must institute a corrective action program under § 264.100. Exceeded is defined as statistically significant evidence of increased contamination as described in § 264.99(d);
(3) Whenever hazardous constituents under § 264.93 from a regulated unit exceed concentration limits under § 264.94 in ground water between the compliance point under § 264.95 and the downgradient facility property boundary, the owner or operator must institute a corrective action program under § 264.100; or
(4) In all other cases, the owner or operator must institute a detection monitoring program under § 264.98.
(b) The Regional Administrator will specify in the facility permit the specific elements of the monitoring and response program. The Regional Administrator may include one or more of the programs identified in paragraph (a) of this section in the facility permit as may be necessary to protect human health and the environment and will specify the circumstances under which each of the programs will be required. In deciding whether to require the
owner or operator to be prepared to institute a particular program, the Regional Administrator will consider the potential adverse effects on human health and the environment that might occur before final administrative action on a permit modification application to incorporate such a program could be taken.
[47 FR 32350, July 26, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 39728, Oct. 11, 1988]
§ 264.92
Ground-water protection standard.
The owner or operator must comply with conditions specified in the facility permit that are designed to ensure that hazardous constituents under § 264.93 detected in the ground water from a regulated unit do not exceed the concentration limits under § 264.94 in the uppermost aquifer underlying the waste management area beyond the point of compliance under § 264.95 during the compliance period under § 264.96. The Regional Administrator will establish this ground-water protection standard in the facility permit when hazardous constituents have been detected in the ground water.
[53 FR 39728, Oct. 11, 1988]
§ 264.93
Hazardous constituents.
(a) The Regional Administrator will specify in the facility permit the hazardous constituents to which the ground-water protection standard of § 264.92 applies. Hazardous constituents are constituents identified in appendix VIII of part 261 of this chapter that have been detected in ground water in the uppermost aquifer underlying a regulated unit and that are reasonably expected to be in or derived from waste contained in a regulated unit, unless the Regional Administrator has excluded them under paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) The Regional Administrator will exclude an appendix VIII constituent from the list of hazardous constituents specified in the facility permit if he finds that the constituent is not capable of posing a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment. In deciding whether to grant an exemption, the Regional Administrator will consider the following:
(1) Potential adverse effects on ground-water quality, considering:
(i) The physical and chemical characteristics of the waste in the regulated unit, including its potential for migration;
(ii) The hydrogeological characteristics of the facility and surrounding land;
(iii) The quantity of ground water and the direction of ground-water flow;
(iv) The proximity and withdrawal rates of ground-water users;
(v) The current and future uses of ground water in the area;
(vi) The existing quality of ground water, including other sources of contamination and their cumulative impact on the ground-water quality;
(vii) The potential for health risks caused by human exposure to waste constituents;
(viii) The potential damage to wildlife, crops, vegetation, and physical structures caused by exposure to waste constituents;
(ix) The persistence and permanence of the potential adverse effects; and
(2) Potential adverse effects on hydraulically-connected surface water quality, considering:
(i) The volume and physical and chemical characteristics of the waste in the regulated unit;
(ii) The hydrogeological characteristics of the facility and surrounding land;
(iii) The quantity and quality of ground water, and the direction of ground-water flow;
(iv) The patterns of rainfall in the region;
(v) The proximity of the regulated unit to surface waters;
(vi) The current and future uses of surface waters in the area and any water quality standards established for those surface waters;
(vii) The existing quality of surface water, including other sources of contamination and the cumulative impact on surface-water quality;
(viii) The potential for health risks caused by human exposure to waste constituents;
(ix) The potential damage to wildlife, crops, vegetation, and physical structures caused by exposure to waste constituents; and
(x) The persistence and permanence of the potential adverse effects.
(c) In making any determination under paragraph (b) of this section about the use of ground water in the area around the facility, the Regional Administrator will consider any identification of underground sources of drinking water and exempted aquifers made under § 144.8 of this chapter.

§ 264.94
Concentration limits.
(a) The Regional Administrator will specify in the facility permit concentration limits in the ground water for hazardous constituents established under § 264.93. The concentration of a hazardous constituent:
(1) Must not exceed the background level of that constituent in the ground water at the time that limit is specified in the permit; or
(2) For any of the constituents listed in Table 1, must not exceed the respective value given in that table if the background level of the constituent is below the value given in Table 1; or

In establishing alternate concentration limits, the Regional Administrator will consider the following factors:
(1) Potential adverse effects on ground-water quality, considering:
(i) The physical and chemical characteristics of the waste in the regulated unit, including its potential for migration;
(ii) The hydrogeological characteristics of the facility and surrounding land;
(iii) The quantity of ground water and the direction of ground-water flow;
(iv) The proximity and withdrawal rates of ground-water users;

(viii) The potential for health risks caused by human exposure to waste constituents;
(ix) The potential damage to wildlife, crops, vegetation, and physical structures caused by exposure to waste constituents; and
(x) The persistence and permanence of the potential adverse effects.
(c) In making any determination under paragraph (b) of this section about the use of ground water in the area around the facility the Regional Administrator will consider any identification of underground sources of drinking water and exempted aquifers made under § 144.8 of this chapter.
[47 FR 32350, July 26, 1982, as amended at 48 FR 14294, Apr. 1, 1983]
§ 264.95
Point of compliance.
(a) The Regional Administrator will specify in the facility permit the point of compliance at which the ground-water protection standard of § 264.92 applies and at which monitoring must be conducted. The point of compliance is a vertical surface located at the hydraulically downgradient limit of the waste management area that extends down into the uppermost aquifer underlying the regulated units.
(b) The waste management area is the limit projected in the horizontal plane of the area on which waste will be placed during the active life of a regulated unit.
(1) The waste management area includes horizontal space taken up by any liner, dike, or other barrier designed to contain waste in a regulated unit.
(2) If the facility contains more than one regulated unit, the waste management area is described by an imaginary line circumscribing the several regulated units.
§ 264.96
Compliance period.
(a) The Regional Administrator will specify in the facility permit the compliance period during which the ground-water protection standard of § 264.92 applies. The compliance period is the number of years equal to the active life of the waste management area (including any waste management activity prior to permitting, and the closure period.)
(b) The compliance period begins when the owner or operator initiates a compliance monitoring program meeting the requirements of § 264.99.
(c) If the owner or operator is engaged in a corrective action program at the end of the compliance period specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the compliance period is extended until the owner or operator can demonstrate that the ground-water protection standard of § 264.92 has not been exceeded for a period of three consecutive years.
§ 264.97
General ground-water monitoring requirements.
The owner or operator must comply with the following requirements for any ground-water monitoring program developed to satisfy § 264.98, § 264.99, or § 264.100:
(a) The ground-water monitoring system must consist of a sufficient number of wells, installed at appropriate locations and depths to yield ground-water samples from the uppermost aquifer that:
(1) Represent the quality of background ground water that has not been affected by leakage from a regulated unit;
(i) A determination of background ground-water quality may include sampling of wells that are not hydraulically upgradient of the waste management area where:
(A) Hydrogeologic conditions do not allow the owner or operator to determine what wells are hydraulically upgradient; and
(B) Sampling at other wells will provide an indication of background ground-water quality that is representative or more representative than that provided by the upgradient wells; and
(2) Represent the quality of ground water passing the point of compliance.
(3) Allow for the detection of contamination when hazardous waste or hazardous constituents have migrated from the waste management area to the uppermost aquifer.
(b) If a facility contains more than one regulated unit, separate ground-water monitoring systems are not required for each regulated unit provided that provisions for sampling the ground water in the uppermost aquifer will enable detection and measurement at the compliance point of hazardous constituents from the regulated units that have entered the ground water in the uppermost aquifer.
(c) All monitoring wells must be cased in a manner that maintains the integrity of the monitoring-well bore hole. This casing must be screened or perforated and packed with gravel or sand, where necessary, to enable collection of ground-water samples. The annular space (i.e., the space between the bore hole and well casing) above the sampling depth must be sealed to prevent contamination of samples and the ground water.
(d) The ground-water monitoring program must include consistent sampling and analysis procedures that are designed to ensure monitoring results that provide a reliable indication of ground-water quality below the waste management area. At a minimum the program must include procedures and techniques for:
(1) Sample collection;
(2) Sample preservation and shipment;
(3) Analytical procedures; and
(4) Chain of custody control.
(e) The ground-water monitoring program must include sampling and analytical methods that are appropriate for ground-water sampling and that accurately measure hazardous constituents in ground-water samples.
(f) The ground-water monitoring program must include a determination of the ground-water surface elevation each time ground water is sampled.
(g) In detection monitoring or where appropriate in compliance monitoring, data on each hazardous constituent specified in the permit will be collected from background wells and wells at the compliance point(s). The number and kinds of samples collected to establish background shall be appropriate for the form of statistical test employed, following generally accepted statistical principles. The sample size shall be as large as necessary to ensure with reasonable confidence that a contaminant release to ground water from a facility will be detected. The owner or operator will determine an appropriate sampling procedure and interval for each hazardous constituent listed in the facility permit which shall be specified in the unit permit upon approval by the Regional Administrator. This sampling procedure shall be:
(1) A sequence of at least four samples, taken at an interval that assures, to the greatest extent technically feasible, that an independent sample is obtained, by reference to the uppermost aquifer's effective porosity, hydraulic conductivity, and hydraulic gradient, and the fate and transport characteristics of the potential contaminants, or
(2) an alternate sampling procedure proposed by the owner or operator and approved by the Regional Administrator.
(h) The owner or operator will specify one of the following statistical methods to be used in evaluating ground-water monitoring data for each hazardous constituent which, upon approval by the Regional Administrator, will be specified in the unit permit. The statistical test chosen shall be conducted separately for each hazardous constituent in each well. Where practical quantification limits (pql's) are used in any of the following statistical procedures to comply with § 264.97(i)(5), the pql must be proposed by the owner or operator and approved by the Regional Administrator. Use of any of the following statistical methods must be protective of human health and the environment and must comply with the performance standards outlined in paragraph (i) of this section.
(1) A parametric analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by multiple comparisons procedures to identify statistically significant evidence of contamination. The method must include estimation and testing of the contrasts between each compliance well's mean and the background mean levels for each constituent.
(2) An analysis of variance (ANOVA) based on ranks followed by multiple comparisons procedures to identify statistically significant evidence of contamination. The method must include
estimation and testing of the contrasts between each compliance well's median and the background median levels for each constituent.
(3) A tolerance or prediction interval procedure in which an interval for each constituent is established from the distribution of the background data, and the level of each constituent in each compliance well is compared to the upper tolerance or prediction limit.
(4) A control chart approach that gives control limits for each constituent.
(5) Another statistical test method submitted by the owner or operator and approved by the Regional Administrator.
(i) Any statistical method chosen under § 264.97(h) for specification in the unit permit shall comply with the following performance standards, as appropriate:
(1) The statistical method used to evaluate ground-water monitoring data shall be appropriate for the distribution of chemical parameters or hazardous constituents. If the distribution of the chemical parameters or hazardous constituents is shown by the owner or operator to be inappropriate for a normal theory test, then the data should be transformed or a distribution-free theory test should be used. If the distributions for the constituents differ, more than one statistical method may be needed.
(2) If an individual well comparison procedure is used to compare an individual compliance well constituent concentration with background constituent concentrations or a ground-water protection standard, the test shall be done at a Type I error level no less than 0.01 for each testing period. If a multiple comparisons procedure is used, the Type I experimentwise error rate for each testing period shall be no less than 0.05; however, the Type I error of no less than 0.01 for individual well comparisons must be maintained. This performance standard does not apply to tolerance intervals, prediction intervals or control charts.
(3) If a control chart approach is used to evaluate ground-water monitoring data, the specific type of control chart and its associated parameter values shall be proposed by the owner or operator and approved by the Regional Administrator if he or she finds it to be protective of human health and the environment.
(4) If a tolerance interval or a prediction interval is used to evaluate groundwater monitoring data, the levels of confidence and, for tolerance intervals, the percentage of the population that the interval must contain, shall be proposed by the owner or operator and approved by the Regional Administrator if he or she finds these parameters to be protective of human health and the environment. These parameters will be determined after considering the number of samples in the background data base, the data distribution, and the range of the concentration values for each constituent of concern.
(5) The statistical method shall account for data below the limit of detection with one or more statistical procedures that are protective of human health and the environment. Any practical quantification limit (pql) approved by the Regional Administrator under § 264.97(h) that is used in the statistical method shall be the lowest concentration level that can be reliably achieved within specified limits of precision and accuracy during routine laboratory operating conditions that are available to the facility.
(6) If necessary, the statistical method shall include procedures to control or correct for seasonal and spatial variability as well as temporal correlation in the data.
(j) Ground-water monitoring data collected in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section including actual levels of constituents must be maintained in the facility operating record. The Regional Administrator will specify in the permit when the data must be submitted for review.

§ 264.98
Detection monitoring program.
An owner or operator required to establish a detection monitoring program under this subpart must, at a minimum, discharge the following responsibilities:
(a) The owner or operator must monitor for indicator parameters (e.g., specific conductance, total organic carbon, or total organic halogen), waste constituents, or reaction products that provide a reliable indication of the presence of hazardous constituents in ground water. The Regional Administrator will specify the parameters or constituents to be monitored in the facility permit, after considering the following factors:
(1) The types, quantities, and concentrations of constituents in wastes managed at the regulated unit;
(2) The mobility, stability, and persistence of waste constituents or their reaction products in the unsaturated zone beneath the waste management area;
(3) The detectability of indicator parameters, waste constituents, and reaction products in ground water; and
(4) The concentrations or values and coefficients of variation of proposed monitoring parameters or constituents in the ground-water background.
(b) The owner or operator must install a ground-water monitoring system at the compliance point as specified under § 264.95. The ground-water monitoring system must comply with § 264.97(a)(2), (b), and (c).
(c) The owner or operator must conduct a ground-water monitoring program for each chemical parameter and hazardous constituent specified in the permit pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section in accordance with § 264.97(g). The owner or operator must maintain a record of ground-water analytical data as measured and in a form necessary for the determination of statistical significance under § 264.97(h).
(d) The Regional Administrator will specify the frequencies for collecting samples and conducting statistical tests to determine whether there is statistically significant evidence of contamination for any parameter or hazardous constituent specified in the permit conditions under paragraph (a) of this section in accordance with § 264.97(g).
(e) The owner or operator must determine the ground-water flow rate and direction in the uppermost aquifer at least annually.
(f) The owner or operator must determine whether there is statistically significant evidence of contamination for any chemical parameter of hazardous constituent specified in the permit pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section at a frequency specified under paragraph (d) of this section.
(1) In determining whether statistically significant evidence of contamination exists, the owner or operator must use the method(s) specified in the permit under § 264.97(h). These method(s) must compare data collected at the compliance point(s) to the background ground-water quality data.
(2) The owner or operator must determine whether there is statistically significant evidence of contamination at each monitoring well as the compliance point within a reasonable period of time after completion of sampling. The Regional Administrator will specify in the facility permit what period of time is reasonable, after considering the complexity of the statistical test and the availability of laboratory facilities to perform the analysis of ground-water samples.
(g) If the owner or operator determines pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section that there is statistically significant evidence of contamination for chemical parameters or hazardous constituents specified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section at any monitoring well at the compliance point, he or she must:
(1) Notify the Regional Administrator of this finding in writing within seven days. The notification must indicate what chemical parameters or hazardous constituents have shown statistically significant evidence of contamination;
(2) Immediately sample the ground water in all monitoring wells and determine whether constituents in the list of appendix IX of this part are present, and if so, in what concentration. However, the Regional Administrator, on a discretionary basis, may allow sampling for a site-specific subset of constituents from the appendix IX list of this part and other representative/related waste constituents.
(3) For any appendix IX compounds found in the analysis pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the owner
or operator may resample within one month or at an alternative site-specific schedule approved by the Administrator and repeat the analysis for those compounds detected. If the results of the second analysis confirm the initial results, then these constituents will form the basis for compliance monitoring. If the owner or operator does not resample for the compounds in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the hazardous constituents found during this initial appendix IX analysis will form the basis for compliance monitoring.
(4) Within 90 days, submit to the Regional Administrator an application for a permit modification to establish a compliance monitoring program meeting the requirements of § 264.99. The application must include the following information:
(i) An identification of the concentration of any appendix IX constituent detected in the ground water at each monitoring well at the compliance point;
(ii) Any proposed changes to the ground-water monitoring system at the facility necessary to meet the requirements of § 264.99;
(iii) Any proposed additions or changes to the monitoring frequency, sampling and analysis procedures or methods, or statistical methods used at the facility necessary to meet the requirements of § 264.99;
(iv) For each hazardous constituent detected at the compliance point, a proposed concentration limit under § 264.94(a) (1) or (2), or a notice of intent to seek an alternate concentration limit under § 264.94(b); and
(5) Within 180 days, submit to the Regional Administrator:
(i) All data necessary to justify an alternate concentration limit sought under § 264.94(b); and
(ii) An engineering feasibility plan for a corrective action program necessary to meet the requirement of § 264.100, unless:
(A) All hazardous constituents identified under paragraph (g)(2) of this section are listed in Table 1 of § 264.94 and their concentrations do not exceed the respective values given in that Table; or
(B) The owner or operator has sought an alternate concentration limit under § 264.94(b) for every hazardous constituent identified under paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
(6) If the owner or operator determines, pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, that there is a statistically significant difference for chemical parameters or hazardous constituents specified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section at any monitoring well at the compliance point, he or she may demonstrate that a source other than a regulated unit caused the contamination or that the detection is an artifact caused by an error in sampling, analysis, or statistical evaluation or natural variation in the ground water. The owner operator may make a demonstration under this paragraph in addition to, or in lieu of, submitting a permit modification application under paragraph (g)(4) of this section; however, the owner or operator is not relieved of the requirement to submit a permit modification application within the time specified in paragraph (g)(4) of this section unless the demonstration made under this paragraph successfully shows that a source other than a regulated unit caused the increase, or that the increase resulted from error in sampling, analysis, or evaluation. In making a demonstration under this paragraph, the owner or operator must:
(i) Notify the Regional Administrator in writing within seven days of determining statistically significant evidence of contamination at the compliance point that he intends to make a demonstration under this paragraph;
(ii) Within 90 days, submit a report to the Regional Administrator which demonstrates that a source other than a regulated unit caused the contamination or that the contamination resulted from error in sampling, analysis, or evaluation;
(iii) Within 90 days, submit to the Regional Administrator an application for a permit modification to make any appropriate changes to the detection monitoring program facility; and
(iv) Continue to monitor in accordance with the detection monitoring program established under this section.
(h) If the owner or operator determines that the detection monitoring
program no longer satisfies the requirements of this section, he or she must, within 90 days, submit an application for a permit modification to make any appropriate changes to the program.

§ 264.99
Compliance monitoring program.
An owner or operator required to establish a compliance monitoring program under this subpart must, at a minimum, discharge the following responsibilities:
(a) The owner or operator must monitor the ground water to determine whether regulated units are in compliance with the ground-water protection standard under § 264.92. The Regional Administrator will specify the ground-water protection standard in the facility permit, including:
(1) A list of the hazardous constituents identified under § 264.93;
(2) Concentration limits under § 264.94 for each of those hazardous constituents;
(3) The compliance point under § 264.95; and
(4) The compliance period under § 264.96.
(b) The owner or operator must install a ground-water monitoring system at the compliance point as specified under § 264.95. The ground-water monitoring system must comply with § 264.97(a)(2), (b), and (c).
(c) The Regional Administrator will specify the sampling procedures and statistical methods appropriate for the constituents and the facility, consistent with § 264.97 (g) and (h).
(1) The owner or operator must conduct a sampling program for each chemical parameter or hazardous constituent in accordance with § 264.97(g).
(2) The owner or operator must record ground-water analytical data as measured and in form necessary for the determination of statistical significance under § 264.97(h) for the compliance period of the facility.
(d) The owner or operator must determine whether there is statistically significant evidence of increased contamination for any chemical parameter or hazardous constituent specified in the permit, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, at a frequency specified under paragraph (f) under this section.
(1) In determining whether statistically significant evidence of increased contamination exists, the owner or operator must use the method(s) specified in the permit under § 264.97(h). The methods(s) must compare data collected at the compliance point(s) to a concentration limit developed in accordance with § 264.94.
(2) The owner or operator must determine whether there is statistically significant evidence of increased contamination at each monitoring well at the compliance point within a reasonable time period after completion of sampling. The Regional Administrator will specify that time period in the facility permit, after considering the complexity of the statistical test and the availability of laboratory facilities to perform the analysis of ground-water samples.
(e) The owner or operator must determine the ground-water flow rate and direction in the uppermost aquifer at least annually.
(f) The Regional Administrator will specify the frequencies for collecting samples and conducting statistical tests to determine statistically significant evidence of increased contamination in accordance with § 264.97(g).
(g) Annually, the owner or operator must determine whether additional hazardous constituents from appendix IX of this part, which could possibly be present but are not on the detection monitoring list in the permit, are actually present in the uppermost aquifer and, if so, at what concentration, pursuant to procedures in § 264.98(f). To accomplish this, the owner or operator must consult with the Regional Administrator to determine on a case-by-case basis: which sample collection event during the year will involve enhanced sampling; the number of monitoring wells at the compliance point to undergo enhanced sampling; the number of samples to be collected from each of these monitoring wells; and, the specific constituents from appendix IX of this part for which these samples must
be analyzed. If the enhanced sampling event indicates that appendix IX constituents are present in the ground water that are not already identified in the permit as monitoring constituents, the owner or operator may resample within one month or at an alternative site-specific schedule approved by the Regional Administrator, and repeat the analysis. If the second analysis confirms the presence of new constituents, the owner or operator must report the concentration of these additional constituents to the Regional Administrator within seven days after the completion of the second analysis and add them to the monitoring list. If the owner or operator chooses not to resample, then he or she must report the concentrations of these additional constituents to the Regional Administrator within seven days after completion of the initial analysis, and add them to the monitoring list.
(h) If the owner or operator determines pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section that any concentration limits under § 264.94 are being exceeded at any monitoring well at the point of compliance he or she must:
(1) Notify the Regional Administrator of this finding in writing within seven days. The notification must indicate what concentration limits have been exceeded.
(2) Submit to the Regional Administrator an application for a permit modification to establish a corrective action program meeting the requirements of § 264.100 within 180 days, or within 90 days if an engineering feasibility study has been previously submitted to the Regional Administrator under § 264.98(g)(5). The application must at a minimum include the following information:
(i) A detailed description of corrective actions that will achieve compliance with the ground-water protection standard specified in the permit under paragraph (a) of this section; and
(ii) A plan for a ground-water monitoring program that will demonstrate the effectiveness of the corrective action. Such a ground-water monitoring program may be based on a compliance monitoring program developed to meet the requirements of this section.
(i) If the owner or operator determines, pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, that the ground-water concentration limits under this section are being exceeded at any monitoring well at the point of compliance, he or she may demonstrate that a source other than a regulated unit caused the contamination or that the detection is an artifact caused by an error in sampling, analysis, or statistical evaluation or natural variation in the ground water. In making a demonstration under this paragraph, the owner or operator must:
(1) Notify the Regional Administrator in writing within seven days that he intends to make a demonstration under this paragraph;
(2) Within 90 days, submit a report ­­to the Regional Administrator which demonstrates that a source other than a regulated unit caused the standard to be exceeded or that the apparent noncompliance with the standards resulted from error in sampling, analysis, or evaluation;
(3) Within 90 days, submit to the Regional Administrator an application for a permit modification to make any appropriate changes to the compliance monitoring program at the facility; and
(4) Continue to monitor in accord with the compliance monitoring program established under this section.
(j) If the owner or operator determines that the compliance monitoring program no longer satisfies the requirements of this section, he must, within 90 days, submit an application for a permit modification to make any appropriate changes to the program.

§ 264.100
Corrective action program.
An owner or operator required to establish a corrective action program under this subpart must, at a minimum, discharge the following responsibilities:
(a) The owner or operator must take corrective action to ensure that regulated units are in compliance with the ground-water protection standard
under § 264.92. The Regional Administrator will specify the ground-water protection standard in the facility permit, including:
(1) A list of the hazardous constituents identified under § 264.93;
(2) Concentration limits under § 264.94 for each of those hazardous constituents;
(3) The compliance point under § 264.95; and
(4) The compliance period under § 264.96.
(b) The owner or operator must implement a corrective action program that prevents hazardous constituents from exceeding their respective concentration limits at the compliance point by removing the hazardous waste constituents or treating them in place. The permit will specify the specific measures that will be taken.
(c) The owner or operator must begin corrective action within a reasonable time period after the ground-water protection standard is exceeded. The Regional Administrator will specify that time period in the facility permit. If a facility permit includes a corrective action program in addition to a compliance monitoring program, the permit will specify when the corrective action will begin and such a requirement will operate in lieu of § 264.99(i)(2).
(d) In conjunction with a corrective action program, the owner or operator must establish and implement a ground-water monitoring program to demonstrate the effectiveness of the corrective action program. Such a monitoring program may be based on the requirements for a compliance monitoring program under § 264.99 and must be as effective as that program ­­in determining compliance with the ground-water protection standard under § 264.92 and in determining the success of a corrective action program under paragraph (e) of this section, where appropriate.
(e) In addition to the other requirements of this section, the owner or operator must conduct a corrective action program to remove or treat in place any hazardous constituents under § 264.93 that exceed concentration limits under § 264.94 in groundwater:
(1) Between the compliance point under § 264.95 and the downgradient property boundary; and
(2) Beyond the facility boundary, where necessary to protect human health and the environment, unless the owner or operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Regional Administrator that, despite the owner's or operator's best efforts, the owner or operator was unable to obtain the necessary permission to undertake such action. The owner/operator is not relieved of all responsibility to clean up a release that has migrated beyond the facility boundary where off-site access is denied. On-site measures to address such releases will be determined on a case-by-case basis.
(3) Corrective action measures under this paragraph must be initiated and completed within a reasonable period of time considering the extent of contamination.
(4) Corrective action measures under this paragraph may be terminated once the concentration of hazardous constituents under § 264.93 is reduced to levels below their respective concentration limits under § 264.94.
(f) The owner or operator must continue corrective action measures during the compliance period to the extent necessary to ensure that the ground-water protection standard is not exceeded. If the owner or operator is conducting corrective action at the end of the compliance period, he must continue that corrective action for as long as necessary to achieve compliance with the ground-water protection standard. The owner or operator may terminate corrective action measures taken beyond the period equal to the active life of the waste management area (including the closure period) if he can demonstrate, based on data from the ground-water monitoring program under paragraph (d) of this section, that the ground-water protection standard of § 264.92 has not been exceeded for a period of three consecutive years.
(g) The owner or operator must report in writing to the Regional Administrator on the effectiveness of the corrective action program. The owner or operator must submit these reports annually.
(h) If the owner or operator determines that the corrective action program no longer satisfies the requirements of this section, he must, within 90 days, submit an application for a permit modification to make any appropriate changes to the program.
[47 FR 32350, July 26, 1985, as amended at 50 FR 4514, Jan. 31, 1985; 52 FR 45798, Dec. 1, 1987; 71 FR 16904, Apr. 4, 2006]
§ 264.101
Corrective action for solid waste management units.
(a) The owner or operator of a facility seeking a permit for the treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste must institute corrective action as necessary to protect human health and the environment for all releases of hazardous waste or constituents from any solid waste management unit at the facility, regardless of the time at which waste was placed in such unit.
(b) Corrective action will be specified in the permit in accordance with this section and subpart S of this part. The permit will contain schedules of compliance for such corrective action (where such corrective action cannot be completed prior to issuance of the permit) and assurances of financial responsibility for completing such corrective action.
(c) The owner or operator must implement corrective actions beyond the facility property boundary, where necessary to protect human health and the environment, unless the owner or operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Regional Administrator that, despite the owner's or operator's best efforts, the owner or operator was unable to obtain the necessary permission to undertake such actions. The owner/operator is not relieved of all responsibility to clean up a release that has migrated beyond the facility boundary where off-site access is denied. On-site measures to address such releases will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Assurances of financial responsibility for such corrective action must be provided.
(d) This section does not apply to remediation waste management sites unless they are part of a facility subject to a permit for treating, storing or disposing of hazardous wastes that are not remediation wastes.

51 FR 16444, May 2, 1986, unless otherwise noted.
§ 264.110
Applicability.
Except as § 264.1 provides otherwise:
(a) Sections 264.111 through 264.115 (which concern closure) apply to the owners and operators of all hazardous waste management facilities; and
(b) Sections 264.116 through 264.120 (which concern post-closure care) apply to the owners and operators of:
(1) All hazardous waste disposal facilities;
(2) Waste piles and surface impoundments from which the owner or operator intends to remove the wastes at closure to the extent that these sections are made applicable to such facilities in § 264.228 or § 264.258;
(3) Tank systems that are required under § 264.197 to meet the requirements for landfills; and
(4) Containment buildings that are required under § 264.1102 to meet the requirement for landfills.
(c) The Regional Administrator may replace all or part of the requirements of this subpart (and the unit-specific standards referenced in § 264.111(c) applying to a regulated unit), with alternative requirements set out in a permit or in an enforceable document (as defined in 40 CFR 270.1(c)(7)), where the Regional Administrator determines that:
(1) The regulated unit is situated among solid waste management units (or areas of concern), a release has occurred, and both the regulated unit and one or more solid waste management unit(s) (or areas of concern) are likely to have contributed to the release; and
(2) It is not necessary to apply the closure requirements of this subpart (and those referenced herein) because
the alternative requirements will protect human health and the environment and will satisfy the closure performance standard of § 264.111 (a) and (b).
[51 FR 16444, May 2, 1986, as amended at 51 FR 25472, July 14, 1986; 57 FR 37264, Aug. 18, 1992; 63 FR 56733, Oct. 22, 1998]
§ 264.111
Closure performance standard.
The owner or operator must close the facility in a manner that:
(a) Minimizes the need for further maintenance; and
(b) Controls, minimizes or eliminates, to the extent necessary to protect human health and the environment, post-closure escape of hazardous waste, hazardous constituents, leachate, contaminated run-off, or hazardous waste decomposition products to the ground or surface waters or to the atmosphere; and
(c) Complies with the closure requirements of this part, including, but not limited to, the requirements of §§ 264.178, 264.197, 264.228, 264.258, 264.280, 264.310, 264.351, 264.601 through 264.603, and 264.1102.

§ 264.112
Closure plan; amendment of plan.
(a)
Written plan.
(1) The owner or operator of a hazardous waste management facility must have a written closure plan. In addition, certain surface impoundments and waste piles from which the owner or operator intends to remove or decontaminate the hazardous waste at partial or final closure are required by §§ 264.228(c)(1)(i) and 264.258(c)(1)(i) to have contingent closure plans. The plan must be submitted with the permit application, in accordance with § 270.14(b)(13) of this chapter, and approved by the Regional Administrator as part of the permit issuance procedures under part 124 of this chapter. In accordance with § 270.32 of this chapter, the approved closure plan will become a condition of any RCRA permit.
(2) The Director's approval of the plan must ensure that the approved closure plan is consistent with §§ 264.111 through 264.115 and the applicable requirements of subpart F of this part, §§ 264.178, 264.197, 264.228, 264.258, 264.280, 264.310, 264.351, 264.601, and 264.1102. Until final closure is completed and certified in accordance with § 264.115, a copy of the approved plan and all approved revisions must be furnished to the Director upon request, including requests by mail.
(b)
Content of plan.
The plan must identify steps necessary to perform partial and/or final closure of the facility at any point during its active life. The closure plan must include, at least:
(1) A description of how each hazardous waste management unit at the facility will be closed in accordance with § 264.111;
(2) A description of how final closure of the facility will be conducted in accordance with § 264.111. The description must identify the maximum extent of the operations which will be unclosed during the active life of the facility; and
(3) An estimate of the maximum inventory of hazardous wastes ever on-site over the active life of the facility and a detailed description of the methods to be used during partial closures and final closure, including, but not limited to, methods for removing, transporting, treating, storing, or disposing of all hazardous wastes, and identification of the type(s) of the off-site hazardous waste management units to be used, if applicable; and
(4) A detailed description of the steps needed to remove or decontaminate all hazardous waste residues and contaminated containment system components, equipment, structures, and soils during partial and final closure, including, but not limited to, procedures for cleaning equipment and removing contaminated soils, methods for sampling and testing surrounding soils, and criteria for determining the extent of decontamination required to satisfy the closure performance standard; and
(5) A detailed description of other activities necessary during the closure period to ensure that all partial closures and final closure satisfy the closure performance standards, including, but not limited to, ground-water monitoring, leachate collection, and run-on and run-off control; and
(6) A schedule for closure of each hazardous waste management unit and for final closure of the facility. The schedule must include, at a minimum, the total time required to close each hazardous waste management unit and the time required for intervening closure activities which will allow tracking of the progress of partial and final closure. (For example, in the case of a landfill unit, estimates of the time required to treat or dispose of all hazardous waste inventory and of the time required to place a final cover must be included.)
(7) For facilities that use trust funds to establish financial assurance under § 264.143 or § 264.145 and that are expected to close prior to the expiration of the permit, an estimate of the expected year of final closure.
(8) For facilities where the Regional Administrator has applied alternative requirements at a regulated unit under §§ 264.90(f), 264.110(c), and/or § 264.140(d), either the alternative requirements applying to the regulated unit, or a reference to the enforceable document containing those alternative requirements.
(c)
Amendment of plan.
The owner or operator must submit a written notification of or request for a permit modification to authorize a change in operating plans, facility design, or the approved closure plan in accordance with the applicable procedures in parts 124 and 270. The written notification or request must include a copy of the amended closure plan for review or approval by the Regional Administrator.
(1) The owner or operator may submit a written notification or request to the Regional Administrator for a permit modification to amend the closure plan at any time prior to the notification of partial or final closure of the facility.
(2) The owner or operator must submit a written notification of or request for a permit modification to authorize a change in the approved closure plan whenever:
(i) Changes in operating plans or facility design affect the closure plan, or
(ii) There is a change in the expected year of closure, if applicable, or
(iii) In conducting partial or final closure activities, unexpected events require a modification of the approved closure plan.
(iv) The owner or operator requests the Regional Administrator to apply alternative requirements to a regulated unit under §§ 264.90(f), 264.110(c), and/or § 264.140(d).
(3) The owner or operator must submit a written request for a permit modification including a copy of the amended closure plan for approval at least 60 days prior to the proposed change in facility design or operation, or no later than 60 days after an unexpected event has occurred which has affected the closure plan. If an unexpected event occurs during the partial or final closure period, the owner or operator must request a permit modification no later than 30 days after the unexpected event. An owner or operator of a surface impoundment or waste pile that intends to remove all hazardous waste at closure and is not otherwise required to prepare a contingent closure plan under § 264.228(c)(1)(i) or § 264.258(c)(1)(i), must submit an amended closure plan to the Regional Administrator no later than 60 days from the date that the owner or operator or Regional Administrator determines that the hazardous waste management unit must be closed as a landfill, subject to the requirements of § 264.310, or no later than 30 days from that date if the determination is made during partial or final closure. The Regional Administrator will approve, disapprove, or modify this amended plan in accordance with the procedures in parts 124 and 270. In accordance with § 270.32 of this chapter, the approved closure plan will become a condition of any RCRA permit issued.
(4) The Regional Administrator may request modifications to the plan under the conditions described in § 264.112(c)(2). The owner or operator must submit the modified plan within 60 days of the Regional Administrator's request, or within 30 days if the change in facility conditions occurs during partial or final closure. Any modifications requested by the Regional Administrator will be approved in accordance with the procedures in parts 124 and 270.
(d)
Notification of partial closure and final closure.
(1) The owner or operator
must notify the Regional Administrator in writing at least 60 days prior to the date on which he expects to begin closure of a surface impoundment, waste pile, land treatment or landfill unit, or final closure of a facility with such a unit. The owner or operator must notify the Regional Administrator in writing at least 45 days prior to the date on which he expects to begin final closure of a facility with only treatment or storage tanks, container storage, or incinerator units to be closed. The owner or operator must notify the Regional Administrator in writing at least 45 days prior to the date on which he expects to begin partial or final closure of a boiler or industrial furnace, whichever is earlier.
(2) The date when he “expects to begin closure” must be either:
(i) No later than 30 days after the date on which any hazardous waste management unit receives the known final volume of hazardous wastes, or if there is a reasonable possibility that the hazardous waste management unit will receive additional hazardous wastes, no later than one year after the date on which the unit received the most recent volume of hazardous wastes. If the owner or operator of a hazardous waste management unit can demonstrate to the Regional Administrator that the hazardous waste management unit or facility has the capacity to receive additional hazardous wastes and he has taken all steps to prevent threats to human health and the environment, including compliance with all applicable permit requirements, the Regional Administrator may approve an extension to this one-year limit; or
(ii) For units meeting the requirements of § 264.113(d), no later than 30 days after the date on which the hazardous waste management unit receives the known final volume of non-hazardous wastes, or if there is a reasonable possibility that the hazardous waste management unit will receive additional non-hazardous wastes, no later than one year after the date on which the unit received the most recent volume of non-hazardous wastes. If the owner or operator can demonstrate to the Regional Administrator that the hazardous waste management unit has the capacity to receive additional non-hazardous wastes and he has taken, and will continue to take, all steps to prevent threats to human health and the environment, including compliance with all applicable permit requirements, the Regional Administrator may approve an extension to this one-year limit.
(3) If the facility's permit is terminated, or if the facility is otherwise ordered, by judicial decree or final order under section 3008 of RCRA, to cease receiving hazardous wastes or to close, then the requirements of this paragraph do not apply. However, the owner or operator must close the facility in accordance with the deadlines established in § 264.113.
(e)
Removal of wastes and decontamination or dismantling of equipment.
Nothing in this section shall preclude the owner or operator from removing hazardous wastes and decontaminating or dismantling equipment in accordance with the approved partial or final closure plan at any time before or after notification of partial or final closure.

(c) Until final closure of the facility, a copy of the approved post-closure plan must be furnished to the Regional Administrator upon request, including request by mail. After final closure has been certified, the person or office specified in § 264.118(b)(3) must keep the approved post-closure plan during the remainder of the post-closure period.
(d)
Amendment of plan.
The owner or operator must submit a written notification of or request for a permit modification to authorize a change in the approved post-closure plan in accordance with the applicable requirements in parts 124 and 270. The written notification or request must include a copy of the amended post-closure plan for review or approval by the Regional Administrator.
(1) The owner or operator may submit a written notification or request to the Regional Administrator for a permit modification to amend the post-closure plan at any time during the active life of the facility or during the post-closure care period.
(2) The owner or operator must submit a written notification of or request for a permit modification to authorize a change in the approved post-closure plan whenever:
(i) Changes in operating plans or facility design affect the approved post-closure plan, or
(ii) There is a change in the expected year of final closure, if applicable, or
(iii) Events which occur during the active life of the facility, including partial and final closures, affect the approved post-closure plan.
(iv) The owner or operator requests the Regional Administrator to apply alternative requirements to a regulated unit under §§ 264.90(f), 264.110(c), and/or § 264.140(d).
(3) The owner or operator must submit a written request for a permit modification at least 60 days prior to the proposed change in facility design or operation, or no later than 60 days after an unexpected event has occurred which has affected the post-closure plan. An owner or operator of a surface impoundment or waste pile that intends to remove all hazardous waste at closure and is not otherwise required to submit a contingent post-closure plan under §§ 264.228(c)(1)(ii) and
264.258(c)(1)(ii) must submit a post-closure plan to the Regional Administrator no later than 90 days after the date that the owner or operator or Regional Administrator determines that the hazardous waste management unit must be closed as a landfill, subject to the requirements of § 264.310. The Regional Administrator will approve, disapprove or modify this plan in accordance with the procedures in parts 124 and 270. In accordance with § 270.32 of this chapter, the approved post-closure plan will become a permit condition.
(4) The Regional Administrator may request modifications to the plan under the conditions described in § 264.118(d)(2). The owner or operator must submit the modified plan no later than 60 days after the Regional Administrator's request, or no later than 90 days if the unit is a surface impoundment or waste pile not previously required to prepare a contingent post-closure plan. Any modifications requested by the Regional Administrator will be approved, disapproved, or modified in accordance with the procedures in parts 124 and 270.

§ 264.119
Post-closure notices.
(a) No later than 60 days after certification of closure of each hazardous waste disposal unit, the owner or operator must submit to the local zoning authority, or the authority with jurisdiction over local land use, and to the Regional Administrator a record of the type, location, and quantity of hazardous wastes disposed of within each cell or other disposal unit of the facility. For hazardous wastes disposed of before January 12, 1981, the owner or operator must identify the type, location, and quantity of the hazardous wastes to the best of his knowledge and in accordance with any records he has kept.
(b) Within 60 days of certification of closure of the first hazardous waste disposal unit and within 60 days of certification of closure of the last hazardous waste disposal unit, the owner or operator must:
(1) Record, in accordance with State law, a notation on the deed to the facility property—or on some other instrument which is normally examined during title search—that will in perpetuity notify any potential purchaser of the property that:
(i) The land has been used to manage hazardous wastes; and
(ii) Its use is restricted under 40 CFR part 264, subpart G regulations; and
(iii) The survey plat and record of the type, location, and quantity of hazardous wastes disposed of within each cell or other hazardous waste disposal unit of the facility required by §§ 264.116 and 264.119(a) have been filed with the local zoning authority or the authority with jurisdiction over local land use and with the Regional Administrator; and
(2) Submit a certification, signed by the owner or operator, that he has recorded the notation specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, including a copy of the document in which the notation has been placed, to the Regional Administrator.
(c) If the owner or operator or any subsequent owner or operator of the land upon which a hazardous waste disposal unit is located wishes to remove hazardous wastes and hazardous waste residues, the liner, if any, or contaminated soils, he must request a modification to the post-closure permit in accordance with the applicable requirements in parts 124 and 270. The owner or operator must demonstrate that the removal of hazardous wastes will satisfy the criteria of § 264.117(c). By removing hazardous waste, the owner or operator may become a generator of hazardous waste and must manage it in accordance with all applicable requirements of this chapter. If he is granted a permit modification or otherwise granted approval to conduct such removal activities, the owner or operator may request that the Regional Administrator approve either:
(1) The removal of the notation on the deed to the facility property or other instrument normally examined during title search; or
(2) The addition of a notation to the deed or instrument indicating the removal of the hazardous waste.
