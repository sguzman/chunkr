A suggestion that a private education loan is offered or made by the covered educational institution instead of by the creditor is included in the prohibition on implying that the covered educational institution endorses the private education loan under § 226.48(a)(1). For example, naming the loan the “University of ABC Loan,” suggests that the loan is offered by the educational institution. However, the use of a creditor's full name, even if that name includes the name of a covered educational institution, does not imply endorsement. For example, a credit union whose name includes the name of a covered educational institution is not prohibited from using its own name. In addition, the authorized use of a state seal by a state or an institution of higher education in the marketing of state education loan products does not imply endorsement.
3.
Disclosure.
i. A creditor is considered to have complied with § 226.48(a)(2) if the creditor's marketing contains a clear and conspicuous statement, equally prominent and closely proximate to the reference to the covered educational institution, using the name of the creditor and the name of the covered educational institution that the covered educational institution does not endorse the creditor's loans and that the creditor is not affiliated with the covered educational institution. For example, “[Name of creditor]'s loans are not endorsed by [name of school] and [name of creditor] is not affiliated with [name of school].” The statement is considered to be equally prominent and closely proximate if it is the same type size and is located immediately next to or directly above or below the reference to the educational institution, without any intervening text or graphical displays.
ii. A creditor is considered to have complied with § 226.48(b) if the creditor's marketing contains a clear and conspicuous statement, equally prominent and closely proximate to the reference to the covered educational institution, using the name of the creditor's loan or loan program, the name of the covered educational institution, and the name of the creditor, that the creditor's loans are not offered or made by the covered educational institution, but are made by the creditor. For example, “[Name of loan or loan program] is not being offered or made by [name of school], but by [name of creditor].” The statement is considered to be equally prominent and closely proximate if it is the same type size and is located immediately next to or directly above or below the reference to the educational institution, without any intervening text or graphical displays.

# Paragraph 48(c)
1.
30 day acceptance period.
The creditor must provide the consumer with at least 30 calendar days from the date the consumer receives the disclosures required under § 226.47(b) to accept the terms of the loan. The creditor may provide the consumer with a longer period of time. If the creditor places the disclosures in the mail, the consumer is considered to have received them three business days after they are mailed under § 226.46(d)(4). For purposes of determining when a consumer receives mailed disclosures, “business day” means all calendar days except Sundays and the legal public holidays referred to in § 226.2(a)(6).
See
comment 46(d)-1. The consumer may accept the
loan at any time before the end of the 30 day period.
2.
Method of acceptance.
The creditor must specify a method or methods by which the consumer can accept the loan at any time within the 30-day acceptance period. The creditor may require the consumer to communicate acceptance orally or in writing. Acceptance may also be communicated electronically, but electronic communication must not be the only means provided for the consumer to communicate acceptance unless the creditor has provided the approval disclosure electronically in compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. § 7001
et seq.
). If acceptance by mail is allowed, the consumer's communication of acceptance is considered timely if placed in the mail within the 30-day period.
3.
Prohibition on changes to rates and terms.
The prohibition on changes to the rates and terms of the loan applies to changes that affect those terms that are required to be disclosed under §§ 226.47(b) and (c). The creditor is permitted to make changes that do not affect any of the terms disclosed to the consumer under those sections.
4.
Permissible changes to rates and terms—re-disclosure not required.
Creditors are not required to consummate a loan where the extension of credit would be prohibited by law or where the creditor has reason to believe that the consumer has committed fraud. A creditor may make changes to the rate based on adjustments to the index used for the loan and changes that will unequivocally benefit the consumer. For example, a creditor is permitted to reduce the interest rate or lower the amount of a fee. A creditor may also reduce the loan amount based on a certification or other information received from a covered educational institution or from the consumer indicating that the student's cost of attendance has decreased or the amount of other financial aid has increased. A creditor may also withdraw the loan approval based on a certification or other information received from a covered educational institution or from the consumer indicating that the student is not enrolled in the institution. For these changes permitted by § 226.48(c)(3), the creditor is not required to provide a new set of approval disclosures required under § 226.47(b) or provide the consumer with a new 30-day acceptance period under § 226.48(c)(1). The creditor must provide the final disclosures under § 226.47(c).
5.
Permissible changes to rates and terms—school certification.
If the creditor reduces the loan amount based on information that the student's cost of attendance has decreased or the amount of other financial aid has increased, the creditor may make certain corresponding changes to the rate and terms. The creditor may change the rate or terms to those that the consumer would have received if the consumer had applied for the reduced loan amount. For example, assume a consumer applies for, and is approved for, a $10,000 loan at a 7% interest rate. However, after the consumer receives the approval disclosures, the consumer's school certifies that the consumer's financial need is only $8,000. The creditor may reduce the loan amount for which the consumer is approved to $8,000. The creditor may also, for example, increase the interest rate on the loan to 7.125%, but only if the consumer would have received a rate of 7.125% if the consumer had originally applied for an $8,000 loan.
5.
Permissible changes to rates and terms—re-disclosure required.
A creditor may make changes to the interest rate or terms to accommodate a request from a consumer. For example, assume a consumer applies for a $10,000 loan and is approved for the $10,000 amount at an interest rate of 6%. After the creditor has provided the approval disclosures, the consumer's financial need increases, and the consumer requests to a loan amount of $15,000. In this situation, the creditor is permitted to offer a $15,000 loan, and to make any other changes such as raising the interest rate to 7%, in response to the consumer's request. The creditor must provide a new set of disclosures under § 226.47(b) and provide the consumer with 30 days to accept the offer under § 226.48(c) for the $15,000 loan offered in response to the consumer's request. However, because the consumer may choose not to accept the offer for the $15,000 loan at the higher interest rate, the creditor may not withdraw or change the rate or terms of the offer for the $10,000 loan, except as permitted under § 226.48(c)(3), unless the consumer accepts the $15,000 loan.

# Paragraph 48(d)
1.
Right to cancel.
If the creditor mails the disclosures, the disclosures are considered received by the consumer three business days after the disclosures were mailed. For purposes of determining when the consumer receives the disclosures, the term “business day” is defined as all calendar days except Sunday and the legal public holidays referred to in § 226.2(a)(6).
See
§ 226.46(d)(4). The consumer has three business days from the date on which the disclosures are deemed received to cancel the loan. For example, if the creditor places the disclosures in the mail on Thursday, June 4, the disclosures are considered received on Monday, June 8. The consumer may cancel any time before midnight Thursday, June 11. The creditor may provide the consumer with more time to cancel the loan than the minimum three business days required under this section. If the creditor provides the consumer with a longer period of time in which to cancel the loan, the creditor may disburse the funds three business
days after the consumer has received the disclosures required under this section, but the creditor must honor the consumer's later timely cancellation request.
2.
Method of cancellation.
The creditor must specify a method or methods by which the consumer may cancel. For example, the creditor may require the consumer to communicate cancellation orally or in writing. Cancellation may also be communicated electronically, but electronic communication must not be the only means by which the consumer may cancel unless the creditor provided the final disclosure electronically in compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001
et seq.
). If the creditor allows cancellation by mail, the creditor must specify an address or the name and address of an agent of the creditor to receive notice of cancellation. The creditor must wait to disburse funds until it is reasonably satisfied that the consumer has not canceled. For example, the creditor may satisfy itself by waiting a reasonable time after expiration of the cancellation period to allow for delivery of a mailed notice. The creditor may also satisfy itself by obtaining a written statement from the consumer, which must be provided to and signed by the consumer only at the end of the three-day period, that the right has not been exercised.
3.
Cancellation without penalty.
The creditor may not charge the consumer a fee for exercising the right to cancel under § 226.48(d). The prohibition extends only to fees charged specifically for canceling the loan. The creditor is not required to refund fees, such as an application fee, that are charged to all consumers whether or not the consumer cancels the loan.

# Paragraph 48(e)
1.
General.
Section 226.48(e) requires that the creditor obtain the self-certification form, signed by the consumer, before consummating the private education loan. The rule applies only to private education loans that will be used for the postsecondary educational expenses of a student while that student is attending an institution of higher education as defined in § 226.46(b)(2). It does not apply to all covered educational institutions. The requirement applies even if the student is not currently attending an institution of higher education, but will use the loan proceeds for postsecondary educational expenses while attending such institution. For example, a creditor is required to obtain the form before consummating a private education loan provided to a high school senior for expenses to be incurred during the consumer's first year of college. This provision does not require that the creditor obtain the self-certification form in instances where the loan is not intended for a student attending an institution of higher education, such as when the consumer is consolidating loans after graduation. Section 155(a)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 provides that the form shall be made available to the consumer by the relevant institution of higher education. However, § 226.48(e) provides flexibility to institutions of higher education and creditors as to how the completed self-certification form is provided to the lender. The creditor may receive the form directly from the consumer, or the creditor may receive the form from the consumer through the institution of higher education. In addition, the creditor may provide the form, and the information the consumer will require to complete the form, directly to the consumer.
2.
Electronic signature.
Under Section 155(a)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, the institution of higher education may provide the self-certification form to the consumer in written or electronic form. Under Section 155(a)(5) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, the form may be signed electronically by the consumer. A creditor may accept the self-certification form from the consumer in electronic form. A consumer's electronic signature is considered valid if it meets the requirements issued by the Department of Education under Section 155(a)(5) of the Higher Education Act of 1965.

# Paragraph 48(f)
1.
General.
Section 226.48(f) does not specify the format in which creditors must provide the required information to the covered educational institution. Creditors may choose to provide only the required information or may provide copies of the form or forms the lender uses to comply with § 226.47(a). A creditor is only required to provide the required information if the creditor is aware that it is a party to a preferred lender arrangement. For example, if a creditor is placed on a covered educational institution's preferred lender list without the creditor's knowledge, the creditor is not required to comply with § 226.48(f).

# Subpart G—Special Rules Applicable to Credit Card Accounts and Open-End Credit Offered to College Students

# § 226.51—Ability To Pay
51(a) General rule.
51(a)(1) Consideration of ability to pay.
1.
Consideration of additional factors.
Section 226.51(a) requires a card issuer to consider a consumer's independent ability to make the required minimum periodic payments under the terms of an account based on the consumer's independent income or assets and current obligations. The card issuer may also consider consumer reports, credit scores, and other factors, consistent with Regulation B (12 CFR part 202).
2.
Ability to pay as of application or consideration of increase.
A card issuer complies with § 226.51(a) if it bases its determination regarding a consumer's independent ability to make the required minimum periodic payments on the facts and circumstances known to the card issuer at the time the consumer applies to open the credit card account or when the card issuer considers increasing the credit line on an existing account.
3.
Credit line increase.
When a card issuer considers increasing the credit line on an existing account, § 226.51(a) applies whether the consideration is based upon a request of the consumer or is initiated by the card issuer.
4.
Income and assets.
i.
Sources of information.
For purposes of § 226.51(a), a card issuer may consider the consumer's income and assets based on
A. Information provided by the consumer in connection with the credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan;
B. Information provided by the consumer in connection with any other financial relationship the card issuer or its affiliates have with the consumer (subject to any applicable information-sharing rules);
C. Information obtained through third parties (subject to any applicable information-sharing rules); and
D. Information obtained through any empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound model that reasonably estimates a consumer's income and assets.
ii.
Income and assets of persons liable for debts incurred on account.
For purposes of § 226.51(a), a card issuer may consider any current or reasonably expected income and assets of the consumer or consumers who are applying for a new account and will be liable for debts incurred on that account. Similarly, when a card issuer is considering whether to increase the credit limit on an existing account, the card issuer may consider any current or reasonably expected income and assets of the consumer or consumers who are accountholders and are liable for debts incurred on that account. A card issuer may also consider any current or reasonably expected income and assets of a cosigner or guarantor who is or will be liable for debts incurred on the account. However, a card issuer may not use the income and assets of an authorized user or other person who is not liable for debts incurred on the account to satisfy the requirements of § 226.51, unless a Federal or State statute or regulation grants a consumer who is liable for debts incurred on the account an ownership interest in such income and assets. Information about current or reasonably expected income and assets includes, for example, information about current or expected salary, wages, bonus pay, tips, and commissions. Employment may be full-time, part-time, seasonal, irregular, military, or self-employment. Other sources of income could include interest or dividends, retirement benefits, public assistance, alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments. A card issuer may also take into account assets such as savings accounts or investments.
iii.
Household income and assets.
Consideration of information regarding a consumer's household income does not by itself satisfy the requirement in § 226.51(a) to consider the consumer's independent ability to pay. For example, if a card issuer requests on its application forms that applicants provide their “household income,” the card issuer may not rely solely on the information provided by applicants to satisfy the requirements of § 226.51(a). Instead, the card issuer would need to obtain additional information about an applicant's independent income (such as by contacting the applicant). However, if a card issuer requests on its application forms that applicants provide their income without reference to household income (such as by requesting “income” or “salary”), the card issuer may rely on the information provided by applicants to satisfy the requirements of § 226.51(a).
5.
Current obligations.
A card issuer may consider the consumer's current obligations based on information provided by the consumer or in a consumer report. In evaluating a consumer's current obligations, a card issuer need not assume that credit lines for other obligations are fully utilized.
6.
Joint applicants and joint accountholders.
With respect to the opening of a joint account for two or more consumers or a credit line increase on such an account, the card issuer may consider the collective ability of all persons who are or will be liable for debts incurred on the account to make the required payments.
51(a)(2) Minimum periodic payments.
1.
Applicable minimum payment formula.
For purposes of estimating required minimum periodic payments under the safe harbor set forth in § 226.51(a)(2)(ii), if the account has or may have a promotional program, such as a deferred payment or similar program, where there is no applicable minimum payment formula during the promotional period, the issuer must estimate the required minimum periodic payment based on the minimum payment formula that will apply when the promotion ends.
2.
Interest rate for purchases.
For purposes of estimating required minimum periodic payments under the safe harbor set forth in § 226.51(a)(2)(ii), if the interest rate for purchases is or may be a promotional rate, the issuer must use the post-promotional rate to estimate interest charges.
3.
Mandatory fees.
For purposes of estimating required minimum periodic payments under the safe harbor set forth in § 226.51(a)(2)(ii), mandatory fees that must be
assumed to be charged include those fees the card issuer knows the consumer will be required to pay under the terms of the account if the account is opened, such as an annual fee. If a mandatory fee is a promotional fee (as defined in § 226.16(g)), the issuer must use the post-promotional fee amount for purposes of § 226.51(a)(2)(ii).
51(b) Rules affecting young consumers.
1.
Age as of date of application or consideration of credit line increase.
Sections 226.51(b)(1) and (b)(2) apply only to a consumer who has not attained the age of 21 as of the date of submission of the application under § 226.51(b)(1) or the date the credit line increase is requested by the consumer (or if no request has been made, the date the credit line increase is considered by the card issuer) under § 226.51(b)(2).
2.
Liability of cosigner, guarantor, or joint accountholder.
Sections 226.51(b)(1)(ii) and (b)(2) require the signature or written consent of a cosigner, guarantor, or joint accountholder agreeing either to be secondarily liable for any debt on the account incurred by the consumer before the consumer has attained the age of 21 or to be jointly liable with the consumer for any debt on the account. Sections 226.51(b)(1)(ii) and (b)(2) do not prohibit a card issuer from also requiring the cosigner, guarantor, or joint accountholder to assume liability for debts incurred after the consumer has attained the age of 21, consistent with any agreement made between the parties.
3.
Authorized users exempt.
If a consumer who has not attained the age of 21 is being added to another person's account as an authorized user and has no liability for debts incurred on the account, § 226.51(b)(1) and (b)(2) do not apply.
4.
Electronic application.
Consistent with § 226.5(a)(1)(iii), an application may be provided to the consumer in electronic form without regard to the consumer consent or other provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001
et seq.
) in the circumstances set forth in § 226.5a. The electronic submission of an application from a consumer or a consent to a credit line increase from a cosigner, guarantor, or joint accountholder to a card issuer would constitute a written application or consent for purposes of § 226.51(b) and would not be considered a consumer disclosure for purposes of the E-Sign Act.
51(b)(1) Applications from young consumers.
1.
Relation to Regulation B.
In considering an application or credit line increase on the credit card account of a consumer who is less than 21 years old, creditors must comply with the applicable rules in Regulation B (12 CFR part 202).
2.
Financial information.
Information regarding income and assets that satisfies the requirements of § 226.51(a) also satisfies the requirements of § 226.51(b)(1).
See
comment 51(a)(1)-4.
51(b)(2) Credit line increases for young consumers.
1.
Relation to Regulation B.
In considering an application or credit line increase on the credit card account of a consumer who is less than 21 years old, creditors must comply with the applicable rules in Regulation B (12 CFR part 202).

# § 226.52—Limitations on Fees
52(a) Limitations prior to account opening and during first year after account opening.
52(a)(1) General rule.
1.
Application.
The 25 percent limit in § 226.52(a)(1) applies to fees that the card issuer charges to the account as well as to fees that the card issuer requires the consumer to pay with respect to the account through other means (such as through a payment from the consumer's asset account to the card issuer or from another credit account provided by the card issuer). For example
i. Assume that, under the terms of a credit card account, a consumer is required to pay $120 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit at account opening. The consumer is also required to pay a cash advance fee that is equal to five percent of the cash advance and a late payment fee of $15 if the required minimum periodic payment is not received by the payment due date (which is the twenty-fifth of the month). At account opening on January 1 of year one, the credit limit for the account is $500. Section 226.52(a)(1) permits the card issuer to charge to the account the $120 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit at account opening. On February 1 of year one, the consumer uses the account for a $100 cash advance. Section 226.52(a)(1) permits the card issuer to charge a $5 cash-advance fee to the account. On March 26 of year one, the card issuer has not received the consumer's required minimum periodic payment. Section 226.52(a)(2) permits the card issuer to charge a $15 late payment fee to the account. On July 15 of year one, the consumer uses the account for a $50 cash advance. Section 226.52(a)(1) does not permit the card issuer to charge a $2.50 cash advance fee to the account. Furthermore, § 225.52(a)(1) prohibits the card issuer from collecting the $2.50 cash advance fee from the consumer by other means.
ii. Assume that, under the terms of a credit card account, a consumer is required to pay $125 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit during the first year after account opening. At account opening on January 1 of year one, the credit limit for the account is $500. Section 226.52(a)(1) permits the card issuer to charge the $125 in fees to the account. However, § 226.52(a)(1) prohibits the card issuer from requiring the consumer
to make payments to the card issuer for additional non-exempt fees with respect to the account prior to account opening or during the first year after account opening. Section 226.52(a)(1) also prohibits the card issuer from requiring the consumer to open a separate credit account with the card issuer to fund the payment of additional non-exempt fees prior to the opening of the credit card account or during the first year after the credit card account is opened.
iii. Assume that, on January 1 of year one, a consumer is required to pay a $100 fee in order to apply for a credit card account. On January 5, the card issuer approves the consumer's application, assigns the account a credit limit of $1,000, and provides the consumer with account-opening disclosures consistent with § 226.6. The date on which the account may first be used by the consumer to engage in transactions is January 5. The consumer is required to pay $150 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit, which § 226.52(a)(1) permits the card issuer to charge to the account on January 5. However, because the $100 application fee is subject to the 25 percent limit in § 226.52(a)(1), the card issuer is prohibited from requiring the consumer to pay any additional non-exempt fees with respect to the account until January 5 of year two.
2.
Fees that exceed 25 percent limit.
A card issuer that charges a fee to a credit card account that exceeds the 25 percent limit complies with § 226.52(a)(1) if the card issuer waives or removes the fee and any associated interest charges or credits the account for an amount equal to the fee and any associated interest charges within a reasonable amount of time but no later than the end of the billing cycle following the billing cycle during which the fee was charged. For example, assuming the facts in the example in comment 52(a)(1)-1.i. above, the card issuer complies with § 226.52(a)(1) if the card issuer charged the $2.50 cash advance fee to the account on July 15 of year one but waived or removed the fee or credited the account for $2.50 (plus any interest charges on that $2.50) at the end of the billing cycle.
3.
Changes in credit limit during first year.
i.
Increases in credit limit.
If a card issuer increases the credit limit during the first year after the account is opened, § 226.52(a)(1) does not permit the card issuer to require the consumer to pay additional fees that would otherwise be prohibited (such as a fee for increasing the credit limit). For example, assume that, at account opening on January 1, the credit limit for a credit card account is $400 and the consumer is required to pay $100 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit. On July 1, the card issuer increases the credit limit for the account to $600. Section 226.52(a)(1) does not permit the card issuer to require the consumer to pay additional fees based on the increased credit limit.
ii.
Decreases in credit limit.
If a card issuer decreases the credit limit during the first year after the account is opened, § 226.52(a)(1) requires the card issuer to waive or remove any fees charged to the account that exceed 25 percent of the reduced credit limit or to credit the account for an amount equal to any fees the consumer was required to pay with respect to the account that exceed 25 percent of the reduced credit limit within a reasonable amount of time but no later than the end of the billing cycle following the billing cycle during which the credit limit was reduced. For example
A. Assume that, at account opening on January 1, the credit limit for a credit card account is $1,000 and the consumer is required to pay $250 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit. The billing cycles for the account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month. On July 30, the card issuer decreases the credit limit for the account to $500. Section 226.52(a)(1) requires the card issuer to waive or remove $175 in fees from the account or to credit the account for an amount equal to $175 within a reasonable amount of time but no later than August 31.
B. Assume that, on June 25 of year one, a consumer is required to pay a $75 fee in order to apply for a credit card account. At account opening on July 1 of year one, the credit limit for the account is $500 and the consumer is required to pay $50 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit. The billing cycles for the account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month. On February 15 of year two, the card issuer decreases the credit limit for the account to $250. Section 226.52(a)(1) requires the card issuer to waive or remove fees from the account or to credit the account for an amount equal to $62.50 within a reasonable amount of time but no later than March 31 of year two.
4.
Date on which account may first be used by consumer to engage in transactions.
i.
Methods of compliance.
For purposes of § 226.52(a)(1), an account is considered open no earlier than the date on which the account may first be used by the consumer to engage in transactions. A card issuer may consider an account open for purposes of § 226.52(a)(1) on any of the following dates
A. The date the account is first used by the consumer for a transaction (such as when an account is established in connection with financing the purchase of goods or services).
B. The date the consumer complies with any reasonable activation procedures imposed by the card issuer for preventing fraud or unauthorized use of a new account (such
as requiring the consumer to provide information that verifies his or her identity), provided that the account may be used for transactions on that date.
C. The date that is seven days after the card issuer mails or delivers to the consumer account-opening disclosures that comply with § 226.6, provided that the consumer may use the account for transactions after complying with any reasonable activation procedures imposed by the card issuer for preventing fraud or unauthorized use of the new account (such as requiring the consumer to provide information that verifies his or her identity). If a card issuer has reasonable procedures designed to ensure that account-opening disclosures that comply with § 226.6 are mailed or delivered to consumers no later than a certain number of days after the card issuer establishes the account, the card issuer may add that number of days to the seven-day period for purposes of determining the date on which the account was opened.
ii.
Examples.
A. Assume that, on July 1 of year one, a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan is established in connection with financing the purchase of goods or services and a $500 transaction is charged to the account by the consumer. The card issuer may consider the account open on July 1 of year one for purposes of § 226.52(a)(1). Accordingly, § 226.52(a)(1) ceases to apply to the account on July 1 of year two.
B. Assume that, on July 1 of year one, a card issuer approves a consumer's application for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan and establishes the account on its internal systems. On July 5, the card issuer mails or delivers to the consumer account-opening disclosures that comply with § 226.6. If the consumer may use the account for transactions on the date the consumer complies with any reasonable procedures imposed by the card issuer for preventing fraud or unauthorized use, the card issuer may consider the account open on July 12 of year one for purposes of § 226.52(a)(1). Accordingly, § 226.52(a)(1) ceases to apply to the account on July 12 of year two.
C. Same facts as in paragraph B above except that the card issuer has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that account-opening disclosures that comply with § 226.6 are mailed or delivered to consumers no later than three days after an account is established on its systems. If the consumer may use the account for transactions on the date the consumer complies with any reasonable procedures imposed by the card issuer for preventing fraud or unauthorized use, the card issuer may consider the account open on July 11 of year one for purposes of § 226.52(a)(1). Accordingly, § 226.52(a)(1) ceases to apply to the account on July 11 of year two. However, if the consumer uses the account for a transaction or complies with the card issuer's reasonable procedures for preventing fraud or unauthorized use on July 8 of year one, the card issuer may, at its option, consider the account open on that date for purposes of § 226.52(a)(1) and § 226.52(a)(1) therefore ceases to apply to the account on July 8 of year two.
52(a)(2) Fees not subject to limitations.
1.
Covered fees.
Except as provided in § 226.52(a)(2), § 226.52(a) applies to any fees or other charges that a card issuer will or may require the consumer to pay with respect to a credit card account prior to account opening and during the first year after account opening, other than charges attributable to periodic interest rates. For example, § 226.52(a) applies to
i. Fees that the consumer is required to pay for the issuance or availability of credit described in § 226.5a(b)(2), including any fee based on account activity or inactivity and any fee that a consumer is required to pay in order to receive a particular credit limit;
ii. Fees for insurance described in § 226.4(b)(7) or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage described in § 226.4(b)(10) written in connection with a credit transaction, if the insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage is required by the terms of the account;
iii. Fees that the consumer is required to pay in order to engage in transactions using the account (such as cash advance fees, balance transfer fees, foreign transaction fees, and fees for using the account for purchases);
iv. Fees that the consumer is required to pay for violating the terms of the account (except to the extent specifically excluded by § 226.52(a)(2)(i));
v. Fixed finance charges; and
vi. Minimum charges imposed if a charge would otherwise have been determined by applying a periodic interest rate to a balance except for the fact that such charge is smaller than the minimum.
2.
Fees the consumer is not required to pay.
Section 226.52(a)(2)(ii) provides that § 226.52(a) does not apply to fees that the consumer is not required to pay with respect to the account. For example, § 226.52(a) generally does not apply to fees for making an expedited payment (to the extent permitted by § 226.10(e)), fees for optional services (such as travel insurance), fees for reissuing a lost or stolen card, or statement reproduction fees.
3.
Security deposits.
A security deposit that is charged to a credit card account is a fee for purposes of § 226.52(a). In contrast, however, a security deposit is not subject to the 25 percent limit in § 226.52(a)(1) if it is not charged to the account. For example, § 226.52(a)(1) does not prohibit a card issuer from requiring a consumer to provide funds at account opening pledged as security for
the account that exceed 25 percent of the credit limit at account opening so long as those funds are not obtained from the account.
52(a)(3) Rule of construction.
1.
Fees or charges otherwise prohibited by law.
Section 226.52(a) does not authorize the imposition or payment of fees or charges otherwise prohibited by law. For example, see 16 CFR 310.4(a)(4).
52(b) Limitations on penalty fees.
1.
Fees for violating the account terms or other requirements.
For purposes of § 226.52(b), a fee includes any charge imposed by a card issuer based on an act or omission that violates the terms of the account or any other requirements imposed by the card issuer with respect to the account, other than charges attributable to periodic interest rates. Accordingly, for purposes of § 226.52(b), a fee does not include charges attributable to an increase in an annual percentage rate based on an act or omission that violates the terms or other requirements of an account.
i. The following are examples of fees that are subject to the limitations in § 226.52(b) or are prohibited by § 226.52(b)
A. Late payment fees and any other fees imposed by a card issuer if an account becomes delinquent or if a payment is not received by a particular date.
B. Returned payment fees and any other fees imposed by a card issuer if a payment received via check, automated clearing house, or other payment method is returned.
C. Any fee or charge for an over-the-limit transaction as defined in § 226.56(a), to the extent the imposition of such a fee or charge is permitted by § 226.56.
D. Any fee imposed by a card issuer if payment on a check that accesses a credit card account is declined.
E. Any fee or charge for a transaction that the card issuer declines to authorize.
See
§ 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B).
F. Any fee imposed by a card issuer based on account inactivity (including the consumer's failure to use the account for a particular number or dollar amount of transactions or a particular type of transaction).
See
§ 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B).
G. Any fee imposed by a card issuer based on the closure or termination of an account.
See
§ 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B).
ii. The following are examples of fees to which § 226.52(b) does not apply
A. Balance transfer fees.
B. Cash advance fees.
C. Foreign transaction fees.
D. Annual fees and other fees for the issuance or availability of credit described in § 226.5a(b)(2), except to the extent that such fees are based on account inactivity.
See
§ 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B).
E. Fees for insurance described in § 226.4(b)(7) or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage described in § 226.4(b)(10) written in connection with a credit transaction, provided that such fees are not imposed as a result of a violation of the account terms or other requirements of an account.
F. Fees for making an expedited payment (to the extent permitted by § 226.10(e)).
G. Fees for optional services (such as travel insurance).
H. Fees for reissuing a lost or stolen card.
2.
Rounding to nearest whole dollar.
A card issuer may round any fee that complies with § 226.52(b) to the nearest whole dollar. For example, if § 226.52(b) permits a card issuer to impose a late payment fee of $21.50, the card issuer may round that amount up to the nearest whole dollar and impose a late payment fee of $22. However, if the late payment fee permitted by § 226.52(b) were $21.49, the card issuer would not be permitted to round that amount up to $22, although the card issuer could round that amount down and impose a late payment fee of $21.
52(b)(1) General rule.
1.
Relationship between § 226.52(b)(1)(i), (b)(1)(ii), and (b)(2).
i.
Relationship between § 226.52(b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii).
A card issuer may impose a fee for violating the terms or other requirements of an account pursuant to either § 226.52(b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii).
A. A card issuer that complies with the safe harbors in § 226.52(b)(1)(ii) is not required to determine that its fees represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of a type of violation under § 226.52(b)(1)(i).
B. A card issuer may impose a fee for one type of violation pursuant to § 226.52(b)(1)(i) and may impose a fee for a different type of violation pursuant to § 226.52(b)(1)(ii). For example, a card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $30 based on a cost determination pursuant to § 226.52(b)(1)(i) but impose returned payment and over-the-limit fees of $25 or $35 pursuant to the safe harbors in § 226.52(b)(1)(ii).
C. A card issuer that previously based the amount of a penalty fee for a particular type of violation on a cost determination pursuant to § 226.52(b)(1)(i) may begin to impose a penalty fee for that type of violation that is consistent with § 226.52(b)(1)(ii) at any time (subject to the notice requirements in § 226.9), provided that the first fee imposed pursuant to § 226.52(b)(1)(ii) is consistent with § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A). For example, assume that a late payment occurs on January 15 and that, based on a cost determination pursuant to § 226.52(b)(1)(i), the card issuer imposes a $30 late payment fee. Another late payment occurs on July 15. The card issuer may impose another $30 late payment fee pursuant to § 226.52(b)(1)(i) or may impose a $25 late payment fee pursuant to § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A). However, the card issuer may not impose a $35 late payment fee pursuant to
§ 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B). If the card issuer imposes a $25 fee pursuant to § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) for the July 15 late payment and another late payment occurs on September 15, the card issuer may impose a $35 fee for the September 15 late payment pursuant to § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B).
ii.
Relationship between § 226.52(b)(1) and (b)(2).
Section 226.52(b)(1) does not permit a card issuer to impose a fee that is inconsistent with the prohibitions in § 226.52(b)(2). For example, if § 226.52(b)(2)(i) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a late payment fee that exceeds $15, § 226.52(b)(1)(ii) does not permit the card issuer to impose a higher late payment fee.
52(b)(1)(i) Fees based on costs.
1.
Costs incurred as a result of violations.
Section 226.52(b)(1)(i) does not require a card issuer to base a fee on the costs incurred as a result of a specific violation of the terms or other requirements of an account. Instead, for purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(i), a card issuer must have determined that a fee for violating the terms or other requirements of an account represents a reasonable proportion of the costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of that type of violation. A card issuer may make a single determination for all of its credit card portfolios or may make separate determinations for each portfolio. The factors relevant to this determination include
i. The number of violations of a particular type experienced by the card issuer during a prior period of reasonable length (for example, a period of twelve months).
ii. The costs incurred by the card issuer during that period as a result of those violations.
iii. At the card issuer's option, the number of fees imposed by the card issuer as a result of those violations during that period that the card issuer reasonably estimates it will be unable to collect.
See
comment 52(b)(1)(i)-5.
iv. At the card issuer's option, reasonable estimates for an upcoming period of changes in the number of violations of that type, the resulting costs, and the number of fees that the card issuer will be unable to collect.
See
illustrative examples in comments 52(b)(1)(i)-6 through -9.
2.
Amounts excluded from cost analysis.
The following amounts are not costs incurred by a card issuer as a result of violations of the terms or other requirements of an account for purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(i)
i. Losses and associated costs (including the cost of holding reserves against potential losses and the cost of funding delinquent accounts).
ii. Costs associated with evaluating whether consumers who have not violated the terms or other requirements of an account are likely to do so in the future (such as the costs associated with underwriting new accounts). However, once a violation of the terms or other requirements of an account has occurred, the costs associated with preventing additional violations for a reasonable period of time are costs incurred by a card issuer as a result of violations of the terms or other requirements of an account for purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(i).
3.
Third party charges.
As a general matter, amounts charged to the card issuer by a third party as a result of a violation of the terms or other requirements of an account are costs incurred by the card issuer for purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(i). For example, if a card issuer is charged a specific amount by a third party for each returned payment, that amount is a cost incurred by the card issuer as a result of returned payments. However, if the amount is charged to the card issuer by an affiliate or subsidiary of the card issuer, the card issuer must have determined that the charge represents a reasonable proportion of the costs incurred by the affiliate or subsidiary as a result of the type of violation. For example, if an affiliate of a card issuer provides collection services to the card issuer on delinquent accounts, the card issuer must have determined that the amounts charged to the card issuer by the affiliate for such services represent a reasonable proportion of the costs incurred by the affiliate as a result of late payments.
4.
Amounts charged by other card issuers.
The fact that a card issuer's fees for violating the terms or other requirements of an account are comparable to fees assessed by other card issuers does not satisfy the requirements of § 226.52(b)(1)(i).
5.
Uncollected fees.
For purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(i), a card issuer may consider fees that it is unable to collect when determining the appropriate fee amount. Fees that the card issuer is unable to collect include fees imposed on accounts that have been charged off by the card issuer, fees that have been discharged in bankruptcy, and fees that the card issuer is required to waive in order to comply with a legal requirement (such as a requirement imposed by 12 CFR part 226 or 50 U.S.C. app. 527). However, fees that the card issuer chooses not to impose or chooses not to collect (such as fees the card issuer chooses to waive at the request of the consumer or under a workout or temporary hardship arrangement) are not relevant for purposes of this determination.
See
illustrative examples in comments 52(b)(2)(i)-6 through -9.
6.
Late payment fees.
i.
Costs incurred as a result of late payments.
For purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(i), the costs incurred by a card issuer as a result of late payments include the costs associated with the collection of late payments, such as the costs associated with notifying consumers of delinquencies and resolving delinquencies (including the
establishment of workout and temporary hardship arrangements).
ii.
Examples.
A. Late payment fee based on past delinquencies and costs. Assume that, during year one, a card issuer experienced 1 million delinquencies and incurred $26 million in costs as a result of those delinquencies. For purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(i), a $26 late payment fee would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of late payments during year two.
B. Adjustment based on fees card issuer is unable to collect. Same facts as above except that the card issuer imposed a late payment fee for each of the 1 million delinquencies experienced during year one but was unable to collect 25% of those fees (in other words, the card issuer was unable to collect 250,000 fees, leaving a total of 750,000 late payments for which the card issuer did collect or could have collected a fee). For purposes of § 226.52(b)(2)(i), a late payment fee of $35 would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of late payments during year two.
C. Adjustment based on reasonable estimate of future changes. Same facts as paragraphs A. and B. above except the card issuer reasonably estimates that—based on past delinquency rates and other factors relevant to potential delinquency rates for year two—it will experience a 2% decrease in delinquencies during year two (in other words, 20,000 fewer delinquencies for a total of 980,000). The card issuer also reasonably estimates that it will be unable to collect the same percentage of fees (25%) during year two as during year one (in other words, the card issuer will be unable to collect 245,000 fees, leaving a total of 735,000 late payments for which the card issuer will be able to collect a fee). The card issuer also reasonably estimates that—based on past changes in costs incurred as a result of delinquencies and other factors relevant to potential costs for year two—it will experience a 5% increase in costs during year two (in other words, $1.3 million in additional costs for a total of $27.3 million). For purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(i), a $37 late payment fee would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of late payments during year two.
7.
Returned payment fees.
i.
Costs incurred as a result of returned payments.
For purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(i), the costs incurred by a card issuer as a result of returned payments include
A. Costs associated with processing returned payments and reconciling the card issuer's systems and accounts to reflect returned payments;
B. Costs associated with investigating potential fraud with respect to returned payments; and
C. Costs associated with notifying the consumer of the returned payment and arranging for a new payment.
ii.
Examples.
A. Returned payment fee based on past returns and costs. Assume that, during year one, a card issuer experienced 150,000 returned payments and incurred $3.1 million in costs as a result of those returned payments. For purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(i), a $21 returned payment fee would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of returned payments during year two.
B. Adjustment based on fees card issuer is unable to collect. Same facts as above except that the card issuer imposed a returned payment fee for each of the 150,000 returned payments experienced during year one but was unable to collect 15% of those fees (in other words, the card issuer was unable to collect 22,500 fees, leaving a total of 127,500 returned payments for which the card issuer did collect or could have collected a fee). For purposes of § 226.52(b)(2)(i), a returned payment fee of $24 would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of returned payments during year two.
C. Adjustment based on reasonable estimate of future changes. Same facts as paragraphs A. and B. above except the card issuer reasonably estimates that—based on past returned payment rates and other factors relevant to potential returned payment rates for year two—it will experience a 2% increase in returned payments during year two (in other words, 3,000 additional returned payments for a total of 153,000). The card issuer also reasonably estimates that it will be unable to collect 25% of returned payment fees during year two (in other words, the card issuer will be unable to collect 38,250 fees, leaving a total of 114,750 returned payments for which the card issuer will be able to collect a fee). The card issuer also reasonably estimates that—based on past changes in costs incurred as a result of returned payments and other factors relevant to potential costs for year two—it will experience a 1% decrease in costs during year two (in other words, a $31,000 reduction in costs for a total of $3.069 million). For purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(i), a $27 returned payment fee would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of returned payments during year two.
8.
Over-the-limit fees.
i.
Costs incurred as a result of over-the-limit transactions.
For purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(i), the costs incurred by a card issuer as a result of over-the-limit transactions include
A. Costs associated with determining whether to authorize over-the-limit transactions; and
B. Costs associated with notifying the consumer that the credit limit has been exceeded and arranging for payments to reduce the balance below the credit limit.
ii.
Costs not incurred as a result of over-the-limit transactions.
For purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(i), costs associated with obtaining the affirmative consent of consumers to the card issuer's payment of transactions that exceed the credit limit consistent with § 226.56 are not costs incurred by a card issuer as a result of over-the-limit transactions.
iii.
Examples.
A. Over-the-limit fee based on past fees and costs. Assume that, during year one, a card issuer authorized 600,000 over-the-limit transactions and incurred $4.5 million in costs as a result of those over-the-limit transactions. However, because of the affirmative consent requirements in § 226.56, the card issuer was only permitted to impose 200,000 over-the-limit fees during year one. For purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(i), a $23 over-the-limit fee would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of over-the-limit transactions during year two.
B. Adjustment based on fees card issuer is unable to collect. Same facts as above except that the card issuer was unable to collect 30% of the 200,000 over-the-limit fees imposed during year one (in other words, the card issuer was unable to collect 60,000 fees, leaving a total of 140,000 over-the-limit transactions for which the card issuer did collect or could have collected a fee). For purposes of § 226.52(b)(2)(i), an over-the-limit fee of $32 would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of over-the-limit transactions during year two.
C. Adjustment based on reasonable estimate of future changes. Same facts as paragraphs A. and B. above except the card issuer reasonably estimates that—based on past over-the-limit transaction rates, the percentages of over-the-limit transactions that resulted in an over-the-limit fee in the past (consistent with § 226.56), and factors relevant to potential changes in those rates and percentages for year two—it will authorize approximately the same number of over-the-limit transactions during year two (600,000) and impose approximately the same number of over-the-limit fees (200,000). The card issuer also reasonably estimates that it will be unable to collect the same percentage of fees (30%) during year two as during year one (in other words, the card issuer was unable to collect 60,000 fees, leaving a total of 140,000 over-the-limit transactions for which the card issuer will be able to collect a fee). The card issuer also reasonably estimates that—based on past changes in costs incurred as a result of over-the-limit transactions and other factors relevant to potential costs for year two—it will experience a 6% decrease in costs during year two (in other words, a $270,000 reduction in costs for a total of $4.23 million). For purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(i), a $30 over-the-limit fee would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of over-the-limit transactions during year two.
9.
Declined access check fees.
i.
Costs incurred as a result of declined access checks.
For purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(i), the costs incurred by a card issuer as a result of declining payment on a check that accesses a credit card account include
A. Costs associated with determining whether to decline payment on access checks;
B. Costs associated with processing declined access checks and reconciling the card issuer's systems and accounts to reflect declined access checks;
C. Costs associated with investigating potential fraud with respect to declined access checks; and
D. Costs associated with notifying the consumer and the merchant or other party that accepted the access check that payment on the check has been declined.
ii.
Example.
Assume that, during year one, a card issuer declined 100,000 access checks and incurred $2 million in costs as a result of those declined checks. The card issuer imposed a fee for each declined access check but was unable to collect 10% of those fees (in other words, the card issuer was unable to collect 10,000 fees, leaving a total of 90,000 declined access checks for which the card issuer did collect or could have collected a fee). For purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(i), a $22 declined access check fee would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of declined access checks during year two.
52(b)(1)(ii) Safe harbors.
1.
Multiple violations of same type.
i.
Same billing cycle or next six billing cycles.
A card issuer cannot impose a fee for a violation pursuant to § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B) unless a fee has previously been imposed for the same type of violation pursuant to § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A). Once a fee has been imposed for a violation pursuant to § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A), the card issuer may impose a fee pursuant to § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B) for any subsequent violation of the same type until that type of violation has not occurred for a period of six consecutive complete billing cycles. A fee has been imposed for purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(ii) even if the card issuer waives or rebates all or part of the fee.
A.
Late payments.
For purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(ii), a late payment occurs during the billing cycle in which the payment may first be treated as late consistent with the requirements of 12 CFR Part 226 and the terms or other requirements of the account.
B.
Returned payments.
For purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(ii), a returned payment occurs
during the billing cycle in which the payment is returned to the card issuer.
C.
Transactions that exceed the credit limit.
For purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(ii), a transaction that exceeds the credit limit for an account occurs during the billing cycle in which the transaction occurs or is authorized by the card issuer.
D.
Declined access checks.
For purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(ii), a check that accesses a credit card account is declined during the billing cycle in which the card issuer declines payment on the check.
ii.
Relationship to §§ 226.52(b)(2)(ii) and 226.56(j)(1).
If multiple violations are based on the same event or transaction such that § 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing more than one fee, the event or transaction constitutes a single violation for purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(ii). Furthermore, consistent with § 226.56(j)(1)(i), no more than one violation for exceeding an account's credit limit can occur during a single billing cycle for purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(ii). However, § 226.52(b)(2)(ii) does not prohibit a card issuer from imposing fees for exceeding the credit limit in consecutive billing cycles based on the same over-the-limit transaction to the extent permitted by § 226.56(j)(1). In these circumstances, the second and third over-the-limit fees permitted by § 226.56(j)(1) may be imposed pursuant to § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B).
See
comment 52(b)(2)(ii)-1.
iii.
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B) with respect to credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan that are not charge card accounts. For purposes of these examples, assume that the billing cycles for the account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the payment due date for the account is the twenty-fifth day of the month.
A.
Violations of same type (late payments).
A required minimum periodic payment of $50 is due on March 25. On March 26, a late payment has occurred because no payment has been received. Accordingly, consistent with § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A), the card issuer imposes a $25 late payment fee on March 26. In order for the card issuer to impose a $35 late payment fee pursuant to § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), a second late payment must occur during the April, May, June, July, August, or September billing cycles.
(1) The card issuer does not receive any payment during the March billing cycle. A required minimum periodic payment of $100 is due on April 25. On April 20, the card issuer receives a $50 payment. No further payment is received during the April billing cycle. Accordingly, consistent with § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), the card issuer may impose a $35 late payment fee on April 26. Furthermore, the card issuer may impose a $35 late payment fee for any late payment that occurs during the May, June, July, August, September, or October billing cycles.
(2) Same facts as in paragraph A. above. On March 30, the card issuer receives a $50 payment and the required minimum periodic payments for the April, May, June, July, August, and September billing cycles are received on or before the payment due date. A required minimum periodic payment of $60 is due on October 25. On October 26, a late payment has occurred because the required minimum periodic payment due on October 25 has not been received. However, because this late payment did not occur during the six billing cycles following the March billing cycle, § 226.52(b)(1)(ii) only permits the card issuer to impose a late payment fee of $25.
B.
Violations of different types (late payment and over the credit limit).
The credit limit for an account is $1,000. Consistent with § 226.56, the consumer has affirmatively consented to the payment of transactions that exceed the credit limit. A required minimum periodic payment of $30 is due on August 25. On August 26, a late payment has occurred because no payment has been received. Accordingly, consistent with § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A), the card issuer imposes a $25 late payment fee on August 26. On August 30, the card issuer receives a $30 payment. On September 10, a transaction causes the account balance to increase to $1,150, which exceeds the account's $1,000 credit limit. On September 11, a second transaction increases the account balance to $1,350. On September 23, the card issuer receives the $50 required minimum periodic payment due on September 25, which reduces the account balance to $1,300. On September 30, the card issuer imposes a $25 over-the-limit fee, consistent with § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A). On October 26, a late payment has occurred because the $60 required minimum periodic payment due on October 25 has not been received. Accordingly, consistent with § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), the card issuer imposes a $35 late payment fee on October 26.
C.
Violations of different types (late payment and returned payment).
A required minimum periodic payment of $50 is due on July 25. On July 26, a late payment has occurred because no payment has been received. Accordingly, consistent with § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A), the card issuer imposes a $25 late payment fee on July 26. On July 30, the card issuer receives a $50 payment. A required minimum periodic payment of $50 is due on August 25. On August 24, a $50 payment is received. On August 27, the $50 payment is returned to the card issuer for insufficient funds. In these circumstances, § 226.52(b)(2)(ii) permits the card issuer to impose either a late payment fee or a returned payment fee but not both because the late payment and the returned payment result from the same event or transaction. Accordingly, for purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(ii), the event or transaction constitutes a single
violation. However, if the card issuer imposes a late payment fee, § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B) permits the issuer to impose a fee of $35 because the late payment occurred during the six billing cycles following the July billing cycle. In contrast, if the card issuer imposes a returned payment fee, the amount of the fee may be no more than $25 pursuant to § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A).
2.
Adjustments based on Consumer Price Index.
For purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B), the Board shall calculate each year price level adjusted amounts using the Consumer Price Index in effect on June 1 of that year. When the cumulative change in the adjusted minimum value derived from applying the annual Consumer Price level to the current amounts in § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B) has risen by a whole dollar, those amounts will be increased by $1.00. Similarly, when the cumulative change in the adjusted minimum value derived from applying the annual Consumer Price level to the current amounts in § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B) has decreased by a whole dollar, those amounts will be decreased by $1.00. The Board will publish adjustments to the amounts in § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B).
3.
Delinquent balance for charge card accounts.
Section 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(C) provides that, when a charge card issuer that requires payment of outstanding balances in full at the end of each billing cycle has not received the required payment for two or more consecutive billing cycles, the card issuer may impose a late payment fee that does not exceed three percent of the delinquent balance. For purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(C), the delinquent balance is any previously billed amount that remains unpaid at the time the late payment fee is imposed pursuant to § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(C). Consistent with § 226.52(b)(2)(ii), a charge card issuer that imposes a fee pursuant to § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(C) with respect to a late payment may not impose a fee pursuant to § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B) with respect to the same late payment. The following examples illustrate the application of § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(C)
i. Assume that a charge card issuer requires payment of outstanding balances in full at the end of each billing cycle and that the billing cycles for the account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month. At the end of the June billing cycle, the account has a balance of $1,000. On July 5, the card issuer provides a periodic statement disclosing the $1,000 balance consistent with § 226.7. During the July billing cycle, the account is used for $300 in transactions, increasing the balance to $1,300. At the end of the July billing cycle, no payment has been received and the card issuer imposes a $25 late payment fee consistent with § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A). On August 5, the card issuer provides a periodic statement disclosing the $1,325 balance consistent with § 226.7. During the August billing cycle, the account is used for $200 in transactions, increasing the balance to $1,525. At the end of the August billing cycle, no payment has been received. Consistent with § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(C), the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $40, which is 3% of the $1,325 balance that was due at the end of the August billing cycle. Section 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(C) does not permit the card issuer to include the $200 in transactions that occurred during the August billing cycle.
ii. Same facts as above except that, on August 25, a $100 payment is received. Consistent with § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(C), the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $37, which is 3% of the unpaid portion of the $1,325 balance that was due at the end of the August billing cycle ($1,225).
iii. Same facts as in paragraph A. above except that, on August 25, a $200 payment is received. Consistent with § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(C), the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $34, which is 3% of the unpaid portion of the $1,325 balance that was due at the end of the August billing cycle ($1,125). In the alternative, the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $35 consistent with § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B). However, § 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing both fees.
52(b)(2) Prohibited fees.
1.
Relationship to § 226.52(b)(1).
A card issuer does not comply with § 226.52(b) if it imposes a fee that is inconsistent with the prohibitions in § 226.52(b)(2). Thus, the prohibitions in § 226.52(b)(2) apply even if a fee is consistent with § 226.52(b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii). For example, even if a card issuer has determined for purposes of § 226.52(b)(1)(i) that a $27 fee represents a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of a particular type of violation, § 226.52(b)(2)(i) prohibits the card issuer from imposing that fee if the dollar amount associated with the violation is less than $27. Similarly, even if § 226.52(b)(1)(ii) permits a card issuer to impose a $25 fee, § 226.52(b)(2)(i) prohibits the card issuer from imposing that fee if the dollar amount associated with the violation is less than $25.
52(b)(2)(i) Fees that exceed dollar amount associated with violation.
1.
Late payment fees.
For purposes of § 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with a late payment is the amount of the required minimum periodic payment due immediately prior to assessment of the late payment fee. Thus, § 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits a card issuer from imposing a late payment fee that exceeds the amount of that required minimum periodic payment. For example
i. Assume that a $15 required minimum periodic payment is due on September 25.
The card issuer does not receive any payment on or before September 25. On September 26, the card issuer imposes a late payment fee. For purposes of § 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the late payment is the amount of the required minimum periodic payment due on September 25 ($15). Thus, under § 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A), the amount of that fee cannot exceed $15 (even if a higher fee would be permitted under § 226.52(b)(1)).
ii. Same facts as above except that, on September 25, the card issuer receives a $10 payment. No further payments are received. On September 26, the card issuer imposes a late payment fee. For purposes of § 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the late payment is the full amount of the required minimum periodic payment due on September 25 ($15), rather than the unpaid portion of that payment ($5). Thus, under § 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A), the amount of the late payment fee cannot exceed $15 (even if a higher fee would be permitted under § 226.52(b)(1)).
iii. Assume that a $15 required minimum periodic payment is due on October 28 and the billing cycle for the account closes on October 31. The card issuer does not receive any payment on or before November 3. On November 3, the card issuer determines that the required minimum periodic payment due on November 28 is $50. On November 5, the card issuer imposes a late payment fee. For purposes of § 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the late payment is the amount of the required minimum periodic payment due on October 28 ($15), rather than the amount of the required minimum periodic payment due on November 28 ($50). Thus, under § 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A), the amount of that fee cannot exceed $15 (even if a higher fee would be permitted under § 226.52(b)(1)).
2.
Returned payment fees.
For purposes of § 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with a returned payment is the amount of the required minimum periodic payment due immediately prior to the date on which the payment is returned to the card issuer. Thus, § 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits a card issuer from imposing a returned payment fee that exceeds the amount of that required minimum periodic payment. However, if a payment has been returned and is submitted again for payment by the card issuer, there is no additional dollar amount associated with a subsequent return of that payment and § 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B) prohibits the card issuer from imposing an additional returned payment fee. For example
i. Assume that the billing cycles for an account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the payment due date is the twenty-fifth day of the month. A minimum payment of $15 is due on March 25. The card issuer receives a check for $100 on March 23, which is returned to the card issuer for insufficient funds on March 26. For purposes of § 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the returned payment is the amount of the required minimum periodic payment due on March 25 ($15). Thus, § 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a returned payment fee that exceeds $15 (even if a higher fee would be permitted under § 226.52(b)(1)). Furthermore, § 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from assessing both a late payment fee and a returned payment fee in these circumstances.
See
comment 52(b)(2)(ii)-1.
ii. Same facts as above except that the card issuer receives the $100 check on March 31 and the check is returned for insufficient funds on April 2. The minimum payment due on April 25 is $30. For purposes of § 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the returned payment is the amount of the required minimum periodic payment due on March 25 ($15), rather than the amount of the required minimum periodic payment due on April 25 ($30). Thus, § 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a returned payment fee that exceeds $15 (even if a higher fee would be permitted under § 226.52(b)(1)). Furthermore, § 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from assessing both a late payment fee and a returned payment fee in these circumstances.
See
comment 52(b)(2)(ii)-1.
iii. Same facts as paragraph i. above except that, on March 28, the card issuer presents the $100 check for payment a second time. On April 1, the check is again returned for insufficient funds. Section 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a returned payment fee based on the return of the payment on April 1.
iv. Assume that the billing cycles for an account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the payment due date is the twenty-fifth day of the month. A minimum payment of $15 is due on August 25. The card issuer receives a check for $15 on August 23, which is not returned. The card issuer receives a check for $50 on September 5, which is returned to the card issuer for insufficient funds on September 7. Section 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B) does not prohibit the card issuer from imposing a returned payment fee in these circumstances. Instead, for purposes of § 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the returned payment is the amount of the required minimum periodic payment due on August 25 ($15). Thus, § 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a returned payment fee that exceeds $15 (even if a higher fee would be permitted under § 226.52(b)(1)).
3.
Over-the-limit fees.
For purposes of § 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with extensions of credit in excess of the credit limit for an account is the total
amount of credit extended by the card issuer in excess of the credit limit during the billing cycle in which the over-the-limit fee is imposed. Thus, § 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits a card issuer from imposing an over-the-limit fee that exceeds that amount. Nothing in § 226.52(b) permits a card issuer to impose an over-the-limit fee if imposition of the fee is inconsistent with § 226.56. The following examples illustrate the application of § 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A) to over-the-limit fees
i. Assume that the billing cycles for a credit card account with a credit limit of $5,000 begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month. Assume also that, consistent with § 226.56, the consumer has affirmatively consented to the payment of transactions that exceed the credit limit. On March 1, the account has a $4,950 balance. On March 6, a $60 transaction is charged to the account, increasing the balance to $5,010. On March 25, a $5 transaction is charged to the account, increasing the balance to $5,015. On the last day of the billing cycle (March 31), the card issuer imposes an over-the-limit fee. For purposes of § 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the extensions of credit in excess of the credit limit is the total amount of credit extended by the card issuer in excess of the credit limit during the March billing cycle ($15). Thus, § 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits the card issuer from imposing an over-the-limit fee that exceeds $15 (even if a higher fee would be permitted under § 226.52(b)(1)).
ii. Same facts as above except that, on March 26, the card issuer receives a payment of $20, reducing the balance below the credit limit to $4,995. Nevertheless, for purposes of § 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the extensions of credit in excess of the credit limit is the total amount of credit extended by the card issuer in excess of the credit limit during the March billing cycle ($15). Thus, consistent with § 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose an over-the-limit fee of $15.
4.
Declined access check fees.
For purposes of § 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with declining payment on a check that accesses a credit card account is the amount of the check. Thus, when a check that accesses a credit card account is declined, § 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits a card issuer from imposing a fee that exceeds the amount of that check. For example, assume that a check that accesses a credit card account is used as payment for a $50 transaction, but payment on the check is declined by the card issuer because the transaction would have exceeded the credit limit for the account. For purposes of § 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the declined check is the amount of the check ($50). Thus, § 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a fee that exceeds $50. However, the amount of this fee must also comply with § 226.52(b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii).
5.
Inactivity fees.
Section 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(
2
) prohibits a card issuer from imposing a fee with respect to a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan based on inactivity on that account (including the consumer's failure to use the account for a particular number or dollar amount of transactions or a particular type of transaction). For example, § 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(
2
) prohibits a card issuer from imposing a $50 fee when a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan is not used for at least $2,000 in purchases over the course of a year. Similarly, § 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(
2
) prohibits a card issuer from imposing a $50 annual fee on all accounts of a particular type but waiving the fee on any account that is used for at least $2,000 in purchases over the course of a year if the card issuer promotes the waiver or rebate of the annual fee for purposes of § 226.55(e). However, if the card issuer does not promote the waiver or rebate of the annual fee for purposes of § 226.55(e), § 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(
2
) does not prohibit a card issuer from considering account activity along with other factors when deciding whether to waive or rebate annual fees on individual accounts (such as in response to a consumer's request).
6.
Closed account fees.
Section 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(
3
) prohibits a card issuer from imposing a fee based on the closure or termination of an account. For example, 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(
3
) prohibits a card issuer from
i. Imposing a one-time fee to consumers who close their accounts.
ii. Imposing a periodic fee (such as an annual fee, a monthly maintenance fee, or a closed account fee) after an account is closed or terminated if that fee was not imposed prior to closure or termination. This prohibition applies even if the fee was disclosed prior to closure or termination.
See also
comment 55(d)-1.
iii. Increasing a periodic fee (such as an annual fee or a monthly maintenance fee) after an account is closed or terminated. However, a card issuer is not prohibited from continuing to impose a periodic fee that was imposed before the account was closed or terminated.
52(b)(2)(ii) Multiple fees based on single event or transaction.
1.
Single event or transaction.
Section 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits a card issuer from imposing more than one fee for violating the terms or other requirements of an account based on a single event or transaction. If § 226.56(j)(1) permits a card issuer to impose fees for exceeding the credit limit in consecutive billing cycles based on the same over-the-limit transaction, those fees are not based on a single event or transaction for
purposes of § 226.52(b)(2)(ii). The following examples illustrate the application of § 226.52(b)(2)(ii). Assume for purposes of these examples that the billing cycles for a credit card account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the payment due date for the account is the twenty-fifth day of the month.
i. Assume that the required minimum periodic payment due on March 25 is $20. On March 26, the card issuer has not received any payment and imposes a late payment fee. Consistent with §§ 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i), the card issuer may impose a $20 late payment fee on March 26. However, § 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing an additional late payment fee if the $20 minimum payment has not been received by a subsequent date (such as March 31).
A. On April 3, the card issuer provides a periodic statement disclosing that a $70 required minimum periodic payment is due on April 25. This minimum payment includes the $20 minimum payment due on March 25 and the $20 late payment fee imposed on March 26. On April 20, the card issuer receives a $20 payment. No additional payments are received during the April billing cycle. Section 226.52(b)(2)(ii) does not prohibit the card issuer from imposing a late payment fee based on the consumer's failure to make the $70 required minimum periodic payment on or before April 25. Accordingly, consistent with § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B) and (b)(2)(i), the card issuer may impose a $35 late payment fee on April 26.
B. On April 3, the card issuer provides a periodic statement disclosing that a $20 required minimum periodic payment is due on April 25. This minimum payment does not include the $20 minimum payment due on March 25 or the $20 late payment fee imposed on March 26. On April 20, the card issuer receives a $20 payment. No additional payments are received during the April billing cycle. Because the card issuer has received the required minimum periodic payment due on April 25 and because § 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a second late payment fee based on the consumer's failure to make the $20 minimum payment due on March 25, the card issuer cannot impose a late payment fee in these circumstances.
ii. Assume that the required minimum periodic payment due on March 25 is $30.
A. On March 25, the card issuer receives a check for $50, but the check is returned for insufficient funds on March 27. Consistent with §§ 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $25 or a returned payment fee of $25. However, § 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing both fees because those fees would be based on a single event or transaction.
B. Same facts as paragraph ii.A. above except that that card issuer receives the $50 check on March 27 and the check is returned for insufficient funds on March 29. Consistent with §§ 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $25 or a returned payment fee of $25. However, § 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing both fees because those fees would be based on a single event or transaction. If no payment is received on or before the next payment due date (April 25), § 226.52(b)(2)(ii) does not prohibit the card issuer from imposing a late payment fee.
iii. Assume that the required minimum periodic payment due on July 25 is $30. On July 10, the card issuer receives a $50 payment, which is not returned. On July 20, the card issuer receives a $100 payment, which is returned for insufficient funds on July 24. Consistent with § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose a returned payment fee of $25. Nothing in § 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the imposition of this fee.
iv. Assume that the credit limit for an account is $1,000 and that, consistent with § 226.56, the consumer has affirmatively consented to the payment of transactions that exceed the credit limit. On March 31, the balance on the account is $970 and the card issuer has not received the $35 required minimum periodic payment due on March 25. On that same date (March 31), a $70 transaction is charged to the account, which increases the balance to $1,040. Consistent with § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $25 and an over-the-limit fee of $25. Section 226.52(b)(2)(ii) does not prohibit the imposition of both fees because those fees are based on different events or transactions. No additional transactions are charged to the account during the March, April, or May billing cycles. If the account balance remains more than $35 above the credit limit on April 26, the card issuer may impose an over-the-limit fee of $35 pursuant to § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), to the extent consistent with § 226.56(j)(1). Furthermore, if the account balance remains more than $35 above the credit limit on May 26, the card issuer may again impose an over-the-limit fee of $35 pursuant to § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), to the extent consistent with § 226.56(j)(1). Thereafter, § 226.56(j)(1) does not permit the card issuer to impose additional over-the-limit fees unless another over-the-limit transaction occurs. However, if an over-the-limit transaction occurs during the six billing cycles following the May billing cycle, the card issuer may impose an over-the-limit fee of $35 pursuant to § 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B).
v. Assume that the credit limit for an account is $5,000 and that, consistent with § 226.56, the consumer has affirmatively consented to the payment of transactions that
exceed the credit limit. On July 23, the balance on the account is $4,950. On July 24, the card issuer receives the $100 required minimum periodic payment due on July 25, reducing the balance to $4,850. On July 26, a $75 transaction is charged to the account, which increases the balance to $4,925. On July 27, the $100 payment is returned for insufficient funds, increasing the balance to $5,025. Consistent with §§ 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose a returned payment fee of $25 or an over-the-limit fee of $25. However, § 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing both fees because those fees would be based on a single event or transaction.
vi. Assume that the required minimum periodic payment due on March 25 is $50. On March 20, the card issuer receives a check for $50, but the check is returned for insufficient funds on March 22. Consistent with §§ 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose a returned payment fee of $25. On March 25, the card issuer receives a second check for $50, but the check is returned for insufficient funds on March 27. Consistent with §§ 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A), (b)(1)(ii)(B), and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $25 or a returned payment fee of $35. However, § 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing both fees because those fees would be based on a single event or transaction.
vii. Assume that the required minimum periodic payment due on February 25 is $100. On February 25, the card issuer receives a check for $100. On March 3, the card issuer provides a periodic statement disclosing that a $120 required minimum periodic payment is due on March 25. On March 4, the $100 check is returned to the card issuer for insufficient funds. Consistent with §§ 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $25 or a returned payment fee of $25 with respect to the $100 payment. However, § 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing both fees because those fees would be based on a single event or transaction. On March 20, the card issuer receives a $120 check, which is not returned. No additional payments are received during the March billing cycle. Because the card issuer has received the required minimum periodic payment due on March 25 and because § 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a second fee based on the $100 payment that was returned for insufficient funds, the card issuer cannot impose a late payment fee in these circumstances.

# Section 226.53—Allocation of Payments
1.
Required minimum periodic payment.
Section 226.53 addresses the allocation of amounts paid by the consumer in excess of the minimum periodic payment required by the card issuer. Section 226.53 does not limit or otherwise address the card issuer's ability to determine, consistent with applicable law and regulatory guidance, the amount of the required minimum periodic payment or how that payment is allocated. A card issuer may, but is not required to, allocate the required minimum periodic payment consistent with the requirements in § 226.53 to the extent consistent with other applicable law or regulatory guidance.
2.
Applicable rates and balances.
Section 226.53 permits a card issuer to allocate an amount paid by the consumer in excess of the required minimum periodic payment based on the annual percentage rates and balances on the day the preceding billing cycle ends, on the day the payment is credited to the account, or on any day in between those two dates. The day used by the card issuer to determine the applicable annual percentage rates and balances for purposes of § 226.53 generally must be consistent from billing cycle to billing cycle, although the card issuer may adjust this day from time to time. For example:
i. Assume that the billing cycles for a credit card account start on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month. On the date the March billing cycle ends (March 31), the account has a purchase balance of $500 at a promotional annual percentage rate of 5% and another purchase balance of $200 at a non-promotional annual percentage rate of 15%. On April 5, a $100 purchase to which the 15% rate applies is charged to the account. On April 15, the promotional rate expires and § 226.55(b)(1) permits the card issuer to increase the rate that applies to the $500 balance from 5% to 18%. On April 25, the card issuer credits to the account $400 paid by the consumer in excess of the required minimum periodic payment. If the card issuer's practice is to allocate payments based on the rates and balances on the last day of the prior billing cycle, the card issuer would allocate the $400 payment to pay in full the $200 balance to which the 15% rate applied on March 31 and then allocate the remaining $200 to the $500 balance to which the 5% rate applied on March 31. In the alternative, if the card issuer's practice is to allocate payments based on the rates and balances on the day a payment is credited to the account, the card issuer would allocate the $400 payment to the $500 balance to which the 18% rate applied on April 25.
ii. Same facts as above except that, on April 25, the card issuer credits to the account $750 paid by the consumer in excess of the required minimum periodic payment. If the card issuer's practice is to allocate payments based on the rates and balances on the last day of the prior billing cycle, the card issuer would allocate the $750 payment to pay in full the $200 balance to which the 15% rate applied on March 31 and the $500 balance to which the 5% rate applied on March 31 and
then allocate the remaining $50 to the $100 purchase made on April 5. In the alternative, if the card issuer's practice is to allocate payments based on the rates and balances on the day a payment is credited to the account, the card issuer would allocate the $750 payment to pay in full the $500 balance to which the 18% rate applied on April 25 and then allocate the remaining $250 to the $300 balance to which the 15% rate applied on April 25.
3.
Claims or defenses under § 226.12(c) and billing error disputes under § 226.13.
When a consumer has asserted a claim or defense against the card issuer pursuant to § 226.12(c) or alleged a billing error under § 226.13, the card issuer must apply the consumer's payment in a manner that avoids or minimizes any reduction in the amount subject to that claim, defense, or dispute. For example:
i. Assume that a credit card account has a $500 cash advance balance at an annual percentage rate of 25% and a $1,000 purchase balance at an annual percentage rate of 17%. Assume also that $200 of the cash advance balance is subject to a claim or defense under § 226.12(c) or a billing error dispute under § 226.13. If the consumer pays $900 in excess of the required minimum periodic payment, the card issuer must allocate $300 of the excess payment to pay in full the portion of the cash advance balance that is not subject to the claim, defense, or dispute and then allocate the remaining $600 to the $1,000 purchase balance.
ii. Same facts as above except that the consumer pays $1,400 in excess of the required minimum periodic payment. The card issuer must allocate $1,300 of the excess payment to pay in full the $300 cash advance balance that is not subject to the claim, defense, or dispute and the $1,000 purchase balance. If there are no new transactions or other amounts to which the remaining $100 can be allocated, the card issuer may apply that amount to the $200 cash advance balance that is subject to the claim, defense, or dispute. However, if the card issuer subsequently determines that a billing error occurred as asserted by the consumer, the card issuer must credit the account for the disputed amount and any related finance or other charges and send a correction notice consistent with § 226.13(e).
4.
Balances with the same rate.
When the same annual percentage rate applies to more than one balance on an account and a different annual percentage rate applies to at least one other balance on that account, § 226.53 generally does not require that any particular method be used when allocating among the balances with the same annual percentage rate. Under these circumstances, a card issuer may treat the balances with the same rate as a single balance or separate balances.
See
example in comment 53-5.iv. However, when a balance on a credit card account is subject to a deferred interest or similar program that provides that a consumer will not be obligated to pay interest that accrues on the balance if the balance is paid in full prior to the expiration of a specified period of time, that balance must be treated as a balance with an annual percentage rate of zero for purposes of § 226.53 during that period of time. For example, if an account has a $1,000 purchase balance and a $2,000 balance that is subject to a deferred interest program that expires on July 1 and a 15% annual percentage rate applies to both, the balances must be treated as balances with different rates for purposes of § 226.53 until July 1. In addition, unless the card issuer allocates amounts paid by the consumer in excess of the required minimum periodic payment in the manner requested by the consumer pursuant to § 226.53(b)(1)(ii), § 226.53(b)(1)(i) requires the card issuer to apply any excess payments first to the $1,000 purchase balance except during the last two billing cycles of the deferred interest period (when it must be applied first to any remaining portion of the $2,000 balance).
See
example in comment 53-5.v.
5.
Examples.
For purposes of the following examples, assume that none of the required minimum periodic payment is allocated to the balances discussed (unless otherwise stated).
i. Assume that a credit card account has a cash advance balance of $500 at an annual percentage rate of 20% and a purchase balance of $1,500 at an annual percentage rate of 15% and that the consumer pays $800 in excess of the required minimum periodic payment. Under § 226.53(a), the card issuer must allocate $500 to pay off the cash advance balance and then allocate the remaining $300 to the purchase balance.
ii. Assume that a credit card account has a cash advance balance of $500 at an annual percentage rate of 20% and a purchase balance of $1,500 at an annual percentage rate of 15% and that the consumer pays $400 in excess of the required minimum periodic payment. Under § 226.53(a), the card issuer must allocate the entire $400 to the cash advance balance.
iii. Assume that a credit card account has a cash advance balance of $100 at an annual percentage rate of 20%, a purchase balance of $300 at an annual percentage rate of 18%, and a $600 protected balance on which the 12% annual percentage rate cannot be increased pursuant to § 226.55. If the consumer pays $500 in excess of the required minimum periodic payment, § 226.53(a) requires the card issuer to allocate $100 to pay off the cash advance balance, $300 to pay off the purchase balance, and $100 to the protected balance.
iv. Assume that a credit card account has a cash advance balance of $500 at an annual percentage rate of 20%, a purchase balance of $1,000 at an annual percentage rate of 15%,
and a transferred balance of $2,000 that was previously at a discounted annual percentage rate of 5% but is now at an annual percentage rate of 15%. Assume also that the consumer pays $800 in excess of the required minimum periodic payment. Under § 226.53(a), the card issuer must allocate $500 to pay off the cash advance balance and allocate the remaining $300 among the purchase balance and the transferred balance in the manner the card issuer deems appropriate.
v. Assume that on January 1 a consumer uses a credit card account to make a $1,200 purchase subject to a deferred interest program under which interest accrues at an annual percentage rate of 15% but the consumer will not be obligated to pay that interest if the balance is paid in full on or before June 30. The billing cycles for this account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month. Each month from January through June, the consumer uses the account to make $200 in purchases that are not subject to the deferred interest program but are subject to the 15% rate
A. Each month from February through June, the consumer pays $400 in excess of the required minimum periodic payment on the payment due date, which is the twenty-fifth of the month. Any interest that accrues on the purchases not subject to the deferred interest program is paid by the required minimum periodic payment. The card issuer does not accept requests from consumers regarding the allocation of excess payments pursuant to § 226.53(b)(1)(ii). Thus, § 226.53(b)(1)(i) requires the card issuer to allocate the $400 excess payments received on February 25, March 25, and April 25 consistent with § 226.53(a). In other words, the card issuer must allocate those payments as follows: $200 to pay off the balance not subject to the deferred interest program (which is subject to the 15% rate) and the remaining $200 to the deferred interest balance (which is treated as a balance with a rate of zero). However, § 226.53(b)(1)(i) requires the card issuer to allocate the entire $400 excess payment received on May 25 to the deferred interest balance. Similarly, § 226.53(b)(1)(i) requires the card issuer to allocate the $400 excess payment received on June 25 as follows: $200 to the deferred interest balance (which pays that balance in full) and the remaining $200 to the balance not subject to the deferred interest program.
B. Same facts as above, except that the card issuer does accept requests from consumers regarding the allocation of excess payments pursuant to § 226.53(b)(1)(ii). In addition, on April 25, the card issuer receives an excess payment of $800, which the consumer requests be allocated to pay off the $800 balance subject to the deferred interest program. Section 226.53(b)(1)(ii) permits the card issuer to allocate the $800 excess payment in the manner requested by the consumer.
53(b) Special rules.
1.
Deferred interest and similar programs.
Section 226.53(b)(1) applies to deferred interest or similar programs under which the consumer is not obligated to pay interest that accrues on a balance if that balance is paid in full prior to the expiration of a specified period of time. For purposes of § 226.53(b)(1), “deferred interest” has the same meaning as in § 226.16(h)(2) and associated commentary. Section 226.53(b)(1) applies regardless of whether the consumer is required to make payments with respect to that balance during the specified period. However, a grace period during which any credit extended may be repaid without incurring a finance charge due to a periodic interest rate is not a deferred interest or similar program for purposes of § 226.53(b)(1). Similarly, a temporary annual percentage rate of zero percent that applies for a specified period of time consistent with § 226.55(b)(1) is not a deferred interest or similar program for purposes of § 226.53(b)(1) unless the consumer may be obligated to pay interest that accrues during the period if a balance is not paid in full prior to expiration of the period.
2.
Expiration of deferred interest or similar program during billing cycle.
For purposes of § 226.53(b)(1)(i), a billing cycle does not constitute one of the two billing cycles immediately preceding expiration of a deferred interest or similar program if the expiration date for the program precedes the payment due date in that billing cycle. For example, assume that a credit card account has a balance subject to a deferred interest program that expires on June 15. Assume also that the billing cycles for the account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the required minimum periodic payment is due on the twenty-fifth day of the month. The card issuer does not accept requests from consumers regarding the allocation of excess payments pursuant to § 226.53(b)(1)(ii). Because the expiration date for the deferred interest program (June 15) precedes the due date in the June billing cycle (June 25), § 226.53(b)(1)(i) requires the card issuer to allocate first to the deferred interest balance any amount paid by the consumer in excess of the required minimum periodic payment during the April and May billing cycles (as well as any amount paid by the consumer before June 15). However, if the deferred interest program expired on June 25 or on June 30 (or on any day in between), § 226.53(b)(1)(i) would apply only to the May and June billing cycles.
3.
Consumer requests.
i.
Generally.
Section 226.53(b) does not require a card issuer to allocate amounts paid by the consumer in excess of the required minimum periodic payment in the manner requested by the consumer, provided that the card issuer instead allocates such amounts consistent with § 226.53(a) or (b)(1)(i), as applicable. For example, a card issuer may decline consumer requests regarding payment allocation as a general matter or may decline such requests when a consumer does not comply with requirements set by the card issuer (such as submitting the request in writing or submitting the request prior to or contemporaneously with submission of the payment), provided that amounts paid by the consumer in excess of the required minimum periodic payment are allocated consistent with § 226.53(a) or (b)(1)(i), as applicable. Similarly, a card issuer that accepts requests pursuant to § 226.53(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2) must allocate amounts paid by a consumer in excess of the required minimum periodic payment consistent with § 226.53(a) or (b)(1)(i), as applicable, if the consumer does not submit a request. Furthermore, a card issuer that accepts requests pursuant to § 226.53(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2) must allocate consistent with § 226.53(a) or (b)(1)(i), as applicable, if the consumer submits a request with which the card issuer cannot comply (such as a request that contains a mathematical error), unless the consumer submits an additional request with which the card issuer can comply.
ii.
Examples of consumer requests that satisfy § 226.53(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2).
A consumer has made a request for purposes of § 226.53(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2) if
A. The consumer contacts the card issuer orally, electronically, or in writing and specifically requests that a payment or payments be allocated in a particular manner during the period of time that the deferred interest or similar program applies to a balance on the account or the period of time that a balance on the account is secured.
B. The consumer completes and submits to the card issuer a form or payment coupon provided by the card issuer for the purpose of requesting that a payment or payments be allocated in a particular manner during the period of time that the deferred interest or similar program applies to a balance on the account or the period of time that a balance on the account is secured.
C. The consumer contacts the card issuer orally, electronically, or in writing and specifically requests that a payment that the card issuer has previously allocated consistent with § 226.53(a) or (b)(1)(i), as applicable, instead be allocated in a different manner.
iii.
Examples of consumer requests that do not satisfy § 226.53(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2).
A consumer has not made a request for purposes of § 226.53(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2) if
A. The terms and conditions of the account agreement contain preprinted language stating that by applying to open an account, by using that account for transactions subject to a deferred interest or similar program, or by using the account to purchase property in which the card issuer holds a security interest the consumer requests that payments be allocated in a particular manner.
B. The card issuer's on-line application contains a preselected check box indicating that the consumer requests that payments be allocated in a particular manner and the consumer does not deselect the box.
C. The payment coupon provided by the card issuer contains preprinted language or a preselected check box stating that by submitting a payment the consumer requests that the payment be allocated in a particular manner.
D. The card issuer requires a consumer to accept a particular payment allocation method as a condition of using a deferred interest or similar program, purchasing property in which the card issuer holds a security interest, making a payment, or receiving account services or features.

# Section 226.54—Limitations on the Imposition of Finance Charges
54(a) Limitations on imposing finance charges as a result of the loss of a grace period.
54(a)(1) General rule.
1.
Eligibility for grace period.
Section 226.54 prohibits the imposition of finance charges as a result of the loss of a grace period in certain specified circumstances. Section 226.54 does not require the card issuer to provide a grace period. Furthermore, § 226.54 does not prohibit the card issuer from placing limitations and conditions on a grace period (such as limiting application of the grace period to certain types of transactions or conditioning eligibility for the grace period on certain transactions being paid in full by a particular date), provided that such limitations and conditions are consistent with § 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B) and § 226.54. Finally, § 226.54 does not limit the imposition of finance charges with respect to a transaction when the consumer is not eligible for a grace period on that transaction at the end of the billing cycle in which the transaction occurred. For example:
i. Assume that the billing cycles for a credit card account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the payment due date is the twenty-fifth day of the month. Assume also that, for purchases made during the current billing cycle (for purposes of this example, the June billing cycle), the grace period applies from the date of the purchase until the payment due date in the following billing cycle (July 25), subject to two conditions. First, the purchase balance at the end of the preceding billing cycle (the May billing cycle)
must have been paid in full by the payment due date in the current billing cycle (June 25). Second, the purchase balance at the end of the current billing cycle (the June billing cycle) must be paid in full by the following payment due date (July 25). Finally, assume that the consumer was eligible for a grace period at the start of the June billing cycle (in other words, assume that the purchase balance for the April billing cycle was paid in full by May 25).
A. If the consumer pays the purchase balance for the May billing cycle in full by June 25, then at the end of the June billing cycle the consumer is eligible for a grace period with respect to purchases made during that billing cycle. Therefore, § 226.54 limits the imposition of finance charges with respect to purchases made during the June billing cycle if the consumer does not pay the purchase balance for the June billing cycle in full by July 25. Specifically, § 226.54(a)(1)(i) prohibits the card issuer from imposing finance charges based on the purchase balance at the end of the June billing cycle for days that precede the July billing cycle. Furthermore, § 226.54(a)(1)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing finance charges based on any portion of the balance at the end of the June billing cycle that was paid on or before July 25.
B. If the consumer does not pay the purchase balance for the May billing cycle in full by June 25, then the consumer is not eligible for a grace period with respect to purchases made during the June billing cycle at the end of that cycle. Therefore, § 226.54 does not limit the imposition of finance charges with respect to purchases made during the June billing cycle regardless of whether the consumer pays the purchase balance for the June billing cycle in full by July 25.
ii. Same facts as above except that the card issuer places only one condition on the provision of a grace period for purchases made during the current billing cycle (the June billing cycle): that the purchase balance at the end of the current billing cycle (the June billing cycle) be paid in full by the following payment due date (July 25). In these circumstances, § 226.54 applies to the same extent as discussed in paragraphs i.A. and i.B. above regardless of whether the purchase balance for the April billing cycle was paid in full by May 25.
2.
Definition of grace period.
For purposes of §§ 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B) and 226.54, a grace period is a period within which any credit extended may be repaid without incurring a finance charge due to a periodic interest rate. The following are not grace periods for purposes of § 226.54:
i.
Deferred interest and similar programs.
A deferred interest or similar promotional program under which a consumer will not be obligated to pay interest that accrues on a balance if that balance is paid in full prior to the expiration of a specified period of time is not a grace period for purposes of § 226.54. Thus, § 226.54 does not prohibit the card issuer from charging accrued interest to an account upon expiration of a deferred interest or similar program if the balance was not paid in full prior to expiration (to the extent consistent with § 226.55 and other applicable law and regulatory guidance).
ii.
Waivers or rebates of interest.
As a general matter, a card issuer has not provided a grace period with respect to transactions for purposes of § 226.54 if, on an individualized basis (such as in response to a consumer's request), the card issuer waives or rebates finance charges that have accrued on transactions. In addition, when a balance at the end of the preceding billing cycle is paid in full on or before the payment due date in the current billing cycle, a card issuer that waives or rebates trailing or residual interest accrued on that balance or any other transactions during the current billing cycle has not provided a grace period with respect to that balance or any other transactions for purposes of § 226.54. However, if the terms of the account provide that all interest accrued on transactions will be waived or rebated if the balance for those transactions at the end of the billing cycle during which the transactions occurred is paid in full by the following payment due date, the card issuer is providing a grace period with respect to those transactions for purposes of § 226.54. For example:
A. Assume that the billing cycles for a credit card account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the payment due date is the twenty-fifth day of the month. On March 31, the balance on the account is $1,000 and the consumer is not eligible for a grace period with respect to that balance because the balance at the end of the prior billing cycle was not paid in full on March 25. On April 15, the consumer uses the account for a $500 purchase. On April 25, the card issuer receives a payment of $1,000. On May 3, the card issuer mails or delivers a periodic statement reflecting trailing or residual interest that accrued on the $1,000 balance from April 1 through April 24 as well as interest that accrued on the $500 purchase from April 15 through April 30. On May 10, the consumer requests that the trailing or residual interest charges be waived and the card issuer complies. By waiving these interest charges, the card issuer has not provided a grace period with respect to the $1,000 balance or the $500 purchase.
B. Same facts as in paragraph ii.A. above except that the terms of the account state that trailing or residual interest will be waived in these circumstances or it is the card issuer's practice to waive trailing or residual interest in these circumstances. By waiving these interest charges, the card
issuer has not provided a grace period with respect to the $1,000 balance or the $500 purchase.
C. Assume that the billing cycles for a credit card account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the payment due date is the twenty-fifth day of the month. Assume also that, for purchases made during the current billing cycle (for purposes of this example, the June billing cycle), the terms of the account provide that interest accrued on those purchases from the date of the purchase until the payment due date in the following billing cycle (July 25) will be waived or rebated, subject to two conditions. First, the purchase balance at the end of the preceding billing cycle (the May billing cycle) must have been paid in full by the payment due date in the current billing cycle (June 25). Second, the purchase balance at the end of the current billing cycle (the June billing cycle) must be paid in full by the following payment due date (July 25). Under these circumstances, the card issuer is providing a grace period on purchases for purposes of § 226.54. Therefore, assuming that the consumer was eligible for this grace period at the start of the June billing cycle (in other words, assuming that the purchase balance for the April billing cycle was paid in full by May 25) and assuming that the consumer pays the purchase balance for the May billing cycle in full by June 25, § 226.54 applies to the imposition of finance charges with respect to purchases made during the June billing cycle. Specifically, § 226.54(a)(1)(i) prohibits the card issuer from imposing finance charges based on the purchase balance at the end of the June billing cycle for days that precede the July billing cycle. Furthermore, § 226.54(a)(1)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing finance charges based on any portion of the balance at the end of the June billing cycle that was paid on or before July 25.
3.
Relationship to payment allocation requirements in § 226.53.
Card issuers must comply with the payment allocation requirements in § 226.53 even if doing so will result in the loss of a grace period.
4.
Prohibition on two-cycle balance computation method.
When a consumer ceases to be eligible for a grace period, § 226.54(a)(1)(i) prohibits the card issuer from computing the finance charge using the two-cycle average daily balance computation method. This method calculates the finance charge using a balance that is the sum of the average daily balances for two billing cycles. The first balance is for the current billing cycle, and is calculated by adding the total balance (including or excluding new purchases and deducting payments and credits) for each day in the billing cycle, and then dividing by the number of days in the billing cycle. The second balance is for the preceding billing cycle.
5.
Prohibition on imposing finance charges on amounts paid within grace period.
When a balance on a credit card account is eligible for a grace period and the card issuer receives payment for some but not all of that balance prior to the expiration of the grace period, § 226.54(a)(1)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing finance charges on the portion of the balance paid. Card issuers are not required to use a particular method to comply with § 226.54(a)(1)(ii). However, when § 226.54(a)(1)(ii) applies, a card issuer is in compliance if, for example, it applies the consumer's payment to the balance subject to the grace period at the end of the preceding billing cycle (in a manner consistent with the payment allocation requirements in § 226.53) and then calculates interest charges based on the amount of the balance that remains unpaid.
6.
Examples.
Assume that the annual percentage rate for purchases on a credit card account is 15%. The billing cycle starts on the first day of the month and ends on the last day of the month. The payment due date for the account is the twenty-fifth day of the month. For purchases made during the current billing cycle, the card issuer provides a grace period from the date of the purchase until the payment due date in the following billing cycle, provided that the purchase balance at the end of the current billing cycle is paid in full by the following payment due date. For purposes of this example, assume that none of the required minimum periodic payment is allocated to the balances discussed. During the March billing cycle, the following transactions are charged to the account: A $100 purchase on March 10, a $200 purchase on March 15, and a $300 purchase on March 20. On March 25, the purchase balance for the February billing cycle is paid in full. Thus, for purposes of § 226.54, the consumer is eligible for a grace period on the March purchases. At the end of the March billing cycle (March 31), the consumer's total purchase balance is $600 and the consumer will not be charged interest on that balance if it is paid in full by the following due date (April 25).
i. On April 10, a $150 purchase is charged to the account. On April 25, the card issuer receives $500 in excess of the required minimum periodic payment. Section 226.54(a)(1)(i) prohibits the card issuer from reaching back and charging interest on any of the March transactions from the date of the transaction through the end of the March billing cycle (March 31). In these circumstances, the card issuer may comply with § 226.54(a)(1)(ii) by applying the $500 excess payment to the $600 purchase balance and then charging interest only on the portion of the $600 purchase balance that remains unpaid ($100) from the start of the April billing cycle (April 1) through the end
of the April billing cycle (April 30). In addition, the card issuer may charge interest on the $150 purchase from the date of the transaction (April 10) through the end of the April billing cycle (April 31).
ii. Same facts as in paragraph 6. above except that, on March 18, a $250 cash advance is charged to the account at an annual percentage rate of 25%. The card issuer's grace period does not apply to cash advances, but the card issuer does provide a grace period on the March purchases because the purchase balance for the February billing cycle is paid in full on March 25. On April 25, the card issuer receives $600 in excess of the required minimum periodic payment. As required by § 226.53, the card issuer allocates the $600 excess payment first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (the $250 cash advance balance). Although § 226.54(a)(1)(i) prohibits the card issuer from charging interest on the March purchases based on days in the March billing cycle, the card issuer may charge interest on the $250 cash advance from the date of the transaction (March 18) through April 24. In these circumstances, the card issuer may comply with § 226.54(a)(1)(ii) by applying the remainder of the excess payment ($350) to the $600 purchase balance and then charging interest only on the portion of the $600 purchase balance that remains unpaid ($250) from the start of the April billing cycle (April 1) through the end of the April billing cycle (April 30).
iii. Same facts as in paragraph 6. above except that the consumer does not pay the balance for the February billing cycle in full on March 25 and therefore is not eligible for a grace period on the March purchases. Under these circumstances, § 226.54 does not apply and the card issuer may charge interest from the date of each transaction through April 24 and interest on the remaining $100 from April 25 through the end of the April billing cycle (April 25).

# Section 226.55—Limitations on Increasing Annual Percentage Rates, Fees, and Charges
55(a) General rule.
1.
Increase in rate, fee, or charge.
Section 226.55(a) prohibits card issuers from increasing an annual percentage rate or any fee or charge required to be disclosed under § 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) on a credit card account unless specifically permitted by one of the exceptions in § 226.55(b). Except as specifically provided in § 226.55(b), this prohibition applies even if the circumstances under which an increase will occur are disclosed in advance. The following examples illustrate the general application of § 226.55(a) and (b). Additional examples illustrating specific aspects of the exceptions in § 226.55(b) are provided in the commentary to those exceptions.
i.
Account-opening disclosure of non-variable rate for six months, then variable rate.
Assume that, at account opening on January 1 of year one, a card issuer discloses that the annual percentage rate for purchases is a non-variable rate of 15% and will apply for six months. The card issuer also discloses that, after six months, the annual percentage rate for purchases will be a variable rate that is currently 18% and will be adjusted quarterly by adding a margin of 8 percentage points to a publicly-available index not under the card issuer's control. Furthermore, the card issuer discloses that the annual percentage rate for cash advances is the same variable rate that will apply to purchases after six months. Finally, the card issuer discloses that, to the extent consistent with § 226.55 and other applicable law, a non-variable penalty rate of 30% may apply if the consumer makes a late payment. The payment due date for the account is the twenty-fifth day of the month and the required minimum periodic payments are applied to accrued interest and fees but do not reduce the purchase and cash advance balances.
A.
Change-in-terms rate increase for new transactions after first year.
On January 15 of year one, the consumer uses the account to make a $2,000 purchase and a $500 cash advance. No other transactions are made on the account. At the start of each quarter, the card issuer may adjust the variable rate that applies to the $500 cash advance consistent with changes in the index (pursuant to § 226.55(b)(2)). All required minimum periodic payments are received on or before the payment due date until May of year one, when the payment due on May 25 is received by the creditor on May 28. At this time, the card issuer is prohibited by § 226.55 from increasing the rates that apply to the $2,000 purchase, the $500 cash advance, or future purchases and cash advances. Six months after account opening (July 1), the card issuer may begin to accrue interest on the $2,000 purchase at the previously-disclosed variable rate determined using an 8-point margin (pursuant to § 226.55(b)(1)). Because no other increases in rate were disclosed at account opening, the card issuer may not subsequently increase the variable rate that applies to the $2,000 purchase and the $500 cash advance (except due to increases in the index pursuant to § 226.55(b)(2)). On November 16, the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to § 226.9(c) informing the consumer of a new variable rate that will apply on January 1 of year two (calculated using the same index and an increased margin of 12 percentage points). On December 15, the consumer makes a $100 purchase. On January 1 of year two, the card issuer may increase the margin used to determine the variable rate that applies to new purchases to 12 percentage points (pursuant to § 226.55(b)(3)). However, § 226.55(b)(3)(ii) does not permit the card issuer to apply the variable rate determined
using the 12-point margin to the $2,000 purchase balance. Furthermore, although the $100 purchase occurred more than 14 days after provision of the § 226.9(c) notice, § 226.55(b)(3)(iii) does not permit the card issuer to apply the variable rate determined using the 12-point margin to that purchase because it occurred during the first year after account opening. On January 15 of year two, the consumer makes a $300 purchase. The card issuer may apply the variable rate determined using the 12-point margin to the $300 purchase.
B.
Account becomes more than 60 days delinquent during first year.
Same facts as above except that the required minimum periodic payment due on May 25 of year one is not received by the card issuer until July 30 of year one. Because the card issuer received the required minimum periodic payment more than 60 days after the payment due date, § 226.55(b)(4) permits the card issuer to increase the annual percentage rate applicable to the $2,000 purchase, the $500 cash advance, and future purchases and cash advances. However, § 226.55(b)(4)(i) requires the card issuer to first comply with the notice requirements in § 226.9(g). Thus, if the card issuer provided a § 226.9(g) notice on July 25 stating that all rates on the account would be increased to the 30% penalty rate, the card issuer could apply that rate beginning on September 8 to all balances and to future transactions.
ii.
Account-opening disclosure of non-variable rate for six months, then increased non-variable rate for six months, then variable rate; change-in-terms rate increase for new transactions after first year.
Assume that, at account opening on January 1 of year one, a card issuer discloses that the annual percentage rate for purchases will increase as follows: A non-variable rate of 5% for six months; a non-variable rate of 10% for an additional six months; and thereafter a variable rate that is currently 15% and will be adjusted monthly by adding a margin of 5 percentage points to a publicly-available index not under the card issuer's control. The payment due date for the account is the fifteenth day of the month and the required minimum periodic payments are applied to accrued interest and fees but do not reduce the purchase balance. On January 15 of year one, the consumer uses the account to make a $1,500 purchase. Six months after account opening (July 1), the card issuer may begin to accrue interest on the $1,500 purchase at the previously-disclosed 10% non-variable rate (pursuant to § 226.55(b)(1)). On September 15, the consumer uses the account for a $700 purchase. On November 16, the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to § 226.9(c) informing the consumer of a new variable rate that will apply on January 1 of year two (calculated using the same index and an increased margin of 8 percentage points). One year after account opening (January 1 of year two), the card issuer may begin accruing interest on the $2,200 purchase balance at the previously-disclosed variable rate determined using a 5-point margin (pursuant to § 226.55(b)(1)). Section 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to apply the variable rate determined using the 8-point margin to the $2,200 purchase balance. Furthermore, § 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to subsequently increase the variable rate determined using the 5-point margin that applies to the $2,200 purchase balance (except due to increases in the index pursuant to § 226.55(b)(2)). The card issuer may, however, apply the variable rate determined using the 8-point margin to purchases made on or after January 1 of year two (pursuant to § 226.55(b)(3)).
iii.
Change-in-terms rate increase for new transactions after first year; penalty rate increase after first year.
Assume that, at account opening on January 1 of year one, a card issuer discloses that the annual percentage rate for purchases is a variable rate determined by adding a margin of 6 percentage points to a publicly-available index outside of the card issuer's control. The card issuer also discloses that, to the extent consistent with § 226.55 and other applicable law, a non-variable penalty rate of 28% may apply if the consumer makes a late payment. The due date for the account is the fifteenth of the month. On May 30 of year two, the account has a purchase balance of $1,000. On May 31, the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to § 226.9(c) informing the consumer of a new variable rate that will apply on July 16 for all purchases made on or after June 15 (calculated by using the same index and an increased margin of 8 percentage points). On June 14, the consumer makes a $500 purchase. On June 15, the consumer makes a $200 purchase. On July 1, the card issuer has not received the payment due on June 15 and provides the consumer with a notice pursuant to § 226.9(g) stating that the 28% penalty rate will apply as of August 15 to all transactions made on or after July 16 and that, if the consumer becomes more than 60 days late, the penalty rate will apply to all balances on the account. On July 17, the consumer makes a $300 purchase.
A.
Account does not become more than 60 days delinquent.
The payment due on June 15 of year two is received on July 2. On July 16, § 226.55(b)(3)(ii) permits the card issuer to apply the variable rate determined using the 8-point margin disclosed in the § 226.9(c) notice to the $200 purchase made on June 15 but does not permit the card issuer to apply this rate to the $1,500 purchase balance. On August 15, § 226.55(b)(3)(ii) permits the card issuer to apply the 28% penalty rate disclosed at account opening and in the § 226.9(g) notice to the $300 purchase made on July 17 but does not permit the card issuer
to apply this rate to the $1,500 purchase balance (which remains at the variable rate determined using the 6-point margin) or the $200 purchase (which remains at the variable rate determined using the 8-point margin).
B.
Account becomes more than 60 days delinquent after provision of § 226.9(g) notice.
Same facts as above except the payment due on June 15 of year two has not been received by August 15. Section 226.55(b)(4) permits the card issuer to apply the 28% penalty rate to the $1,500 purchase balance and the $200 purchase because it has not received the June 15 payment within 60 days after the due date. However, in order to do so, § 226.55(b)(4)(i) requires the card issuer to first provide an additional notice pursuant to § 226.9(g). This notice must be sent no earlier than August 15, which is the first day the account became more than 60 days' delinquent. If the notice is sent on August 15, the card issuer may begin accruing interest on the $1,500 purchase balance and the $200 purchase at the 28% penalty rate beginning on September 29.
2.
Relationship to grace period.
Nothing in § 226.55 prohibits a card issuer from assessing interest due to the loss of a grace period to the extent consistent with § 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B) and § 226.54. In addition, a card issuer has not reduced an annual percentage rate on a credit card account for purposes of § 226.55 if the card issuer does not charge interest on a balance or a portion thereof based on a payment received prior to the expiration of a grace period. For example, if the annual percentage rate for purchases on an account is 15% but the card issuer does not charge any interest on a $500 purchase balance because that balance was paid in full prior to the expiration of the grace period, the card issuer has not reduced the 15% purchase rate to 0% for purposes of § 226.55.
55(b) Exceptions.
1.
Exceptions not mutually exclusive.
A card issuer generally may increase an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under § 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) pursuant to an exception set forth in § 226.55(b) even if that increase would not be permitted under a different exception. For example, although a card issuer cannot increase an annual percentage rate pursuant to § 226.55(b)(1) unless that rate is provided for a specified period of at least six months, the card issuer may increase an annual percentage rate during a specified period due to an increase in an index consistent with § 226.55(b)(2). Similarly, although § 226.55(b)(3) does not permit a card issuer to increase an annual percentage rate during the first year after account opening, the card issuer may increase the rate during the first year after account opening pursuant to § 226.55(b)(4) if the required minimum periodic payment is not received within 60 days after the due date. However, if § 226.55(b)(4)(ii) requires a card issuer to decrease the rate, fee, or charge that applies to a balance while the account is subject to a workout or temporary hardship arrangement or subject to 50 U.S.C. app. 527 or a similar Federal or State statute or regulation, the card issuer may not impose a higher rate, fee, or charge on that balance pursuant to § 226.55(b)(5) or (b)(6) upon completion or failure of the arrangement or once 50 U.S.C. app. 527 or the similar Federal or State statute or regulation no longer applies. For example, assume that, on January 1, the annual percentage rate that applies to a $1,000 balance is increased from 12% to 30% pursuant to § 226.55(b)(4). On February 1, the rate on that balance is decreased from 30% to 15% consistent with § 226.55(b)(5) as a part of a workout or temporary hardship arrangement. On July 1, § 226.55(b)(4)(ii) requires the card issuer to reduce the rate that applies to any remaining portion of the $1,000 balance from 15% to 12%. If the consumer subsequently completes or fails to comply with the terms of the workout or temporary hardship arrangement, the card issuer may not increase the 12% rate that applies to any remaining portion of the $1,000 balance pursuant to § 226.55(b)(5).
55(b) Exceptions.
1.
Exceptions not mutually exclusive.
A card issuer generally may increase an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under § 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) pursuant to an exception set forth in § 226.55(b) even if that increase would not be permitted under a different exception. For example, although a card issuer cannot increase an annual percentage rate pursuant to § 226.55(b)(1) unless that rate is provided for a specified period of at least six months, the card issuer may increase an annual percentage rate during a specified period due to an increase in an index consistent with § 226.55(b)(2). Similarly, although § 226.55(b)(3) does not permit a card issuer to increase an annual percentage rate during the first year after account opening, the card issuer may increase the rate during the first year after account opening pursuant to § 226.55(b)(4) if the required minimum periodic payment is not received within 60 days after the due date. However, if § 226.55(b)(4)(ii) requires a card issuer to decrease the rate, fee, or charge that applies to a balance while the account is subject to a workout or temporary hardship arrangement or subject to 50 U.S.C. app. 527 or a similar Federal or State statute or regulation, the card issuer may not impose a higher rate, fee, or charge on that balance pursuant to § 226.55(b)(5) or (b)(6) upon completion or failure of the arrangement or once 50 U.S.C. app. 527 or the similar Federal or State statute or regulation no longer applies. For example, assume that, on January 1, the annual percentage rate that applies to a $1,000 balance is increased from 12% to 30% pursuant to
§ 226.55(b)(4). On February 1, the rate on that balance is decreased from 30% to 15% consistent with § 226.55(b)(5) as a part of a workout or temporary hardship arrangement. On July 1, § 226.55(b)(4)(ii) requires the card issuer to reduce the rate that applies to any remaining portion of the $1,000 balance from 15% to 12%. If the consumer subsequently completes or fails to comply with the terms of the workout or temporary hardship arrangement, the card issuer may not increase the 12% rate that applies to any remaining portion of the $1,000 balance pursuant to § 226.55(b)(5).
2.
Relationship between exceptions in § 226.55(b) and notice requirements in § 226.9.
Nothing in § 226.55 alters the requirements in § 226.9(c) and (g) that creditors provide written notice at least 45 days prior to the effective date of certain increases in annual percentage rates, fees, and charges.
i.
14-day rule in § 226.55(b)(3)(ii).
Although § 226.55(b)(3)(ii) permits a card issuer that discloses an increased rate pursuant to § 226.9(c) or (g) to apply that rate to transactions that occur more than 14 days after provision of the notice, the card issuer cannot begin to accrue interest at the increased rate until that increase goes into effect, consistent with § 226.9(c) or (g). For example, if on May 1 a card issuer provides a notice pursuant to § 226.9(c) stating that a rate will increase from 15% to 18% on June 15, § 226.55(b)(3)(ii) permits the card issuer to apply the 18% rate to transactions that occur on or after May 16. However, neither § 226.55 nor § 226.9(c) permits the card issuer to begin accruing interest at the 18% rate on those transactions until June 15. See additional examples in comment 55(b)(3)-4.
ii.
Mid-cycle increases; application of balance computation methods.
Once an increased rate has gone into effect, the card issuer cannot calculate interest charges based on that increased rate for days prior to the effective date. Assume that, in the example in paragraph i. above, the billing cycles for the account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month. If, for example, the card issuer uses the average daily balance computation method, it cannot apply the 18% rate to the average daily balance for the entire June billing cycle because that rate did not become effective until June 15. However, the card issuer could apply the 15% rate to the average daily balance from June 1 through June 14 and the 18% rate to the average daily balance from June 15 through June 30. Similarly, if the card issuer that uses the daily balance computation method, it could apply the 15% rate to the daily balance for each day from June 1 through June 14 and the 18% rate to the daily balance for each day from June 15 through June 30.
iii.
Mid-cycle increases; delayed implementation of increase.
If § 226.55(b) and § 226.9(b), (c), or (g) permit a card issuer to apply an increased annual percentage rate, fee, or charge on a date that is not the first day of a billing cycle, the card issuer may delay application of the increased rate, fee, or charge until the first day of the following billing cycle without relinquishing the ability to apply that rate, fee, or charge. Thus, in the example in paragraphs i. and ii. above, the card issuer could delay application of the 18% rate until the start of the next billing cycle (April 1) without relinquishing its ability to apply that rate under § 226.55(b)(3). Similarly, assume that, at account opening on January 1, a card issuer discloses that a non-variable annual percentage rate of 10% will apply to purchases for six months and a non-variable rate of 15% will apply thereafter. The first day of each billing cycle for the account is the fifteenth of the month. If the six-month period expires on July 1, the card issuer may delay application of the 15% rate until the start of the next billing cycle (July 15) without relinquishing its ability to apply that rate under § 226.55(b)(1).
3.
Application of a lower rate, fee, or charge.
Nothing in § 226.55 prohibits a card issuer from lowering an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under § 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii). However, a card issuer that does so cannot subsequently increase the rate, fee, or charge unless permitted by one of the exceptions in § 226.55(b). The following examples illustrate the application of the rule
i.
Application of lower rate during first year.
Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one that a non-variable annual percentage rate of 15% will apply to purchases. The card issuer also discloses that, to the extent consistent with § 226.55 and other applicable law, a non-variable penalty rate of 30% may apply if the consumer's required minimum periodic payment is received after the payment due date, which is the tenth of the month. The required minimum periodic payments are applied to accrued interest and fees but do not reduce the purchase balance.
A.
Temporary rate returns to standard rate at expiration.
On September 30 of year one, the account has a purchase balance of $1,400 at the 15% rate. On October 1, the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to § 226.9(c) informing the consumer that the rate for new purchases will decrease to a non-variable rate of 5% for six months (from October 1 through March 31 of year two) and that, beginning on April 1 of year two, the rate for purchases will increase to the 15% non-variable rate disclosed at account opening. The card issuer does not apply the 5% rate to the $1,400 purchase balance. On October 14 of year one, the consumer makes a $300 purchase at the 5% rate. On January 15 of year two, the consumer makes a $150 purchase at the 5% rate. On April 1 of year two, the card
issuer may begin accruing interest on the $300 purchase and the $150 purchase at 15% as disclosed in the § 226.9(c) notice (pursuant to § 226.55(b)(1)).
B.
Penalty rate increase.
Same facts as above except that the required minimum periodic payment due on November 10 of year one is not received until November 15. Section 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to increase any annual percentage rate on the account at this time. The card issuer may apply the 30% penalty rate to new transactions beginning on April 1 of year two pursuant to § 226.55(b)(3) by providing a § 226.9(g) notice informing the consumer of this increase no later than February 14 of year two. The card issuer may not, however, apply the 30% penalty rate to the $1,400 purchase balance as of September 30 of year one, the $300 purchase on October 15 of year one, or the $150 purchase on January 15 of year two.
ii.
Application of lower rate at end of first year.
Assume that, at account opening on January 1 of year one, a card issuer discloses that a non-variable annual percentage rate of 15% will apply to purchases for one year and discloses that, after the first year, the card issuer will apply a variable rate that is currently 20% and is determined by adding a margin of 10 percentage points to a publicly-available index not under the card issuer's control. On December 31 of year one, the account has a purchase balance of $3,000.
A.
Notice of extension of existing temporary rate provided consistent with § 226.55(b)(1)(i).
On December 15 of year one, the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to § 226.9(c) informing the consumer that the existing 15% rate will continue to apply until July 1 of year two. The notice further states that, on July 1 of year two, the variable rate disclosed at account opening will apply. On July 1 of year two, § 226.55(b)(1) permits the card issuer to apply that variable rate to any remaining portion of the $3,000 balance and to new transactions.
B.
Notice of new temporary rate provided consistent with § 226.55(b)(1)(i).
On December 15 of year one, the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to § 226.9(c) informing the consumer of a new variable rate that will apply on January 1 of year two that is lower than the variable rate disclosed at account opening. The new variable rate is calculated using the same index and a reduced margin of 8 percentage points. The notice further states that, on July 1 of year two, the margin will increase to the margin disclosed at account opening (10 percentage points). On July 1 of year two, § 226.55(b)(1) permits the card issuer to increase the margin used to determine the variable rate that applies to new purchases to 10 percentage points and to apply that rate to any remaining portion of the $3,000 purchase balance.
C.
No notice provided.
Same facts as in paragraph ii.B. above except that the card issuer does not send a notice on December 15 of year one. Instead, on January 1 of year two, the card issuer lowers the margin used to determine the variable rate to 8 percentage points and applies that rate to the $3,000 purchase balance and to new purchases. Section 226.9 does not require advance notice in these circumstances. However, unless the account becomes more than 60 days' delinquent, § 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to subsequently increase the rate that applies to the $3,000 purchase balance except due to increases in the index (pursuant to § 226.55(b)(2)).
iii.
Application of lower rate after first year.
Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one that a non-variable annual percentage rate of 10% will apply to purchases for one year, after which that rate will increase to a non-variable rate of 15%. The card issuer also discloses that, to the extent consistent with § 226.55 and other applicable law, a non-variable penalty rate of 30% may apply if the consumer's required minimum periodic payment is received after the payment due date, which is the tenth of the month. The required minimum periodic payments are applied to accrued interest and fees but do not reduce the purchase balance.
A.
Effect of 14-day period.
On June 30 of year two, the account has a purchase balance of $1,000 at the 15% rate. On July 1, the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to § 226.9(c) informing the consumer that the rate for new purchases will decrease to a non-variable rate of 5% for six months (from July 1 through December 31 of year two) and that, beginning on January 1 of year three, the rate for purchases will increase to a non-variable rate of 17%. On July 15 of year two, the consumer makes a $200 purchase. On July 16, the consumer makes a $100 purchase. On January 1 of year three, the card issuer may begin accruing interest on the $100 purchase at 17% (pursuant to § 226.55(b)(1)). However, § 226.55(b)(1)(ii)(B) does not permit the card issuer to apply the 17% rate to the $200 purchase because that transaction occurred within 14 days after provision of the § 226.9(c) notice. Instead, the card issuer may apply the 15% rate that applied to purchases prior to provision of the § 226.9(c) notice. In addition, if the card issuer applied the 5% rate to the $1,000 purchase balance, § 226.55(b)(ii)(A) would not permit the card issuer to increase the rate that applies to that balance on January 1 of year three to a rate that is higher than 15% that previously applied to the balance.
B.
Penalty rate increase.
Same facts as above except that the required minimum periodic payment due on August 25 is received on August 30. At this time, § 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to increase the annual percentage rates that apply to
the $1,000 purchase balance, the $200 purchase, or the $100 purchase. Instead, those rates can only be increased as discussed in paragraph iii.A. above. However, if the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to § 226.9(c) or (g) on September 1, § 226.55(b)(3) permits the card issuer to apply an increased rate (such as the 17% purchase rate or the 30% penalty rate) to transactions that occur on or after September 16 beginning on October 16.
C.
Application of lower temporary rate during specified period.
Same facts as in paragraph iii. above. On June 30 of year two, the account has a purchase balance of $1,000 at the 15% non-variable rate. On July 1, the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to § 226.9(c) informing the consumer that the rate for the $1,000 balance and new purchases will decrease to a non-variable rate of 12% for six months (from July 1 through December 31 of year two) and that, beginning on January 1 of year three, the rate for purchases will increase to a variable rate that is currently 20% and is determined by adding a margin of 10 percentage points to a publicly-available index not under the card issuer's control. On August 15 of year two, the consumer makes a $500 purchase. On October 1, the card issuer provides another notice pursuant to § 226.9(c) informing the consumer that the rate for the $1,000 balance, the $500 purchase, and new purchases will decrease to a non-variable rate of 5% for six months (from October 1 of year two through March 31 of year three) and that, beginning on April 1 of year three, the rate for purchases will increase to a variable rate that is currently 23% and is determined by adding a margin of 13 percentage points to the previously-disclosed index. On November 15 of year two, the consumer makes a $300 purchase. On April 1 of year three, § 226.55 permits the card issuer to begin accruing interest using the following rates for any remaining portion of the following balances: The 15% non-variable rate for the $1,000 balance; the variable rate determined using the 10-point margin for the $500 purchase; and the variable rate determined using the 13-point margin for the $300 purchase.
4.
Date on which transaction occurred.
When a transaction occurred for purposes of § 226.55 is generally determined by the date of the transaction. However, if a transaction that occurred within 14 days after provision of a § 226.9(c) or (g) notice is not charged to the account prior to the effective date of the change or increase, the card issuer may treat the transaction as occurring more than 14 days after provision of the notice for purposes of § 226.55. See example in comment 55(b)(3)-4.iii.B. In addition, when a merchant places a “hold” on the available credit on an account for an estimated transaction amount because the actual transaction amount will not be known until a later date, the date of the transaction for purposes of § 226.55 is the date on which the card issuer receives the actual transaction amount from the merchant. See example in comment 55(b)(3)-4.iii.A.
5.
Category of transactions.
For purposes of § 226.55, a “category of transactions” is a type or group of transactions to which an annual percentage rate applies that is different than the annual percentage rate that applies to other transactions. Similarly, a type or group of transactions is a “category of transactions” for purposes of § 226.55 if a fee or charge required to be disclosed under § 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) applies to those transactions that is different than the fee or charge that applies to other transactions. For example, purchase transactions, cash advance transactions, and balance transfer transactions are separate categories of transactions for purposes of § 226.55 if a card issuer applies different annual percentage rates to each. Furthermore, if, for example, the card issuer applies different annual percentage rates to different types of purchase transactions (such as one rate for purchases of gasoline or purchases over $100 and a different rate for all other purchases), each type constitutes a separate category of transactions for purposes of § 226.55.
55(b)(1) Temporary rate, fee, or charge exception.
1.
Relationship to § 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B).
A card issuer that has complied with the disclosure requirements in § 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B) has also complied with the disclosure requirements in § 226.55(b)(1)(i).
2.
Period of six months or longer.
A temporary annual percentage rate, fee, or charge must apply for a specified period of six months or longer before a card issuer can increase that rate, fee, or charge pursuant to § 226.55(b)(1). The specified period must expire no less than six months after the date on which the card issuer provides the consumer with the disclosures required by § 226.55(b)(1)(i) or, if later, the date on which the account can be used for transactions to which the temporary rate, fee, or charge applies. Section 226.55(b)(1) does not prohibit a card issuer from limiting the application of a temporary annual percentage rate, fee, or charge to a particular category of transactions (such as to balance transfers or to purchases over $100). However, in circumstances where the card issuer limits application of the temporary rate, fee, or charge to a single transaction, the specified period must expire no less than six months after the date on which that transaction occurred. The following examples illustrate the application of § 226.55(b)(1)
i. Assume that on January 1 a card issuer offers a consumer a 5% annual percentage rate on purchases made during the months of January through June. A 15% rate will apply thereafter. On February 15, a $500 purchase is
charged to the account. On June 15, a $200 purchase is charged to the account. On July 1, the card issuer may begin accruing interest at the 15% rate on the $500 purchase and the $200 purchase (pursuant to § 226.55(b)(1)).
ii. Same facts as above except that on January 1 the card issuer offered the 5% rate on purchases beginning in the month of February. Section 226.55(b)(1) would not permit the card issuer to begin accruing interest at the 15% rate on the $500 purchase and the $200 purchase until August 1.
iii. Assume that on October 31 of year one the annual percentage rate for purchases is 17%. On November 1, the card issuer offers the consumer a 0% rate for six months on purchases made during the months of November and December. The 17% rate will apply thereafter. On November 15, a $500 purchase is charged to the account. On December 15, a $300 purchase is charged to the account. On January 15 of year two, a $150 purchase is charged to the account. Section 226.55(b)(1) would not permit the card issuer to begin accruing interest at the 17% rate on the $500 purchase and the $300 purchase until May 1 of year two. However, the card issuer may accrue interest at the 17% rate on the $150 purchase beginning on January 15 of year two.
iv. Assume that on June 1 of year one a card issuer offers a consumer a 0% annual percentage rate for six months on the purchase of an appliance. An 18% rate will apply thereafter. On September 1, a $5,000 transaction is charged to the account for the purchase of an appliance. Section 226.55(b)(1) would not permit the card issuer to begin accruing interest at the 18% rate on the $5,000 transaction until March 1 of year two.
v. Assume that on May 31 of year one the annual percentage rate for purchases is 15%. On June 1, the card issuer offers the consumer a 5% rate for six months on a balance transfer of at least $1,000. The 15% rate will apply thereafter. On June 15, a $3,000 balance is transferred to the account. On July 15, a $200 purchase is charged to the account. Section 226.55(b)(1) would not permit the card issuer to begin accruing interest at the 15% rate on the $3,000 transferred balance until December 15. However, the card issuer may accrue interest at the 15% rate on the $200 purchase beginning on July 15.
vi. Same facts as in paragraph v. above except that the card issuer offers the 5% rate for six months on all balance transfers of at least $1,000 during the month of June and a $2,000 balance is transferred to the account on June 30 (in addition to the $3,000 balance transfer on June 15). Because the 5% rate is not limited to a particular transaction, § 226.55(b)(1) permits the card issuer to begin accruing interest on the $3,000 and $2,000 transferred balances on December 1.
vii. Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one that the annual fee for the account is $0 until January 1 of year two, when the fee will increase to $50. On January 1 of year two, the card issuer may impose the $50 annual fee. However, the issuer must also comply with the notice requirements in § 226.9(e).
viii. Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one that the monthly maintenance fee for the account is $0 until July 1 of year one, when the fee will increase to $10. Beginning on July 1 of year one, the card issuer may impose the $10 monthly maintenance fee (to the extent consistent with § 226.52(a)).
3.
Deferred interest and similar promotional programs.
i.
Application of § 226.55.
The general prohibition in § 226.55(a) applies to the imposition of accrued interest upon the expiration of a deferred interest or similar promotional program under which the consumer is not obligated to pay interest that accrues on a balance if that balance is paid in full prior to the expiration of a specified period of time. However, the exception in § 226.55(b)(1) also applies to these programs, provided that the specified period is six months or longer and that, prior to the commencement of the period, the card issuer discloses the length of the period and the rate at which interest will accrue on the balance subject to the deferred interest or similar program if that balance is not paid in full prior to expiration of the period. See comment 9(c)(2)(v)-9. For purposes of § 226.55, “deferred interest” has the same meaning as in § 226.16(h)(2) and associated commentary.
ii.
Examples.
A.
Deferred interest offer at account opening.
Assume that, at account opening on January 1 of year one, the card issuer discloses the following with respect to a deferred interest program: “No interest on purchases made in January of year one if paid in full by December 31 of year one. If the balance is not paid in full by that date, interest will be imposed from the transaction date at a rate of 20%.” On January 15 of year one, the consumer makes a purchase of $2,000. No other transactions are made on the account. The terms of the deferred interest program require the consumer to make minimum periodic payments with respect to the deferred interest balance, and the payment due on April 1 is not received until April 10. Section 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to charge to the account interest that has accrued on the $2,000 purchase at this time. Furthermore, if the consumer pays the $2,000 purchase in full on or before December 31 of year one, § 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to charge to the account any interest that has accrued on that purchase. If, however, the $2,000 purchase has not been paid in full by January 1 of year two, § 226.55(b)(1) permits the card issuer to charge to the account the interest accrued on that purchase at the 20% rate
during year one (to the extent consistent with other applicable law).
B.
Deferred interest offer after account opening.
Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one that the rate that applies to purchases is a variable annual percentage rate that is currently 18% and will be adjusted quarterly by adding a margin of 8 percentage points to a publicly-available index not under the card issuer's control. The card issuer also discloses that, to the extent consistent with § 226.55 and other applicable law, a non-variable penalty rate of 30% may apply if the consumer's required minimum periodic payment is received after the payment due date, which is the first of the month. On June 30 of year two, the consumer uses the account for a $1,000 purchase in response to an offer of a deferred interest program. Under the terms of this program, interest on the purchase will accrue at the variable rate for purchases but the consumer will not be obligated to pay that interest if the purchase is paid in full by December 31 of year three. The terms of the deferred interest program require the consumer to make minimum periodic payments with respect to the deferred interest balance, and the payment due on September 1 of year two is not received until September 6. Section 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to charge to the account interest that has accrued on the $1,000 purchase at this time. Furthermore, if the consumer pays the $1,000 purchase in full on or before December 31 of year three, § 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to charge to the account any interest that has accrued on that purchase. On December 31 of year three, the $1,000 purchase has been paid in full. Under these circumstances, the card issuer may not charge any interest accrued on the $1,000 purchase.
C.
Application of § 226.55(b)(4) to deferred interest programs.
Same facts as in paragraph ii.B. above except that, on November 2 of year two, the card issuer has not received the required minimum periodic payments due on September 1, October 1, or November 1 of year two and sends a § 226.9(c) or (g) notice stating that interest accrued on the $1,000 purchase since June 30 of year two will be charged to the account on December 17 of year two and thereafter interest will be charged on the $1,000 purchase consistent with the variable rate for purchases. On December 17 of year two, § 226.55(b)(4) permits the card issuer to charge to the account interest accrued on the $1,000 purchase since June 30 of year two and § 226.55(b)(3) permits the card issuer to begin charging interest on the $1,000 purchase consistent with the variable rate for purchases. However, if the card issuer receives the required minimum periodic payments due on January 1, February 1, March 1, April 1, May 1, and June 1 of year three, § 226.55(b)(4)(ii) requires the card issuer to cease charging the account for interest on the $1,000 purchase no later than the first day of the next billing cycle. See comment 55(b)(4)-3.iii. However, § 226.55(b)(4)(ii) does not require the card issuer to waive or credit the account for interest accrued on the $1,000 purchase since June 30 of year two. If the $1,000 purchase is paid in full on December 31 of year three, the card issuer is not permitted to charge to the account interest accrued on the $1,000 purchase after June 1 of year three.
4.
Contingent or discretionary increases.
Section 226.55(b)(1) permits a card issuer to increase a temporary annual percentage rate, fee, or charge upon the expiration of a specified period of time. However, § 226.55(b)(1) does not permit a card issuer to apply an increased rate, fee, or charge that is contingent on a particular event or occurrence or that may be applied at the card issuer's discretion. The following examples illustrate rate increases that are not permitted by § 226.55
i. Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one that a non-variable annual percentage rate of 15% applies to purchases but that all rates on an account may be increased to a non-variable penalty rate of 30% if a consumer's required minimum periodic payment is received after the payment due date, which is the fifteenth of the month. On March 1, the account has a $2,000 purchase balance. The payment due on March 15 is not received until March 20. Section 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to apply the 30% penalty rate to the $2,000 purchase balance. However, pursuant to § 226.55(b)(3), the card issuer could provide a § 226.9(c) or (g) notice on or before November 16 informing the consumer that, on January 1 of year two, the 30% rate (or a different rate) will apply to new transactions.
ii. Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one that a non-variable annual percentage rate of 5% applies to transferred balances but that this rate will increase to a non-variable rate of 18% if the consumer does not use the account for at least $200 in purchases each billing cycle. On July 1, the consumer transfers a balance of $4,000 to the account. During the October billing cycle, the consumer uses the account for $150 in purchases. Section 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to apply the 18% rate to the $4,000 transferred balance or the $150 in purchases. However, pursuant to § 226.55(b)(3), the card issuer could provide a § 226.9(c) or (g) notice on or before November 16 informing the consumer that, on January 1 of year two, the 18% rate (or a different rate) will apply to new transactions.
iii. Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one that the annual fee for the account is $10 but
may be increased to $50 if a consumer's required minimum periodic payment is received after the payment due date, which is the fifteenth of the month. The payment due on July 15 is not received until July 23. Section 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to impose the $50 annual fee at this time. Furthermore, § 226.55(b)(3) does not permit the card issuer to increase the $10 annual fee during the first year after account opening. However, § 226.55(b)(3) does permit the card issuer to impose the $50 fee (or a different fee) on January 1 of year two if, on or before November 16 of year one, the issuer informs the consumer of the increased fee consistent with § 226.9(c) and the consumer does not reject that increase pursuant to § 226.9(h).
iv. Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one that the annual fee for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan is $0 but may be increased to $100 if the consumer's balance in a deposit account provided by the card issuer or its affiliate or subsidiary falls below $5,000. On June 1 of year one, the balance on the deposit account is $4,500. Section 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to impose the $100 annual fee at this time. Furthermore, § 226.55(b)(3) does not permit the card issuer to increase the $0 annual fee during the first year after account opening. However, § 226.55(b)(3) does permit the card issuer to impose the $100 fee (or a different fee) on January 1 of year two if, on or before November 16 of year one, the issuer informs the consumer of the increased fee consistent with § 226.9(c) and the consumer does not reject that increase pursuant to § 226.9(h).
5.
Application of increased fees and charges.
Section 226.55(b)(1)(ii) limits the ability of a card issuer to apply an increased fee or charge to certain transactions. However, to the extent consistent with § 226.55(b)(3), (c), and (d), a card issuer generally is not prohibited from increasing a fee or charge that applies to the account as a whole.
See
comments 55(c)(1)-3 and 55(d)-1.
55(b)(2) Variable rate exception.
1.
Increases due to increase in index.
Section 226.55(b)(2) provides that an annual percentage rate that varies according to an index that is not under the card issuer's control and is available to the general public may be increased due to an increase in the index. This section does not permit a card issuer to increase the rate by changing the method used to determine a rate that varies with an index (such as by increasing the margin), even if that change will not result in an immediate increase. However, from time to time, a card issuer may change the day on which index values are measured to determine changes to the rate.
2.
Index not under card issuer's control.
A card issuer may increase a variable annual percentage rate pursuant to § 226.55(b)(2) only if the increase is based on an index or indices outside the card issuer's control. For purposes of § 226.55(b)(2), an index is under the card issuer's control if:
i. The index is the card issuer's own prime rate or cost of funds. A card issuer is permitted, however, to use a published prime rate, such as that in the
Wall Street Journal,
even if the card issuer's own prime rate is one of several rates used to establish the published rate.
ii. The variable rate is subject to a fixed minimum rate or similar requirement that does not permit the variable rate to decrease consistent with reductions in the index. A card issuer is permitted, however, to establish a fixed maximum rate that does not permit the variable rate to increase consistent with increases in an index. For example, assume that, under the terms of an account, a variable rate will be adjusted monthly by adding a margin of 5 percentage points to a publicly-available index. When the account is opened, the index is 10% and therefore the variable rate is 15%. If the terms of the account provide that the variable rate will not decrease below 15% even if the index decreases below 10%, the card issuer cannot increase that rate pursuant to § 226.55(b)(2). However, § 226.55(b)(2) does not prohibit the card issuer from providing in the terms of the account that the variable rate will not increase above a certain amount (such as 20%).
iii. The variable rate can be calculated based on any index value during a period of time (such as the 90 days preceding the last day of a billing cycle). A card issuer is permitted, however, to provide in the terms of the account that the variable rate will be calculated based on the average index value during a specified period. In the alternative, the card issuer is permitted to provide in the terms of the account that the variable rate will be calculated based on the index value on a specific day (such as the last day of a billing cycle). For example, assume that the terms of an account provide that a variable rate will be adjusted at the beginning of each quarter by adding a margin of 7 percentage points to a publicly-available index. At account opening at the beginning of the first quarter, the variable rate is 17% (based on an index value of 10%). During the first quarter, the index varies between 9.8% and 10.5% with an average value of 10.1%. On the last day of the first quarter, the index value is 10.2%. At the beginning of the second quarter, § 226.55(b)(2) does not permit the card issuer to increase the variable rate to 17.5% based on the first quarter's maximum index value of 10.5%. However, if the terms of the account provide that the variable rate will be calculated based on the average index value during the prior quarter, § 226.55(b)(2) permits the card issuer to increase the variable rate to 17.1% (based on the average index value of
10.1% during the first quarter). In the alternative, if the terms of the account provide that the variable rate will be calculated based on the index value on the last day of the prior quarter, § 226.55(b)(2) permits the card issuer to increase the variable rate to 17.2% (based on the index value of 10.2% on the last day of the first quarter).
3.
Publicly available.
The index or indices must be available to the public. A publicly-available index need not be published in a newspaper, but it must be one the consumer can independently obtain (by telephone, for example) and use to verify the annual percentage rate applied to the account.
4.
Changing a non-variable rate to a variable rate.
Section 226.55 generally prohibits a card issuer from changing a non-variable annual percentage rate to a variable annual percentage rate because such a change can result in an increase. However, a card issuer may change a non-variable rate to a variable rate to the extent permitted by one of the exceptions in § 226.55(b). For example, § 226.55(b)(1) permits a card issuer to change a non-variable rate to a variable rate upon expiration of a specified period of time. Similarly, following the first year after the account is opened, § 226.55(b)(3) permits a card issuer to change a non-variable rate to a variable rate with respect to new transactions (after complying with the notice requirements in § 226.9(b), (c) or (g)).
5.
Changing a variable rate to a non-variable rate.
Nothing in § 226.55 prohibits a card issuer from changing a variable annual percentage rate to an equal or lower non-variable rate. Whether the non-variable rate is equal to or lower than the variable rate is determined at the time the card issuer provides the notice required by § 226.9(c). For example, assume that on March 1 a variable annual percentage rate that is currently 15% applies to a balance of $2,000 and the card issuer sends a notice pursuant to § 226.9(c) informing the consumer that the variable rate will be converted to a non-variable rate of 14% effective April 15. On April 15, the card issuer may apply the 14% non-variable rate to the $2,000 balance and to new transactions even if the variable rate on March 2 or a later date was less than 14%.
6.
Substitution of index.
A card issuer may change the index and margin used to determine the annual percentage rate under § 226.55(b)(2) if the original index becomes unavailable, as long as historical fluctuations in the original and replacement indices were substantially similar, and as long as the replacement index and margin will produce a rate similar to the rate that was in effect at the time the original index became unavailable. If the replacement index is newly established and therefore does not have any rate history, it may be used if it produces a rate substantially similar to the rate in effect when the original index became unavailable.
55(b)(3) Advance notice exception.
1.
Relationship to § 226.9(h).
A card issuer may not increase a fee or charge required to be disclosed under § 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) pursuant to § 226.55(b)(3) if the consumer has rejected the increased fee or charge pursuant to § 226.9(h).
2.
Notice provided pursuant to § 226.9(b) and (c).
If an increased annual percentage rate, fee, or charge is disclosed pursuant to both § 226.9(b) and (c), that rate, fee, or charge may only be applied to transactions that occur more than 14 days after provision of the § 226.9(c) notice as provided in § 226.55(b)(3)(ii).
3.
Account opening.
i.
Multiple accounts with same card issuer.
When a consumer has a credit card account with a card issuer and the consumer opens a new credit card account with the same card issuer (or its affiliate or subsidiary), the opening of the new account constitutes the opening of a credit card account for purposes of § 226.55(b)(3)(iii) if, more than 30 days after the new account is opened, the consumer has the option to obtain additional extensions of credit on each account. For example, assume that, on January 1 of year one, a consumer opens a credit card account with a card issuer. On July 1 of year one, the consumer opens a second credit card account with that card issuer. On July 15, a $1,000 balance is transferred from the first account to the second account. The opening of the second account constitutes the opening of a credit card account for purposes of § 226.55(b)(3)(iii) so long as, on August 1, the consumer has the option to engage in transactions using either account. Under these circumstances, the card issuer could not increase an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under § 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) on the second account pursuant to § 226.55(b)(3) until July 1 of year two (which is one year after the second account was opened).
ii.
Substitution, replacement or consolidation.
A.
Generally.
A credit card account has not been opened for purposes of § 226.55(b)(3)(iii) when a credit card account issued by a card issuer is substituted, replaced, or consolidated with another credit card account issued by the same card issuer (or its affiliate or subsidiary). Circumstances in which a credit card account has not been opened for purposes of § 226.55(b)(3)(iii) include when:
(1) A retail credit card account is replaced with a cobranded general purpose credit card account that can be used at a wider number of merchants;
(2) A credit card account is replaced with another credit card account offering different features;
(3) A credit card account is consolidated or combined with one or more other credit card accounts into a single credit card account; or
(4) A credit card account acquired through merger or acquisition is replaced with a credit card account issued by the acquiring card issuer.
B.
Limitation.
A card issuer that replaces or consolidates a credit card account with another credit card account issued by the card issuer (or its affiliate or subsidiary) may not increase an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under § 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) in a manner otherwise prohibited by § 226.55. For example, assume that, on January 1 of year one, a consumer opens a credit card account with an annual percentage rate of 15% for purchases. On July 1 of year one, the account is replaced with a credit card account that offers different features (such as rewards on purchases). Under these circumstances, § 226.55(b)(3)(iii) prohibits the card issuer from increasing the annual percentage rate for new purchases to a rate that is higher than 15% pursuant to § 226.55(b)(3) until January 1 of year two (which is one year after the first account was opened).
4.
Examples.
i.
Change-in-terms rate increase; temporary rate increase; 14-day period.
Assume that an account is opened on January 1 of year one. On March 14 of year two, the account has a purchase balance of $2,000 at a non-variable annual percentage rate of 15%. On March 15, the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to § 226.9(c) informing the consumer that the rate for new purchases will increase to a non-variable rate of 18% on May 1. The notice further states that the 18% rate will apply for six months (until November 1) and that thereafter the card issuer will apply a variable rate that is currently 22% and is determined by adding a margin of 12 percentage points to a publicly-available index that is not under the card issuer's control. The fourteenth day after provision of the notice is March 29 and, on that date, the consumer makes a $200 purchase. On March 30, the consumer makes a $1,000 purchase. On May 1, the card issuer may begin accruing interest at 18% on the $1,000 purchase made on March 30 (pursuant to § 226.55(b)(3)). Section 226.55(b)(3)(ii) does not permit the card issuer to apply the 18% rate to the $2,200 purchase balance as of March 29 because that balance reflects transactions that occurred prior to or within 14 days after the provision of the § 226.9(c) notice. After six months (November 2), the card issuer may begin accruing interest on any remaining portion of the $1,000 purchase at the previously-disclosed variable rate determined using the 12-point margin (pursuant to § 226.55(b)(1) and (b)(3)).
ii.
Checks that access an account.
Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one that the annual percentage rate that applies to cash advances is a variable rate that is currently 24% and will be adjusted quarterly by adding a margin of 14 percentage points to a publicly available index not under the card issuer's control. On July 1 of year two, the card issuer provides checks that access the account and, pursuant to § 226.9(b)(3)(i)(A), discloses that a promotional rate of 15% will apply to credit extended by use of the checks until January 1 of year three, after which the cash advance rate determined using the 14-point margin will apply. On July 9 of year two, the consumer uses one of the checks to pay for a $500 transaction. Beginning on January 1 of year three, the card issuer may apply the cash advance rate determined using the 14-point margin to any remaining portion of the $500 transaction (pursuant to § 226.55(b)(1) and (b)(3)).
iii.
Hold on available credit; 14-day period.
Assume that an account is opened on January 1 of year one. On September 14 of year two, the account has a purchase balance of $2,000 at a non-variable annual percentage rate of 17%. On September 15, the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to § 226.9(c) informing the consumer that the rate for new purchases will increase to a non-variable rate of 20% on October 30. The fourteenth day after provision of the notice is September 29. On September 28, the consumer uses the credit card to check into a hotel and the hotel obtains authorization for a $1,000 hold on the account to ensure there is adequate available credit to cover the anticipated cost of the stay.
A. The consumer checks out of the hotel on October 2. The actual cost of the stay is $1,100 because of additional incidental costs. On October 2, the hotel charges the $1,100 transaction to the account. For purposes of § 226.55(b)(3), the transaction occurred on October 2. Therefore, on October 30, § 226.55(b)(3) permits the card issuer to apply the 20% rate to new purchases and to the $1,100 transaction. However, § 226.55(b)(3)(ii) does not permit the card issuer to apply the 20% rate to any remaining portion of the $2,000 purchase balance.
B. Same facts as above except that the consumer checks out of the hotel on September 29. The actual cost of the stay is $250, but the hotel does not charge this amount to the account until November 1. For purposes of § 226.55(b)(3), the card issuer may treat the transaction as occurring more than 14 days after provision of the § 226.9(c) notice (
i.e.,
after September 29). Accordingly, the card issuer may apply the 20% rate to the $250 transaction.
5.
Application of increased fees and charges. See
comment 55(c)(1)-3.
6.
Delayed implementation of increase.
Section 226.55(b)(3)(iii) does not prohibit a card issuer from notifying a consumer of an increase in an annual percentage rate, fee, or
charge consistent with § 226.9(b), (c), or (g). However, § 226.55(b)(3)(iii) does prohibit application of an increased rate, fee, or charge during the first year after the account is opened, while the account is closed, or while the card issuer does not permit the consumer to use the account for new transactions. If § 226.9(b), (c), or (g) permits a card issuer to apply an increased rate, fee, or charge on a particular date and the account is closed on that date or the card issuer does not permit the consumer to use the account for new transactions on that date, the card issuer may delay application of the increased rate, fee, or charge until the first day of the following billing cycle without relinquishing the ability to apply that rate, fee, or charge (assuming the increase is otherwise consistent with § 226.55).
See
examples in comment 55(b)-2.iii. However, if the account is closed or the card issuer does not permit the consumer to use the account for new transactions on the first day of the following billing cycle, then the card issuer must provide a new notice of the increased rate, fee, or charge consistent with § 226.9(b), (c), or (g).
7.
Date on which account may first be used by consumer to engage in transactions.
For purposes of § 226.55(b)(3)(iii), an account is considered open no earlier than the date on which the account may first be used by the consumer to engage in transactions. An account is considered open for purposes of § 226.55(b)(3)(iii) on any date that the card issuer may consider the account open for purposes of § 226.52(a)(1).
See
comment 52(a)(1)-4.
55(b)(4) Delinquency exception.
1.
Receipt of required minimum periodic payment within 60 days of due date.
Section 226.55(b)(4) applies when a card issuer has not received the consumer's required minimum periodic payment within 60 days after the due date for that payment. In order to satisfy this condition, a card issuer that requires monthly minimum payments generally must not have received two consecutive required minimum periodic payments. Whether a required minimum periodic payment has been received for purposes of § 226.55(b)(4) depends on whether the amount received is equal to or more than the first outstanding required minimum periodic payment. For example, assume that the required minimum periodic payments for a credit card account are due on the fifteenth day of the month. On May 13, the card issuer has not received the $50 required minimum periodic payment due on March 15 or the $150 required minimum periodic payment due on April 15. The sixtieth day after the March 15 payment due date is May 14. If the card issuer receives a $50 payment on May 14, § 226.55(b)(4) does not apply because the payment is equal to the required minimum periodic payment due on March 15 and therefore the account is not more than 60 days delinquent. However, if the card issuer instead received a $40 payment on May 14, § 226.55(b)(4) would apply beginning on May 15 because the payment is less than the required minimum periodic payment due on March 15. Furthermore, if the card issuer received the $50 payment on May 15, § 226.55(b)(4) would apply because the card issuer did not receive the required minimum periodic payment due on March 15 within 60 days after the due date for that payment.
2.
Relationship to § 226.9(g)(3)(i)(B).
A card issuer that has complied with the disclosure requirements in § 226.9(g)(3)(i)(B) has also complied with the disclosure requirements in § 226.55(b)(4)(i).
3.
Reduction in rate pursuant to § 226.55(b)(4)(ii).
Section 226.55(b)(4)(ii) provides that, if the card issuer receives six consecutive required minimum periodic payments on or before the payment due date beginning with the first payment due following the effective date of the increase, the card issuer must reduce any annual percentage rate, fee, or charge increased pursuant to § 226.55(b)(4) to the annual percentage rate, fee, or charge that applied prior to the increase with respect to transactions that occurred prior to or within 14 days after provision of the § 226.9(c) or (g) notice.
i.
Six consecutive payments immediately following effective date of increase.
Section 226.55(b)(4)(ii) does not apply if the card issuer does not receive six consecutive required minimum periodic payments on or before the payment due date beginning with the payment due immediately following the effective date of the increase, even if, at some later point in time, the card issuer receives six consecutive required minimum periodic payments on or before the payment due date.
ii.
Rate, fee, or charge that does not exceed rate, fee, or charge that applied before increase.
Although § 226.55(b)(4)(ii) requires the card issuer to reduce an annual percentage rate, fee, or charge increased pursuant to § 226.55(b)(4) to the annual percentage rate, fee, or charge that applied prior to the increase, this provision does not prohibit the card issuer from applying an increased annual percentage rate, fee, or charge consistent with any of the other exceptions in § 226.55(b). For example, if a temporary rate applied prior to the § 226.55(b)(4) increase and the temporary rate expired before a reduction in rate pursuant to § 226.55(b)(4)(ii), the card issuer may apply an increased rate to the extent consistent with § 226.55(b)(1). Similarly, if a variable rate applied prior to the § 226.55(b)(4) increase, the card issuer may apply any increase in that variable rate to the extent consistent with § 226.55(b)(2).
iii.
Delayed implementation of reduction.
If § 226.55(b)(4)(ii) requires a card issuer to reduce an annual percentage rate, fee, or charge on a date that is not the first day of
a billing cycle, the card issuer may delay application of the reduced rate, fee, or charge until the first day of the following billing cycle.
iv.
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of § 226.55(b)(4)(ii):
A. Assume that the billing cycles for an account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the required minimum periodic payments are due on the fifteenth day of the month. Assume also that the account has a $5,000 purchase balance to which a non-variable annual percentage rate of 15% applies. On May 16 of year one, the card issuer has not received the required minimum periodic payments due on the fifteenth day of March, April, or May and sends a § 226.9(c) or (g) notice stating that the annual percentage rate applicable to the $5,000 balance and to new transactions will increase to 28% effective July 1. On July 1, § 226.55(b)(4) permits the card issuer to apply the 28% rate to the $5,000 balance and to new transactions. The card issuer receives the required minimum periodic payments due on the fifteenth day of July, August, September, October, November, and December. On January 1 of year two, § 226.55(b)(4)(ii) requires the card issuer to reduce the rate that applies to any remaining portion of the $5,000 balance to 15%. The card issuer is not required to reduce the rate that applies to any transactions that occurred on or after May 31 (which is the fifteenth day after provision of the § 226.9(c) or (g) notice).
B. Same facts as paragraph iv.A. above except that the 15% rate that applied to the $5,000 balance prior to the § 226.55(b)(4) increase was scheduled to increase to 20% on August 1 of year one (pursuant to § 226.55(b)(1)). On January 1 of year two, § 226.55(b)(4)(ii) requires the card issuer to reduce the rate that applies to any remaining portion of the $5,000 balance to 20%.
C. Same facts as paragraph iv.A. above except that the 15% rate that applied to the $5,000 balance prior to the § 226.55(b)(4) increase was scheduled to increase to 20% on March 1 of year two (pursuant to § 226.55(b)(1)). On January 1 of year two, § 226.55(b)(4)(ii) requires the card issuer to reduce the rate that applies to any remaining portion of the $5,000 balance to 15%.
D. Same facts as paragraph iv.A. above except that the 15% rate that applied to the $5,000 balance prior to the § 226.55(b)(4) increase was a variable rate that was determined by adding a margin of 10 percentage points to a publicly-available index not under the card issuer's control (consistent with § 226.55(b)(2)). On January 1 of year two, § 226.55(b)(4)(ii) requires the card issuer to reduce the rate that applies to any remaining portion of the $5,000 balance to the variable rate determined using the 10-point margin.
E. For an example of the application of § 226.55(b)(4)(ii) to deferred interest or similar programs, see comment 55(b)(1)-3.ii.C.
55(b)(5) Workout and temporary hardship arrangement exception.
1.
Scope of exception.
Nothing in § 226.55(b)(5) permits a card issuer to alter the requirements of § 226.55 pursuant to a workout or temporary hardship arrangement. For example, a card issuer cannot increase an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under § 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) pursuant to a workout or temporary hardship arrangement unless otherwise permitted by § 226.55. In addition, a card issuer cannot require the consumer to make payments with respect to a protected balance that exceed the payments permitted under § 226.55(c).
2.
Relationship to § 226.9(c)(2)(v)(D).
A card issuer that has complied with the disclosure requirements in § 226.9(c)(2)(v)(D) has also complied with the disclosure requirements in § 226.55(b)(5)(i). See comment 9(c)(2)(v)-10. Thus, although the disclosures required by § 226.55(b)(5)(i) must generally be provided in writing prior to commencement of the arrangement, a card issuer may comply with § 226.55(b)(5)(i) by complying with § 226.9(c)(2)(v)(D), which states that the disclosure of the terms of the arrangement may be made orally by telephone, provided that the card issuer mails or delivers a written disclosure of the terms of the arrangement to the consumer as soon as reasonably practicable after the oral disclosure is provided.
3.
Rate, fee, or charge that does not exceed rate, fee, or charge that applied before workout or temporary hardship arrangement.
Upon the completion or failure of a workout or temporary hardship arrangement, § 226.55(b)(5)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from applying to any transactions that occurred prior to commencement of the arrangement an annual percentage rate, fee, or charge that exceeds the annual percentage rate, fee, or charge that applied to those transactions prior to commencement of the arrangement. However, this provision does not prohibit the card issuer from applying an increased annual percentage rate, fee, or charge upon completion or failure of the arrangement, to the extent consistent with any of the other exceptions in § 226.55(b). For example, if a temporary rate applied prior to the arrangement and that rate expired during the arrangement, the card issuer may apply an increased rate upon completion or failure of the arrangement to the extent consistent with § 226.55(b)(1). Similarly, if a variable rate applied prior to the arrangement, the card issuer may apply any increase in that variable rate upon completion or failure of the arrangement to the extent consistent with § 226.55(b)(2).
4.
Examples.
i. Assume that an account is subject to a $50 annual fee and that, consistent with § 226.55(b)(4), the margin used to determine a variable annual percentage rate that applies to a $5,000 balance is increased from 5 percentage points to 15 percentage points. Assume also that the card issuer and the consumer subsequently agree to a workout arrangement that reduces the annual fee to $0 and reduces the margin back to 5 points on the condition that the consumer pay a specified amount by the payment due date each month. If the consumer does not pay the agreed-upon amount by the payment due date, § 226.55(b)(5) permits the card issuer to increase the annual fee to $50 and increase the margin for the variable rate that applies to the $5,000 balance up to 15 percentage points.
ii. Assume that a consumer fails to make four consecutive monthly minimum payments totaling $480 on a consumer credit card account with a balance of $6,000 and that, consistent with § 226.55(b)(4), the annual percentage rate that applies to that balance is increased from a non-variable rate of 15% to a non-variable penalty rate of 30%. Assume also that the card issuer and the consumer subsequently agree to a temporary hardship arrangement that reduces all rates on the account to 0% on the condition that the consumer pay an amount by the payment due date each month that is sufficient to cure the $480 delinquency within six months. If the consumer pays the agreed-upon amount by the payment due date during the six-month period and cures the delinquency, § 226.55(b)(5) permits the card issuer to increase the rate that applies to any remaining portion of the $6,000 balance to 15% or any other rate up to the 30% penalty rate.
55(b)(6) Servicemembers Civil Relief Act exception.
1.
Rate that does not exceed rate that applied before decrease.
Once 50 U.S.C. app. 527 no longer applies, § 226.55(b)(6) prohibits a card issuer from applying an annual percentage rate to any transactions that occurred prior to a decrease in rate pursuant to 50 U.S.C. app. 527 that exceeds the rate that applied to those transactions prior to the decrease. However, this provision does not prohibit the card issuer from applying an increased annual percentage rate once 50 U.S.C. app. 527 no longer applies, to the extent consistent with any of the other exceptions in § 226.55(b). For example, if a temporary rate applied prior to the decrease and that rate expired during the period that 50 U.S.C. app. 527 applied to the account, the card issuer may apply an increased rate once 50 U.S.C. app. 527 no longer applies to the extent consistent with § 226.55(b)(1). Similarly, if a variable rate applied prior to the decrease, the card issuer may apply any increase in that variable rate once 50 U.S.C. app. 527 no longer applies to the extent consistent with § 226.55(b)(2).
2.
Example.
Assume that on December 31 of year one the annual percentage rate that applies to a $5,000 balance on a credit card account is a variable rate that is determined by adding a margin of 10 percentage points to a publicly-available index that is not under the card issuer's control. On January 1 of year two, the card issuer reduces the rate that applies to the $5,000 balance to a non-variable rate of 6% pursuant to 50 U.S.C. app. 527. On January 1 of year three, 50 U.S.C. app. 527 ceases to apply and the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to § 226.9(c) informing the consumer that on February 15 of year three the variable rate determined using the 10-point margin will apply to any remaining portion of the $5,000 balance. On February 15 of year three, § 226.55(b)(6) permits the card issuer to begin accruing interest on any remaining portion of the $5,000 balance at the variable rate determined using the 10-point margin.
55(c) Treatment of protected balances.
55(c)(1) Definition of protected balance.
1.
Example of protected balance.
Assume that, on March 15 of year two, an account has a purchase balance of $1,000 at a non-variable annual percentage rate of 12% and that, on March 16, the card issuer sends a notice pursuant to § 226.9(c) informing the consumer that the annual percentage rate for new purchases will increase to a non-variable rate of 15% on May 1. The fourteenth day after provision of the notice is March 29. On March 29, the consumer makes a $100 purchase. On March 30, the consumer makes a $150 purchase. On May 1, § 226.55(b)(3)(ii) permits the card issuer to begin accruing interest at 15% on the $150 purchase made on March 30 but does not permit the card issuer to apply that 15% rate to the $1,100 purchase balance as of March 29. Accordingly, the protected balance for purposes of § 226.55(c) is the $1,100 purchase balance as of March 29. The $150 purchase made on March 30 is not part of the protected balance.
2.
First year after account opening.
Section 226.55(c) applies to amounts owed for a category of transactions to which an increased annual percentage rate or an increased fee or charge cannot be applied after the rate, fee, or charge for that category of transactions has been increased pursuant to § 226.55(b)(3). Because § 226.55(b)(3)(iii) does not permit a card issuer to increase an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under § 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) during the first year after account opening, § 226.55(c) does not apply to balances during the first year after account opening.
3.
Increased fees and charges.
Except as provided in § 226.55(b)(3)(iii), § 226.55(b)(3) permits a card issuer to increase a fee or charge required to be disclosed under § 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) after complying with
the applicable notice requirements in § 226.9(b) or (c), provided that the increased fee or charge is not applied to a protected balance. To the extent consistent with § 226.55(b)(3)(iii), a card issuer is not prohibited from increasing a fee or charge that applies to the account as a whole or to balances other than the protected balance. For example, after the first year following account opening, a card issuer generally may add or increase an annual or a monthly maintenance fee for an account after complying with the notice requirements in § 226.9(c), including notifying the consumer of the right to reject the new or increased fee under § 226.9(h). However, except as otherwise provided in § 226.55(b), an increased fee or charge cannot be applied to an account while the account is closed or while the card issuer does not permit the consumer to use the account for new transactions.
See
§ 226.55(b)(3)(iii);
see also
§§ 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(
3
) and 226.55(d)(1). Furthermore, if the consumer rejects an increase in a fee or charge pursuant to § 226.9(h), the card issuer is prohibited from applying the increased fee or charge to the account and from imposing any other fee or charge solely as a result of the rejection.
See
§ 226.9(h)(2)(i) and (ii); comment 9(h)(2)(ii)-2.
4.
Changing balance computation method.
Nothing in § 226.55 prohibits a card issuer from changing the balance computation method that applies to new transactions as well as protected balances.
55(c)(2) Repayment of protected balance.
1.
No less beneficial to the consumer.
A card issuer may provide a method of repaying the protected balance that is different from the methods listed in § 226.55(c)(2) so long as the method used is no less beneficial to the consumer than one of the listed methods. A method is no less beneficial to the consumer if the method results in a required minimum periodic payment that is equal to or less than a minimum payment calculated using the method for the account before the effective date of the increase. Similarly, a method is no less beneficial to the consumer if the method amortizes the balance in five years or longer or if the method results in a required minimum periodic payment that is equal to or less than a minimum payment calculated consistent with § 226.55(c)(2)(iii). For example:
i. If at account opening the cardholder agreement stated that the required minimum periodic payment would be either the total of fees and interest charges plus 1% of the total amount owed or $20 (whichever is greater), the card issuer may require the consumer to make a minimum payment of $20 even if doing so would pay off the balance in less than five years or constitute more than 2% of the balance plus fees and interest charges.
ii. A card issuer could increase the percentage of the balance included in the required minimum periodic payment from 2% to 5% so long as doing so would not result in amortization of the balance in less than five years.
iii. A card issuer could require the consumer to make a required minimum periodic payment that amortizes the balance in four years so long as doing so would not more than double the percentage of the balance included in the minimum payment prior to the date on which the increased annual percentage rate, fee, or charge became effective.
55(c)(2)(ii) Five-year amortization period.
1.
Amortization period starting from effective date of increase.
Section 226.55(c)(2)(ii) provides for an amortization period for the protected balance of no less than five years, starting from the date on which the increased annual percentage rate or fee or charge required to be disclosed under § 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) became effective. A card issuer is not required to recalculate the required minimum periodic payment for the protected balance if, during the amortization period, that balance is reduced as a result of the allocation of payments by the consumer in excess of that minimum payment consistent with § 226.53 or any other practice permitted by these rules and other applicable law.
2.
Amortization when applicable rate is variable.
If the annual percentage rate that applies to the protected balance varies with an index, the card issuer may adjust the interest charges included in the required minimum periodic payment for that balance accordingly in order to ensure that the balance is amortized in five years. For example, assume that a variable rate that is currently 15% applies to a protected balance and that, in order to amortize that balance in five years, the required minimum periodic payment must include a specific amount of principal plus all accrued interest charges. If the 15% variable rate increases due to an increase in the index, the creditor may increase the required minimum periodic payment to include the additional interest charges.
55(c)(2)(iii) Doubling repayment rate.
1.
Portion of required minimum periodic payment on other balances.
Section 226.55(c)(2)(iii) addresses the portion of the required minimum periodic payment based on the protected balance. Section 226.55(c)(2)(iii) does not limit or otherwise address the card issuer's ability to determine the portion of the required minimum periodic payment based on other balances on the account or the card issuer's ability to apply that portion of the minimum payment to the balances on the account.
2.
Example.
Assume that the method used by a card issuer to calculate the required minimum periodic payment for a credit card
account requires the consumer to pay either the total of fees and accrued interest charges plus 2% of the total amount owed or $50, whichever is greater. Assume also that the account has a purchase balance of $2,000 at an annual percentage rate of 15% and a cash advance balance of $500 at an annual percentage rate of 20% and that the card issuer increases the rate for purchases to 18% but does not increase the rate for cash advances. Under § 226.55(c)(2)(iii), the card issuer may require the consumer to pay fees and interest plus 4% of the $2,000 purchase balance. Section 226.55(c)(2)(iii) does not limit the card issuer's ability to increase the portion of the required minimum periodic payment that is based on the cash advance balance.
55(d) Continuing application.
1.
Closed accounts.
If a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan with a balance is closed, § 226.55 continues to apply to that balance. For example, if a card issuer or a consumer closes a credit card account with a balance, § 226.55(d)(1) prohibits the card issuer from increasing the annual percentage rate that applies to that balance or imposing a periodic fee based solely on that balance that was not charged before the account was closed (such as a closed account fee) unless permitted by one of the exceptions in § 226.55(b).
2.
Acquired accounts.
If, through merger or acquisition (for example), a card issuer acquires a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan with a balance, § 226.55 continues to apply to that balance. For example, if a credit card account has a $1,000 purchase balance with an annual percentage rate of 15% and the card issuer that acquires that account applies an 18% rate to purchases, § 226.55(d)(1) prohibits the card issuer from applying the 18% rate to the $1,000 balance unless permitted by one of the exceptions in § 226.55(b).
3.
Balance transfers.
i.
Between accounts issued by the same creditor.
If a balance is transferred from a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan issued by a creditor to another credit account issued by the same creditor or its affiliate or subsidiary, § 226.55 continues to apply to that balance. For example, if a credit card account has a $2,000 purchase balance with an annual percentage rate of 15% and that balance is transferred to another credit card account issued by the same creditor that applies an 18% rate to purchases, § 226.55(d)(2) prohibits the creditor from applying the 18% rate to the $2,000 balance unless permitted by one of the exceptions in § 226.55(b). However, the creditor would not generally be prohibited from charging a new periodic fee (such as an annual fee) on the second account so long as the fee is not based solely on the $2,000 balance and the creditor has notified the consumer of the fee either by providing written notice 45 days before imposing the fee pursuant to § 226.9(c) or by providing account-opening disclosures pursuant to § 226.6(b). See also § 226.55(b)(3)(iii); comment 55(b)(3)-3; comment 5(b)(1)(i)-6. Additional circumstances in which a balance is considered transferred for purposes of § 226.55(d)(2) include when:
A. A retail credit card account with a balance is replaced or substituted with a cobranded general purpose credit card account that can be used with a broader merchant base;
B. A credit card account with a balance is replaced or substituted with another credit card account offering different features;
C. A credit card account with a balance is consolidated or combined with one or more other credit card accounts into a single credit card account; and
D. A credit card account is replaced or substituted with a line of credit that can be accessed solely by an account number.
ii.
Between accounts issued by different creditors.
If a balance is transferred to a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan issued by a creditor from a credit card account issued by a different creditor or an institution that is not an affiliate or subsidiary of the creditor that issued the account to which the balance is transferred, § 226.55(d)(2) does not prohibit the creditor to which the balance is transferred from applying its account terms to that balance, provided that those terms comply with this part. For example, if a credit card account issued by creditor A has a $1,000 purchase balance at an annual percentage rate of 15% and the consumer transfers that balance to a credit card account with a purchase rate of 17% issued by creditor B, creditor B may apply the 17% rate to the $1,000 balance. However, creditor B may not subsequently increase the rate on that balance unless permitted by one of the exceptions in § 226.55(b).
55(e) Promotional waivers or rebates of interest, fees, and other charges.
1.
Generally.
Nothing in § 226.55 prohibits a card issuer from waiving or rebating finance charges due to a periodic interest rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under § 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii). However, if a card issuer promotes and applies the waiver or rebate to an account, the card issuer cannot temporarily or permanently cease or terminate any portion of the waiver or rebate on that account unless permitted by one of the exceptions in § 226.55(b). For example
i. A card issuer applies an annual percentage rate of 15% to balance transfers but promotes a program under which all of the interest accrued on transferred balances will be waived or rebated for one year. If, prior to the commencement of the one-year period,
the card issuer discloses the length of the period and the annual percentage rate that will apply to transferred balances after expiration of that period consistent with § 226.55(b)(1)(i), § 226.55(b)(1) permits the card issuer to begin imposing interest charges on transferred balances after one year. Furthermore, if, during the one-year period, a required minimum periodic payment is not received within 60 days of the payment due date, § 226.55(b)(4) permits the card issuer to begin imposing interest charges on transferred balances (after providing a notice consistent with § 226.9(g) and § 226.55(b)(4)(i)). However, if a required minimum periodic payment is not more than 60 days delinquent or if the consumer otherwise violates the terms or other requirements of the account, § 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to begin imposing interest charges on transferred balances until the expiration of the one-year period.
ii. A card issuer imposes a monthly maintenance fee of $10 but promotes a program under which the fee will be waived or rebated for the six months following account opening. If, prior to account opening, the card issuer discloses the length of the period and the monthly maintenance fee that will be imposed after expiration of that period consistent with § 226.55(b)(1)(i), § 226.55(b)(1) permits the card issuer to begin imposing the monthly maintenance fee six months after account opening. Furthermore, if, during the six-month period, a required minimum periodic payment is not received within 60 days of the payment due date, § 226.55(b)(4) permits the card issuer to begin imposing the monthly maintenance fee (after providing a notice consistent with § 226.9(c) and § 226.55(b)(4)(i)). However, if a required minimum periodic payment is not more than 60 days delinquent or if the consumer otherwise violates the terms or other requirements of the account, § 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to begin imposing the monthly maintenance fee until the expiration of the six-month period.
2.
Promotion of waiver or rebate.
For purposes of § 226.55(e), a card issuer generally promotes a waiver or rebate if the card issuer discloses the waiver or rebate in an advertisement (as defined in § 226.2(a)(2)).
See
comment 2(a)(2)-1. In addition, a card issuer generally promotes a waiver or rebate for purposes of § 226.55(e) if the card issuer discloses the waiver or rebate in communications regarding existing accounts (such as communications regarding a promotion that encourages additional or different uses of an existing account). However, a card issuer does not promote a waiver or rebate for purposes of § 226.55(e) if the advertisement or communication relates to an inquiry or dispute about a specific charge or to interest, fees, or charges that have already been waived or rebated.
i.
Examples of promotional communications.
The following are examples of circumstances in which a card issuer is promoting a waiver or rebate for purposes of § 226.55(e)
A. A card issuer discloses the waiver or rebate in a newspaper, magazine, leaflet, promotional flyer, catalog, sign, or point-of-sale display, unless the disclosure relates to interest, fees, or charges that have already been waived.
B. A card issuer discloses the waiver or rebate on radio or television or through electronic advertisements (such as on the Internet), unless the disclosure relates to interest, fees, or charges that have already been waived or rebated.
C. A card issuer discloses a waiver or rebate to individual consumers, such as by telephone, letter, or electronic communication, through direct mail literature, or on or with account statements, unless the disclosure relates to an inquiry or dispute about a specific charge or to interest, fees, or charges that have already been waived or rebated.
ii.
Examples of non-promotional communications.
The following are examples of circumstances in which a card issuer is not promoting a waiver or rebate for purposes of § 226.55(e)
A. After a card issuer has waived or rebated interest, fees, or other charges subject to § 226.55 with respect to an account, the issuer discloses the waiver or rebate to the accountholder on the periodic statement or by telephone, letter, or electronic communication. However, if the card issuer also discloses prospective waivers or rebates in the same communication, the issuer is promoting a waiver or rebate for purposes of § 226.55(e).
B. A card issuer communicates with a consumer about a waiver or rebate of interest, fees, or other charges subject to § 226.55 in relation to an inquiry or dispute about a specific charge, including a dispute under §§ 226.12 or 226.13.
C. A card issuer waives or rebates interest, fees, or other charges subject to § 226.55 in order to comply with a legal requirement (such as the limitations in § 226.52(a)).
D. A card issuer discloses a grace period, as defined in § 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(
3
).
E. A card issuer provides a period after the payment due date during which interest, fees, or other charges subject to § 226.55 are waived or rebated even if a payment has not been received.
F. A card issuer provides benefits (such as rewards points or cash back on purchases or finance charges) that can be applied to the account as credits, provided that the benefits are not promoted as reducing interest, fees, or other charges subject to § 226.55.
3.
Relationship of § 226.55(e) to grace period.
Section 226.55(e) does not apply to the waiver
of finance charges due to a periodic rate consistent with a grace period, as defined in § 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(
3
).

# Section 226.56—Requirements for Over-the-Limit Transactions
56(b) Opt-in requirement.
1.
Policy and practice of declining over-the-limit transactions.
Section 226.56(b)(1)(i)-(v), including the requirements to provide notice and obtain consumer consent, do not apply to any card issuer that has a policy and practice of declining to pay any over-the-limit transactions for the consumer's credit card account when the card issuer has a reasonable belief that completing a transaction will cause the consumer to exceed the consumer's credit limit for that account. For example, if a card issuer only authorizes those transactions which, at the time of authorization, would not cause the consumer to exceed a credit limit, it is not subject to the requirement to provide consumers notice and an opportunity to affirmatively consent to the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions. However, if an over-the-limit transaction is paid without the consumer providing affirmative consent, the card issuer may not charge a fee for paying the transaction.
2.
Over-the-limit transactions not required to be authorized or paid.
Section 226.56 does not require a card issuer to authorize or pay an over-the-limit transaction even if the consumer has affirmatively consented to the card issuer's over-the-limit service.
3.
Examples of reasonable opportunity to provide affirmative consent.
A card issuer provides a reasonable opportunity for the consumer to provide affirmative consent to the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions when, among other things, it provides reasonable methods by which the consumer may affirmatively consent. A card issuer provides such reasonable methods if—
i.
On the application.
The card issuer provides the notice on the application form that the consumer can fill out to request the service as part of the application;
ii.
By mail.
The card issuer provides a form with the account-opening disclosures or the periodic statement for the consumer to fill out and mail to affirmatively request the service;
iii.
By telephone.
The card issuer provides a readily available telephone line that consumers may call to provide affirmative consent.
iv.
By electronic means.
The card issuer provides an electronic means for the consumer to affirmatively consent. For example, a card issuer could provide a form that can be accessed and processed at its Web site, where the consumer can check a box to opt in and confirm that choice by clicking on a button that affirms the consumer's consent.
4.
Separate consent required.
A consumer's affirmative consent, or opt-in, to a card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions must be obtained separately from other consents or acknowledgments obtained by the card issuer. For example, a consumer's signature on a credit application to request a credit card would not by itself sufficiently evidence the consumer's consent to the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions. However, a card issuer may obtain a consumer's affirmative consent by providing a blank signature line or a check box on the application that the consumer can sign or select to request the over-the-limit service, provided that the signature line or check box is used solely for purposes of evidencing the choice and not for any other purpose, such as to also obtain consumer consents for other account services or features or to receive disclosures electronically.
5.
Written confirmation.
A card issuer may comply with the requirement in § 226.56(b)(1)(iv) to provide written confirmation of the consumer's decision to affirmatively consent, or opt in, to the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions by providing the consumer a copy of the consumer's completed opt-in form or by sending a letter or notice to the consumer acknowledging that the consumer has elected to opt into the card issuer's service. A card issuer may also satisfy the written confirmation requirement by providing the confirmation on the first periodic statement sent after the consumer has opted in. For example, a card issuer could provide a written notice consistent with § 226.56(e)(2) on the periodic statement. A card issuer may not, however, assess any over-the-limit fees or charges on the consumer's credit card account unless and until the card issuer has sent the written confirmation. Thus, if a card issuer elects to provide written confirmation on the first periodic statement after the consumer has opted in, it would not be permitted to assess any over-the-limit fees or charges until the next statement cycle.
56(b)(2) Completion of over-the-limit transactions without consumer consent.
1.
Examples of over-the-limit transactions paid without consumer consent.
Section 226.56(b)(2) provides that a card issuer may pay an over-the-limit transaction even if the consumer has not provided affirmative consent, so long as the card issuer does not impose a fee or charge for paying the transaction. The prohibition on imposing fees for paying an over-the-limit transaction applies even in circumstances where the card issuer is unable to avoid paying a transaction that exceeds the consumer's credit limit.
i.
Transactions not submitted for authorization.
A consumer has not affirmatively consented to a card issuer's payment of over-
the-limit transactions. The consumer purchases a $3 cup of coffee using his credit card. Because of the small dollar amount of the transaction, the merchant does not submit the transaction to the card issuer for authorization. The transaction causes the consumer to exceed the credit limit. Under these circumstances, the card issuer is prohibited from imposing a fee or charge on the consumer's credit card account for paying the over-the-limit transaction because the consumer has not opted in to the card issuer's over-the-limit service.
ii.
Settlement amount exceeds authorization amount.
A consumer has not affirmatively consented to a card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions. The consumer uses his credit card at a pay-at-the-pump fuel dispenser to purchase $50 of fuel. Before permitting the consumer to use the fuel pump, the merchant verifies the validity of the card by requesting an authorization hold of $1. The subsequent $50 transaction amount causes the consumer to exceed his credit limit. Under these circumstances, the card issuer is prohibited from imposing a fee or charge on the consumer's credit card account for paying the over-the-limit transaction because the consumer has not opted in to the card issuer's over-the-limit service.
iii.
Intervening charges.
A consumer has not affirmatively consented to a card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions. The consumer makes a $50 purchase using his credit card. However, before the $50 transaction is charged to the consumer's account, a separate recurring charge is posted to the account. The $50 purchase then causes the consumer to exceed his credit limit. Under these circumstances, the card issuer is prohibited from imposing a fee or charge on the consumer's credit card account for paying the over-the-limit transaction because the consumer has not opted in to the card issuer's over-the-limit service.
2.
Permissible fees or charges when a consumer has not consented.
Section 226.56(b)(2) does not preclude a card issuer from assessing fees or charges other than over-the-limit fees when an over-the-limit transaction is completed. For example, if a consumer has not opted in, the card issuer may assess a balance transfer fee in connection with a balance transfer, provided such a fee is assessed whether or not the transfer exceeds the credit limit. Section 226.56(b)(2) does not limit the card issuer's ability to debit the consumer's account for the amount of the over-the-limit transaction if the card issuer is permitted to do so under applicable law. The card issuer may also assess interest charges in connection with the over-the-limit transaction.
56(c) Method of election.
1.
Card issuer-determined methods.
A card issuer may determine the means available to consumers to affirmatively consent, or opt in, to the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions. For example, a card issuer may decide to obtain consents in writing, electronically, or orally, or through some combination of these methods. Section 226.56(c) further requires, however, that such methods must be made equally available for consumers to revoke a prior consent. Thus, for example, if a card issuer allows a consumer to consent in writing or electronically, it must also allow the consumer to revoke that consent in writing or electronically.
2.
Electronic requests.
A consumer consent or revocation request submitted electronically is not considered a consumer disclosure for purposes of the E-Sign Act.
56(d) Timing and placement of notices.
1.
Contemporaneous notice for oral or electronic consent.
Under § 226.56(d)(1)(ii), if a card issuer seeks to obtain consent from the consumer orally or by electronic means, the card issuer must provide a notice containing the disclosures in § 226.56(e)(1) prior to and as part of the process of obtaining the consumer's consent.
56(e) Content.
1.
Amount of over-the-limit fee.
See Model Forms G-25(A) and G-25(B) for guidance on how to disclose the amount of the over-the-limit fee.
2.
Notice content.
In describing the consumer's right to affirmatively consent to a card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions, the card issuer may explain that any transactions that exceed the consumer's credit limit will be declined if the consumer does not consent to the service. In addition, the card issuer should explain that even if a consumer consents, the payment of over-the-limit transactions is at the discretion of the card issuer. For example, the card issuer may indicate that it may decline a transaction for any reason, such as if the consumer is past due or significantly over the limit. The card issuer may also disclose the consumer's right to revoke consent.
56(f) Joint relationships.
1.
Authorized users.
Section 226.56(f) does not permit a card issuer to treat a request to opt in to or to revoke a prior request for the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions from an authorized user that is not jointly liable on a credit card account as a consent or revocation request for that account.
56(g) Continuing right to opt in or revoke opt-in.
1.
Fees or charges for over-the-limit transactions incurred prior to revocation.
Section 226.56(g) provides that a consumer may revoke his or her prior consent at any time. If a consumer does so, this provision does not require the card issuer to waive or reverse any over-the-limit fees or charges assessed to the consumer's account for transactions
that occurred prior to the card issuer's implementation of the consumer's revocation request. Nor does this requirement prevent the card issuer from assessing over-the-limit fees in subsequent cycles if the consumer's account balance continues to exceed the credit limit after the payment due date as a result of an over-the-limit transaction that occurred prior to the consumer's revocation of consent.
56(h) Duration of opt-in.
1.
Card issuer ability to stop paying over-the-limit transactions after consumer consent.
A card issuer may cease paying over-the-limit transactions for consumers that have previously opted in at any time and for any reason. For example, a card issuer may stop paying over-the-limit transactions for a consumer to respond to changes in the credit risk presented by the consumer.
56(j) Prohibited practices.
1.
Periodic fees or charges.
A card issuer may charge an over-the-limit fee or charge only if the consumer has exceeded the credit limit during the billing cycle. Thus, a card issuer may not impose any recurring or periodic fees for paying over-the-limit transactions (for example, a monthly “over-the-limit protection” service fee), even if the consumer has affirmatively consented to or opted in to the service, unless the consumer has in fact exceeded the credit limit during that cycle.
2.
Examples of limits on fees or charges imposed per billing cycle.
Section 226.56(j)(1) generally prohibits a card issuer from assessing a fee or charge due to the same over-the-limit transaction for more than three billing cycles. The following examples illustrate the prohibition.
i. Assume that a consumer has opted into a card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions. The consumer exceeds the credit limit during the December billing cycle and does not make sufficient payment to bring the account balance back under the limit for four consecutive cycles. The consumer does not engage in any additional transactions during this period. In this case, § 226.56(j)(1) would permit the card issuer to charge a maximum of three over-the-limit fees for the December over-the-limit transaction.
ii. Assume the same facts as above except that the consumer makes sufficient payment to reduce his account balance by the payment due date during the February billing cycle. The card issuer may charge over-the-limit fees for the December and January billing cycles. However, because the consumer's account balance was below the credit limit by the payment due date for the February billing cycle, the card issuer may not charge an over-the-limit fee for the February billing cycle.
iii. Assume the same facts as in paragraph i., except that the consumer engages in another over-the-limit transaction during the February billing cycle. Because the consumer has obtained an additional extension of credit which causes the consumer to exceed his credit limit, the card issuer may charge over-the-limit fees for the December transaction on the January, February and March billing statements, and additional over-the-limit fees for the February transaction on the April and May billing statements. The card issuer may not charge an over-the-limit fee for each of the December and the February transactions on the March billing statement because it is prohibited from imposing more than one over-the-limit fee during a billing cycle.
3.
Replenishment of credit line.
Section 226.56(j)(2) does not prevent a card issuer from delaying replenishment of a consumer's available credit where appropriate, for example, where the card issuer may suspect fraud on the credit card account. However, a card issuer may not assess an over-the-limit fee or charge if the over-the-limit transaction is caused by the card issuer's decision not to promptly replenish the available credit after the consumer's payment is credited to the consumer's account.
4.
Examples of conditioning.
Section 226.56(j)(3) prohibits a card issuer from conditioning or otherwise tying the amount of a consumer's credit limit on the consumer affirmatively consenting to the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions where the card issuer assesses an over-the-limit fee for the transaction. The following examples illustrate the prohibition.
i.
Amount of credit limit.
Assume that a card issuer offers a credit card with a credit limit of $1,000. The consumer is informed that if the consumer opts in to the payment of the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions, the initial credit limit would be increased to $1,300. If the card issuer would have offered the credit card with the $1,300 credit limit but for the fact that the consumer did not consent to the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions, the card issuer would not be in compliance with § 226.56(j)(3). Section 226.56(j)(3) prohibits the card issuer from tying the consumer's opt-in to the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions as a condition of obtaining the credit card with the $1,300 credit limit.
ii.
Access to credit.
Assume the same facts as above, except that the card issuer declines the consumer's application altogether because the consumer has not affirmatively consented or opted in to the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions. The card issuer is not in compliance with § 226.56(j)(3) because the card issuer has required the consumer's consent as a condition of obtaining credit.
5.
Over-the-limit fees caused by accrued fees or interest.
Section 226.56(j)(4) prohibits a card issuer from imposing any over-the-limit
fees or charges on a consumer's account if the consumer has exceeded the credit limit solely because charges imposed as part of the plan as described in § 226.6(b)(3) were charged to the consumer's account during the billing cycle. For example, a card issuer may not assess an over-the-limit fee or charge even if the credit limit was exceeded due to fees for services requested by the consumer if such fees would constitute charges imposed as part of the plan (such as fees for voluntary debt cancellation or suspension coverage). Section 226.56(j)(4) does not, however, restrict card issuers from assessing over-the-limit fees or charges due to accrued finance charges or fees from prior cycles that have subsequently been added to the account balance. The following examples illustrate the prohibition.
i. Assume that a consumer has opted in to a card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions. The consumer's account has a credit limit of $500. The billing cycles for the account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month. The account is not eligible for a grace period as defined in § 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(
3
). On December 31, the only balance on the account is a purchase balance of $475. On that same date, $50 in fees charged as part of the plan under § 226.6(b)(3)(i) and interest charges are imposed on the account, increasing the total balance at the end of the December billing cycle to $525. Although the total balance exceeds the $500 credit limit, § 226.56(j)(4) prohibits the card issuer from imposing an over-the-limit fee or charge for the December billing cycle in these circumstances because the consumer's credit limit was exceeded solely because of the imposition of fees and interest charges during that cycle.
ii. Same facts as above except that, on December 31, the only balance on the account is a purchase balance of $400. On that same date, $50 in fees imposed as part of the plan under § 226.6(b)(3)(i), including interest charges, are imposed on the account, increasing the total balance at the end of the December billing cycle to $450. The consumer makes a $25 payment by the January payment due date and the remaining $25 in fees imposed as part of the plan in December is added to the outstanding balance. On January 25, an $80 purchase is charged to the account. At the close of the cycle on January 31, an additional $20 in fees imposed as part of the plan are imposed on the account, increasing the total balance to $525. Because § 226.56(j)(4) does not require the issuer to consider fees imposed as part of the plan for the prior cycle in determining whether an over-the-limit fee may be properly assessed for the current cycle, the issuer need not take into account the remaining $25 in fees and interest charges from the December cycle in determining whether fees imposed as part of the plan caused the consumer to exceed the credit limit during the January cycle. Thus, under these circumstances, § 226.56(j)(4) does not prohibit the card issuer from imposing an over-the-limit fee or charge for the January billing cycle because the $20 in fees imposed as part of the plan for the January billing cycle did not cause the consumer to exceed the credit limit during that cycle.
6.
Additional restrictions on over-the-limit fees.
See § 226.52(b).

# Section 226.57—Reporting and Marketing Rules for College Student Open-End Credit
57(a) Definitions.
57(a)(1) College student credit card.
1.
Definition.
The definition of college student credit card excludes home-equity lines of credit accessed by credit cards and overdraft lines of credit accessed by debit cards. A college student credit card includes a college affinity card within the meaning of TILA Section 127(r)(1)(A). In addition, a card may fall within the scope of the definition regardless of the fact that it is not intentionally targeted at or marketed to college students. For example, an agreement between a college and a card issuer may provide for marketing of credit cards to alumni, faculty, staff, and other non-student consumers who have a relationship with the college, but also contain provisions that contemplate the issuance of cards to students. A credit card issued to a student at the college in connection with such an agreement qualifies as a college student credit card.
57(a)(5) College credit card agreement.
1.
Definition.
Section 226.57(a)(5) defines “college credit card agreement” to include any business, marketing or promotional agreement between a card issuer and a college or university (or an affiliated organization, such as an alumni club or a foundation) if the agreement provides for the issuance of credit cards to full-time or part-time students. Business, marketing or promotional agreements may include a broad range of arrangements between a card issuer and an institution of higher education or affiliated organization, including arrangements that do not meet the criteria to be considered college affinity card agreements as discussed in TILA Section 127(r)(1)(A). For example, TILA Section 127(r)(1)(A) specifies that under a college affinity card agreement, the card issuer has agreed to make a donation to the institution or affiliated organization, the card issuer has agreed to offer discounted terms to the consumer, or the credit card will display pictures, symbols, or words identified with the institution or affiliated organization; even if these conditions are not met, an agreement may qualify as a college credit card agreement, if the agreement is a business, marketing or promotional agreement that contemplates the issuance of college student credit cards to college students
currently enrolled (either full-time or part-time) at the institution. An agreement may qualify as a college credit card agreement even if marketing of cards under the agreement is targeted at alumni, faculty, staff, and other non-student consumers, as long as cards may also be issued to students in connection with the agreement.
57(b) Public disclosure of agreements.
1.
Public disclosure.
Section 226.57(b) requires an institution of higher education to publicly disclose any contract or other agreement made with a card issuer or creditor for the purpose of marketing a credit card. Examples of publicly disclosing such contracts or agreements include, but are not limited to, posting such contracts or agreements on the institution's Web site or making such contracts or agreements available upon request, provided the procedures for requesting the documents are reasonable and free of cost to the requestor, and the requested contracts or agreements are provided within a reasonable time frame.
2.
Redaction prohibited.
An institution of higher education must publicly disclose any contract or other agreement made with a card issuer for the purpose of marketing a credit card in its entirety and may not redact any portion of such contract or agreement. Any clause existing in such contracts or agreements, providing for the confidentiality of any portion of the contract or agreement, would be invalid to the extent it restricts the ability of the institution of higher education to publicly disclose the contract or agreement in its entirety.
57(c) Prohibited inducements.
1.
Tangible item clarified.
A tangible item includes any physical item, such as a gift card, a t-shirt, or a magazine subscription, that a card issuer or creditor offers to induce a college student to apply for or open an open-end consumer credit plan offered by such card issuer or creditor. Tangible items do not include non-physical inducements such as discounts, rewards points, or promotional credit terms.
2.
Inducement clarified.
If a tangible item is offered to a person whether or not that person applies for or opens an open-end consumer credit plan, the tangible item has not been offered to induce the person to apply for or open the plan. For example, refreshments offered to a college student on campus that are not conditioned on whether the student has applied for or agreed to open an open-end consumer credit plan would not violate § 226.57(c).
3.
Near campus clarified.
A location that is within 1,000 feet of the border of the campus of an institution of higher education, as defined by the institution of higher education, is considered near the campus of an institution of higher education.
4.
Mailings included.
The prohibition in § 226.57(c) on offering a tangible item to a college student to induce such student to apply for or open an open-end consumer credit plan offered by such card issuer or creditor applies to any solicitation or application mailed to a college student at an address on or near the campus of an institution of higher education.
5.
Related event clarified.
An event is related to an institution of higher education if the marketing of such event uses the name, emblem, mascot, or logo of an institution of higher education, or other words, pictures, symbols identified with an institution of higher education in a way that implies that the institution of higher education endorses or otherwise sponsors the event.
6.
Reasonable procedures for determining if applicant is a student.
Section 226.57(c) applies solely to offering a tangible item to a college student. Therefore, a card issuer or creditor may offer any person who is not a college student a tangible item to induce such person to apply for or open an open-end consumer credit plan offered by such card issuer or creditor, on campus, near campus, or at an event sponsored by or related to an institution of higher education. The card issuer or creditor must have reasonable procedures for determining whether an applicant is a college student before giving the applicant the tangible item. For example, a card issuer or creditor may ask whether the applicant is a college student as part of the application process. The card issuer or creditor may rely on the representations made by the applicant.
57(d) Annual report to the Board.
57(d)(2) Contents of report.
1.
Memorandum of understanding.
Section 226.57(d)(2) requires that the report to the Board include, among other items, a copy of any memorandum of understanding between the card issuer and the institution (or affiliated organization) that “directly or indirectly relates to the college credit card agreement or that controls or directs any obligations or distribution of benefits between any such entities.” Such a memorandum of understanding includes any document that amends the college credit card agreement, or that constitutes a further agreement between the parties as to the interpretation or administration of the agreement. For example, a memorandum of understanding required to be included in the report would include a document that provides details on the dollar amounts of payments from the card issuer to the university, to supplement the original agreement which only provided for payments in general terms (e.g., as a percentage). A memorandum of understanding for these purposes would not include email (or other) messages that merely discuss matters such as the addresses to which payments should be sent or the names of contact persons for carrying out the agreement.

# Section 226.58—Internet Posting of Credit Card Agreements
58(b) Definitions.
58(b)(1) Agreement.
1.
Inclusion of pricing information.
For purposes of this section, a credit card agreement is deemed to include certain information, such as annual percentage rates and fees, even if the issuer does not otherwise include this information in the basic credit contract. This information is listed under the defined term “pricing information” in § 226.58(b)(7). For example, the basic credit contract may not specify rates, fees and other information that constitutes pricing information as defined in § 226.58(b)(7); instead, such information may be provided to the cardholder in a separate document sent along with the card. However, this information nevertheless constitutes part of the agreement for purposes of § 226.58.
2.
Provisions contained in separate documents included.
A credit card agreement is defined as the written document or documents evidencing the terms of the legal obligation, or the prospective legal obligation, between a card issuer and a consumer for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. An agreement therefore may consist of several documents that, taken together, define the legal obligation between the issuer and consumer. For example, provisions that mandate arbitration or allow an issuer to unilaterally alter the terms of the card issuer's or consumer's obligation are part of the agreement even if they are provided to the consumer in a document separate from the basic credit contract.
58(b)(2) Amends.
1.
Substantive changes.
A change to an agreement is substantive, and therefore is deemed an amendment of the agreement, if it alters the rights or obligations of the parties. Section 226.58(b)(2) provides that any change in the pricing information, as defined in § 226.58(b)(7), is deemed to be substantive. Examples of other changes that generally would be considered substantive include: (i) Addition or deletion of a provision giving the issuer or consumer a right under the agreement, such as a clause that allows an issuer to unilaterally change the terms of an agreement; (ii) addition or deletion of a provision giving the issuer or consumer an obligation under the agreement, such as a clause requiring the consumer to pay an additional fee; (iii) changes that may affect the cost of credit to the consumer, such as changes in a provision describing how the minimum payment will be calculated; (iv) changes that may affect how the terms of the agreement are construed or applied, such as changes in a choice-of-law provision; and (v) changes that may affect the parties to whom the agreement may apply, such as provisions regarding authorized users or assignment of the agreement.
2.
Non-substantive changes.
Changes that generally would not be considered substantive include, for example: (i) Correction of typographical errors that do not affect the meaning of any terms of the agreement; (ii) changes to the card issuer's corporate name, logo, or tagline; (iii) changes to the format of the agreement, such as conversion to a booklet from a full-sheet format, changes in font, or changes in margins; (iv) changes to the name of the credit card to which the program applies; (v) reordering sections of the agreement without affecting the meaning of any terms of the agreement; (vi) adding, removing, or modifying a table of contents or index; and (vii) changes to titles, headings, section numbers, or captions.
58(b)(4) Card issuer.
1.
Card issuer clarified.
Section 226.58(b)(4) provides that, for purposes of § 226.58, card issuer or issuer means the entity to which a consumer is legally obligated, or would be legally obligated, under the terms of a credit card agreement. For example, Bank X and Bank Y work together to issue credit cards. A consumer that obtains a credit card issued pursuant to this arrangement between Bank X and Bank Y is subject to an agreement that states “This is an agreement between you, the consumer, and Bank X that governs the terms of your Bank Y Credit Card.” The card issuer in this example is Bank X, because the agreement creates a legally enforceable obligation between the consumer and Bank X. Bank X is the issuer even if the consumer applied for the card through a link on Bank Y's Web site and the cards prominently feature the Bank Y logo on the front of the card.
2.
Use of third-party service providers.
An institution that is the card issuer as defined in § 226.58(b)(4) has a legal obligation to comply with the requirements of § 226.58. However, a card issuer generally may use a third-party service provider to satisfy its obligations under § 226.58, provided that the issuer acts in accordance with regulatory guidance regarding use of third-party service providers and other applicable regulatory guidance. In some cases, an issuer may wish to arrange for the institution with which it partners to issue credit cards to fulfill the requirements of § 226.58 on the issuer's behalf. For example, Retailer and Bank work together to issue credit cards. Under the § 226.58(b)(4) definition, Bank is the issuer of these credit cards for purposes of § 226.58. However, Retailer services the credit card accounts, including mailing account opening materials and periodic statements to cardholders. While Bank is responsible for ensuring compliance with § 226.58, Bank may arrange for Retailer (or another appropriate third-party service provider) to submit credit card agreements to the Board under § 226.58 on Bank's behalf.
Bank must comply with regulatory guidance regarding use of third-party service providers and other applicable regulatory guidance.
3.
Partner institution Web sites.
As explained in comments 58(d)-2 and 58(e)-3, if an issuer provides cardholders with access to specific information about their individual accounts, such as balance information or copies of statements, through a third-party Web site, the issuer is deemed to maintain that Web site for purposes of § 226.58. Such a Web site is deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of § 226.58 even where, for example, an unaffiliated entity designs the Web site and owns and maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the Web site, cardholders with credit cards from multiple issuers can access individual account information through the same Web site, and the Web site is not labeled, branded, or otherwise held out to the public as belonging to the issuer. A partner institution's Web site is an example of a third-party Web site that may be deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of § 226.58. For example, Retailer and Bank work together to issue credit cards. Under the § 226.58(b)(4) definition, Bank is the issuer of these credit cards for purposes of § 226.58. Bank does not have a Web site. However, cardholders can access information about their individual accounts, such as balance information and copies of statements, through a Web site maintained by Retailer. Retailer designs the Web site and owns and maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the Web site. The Web site is branded and held out to the public as belonging to Retailer. Because cardholders can access information about their individual accounts through this Web site, the Web site is deemed to be maintained by Bank for purposes of § 226.58. Bank therefore may comply with § 226.58(d) by ensuring that agreements offered to the public are posted on Retailer's Web site in accordance with § 226.58(d). Bank may comply with § 226.58(e) by ensuring that cardholders can request copies of their individual agreements through Retailer's Web site in accordance with § 226.58(e)(1). Bank need not create and maintain a Web site branded and held out to the public as belonging to Bank in order to comply with §§ 226.58(d) and (e) as long as Bank ensures that Retailer's Web site complies with these sections.
In addition, § 226.58(d)(1) provides that, with respect to an agreement offered solely for accounts under one or more private label credit card plans, an issuer may comply with § 226.58(d) by posting the agreement on the publicly available Web site of at least one of the merchants at which credit cards issued under each private label credit card plan with 10,000 or more open accounts may be used. This rule is not conditioned on cardholders' ability to access account-specific information through the merchant's Web site.
58(b)(5) Offers.
1.
Cards offered to limited groups.
A card issuer is deemed to offer a credit card agreement to the public even if the issuer solicits, or accepts applications from, only a limited group of persons. For example, a card issuer may market affinity cards to students and alumni of a particular educational institution, or may solicit only high-net-worth individuals for a particular card; in these cases, the agreement would be considered to be offered to the public. Similarly, agreements for credit cards issued by a credit union are considered to be offered to the public even though such cards are available only to credit union members.
2.
Individualized agreements.
A card issuer is deemed to offer a credit card agreement to the public even if the terms of the agreement are changed immediately upon opening of an account to terms not offered to the public.
58(b)(6) Open account.
1.
Open account clarified.
The definition of open account includes a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan if either: (i) The cardholder can obtain extensions of credit on the account; or (ii) there is an outstanding balance on the account that has not been charged off. Under this definition, an account that meets either of these criteria is considered to be open even if the account is inactive. Similarly, if an account has been closed for new activity (for example, due to default by the cardholder), but the cardholder is still making payments to pay off the outstanding balance, the account is considered open.
58(b)(8) Private label credit card account and private label credit card plan.
1.
Private label credit card account.
The term private label credit card account means a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan with a credit card that can be used to make purchases only at a single merchant or an affiliated group of merchants. This term applies to any such credit card account, regardless of whether it is issued by the merchant or its affiliate or by an unaffiliated third party.
2.
Co-branded credit cards.
The term private label credit card account does not include accounts with so-called co-branded credit cards. Credit cards that display the name, mark, or logo of a merchant or affiliated group of merchants as well as the mark, logo, or brand of payment network are generally referred to as co-branded cards. While these credit cards may display the brand of the merchant or affiliated group of merchants as the dominant brand on the card, such credit cards are usable at any merchant that participates in the payment network. Because these credit cards can be used at multiple unaffiliated merchants, accounts
with such credit cards are not considered private label credit card accounts under § 226.58(b)(8).
3.
Affiliated group of merchants.
The term “affiliated group of merchants” means two or more affiliated merchants or other persons that are related by common ownership or common corporate control. For example, the term would include franchisees that are subject to a common set of corporate policies or practices under the terms of their franchise licenses. The term also applies to two or more merchants or other persons that agree among each other, by contract or otherwise, to accept a credit card bearing the same name, mark, or logo (other than the mark, logo, or brand of a payment network), for the purchase of goods or services solely at such merchants or persons. For example, several local clothing retailers jointly agree to issue credit cards called the “Main Street Fashion Card” that can be used to make purchases only at those retailers. For purposes of this section, these retailers would be considered an affiliated group of merchants.
4.
Private label credit card plan.
Which credit card accounts issued by a particular issuer constitute a private label credit card plan is determined by where the credit cards can be used. All of the private label credit card accounts issued by a particular card issuer with credit cards usable at the same merchant or affiliated group of merchants constitute a single private label credit card plan, regardless of whether the rates, fees, or other terms applicable to the individual credit card accounts differ. For example, a card issuer has 3,000 open private label credit card accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A and 5,000 open private label credit card accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant B and its affiliates. The card issuer has two separate private label credit card plans, as defined by § 226.58(b)(8)—one plan consisting of 3,000 open accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A and another plan consisting of 5,000 open accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant B and its affiliates.
The example above remains the same regardless of whether (or the extent to which) the terms applicable to the individual open accounts differ. For example, assume that, with respect to the card issuer's 3,000 open accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A in the example above, 1,000 of the open accounts have a purchase APR of 12 percent, 1,000 of the open accounts have a purchase APR of 15 percent, and 1,000 of the open accounts have a purchase APR of 18 percent. All of the 5,000 open accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant B and Merchant B's affiliates have the same 15 percent purchase APR. The card issuer still has only two separate private label credit card plans, as defined by § 226.58(b)(8). The open accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A do not constitute three separate private label credit card plans under § 226.58(b)(8), even though the accounts are subject to different terms.
58(c) Submission of agreements to Board.
58(c)(1) Quarterly submissions.
1.
Quarterly submission requirement.
Section 226.58(c)(1) requires card issuers to send quarterly submissions to the Board no later than the first business day on or after January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31 of each year. For example, a card issuer has already submitted three credit card agreements to the Board. On October 15, the card issuer stops offering agreement A. On November 20, the card issuer amends agreement B. On December 1, the issuer starts offering a new agreement D. The card issuer must submit to the Board no later than the first business day on or after January 31: (i) Notification that the card issuer is withdrawing agreement A, because it is no longer offered to the public; (ii) the amended version of agreement B; and (iii) agreement D.
2.
No quarterly submission required.
Under § 226.58(c)(1), a card issuer is not required to make any submission to the Board at a particular quarterly submission deadline if, during the previous calendar quarter, the card issuer did not take any of the following actions: (i) Offering a new credit card agreement that was not submitted to the Board previously; (ii) amending an agreement previously submitted to the Board; and (iii) ceasing to offer an agreement previously submitted to the Board. For example, a card issuer offers five agreements to the public as of September 30 and submits these to the Board by October 31, as required by § 226.58(c)(1). Between September 30 and December 31, the card issuer continues to offer all five of these agreements to the public without amending them and does not begin offering any new agreements. The card issuer is not required to make any submission to the Board by the following January 31.
3.
Quarterly submission of complete set of updated agreements.
Section 226.58(c)(1) permits a card issuer to submit to the Board on a quarterly basis a complete, updated set of the credit card agreements the card issuer offers to the public. For example, a card issuer offers agreements A, B, and C to the public as of March 31. The card issuer submits each of these agreements to the Board by April 30 as required by § 226.58(c)(1). On May 15, the card issuer amends agreement A, but does not make any changes to agreements B or C. As of June 30, the card issuer continues to offer amended agreement A and agreements B and C to the public. At the next quarterly submission deadline, July 31, the card issuer must submit the entire amended agreement A and is not required to make any submission with respect to agreements B and C. The card issuer may either: (i) Submit the entire amended agreement A
and make no submission with respect to agreements B and C; or (ii) submit the entire amended agreement A and also resubmit agreements B and C. A card issuer may choose to resubmit to the Board all of the agreements it offered to the public as of a particular quarterly submission deadline even if the card issuer has not introduced any new agreements or amended any agreements since its last submission and continues to offer all previously submitted agreements.
58(c)(3) Amended agreements.
1.
No requirement to resubmit agreements not amended.
Under § 226.58(c)(3), if a credit card agreement has been submitted to the Board, the agreement has not been amended, and the card issuer continues to offer the agreement to the public, no additional submission regarding that agreement is required. For example, a credit card issuer begins offering an agreement in October and submits the agreement to the Board the following January 31, as required by § 226.58(c)(1). As of March 31, the card issuer has not amended the agreement and is still offering the agreement to the public. The card issuer is not required to submit anything to the Board regarding that agreement by April 30.
2.
Submission of amended agreements.
If a card issuer amends a credit card agreement previously submitted to the Board, § 226.58(c)(3) requires the card issuer to submit the entire amended agreement to the Board. The issuer must submit the amended agreement to the Board by the first quarterly submission deadline after the last day of the calendar quarter in which the change became effective. However, the issuer is required to submit the amended agreement to the Board only if the issuer offered the amended agreement to the public as of the last business day of the calendar quarter in which the change became effective. For example, a card issuer submits an agreement to the Board on October 31. On November 15, the issuer changes the balance computation method used under the agreement. Because an element of the pricing information has changed, the agreement has been amended for purposes of § 226.58(c)(3). On December 31, the last business day of the calendar quarter in which the change in the balance computation method became effective, the issuer still offers the agreement to the public as amended on November 15. The issuer must submit the entire amended agreement to the Board no later than January 31.
3.
Agreements amended but no longer offered to the public.
A card issuer should submit an amended agreement to the Board under § 226.58(c)(3) only if the issuer offered the amended agreement to the public as of the last business day of the calendar quarter in which the amendment became effective. Agreements that are not offered to the public as of the last day of the calendar quarter should not be submitted to the Board. For example, on December 31 a card issuer offers two agreements, Agreement A and Agreement B. The issuer submits these agreements to the Board by January 31 as required by § 226.58. On February 15, the issuer amends both Agreement A and Agreement B. On February 28, the issuer stops offering Agreement A to the public. On March 15, the issuer amends Agreement B a second time. As a result, on March 31, the last business day of the calendar quarter, the issuer offers to the public one agreement—Agreement B as amended on March 15. By the April 30 quarterly submission deadline, the issuer must: (1) Notify the Board that it is withdrawing Agreement A because Agreement A is no longer offered to the public; and (2) submit to the Board Agreement B as amended on March 15. The issuer should not submit to the Board either Agreement A as amended on February 15 or the earlier version of Agreement B (as amended on February 15), as neither was offered to the public on March 31, the last business day of the calendar quarter.
4.
Change-in-terms notices not permissible.
Section 226.58(c)(3) requires that if an agreement previously submitted to the Board is amended, the card issuer must submit the entire revised agreement to the Board. A card issuer may not fulfill this requirement by submitting a change-in-terms or similar notice covering only the terms that have changed. In addition, amendments must be integrated into the text of the agreement (or the addenda described in § 226.58(c)(8)), not provided as separate riders. For example, a card issuer changes the purchase APR associated with an agreement the issuer has previously submitted to the Board. The purchase APR for that agreement was included in the addendum of pricing information, as required by § 226.58(c)(8). The card issuer may not submit a change-in-terms or similar notice reflecting the change in APR, either alone or accompanied by the original text of the agreement and original pricing information addendum. Instead, the card issuer must revise the pricing information addendum to reflect the change in APR and submit to the Board the entire text of the agreement and the entire revised addendum, even though no changes have been made to the provisions of the agreement and only one item on the pricing information addendum has changed.
58(c)(4) Withdrawal of agreements.
1.
Notice of withdrawal of agreement.
Section 226.58(c)(4) requires a card issuer to notify the Board if any agreement previously submitted to the Board by that issuer is no longer offered to the public by the first quarterly submission deadline after the last day of the calendar quarter in which the card issuer ceased to offer the agreement. For example, on January 5 a card issuer stops offering to the public an agreement it previously
submitted to the Board. The card issuer must notify the Board that the agreement is being withdrawn by April 30, the first quarterly submission deadline after March 31, the last day of the calendar quarter in which the card issuer stopped offering the agreement.
58(c)(5) De minimis exception.
1.
Relationship to other exceptions.
The de minimis exception is distinct from the private label credit card exception under § 226.58(c)(6) and the product testing exception under § 226.58(c)(7). The de minimis exception provides that a card issuer with fewer than 10,000 open credit card accounts is not required to submit any agreements to the Board, regardless of whether those agreements qualify for the private label credit card exception or the product testing exception. In contrast, the private label credit card exception and the product testing exception provide that a card issuer is not required to submit to the Board agreements offered solely in connection with certain types of credit card plans with fewer than 10,000 open accounts, regardless of the card issuer's total number of open accounts.
2.
De minimis exception.
Under § 226.58(c)(5), a card issuer is not required to submit any credit card agreements to the Board under § 226.58(c)(1) if the card issuer has fewer than 10,000 open credit card accounts as of the last business day of the calendar quarter. For example, a card issuer offers five credit card agreements to the public as of September 30. However, the card issuer has only 2,000 open credit card accounts as of September 30. The card issuer is not required to submit any agreements to the Board by October 31 because the issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception.
3.
Date for determining whether card issuer qualifies clarified.
Whether a card issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception is determined as of the last business day of each calendar quarter. For example, as of December 31, a card issuer offers three agreements to the public and has 9,500 open credit card accounts. As of January 30, the card issuer still offers three agreements, but has 10,100 open accounts. As of March 31, the card issuer still offers three agreements, but has only 9,700 open accounts. Even though the card issuer had 10,100 open accounts at one time during the calendar quarter, the card issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception because the number of open accounts was less than 10,000 as of March 31. The card issuer therefore is not required to submit any agreements to the Board under § 226.58(c)(1) by April 30.
4.
Date for determining whether card issuer ceases to qualify clarified.
Whether a card issuer has ceased to qualify for the de minimis exception under § 226.58(c)(5) is determined as of the last business day of the calendar quarter, For example, as of June 30, a card issuer offers three agreements to the public and has 9,500 open credit card accounts. The card issuer is not required to submit any agreements to the Board under § 226.58(c)(1) because the card issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception. As of July 15, the card issuer still offers the same three agreements, but now has 10,000 open accounts. The card issuer is not required to take any action at this time, because whether a card issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception under § 226.58(c)(5) is determined as of the last business day of the calendar quarter. As of September 30, the card issuer still offers the same three agreements and still has 10,000 open accounts. Because the card issuer had 10,000 open accounts as of September 30, the card issuer ceased to qualify for the de minimis exception and must submit the three agreements it offers to the Board by October 31, the next quarterly submission deadline.
5.
Option to withdraw agreements clarified.
Section 226.58(c)(5) provides that if a card issuer that did not previously qualify for the de minimis exception qualifies for the de minimis exception, the card issuer must continue to make quarterly submissions to the Board as required by § 226.58(c)(1) until the card issuer notifies the Board that the issuer is withdrawing all agreements it previously submitted to the Board. For example, a card issuer has 10,001 open accounts and offers three agreements to the public as of December 31. The card issuer has submitted each of the three agreements to the Board as required under § 226.58(c)(1). As of March 31, the card issuer has only 9,999 open accounts. The card issuer has two options. First, the card issuer may notify the Board that the card issuer is withdrawing each of the three agreements it previously submitted. Once the card issuer has notified the Board, the card issuer is no longer required to make quarterly submissions to the Board under § 226.58(c)(1). Alternatively, the card issuer may choose not to notify the Board that it is withdrawing its agreements. In this case, the card issuer must continue making quarterly submissions to the Board as required by § 226.58(c)(1). The card issuer might choose not to withdraw its agreements if, for example, the card issuer believes that it likely will cease to qualify for the de minimis exception again in the near future.
58(c)(6) Private label credit card exception.
1.
Private label credit card exception.
Under § 226.58(c)(6)(i), a card issuer is not required to submit to the Board a credit card agreement if, as of the last business day of the calendar quarter, the agreement: (A) Is offered for accounts under one or more private label credit card plans each of which has fewer than 10,000 open accounts; and (B) is not offered to the public other than for accounts under such a plan. For example, a card issuer offers to the public a credit card agreement offered solely for private label
credit card accounts with credit cards that can be used only at Merchant A. The card issuer has 8,000 open accounts with such credit cards usable only at Merchant A. The card issuer is not required to submit this agreement to the Board under § 226.58(c)(1) because the agreement is offered for a private label credit card plan with fewer than 10,000 open accounts, and the credit card agreement is not offered to the public other than for accounts under that private label credit card plan.
In contrast, assume the same card issuer also offers to the public a different credit card agreement that is offered solely for private label credit card accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant B. The card issuer has 12,000 open accounts with such credit cards usable only at Merchant B. The private label credit card exception does not apply. Although this agreement is offered for a private label credit card plan (
i.e.,
the 12,000 private label credit card accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant B), and the agreement is not offered to the public other than for accounts under that private label credit card plan, the private label credit card plan has more than 10,000 open accounts. (The card issuer still is not required to submit to the Board the agreement offered in connection with credit cards usable only at Merchant A, as each agreement is evaluated separately under the private label credit card exception.)
2.
Card issuers with small private label and other credit card plans.
Whether the private label credit card exception applies is determined on an agreement-by-agreement basis. Therefore, some agreements offered by a card issuer may qualify for the private label credit card exception even though the card issuer also offers other agreements that do not qualify, such as agreements offered for accounts with cards usable at multiple unaffiliated merchants or agreements offered for accounts under private label plans with 10,000 or more open accounts.
3.
De minimis exception distinguished.
The private label credit card exception under § 226.58(c)(6) is distinct from the de minimis exception under § 226.58(c)(5). The private label credit card exception exempts card issuers from submitting certain agreements to the Board regardless of the card issuer's overall size as measured by total number of open accounts. In contrast, the de minimis exception exempts a particular card issuer from submitting any credit card agreements to the Board if the card issuer has fewer than 10,000 total open accounts. For example, a card issuer offers to the public two credit card agreements. Agreement A is offered solely for private label credit card accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A. The card issuer has 5,000 open credit card accounts with such credit cards usable only at Merchant A. Agreement B is offered solely for credit card accounts with cards usable at multiple unaffiliated merchants that participate in a major payment network. The card issuer has 40,000 open credit card accounts with such payment network cards. The card issuer is not required to submit agreement A to the Board under § 226.58(c)(1) because agreement A qualifies for the private label credit card exception under § 226.58(c)(6). Agreement A is offered for accounts under a private label credit card plan with fewer than 10,000 open accounts (
i.e.,
the 5,000 accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A) and is not otherwise offered to the public. The card issuer is required to submit agreement B to the Board under § 226.58(c)(1). The card issuer does not qualify for the de minimis exception under § 226.58(c)(5) because it has more than 10,000 open accounts, and agreement B does not qualify for the private label credit card exception under § 226.58(c)(6) because it is not offered solely for accounts under a private label credit card plan with fewer than 10,000 open accounts.
4.
Agreement otherwise offered to the public.
An agreement qualifies for the private label exception only if it is offered for accounts under one or more private label credit card plans with fewer than 10,000 open accounts and is not offered to the public other than for accounts under such a plan. For example, a card issuer offers a single agreement to the public. The agreement is offered for private label credit card accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A. The card issuer has 9,000 such open accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A. The agreement also is offered for credit card accounts with credit cards usable at multiple unaffiliated merchants that participate in a major payment network. The agreement does not qualify for the private label credit card exception. The agreement is offered for accounts under a private label credit card plan with fewer than 10,000 open accounts. However, the agreement also is offered to the public for accounts that are not part of a private label credit card plan and therefore does not qualify for the private label credit card exception.
Similarly, an agreement does not qualify for the private label credit card exception if it is offered in connection with one private label credit card plan with fewer than 10,000 open accounts and one private label credit card plan with 10,000 or more open accounts. For example, a card issuer offers a single credit card agreement to the public. The agreement is offered for two types of accounts. The first type of account is a private label credit card account with a credit card usable only at Merchant A. The second type of account is a private label credit card account with a credit card usable only at Merchant B. The card issuer has 10,000 such open accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A and 5,000 such open accounts
with credit cards usable only at Merchant B. The agreement does not qualify for the private label credit card exception. While the agreement is offered for accounts under a private label credit card plan with fewer than 10,000 open accounts (
i.e.,
the 5,000 open accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant B), the agreement is also offered for accounts not under such a plan (
i.e.,
the 10,000 open accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A).
5.
Agreement used for multiple small private label plans.
The private label exception applies even if the same agreement is used for more than one private label credit card plan with fewer than 10,000 open accounts. For example, a card issuer has 15,000 total open private label credit card accounts. Of these, 7,000 accounts have credit cards usable only at Merchant A, 5,000 accounts have credit cards usable only at Merchant B, and 3,000 accounts have credit cards usable only at Merchant C. The card issuer offers to the public a single credit card agreement that is offered for all three types of accounts and is not offered for any other type of account. The card issuer is not required to submit the agreement to the Board under § 226.58(c)(1). The agreement is used for three different private label credit card plans (
i.e.,
the accounts with credit cards usable at Merchant A, the accounts with credit cards usable at Merchant B, and the accounts with credit cards usable at Merchant C), each of which has fewer than 10,000 open accounts, and the card issuer does not offer the agreement for any other type of account. The agreement therefore qualifies for the private label credit card exception under § 226.58(c)(6).
6.
Multiple agreements used for one private label credit card plan.
The private label credit card exception applies even if a card issuer offers more than one agreement in connection with a particular private label credit card plan. For example, a card issuer has 5,000 open private label credit card accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A. The card issuer offers to the public three different agreements each of which may be used in connection with private label credit card accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A. The agreements are not offered for any other type of credit card account. The card issuer is not required to submit any of the three agreements to the Board under § 226.58(c)(1) because each of the agreements is used for a private label credit card plan which has fewer than 10,000 open accounts and none of the three is offered to the public other than for accounts under such a plan.
58(c)(8) Form and content of agreements submitted to the Board.
1.
“As of” date clarified.
Agreements submitted to the Board must contain the provisions of the agreement and pricing information in effect as of the last business day of the preceding calendar quarter. For example, on June 1, a card issuer decides to decrease the purchase APR associated with one of the agreements it offers to the public. The change in the APR will become effective on August 1. If the card issuer submits the agreement to the Board on July 31 (for example, because the agreement has been otherwise amended), the agreement submitted should not include the new lower APR because that APR was not in effect on June 30, the last business day of the preceding calendar quarter.
2.
Pricing agreement addendum.
Pricing information must be set forth in the separate addendum described in § 226.58(c)(8)(ii)(A) even if it is also stated elsewhere in the agreement.
3.
Pricing agreement variations do not constitute separate agreements.
Pricing information that may vary from one cardholder to another depending on the cardholder's creditworthiness or state of residence or other factors must be disclosed by setting forth all the possible variations or by providing a range of possible variations. Two agreements that differ only with respect to variations in the pricing information do not constitute separate agreements for purposes of this section. For example, a card issuer offers two types of credit card accounts that differ only with respect to the purchase APR. The purchase APR for one type of account is 15 percent, while the purchase APR for the other type of account is 18 percent. The provisions of the agreement and pricing information for the two types of accounts are otherwise identical. The card issuer should not submit to the Board one agreement with a pricing information addendum listing a 15 percent purchase APR and another agreement with a pricing information addendum listing an 18 percent purchase APR. Instead, the card issuer should submit to the Board one agreement with a pricing information addendum listing possible purchase APRs of 15 or 18 percent.
4.
Optional variable terms addendum.
Examples of provisions that might be included in the variable terms addendum include a clause that is required by law to be included in credit card agreements in a particular state but not in other states (unless, for example, a clause is included in the agreement used for all cardholders under a heading such as “For State X Residents”), the name of the credit card plan to which the agreement applies (if this information is included in the agreement), or the name of a charitable organization to which donations will be made in connection with a particular card (if this information is included in the agreement).
5.
Integrated agreement requirement.
Card issuers may not provide provisions of the agreement or pricing information in the form of change-in-terms notices or riders.
The only two addenda that may be submitted as part of an agreement are the pricing information addendum and optional variable terms addendum described in § 226.58(c)(8). Changes in provisions or pricing information must be integrated into the body of the agreement, pricing information addendum, or optional variable terms addendum described in § 226.58(c)(8). For example, it would be impermissible for a card issuer to submit to the Board an agreement in the form of a terms and conditions document dated January 1, 2005, four subsequent change in terms notices, and 2 addenda showing variations in pricing information. Instead, the card issuer must submit a document that integrates the changes made by each of the change in terms notices into the body of the original terms and conditions document and a single addendum displaying variations in pricing information.
58(d) Posting of agreements offered to the public.
1.
Requirement applies only to agreements submitted to the Board.
Card issuers are only required to post and maintain on their publicly available Web site the credit card agreements that the card issuer must submit to the Board under § 226.58(c). If, for example, a card issuer is not required to submit any agreements to the Board because the card issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception under § 226.58(c)(5), the card issuer is not required to post and maintain any agreements on its Web site under § 226.58(d). Similarly, if a card issuer is not required to submit a specific agreement to the Board, such as an agreement that qualifies for the private label exception under § 226.58(c)(6), the card issuer is not required to post and maintain that agreement under § 226.58(d) (either on the card issuer's publicly available Web site or on the publicly available Web sites of merchants at which private label credit cards can be used). (The card issuer in both of these cases is still required to provide each individual cardholder with access to his or her specific credit card agreement under § 226.58(e) by posting and maintaining the agreement on the card issuer's Web site or by providing a copy of the agreement upon the cardholder's request.)
2.
Card issuers that do not otherwise maintain Web sites.
Unlike § 226.58(e), § 226.58(d) does not include a special rule for card issuers that do not otherwise maintain a Web site. If a card issuer is required to submit one or more agreements to the Board under § 226.58(c), that card issuer must post those agreements on a publicly available Web site it maintains (or, with respect to an agreement for a private label credit card, on the publicly available Web site of at least one of the merchants at which the card may be used, as provided in § 226.58(d)(1)).
If an issuer provides cardholders with access to specific information about their individual accounts, such as balance information or copies of statements, through a third-party Web site, the issuer is considered to maintain that Web site for purposes of § 226.58. Such a third-party Web site is deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of § 226.58(d) even where, for example, an unaffiliated entity designs the Web site and owns and maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the Web site, cardholders with credit cards from multiple issuers can access individual account information through the same Web site, and the Web site is not labeled, branded, or otherwise held out to the public as belonging to the issuer. Therefore, issuers that provide cardholders with access to account-specific information through a third-party Web site can comply with § 226.58(d) by ensuring that the agreements the issuer submits to the Board are posted on the third-party Web site in accordance with § 226.58(d). (In contrast, the § 226.58(d)(1) rule regarding agreements for private label credit cards is not conditioned on cardholders' ability to access account-specific information through the merchant's Web site.)
3.
Private label credit card plans.
Section 226.58(d) provides that, with respect to an agreement offered solely for accounts under one or more private label credit card plans, a card issuer may comply by posting and maintaining the agreement on the Web site of at least one of the merchants at which the cards issued under each private label credit card plan with 10,000 or more open accounts may be used. For example, a card issuer has 100,000 open private label credit card accounts. Of these, 75,000 open accounts have credit cards usable only at Merchant A and 25,000 open accounts have credit cards usable only at Merchant B and Merchant B's affiliates, Merchants C and D. The card issuer offers to the public a single credit card agreement that is offered for both of these types of accounts and is not offered for any other type of account.
The card issuer is required to submit the agreement to the Board under § 226.58(c)(1). (The card issuer has more than 10,000 open accounts, so the § 226.58(c)(5) de minimis exception does not apply. The agreement is offered solely for two different private label credit card plans (
i.e.,
one plan consisting of the accounts with credit cards usable at Merchant A and one plan consisting of the accounts with credit cards usable at Merchant B and its affiliates, Merchants C and D), but both of these plans have more than 10,000 open accounts, so the § 226.58(c)(6) private label credit card exception does not apply. Finally, the agreement is not offered solely in connection with a product test by the card issuer, so the § 226.58(c)(7) product test exception does not apply.)
Because the card issuer is required to submit the agreement to the Board under
§ 226.58(c)(1), the card issuer is required to post and maintain the agreement on the card issuer's publicly available Web site under § 226.58(d). However, because the agreement is offered solely for accounts under one or more private label credit card plans, the card issuer may comply with § 226.58(d) in either of two ways. First, the card issuer may comply by posting and maintaining the agreement on the card issuer's own publicly available Web site. Alternatively, the card issuer may comply by posting and maintaining the agreement on the publicly available Web site of Merchant A
and
the publicly available Web site of at least one of Merchants B, C and D. It would not be sufficient for the card issuer to post the agreement on Merchant A's Web site alone because § 226.58(d) requires the card issuer to post the agreement on the publicly available Web site of “at least one of the merchants at which cards issued under
each
private label credit card plan may be used” (emphasis added).
In contrast, assume that a card issuer has 100,000 open private label credit card accounts. Of these, 5,000 open accounts have credit cards usable only at Merchant A and 95,000 open accounts have credit cards usable only at Merchant B and Merchant B's affiliates, Merchants C and D. The card issuer offers to the public a single credit card agreement that is offered for both of these types of accounts and is not offered for any other type of account.
The card issuer is required to submit the agreement to the Board under § 226.58(c)(1). (The card issuer has more than 10,000 open accounts, so the § 226.58(c)(5) de minimis exception does not apply. The agreement is offered solely for two different private label credit card plans (
i.e.,
one plan consisting of the accounts with credit cards usable at Merchant A and one plan consisting of the accounts with credit cards usable at Merchant B and its affiliates, Merchants C and D), but one of these plans has more than 10,000 open accounts, so the § 226.58(c)(6) private label credit card exception does not apply. Finally, the agreement is not offered solely in connection with a product test by the card issuer, so the § 226.58(c)(7) product test exception does not apply.)
Because the card issuer is required to submit the agreement to the Board under § 226.58(c)(1), the card issuer is required to post and maintain the agreement on the card issuer's publicly available Web site under § 226.58(d). However, because the agreement is offered solely for accounts under one or more private label credit card plans, the card issuer may comply with § 226.58(d) in either of two ways. First, the card issuer may comply by posting and maintaining the agreement on the card issuer's own publicly available Web site. Alternatively, the card issuer may comply by posting and maintaining the agreement on the publicly available Web site of at least one of Merchants B, C and D. The card issuer is not required to post and maintain the agreement on the publicly available Web site of Merchant A because the card issuer's private label credit card plan consisting of accounts with cards usable only at Merchant A has fewer than 10,000 open accounts.
58(e) Agreements for all open accounts.
1.
Requirement applies to all open accounts.
The requirement to provide access to credit card agreements under § 226.58(e) applies to all open credit card accounts, regardless of whether such agreements are required to be submitted to the Board pursuant to § 226.58(c) (or posted on the card issuer's Web site pursuant to § 226.58(d)). For example, a card issuer that is not required to submit agreements to the Board because it qualifies for the de minimis exception under § 226.58(c)(5)) would still be required to provide cardholders with access to their specific agreements under § 226.58(e). Similarly, an agreement that is no longer offered to the public would not be required to be submitted to the Board under § 226.58(c), but would still need to be provided to the cardholder to whom it applies under § 226.58(e).
2.
Readily available telephone line.
Section 226.58(e) provides that card issuers that provide copies of cardholder agreements upon request must provide the cardholder with the ability to request a copy of their agreement by calling a readily available telephone line. To satisfy the readily available standard, the financial institution must provide enough telephone lines so that consumers get a reasonably prompt response. The institution need only provide telephone service during normal business hours. Within its primary service area, an institution must provide a local or toll-free telephone number. It need not provide a toll-free number or accept collect long-distance calls from outside the area where it normally conducts business.
3.
Issuers without interactive Web sites.
Section 226.58(e)(2) provides that a card issuer that does not maintain a Web site from which cardholders can access specific information about their individual accounts is not required to provide a cardholder with the ability to request a copy of the agreement by using the card issuer's Web site. A card issuer without a Web site of any kind could comply by disclosing the telephone number on each periodic statement; a card issuer with a non-interactive Web site could comply in the same way, or alternatively could comply by displaying the telephone number on the card issuer's Web site. An issuer is considered to maintain an interactive Web site for purposes of the § 226.58(e)(2) special rule if the issuer provide cardholders with access to specific information about their individual accounts, such as balance information or copies of statements, through a third-party interactive Web site. Such a Web
site is deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of § 226.58(e)(2) even where, for example, an unaffiliated entity designs the Web site and owns and maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the Web site, cardholders with credit cards from multiple issuers can access individual account information through the same Web site, and the Web site is not labeled, branded, or otherwise held out to the public as belonging to the issuer. An issuer that provides cardholders with access to specific information about their individual accounts through such a Web site is not permitted to comply with the special rule in § 226.58(e)(2). Instead, such an issuer must comply with § 226.58(e)(1).
4.
Deadline for providing requested agreements clarified.
Sections 226.58(e)(1)(ii) and (e)(2) require that credit card agreements provided upon request must be sent to the cardholder or otherwise made available to the cardholder in electronic or paper form no later than 30 days after the cardholder's request is received. For example, if a card issuer chooses to respond to a cardholder's request by mailing a paper copy of the cardholder's agreement, the card issuer must mail the agreement no later than 30 days after receipt of the cardholder's request. Alternatively, if a card issuer chooses to respond to a cardholder's request by posting the cardholder's agreement on the card issuer's Web site, the card issuer must post the agreement on its Web site no later than 30 days after receipt of the cardholder's request. Section 226.58(e)(3)(v) provides that a card issuer may provide cardholder agreements in either electronic or paper form regardless of the form of the cardholder's request.

# Section 226.59-Reevaluation of Rate Increases.
59(a) General rule.
59(a)(1) Evaluation of increased rate.
1.
Types of rate increases covered.
Section 226.59(a) applies both to increases in annual percentage rates imposed on a consumer's account based on that consumer's credit risk or other circumstances specific to that consumer and to increases in annual percentage rates imposed based on factors that are not specific to the consumer, such as changes in market conditions or the issuer's cost of funds.
2.
Rate increases actually imposed.
Under § 226.59(a), a card issuer must review changes in factors only if the increased rate is actually imposed on the consumer's account. For example, if a card issuer increases the penalty rate for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan and the consumer's account has no balances that are currently subject to the penalty rate, the card issuer is required to provide a notice pursuant to § 226.9(c) of the change in terms, but the requirements of § 226.59 do not apply. However, if the consumer's account later becomes subject to the penalty rate, the card issuer is required to provide a notice pursuant to § 226.9(g) and the requirements of § 226.59 begin to apply upon imposition of the penalty rate. Similarly, if a card issuer raises the cash advance rate applicable to a consumer's account but the consumer engages in no cash advance transactions to which that increased rate is applied, the card issuer is required to provide a notice pursuant to § 226.9(c) of the change in terms, but the requirements of § 226.59 do not apply. If the consumer subsequently engages in a cash advance transaction, the requirements of § 226.59 begin to apply at that time.
3.
Change in type of rate.
i.
Generally.
A change from a variable rate to a non-variable rate or from a non-variable rate to a variable rate is not a rate increase for purposes of § 226.59, if the rate in effect immediately prior to the change in type of rate is equal to or greater than the rate in effect immediately after the change. For example, a change from a variable rate of 15.99% to a non-variable rate of 15.99% is not a rate increase for purposes of § 226.59 at the time of the change.
See
§ 226.55 for limitations on the permissibility of changing from a non-variable rate to a variable rate.
ii.
Change from non-variable rate to variable rate.
A change from a non-variable to a variable rate constitutes a rate increase for purposes of § 226.59 if the variable rate exceeds the non-variable rate that would have applied if the change in type of rate had not occurred. For example, assume a new credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan is opened on January 1 of year 1 and that a non-variable annual percentage rate of 12% applies to all transactions on the account. On January 1 of year 2, upon 45 days' advance notice pursuant to § 226.9(c)(2), the rate on all new transactions is changed to a variable rate that is currently 12% and is determined by adding a margin of 10 percentage points to a publicly-available index not under the card issuer's control. The change from the 12% non-variable rate to the 12% variable rate on January 1 of year 2 is not a rate increase for purposes of § 226.59(a). On April 1 of year 2, the value of the variable rate increases to 12.5%. The increase in the rate from 12% to 12.5% is a rate increase for purposes of § 226.59, and the card issuer must begin periodically conducting reviews of the account pursuant to § 226.59. The increase that must be evaluated for purposes of § 226.59 is the increase from a non-variable rate of 12% to a variable rate of 12.5%.
iii.
Change from variable rate to non-variable rate.
A change from a variable to a non-variable rate constitutes a rate increase for purposes of § 226.59 if the non-variable rate exceeds the variable rate that would have applied if the change in type of rate had not occurred. For example, assume a new credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan is opened on January 1 of year 1 and that a variable annual percentage rate that is currently 15% and is determined by adding a margin of 10 percentage points to a publicly-available index not under the card issuer's control applies to all transactions on the account. On January 1 of year 2, upon 45 days' advance notice pursuant to § 226.9(c)(2), the rate on all existing balances and new transactions is changed to a non-variable rate that is currently 15%. The change from the 15% variable rate to the 15% non-variable rate on January 1 of year 2 is not a rate increase for purposes of § 226.59(a). On April 1 of year 2, the value of the variable rate that would have applied to the account decreases to 12.5%. Accordingly, on April 1 of year 2, the non-variable rate of 15% exceeds the 12.5% variable rate that would have applied but for the change in type of rate. At this time, the change to the non-variable rate of 15% constitutes a rate increase for purposes of § 226.59, and the card issuer must begin periodically conducting reviews of the account pursuant to § 226.59. The increase that must be evaluated for purposes of § 226.59 is the increase from a variable rate of 12.5% to a non-variable rate of 15%.
4.
Rate increases prior to effective date of rule.
For increases in annual percentage rates made on or after January 1, 2009, and prior to August 22, 2010, § 226.59(a) requires the card issuer to review the factors described in § 226.59(d) and reduce the rate, as appropriate, if the rate increase is of a type for which 45 days' advance notice would currently be required under § 226.9(c)(2) or (g). For example, 45 days' notice is not required under § 226.9(c)(2) if the rate increase results from the increase in the index by which a properly-disclosed variable rate is determined in accordance with § 226.9(c)(2)(v)(C) or if the increase occurs upon expiration of a specified period of time and disclosures complying with § 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B) have been provided. The requirements of § 226.59 do not apply to such rate increases.
5.
Amount of rate decrease.
i.
General.
Even in circumstances where a rate reduction is required, § 226.59 does not require that a card issuer decrease the rate that applies to a credit card account to the rate that was in effect prior to the rate increase subject to § 226.59(a). The amount of the rate decrease that is required must be determined based upon the card issuer's reasonable policies and procedures under § 226.59(b) for consideration of factors described in § 226.59(a) and (d). For example, assume a consumer's rate on new purchases is increased from a variable rate of 15.99% to a variable rate of 23.99% based on the consumer's making a required minimum periodic payment five days late. The consumer makes all of the payments required on the account on time for the six months following the rate increase. Assume that the card issuer evaluates the account by reviewing the factors on which the increase in an annual percentage rate was originally based, in accordance with § 226.59(d)(1)(i). The card issuer is not required to decrease the consumer's rate to the 15.99% that applied prior to the rate increase. However, the card issuer's policies and procedures for performing the review required by § 226.59(a) must be reasonable, as required by § 226.59(b), and must take into account any reduction in the consumer's credit risk based upon the consumer's timely payments.
ii.
Change in type of rate.
If the rate increase subject to § 226.59 involves a change from a variable rate to a non-variable rate or from a non-variable rate to a variable rate, § 226.59 does not require that the issuer reinstate the same type of rate that applied prior to the change. However, the amount of any rate decrease that is required must be determined based upon the card issuer's reasonable policies and procedures under § 226.59(b) for consideration of factors described in § 226.59(a) and (d).
59(a)(2) Rate reductions.
59(a)(2)(ii) Applicability of rate reduction.
1.
Applicability of reduced rate to new transactions.
Section 226.59(a)(2)(ii) requires, in part, that any reduction in rate required pursuant to § 226.59(a)(1) must apply to new transactions that occur after the effective date of the rate reduction, if those transactions would otherwise have been subject to the increased rate described in § 226.59(a)(1). A credit card account may have multiple types of balances, for example, purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers, to which different rates apply. For example, assume a new credit card account opened on January 1 of year one has a rate applicable to purchases of 15% and a rate applicable to cash advances and balance transfers of 20%. Effective March 1 of year two, consistent with the limitations in § 226.55 and upon giving notice required by § 226.9(c)(2), the card issuer raises the rate applicable to new purchases to 18% based on market conditions. The only transaction in which the consumer engages in year two is a $1,000 purchase made on July 1. The rate for cash advances and balance transfers remains at 20%. Based on a subsequent review required by § 226.59(a)(1), the card issuer determines that the rate on purchases must be reduced to 16%. Section 226.59(a)(2)(ii) requires that the 16% rate be applied to the $1,000 purchase made on July 1 and to all new purchases. The rate for new
cash advances and balance transfers may remain at 20%, because there was no rate increase applicable to those types of transactions and, therefore, the requirements of § 226.59(a) do not apply.
59(c) Timing.
1.
In general.
The issuer may review all of its accounts subject to § 226.59(a) at the same time once every six months, may review each account once each six months on a rolling basis based on the date on which the rate was increased for that account, or may otherwise review each account not less frequently than once every six months.
2.
Example.
A card issuer increases the rates applicable to one half of its credit card accounts on June 1, 2011. The card issuer increases the rates applicable to the other half of its credit card accounts on September 1, 2011. The card issuer may review the rate increases for all of its credit card accounts on or before December 1, 2011, and at least every six months thereafter. In the alternative, the card issuer may first review the rate increases for the accounts that were repriced on June 1, 2011 on or before December 1, 2011, and may first review the rate increases for the accounts that were repriced on September 1, 2011 on or before March 1, 2012.
3.
Rate increases prior to effective date of rule.
For increases in annual percentage rates applicable to a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan on or after January 1, 2009 and prior to August 22, 2010, § 226.59(c) requires that the first review for such rate increases be conducted prior to February 22, 2011.
59(d) Factors.
1.
Change in factors.
A creditor that complies with § 226.59(a) by reviewing the factors it currently considers in determining the annual percentage rates applicable to similar new credit card accounts may change those factors from time to time. When a creditor changes the factors it considers in determining the annual percentage rates applicable to similar new credit card accounts from time to time, it may comply with § 226.59(a) by reviewing the set of factors it considered immediately prior to the change in factors for a brief transition period, or may consider the new factors. For example, a creditor changes the factors it uses to determine the rates applicable to similar new credit card accounts on January 1, 2012. The creditor reviews the rates applicable to its existing accounts that have been subject to a rate increase pursuant to § 226.59(a) on January 25, 2012. The creditor complies with § 226.59(a) by reviewing, at its option, either the factors that it considered on December 31, 2011 when determining the rates applicable to similar new credit card accounts or the factors that it considers as of January 25, 2012. For purposes of compliance with § 226.59(d), a transition period of 60 days from the change of factors constitutes a brief transition period.
2.
Comparison of existing account to factors used for similar new accounts.
Under § 226.59(a), if a creditor evaluates an existing account using the same factors that it considers in determining the rates applicable to similar new accounts, the review of factors need not result in existing accounts being subject to exactly the same rates and rate structure as a creditor imposes on similar new accounts. For example, a creditor may offer variable rates on similar new accounts that are computed by adding a margin that depends on various factors to the value of the LIBOR index. The account that the creditor is required to review pursuant to § 226.59(a) may have variable rates that were determined by adding a different margin, depending on different factors, to a published prime rate. In performing the review required by § 226.59(a), the creditor may review the factors it uses to determine the rates applicable to similar new accounts. If a rate reduction is required, however, the creditor need not base the variable rate for the existing account on the LIBOR index but may continue to use the published prime rate. Section 226.59(a) requires, however, that the rate on the existing account after the reduction, as determined by adding the published prime rate and margin, be comparable to the rate, as determined by adding the margin and LIBOR, charged on a new account for which the factors are comparable.
3.
Similar new credit card accounts.
A card issuer complying with § 226.59(d)(1)(ii) is required to consider the factors that the card issuer currently considers when determining the annual percentage rates applicable to similar new credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. For example, a card issuer may review different factors in determining the annual percentage rate that applies to credit card plans for which the consumer pays an annual fee and receives rewards points than it reviews in determining the rates for credit card plans with no annual fee and no rewards points. Similarly, a card issuer may review different factors in determining the annual percentage rate that applies to private label credit cards than it reviews in determining the rates applicable to credit cards that can be used at a wider variety of merchants. In addition, a card issuer may review different factors in determining the annual percentage rate that applies to private label credit cards usable only at Merchant A than it may review for private label credit cards usable only at Merchant B. However, § 226.59(d)(1)(ii) requires a card issuer to review the factors it considers when determining the rates for new credit card accounts with similar features that are offered for similar purposes.
4.
No similar new credit card accounts.
In some circumstances, a card issuer that complies with § 226.59(a) by reviewing the factors that it currently considers in determining the annual percentage rates applicable to similar new accounts may not be able to identify a class of new accounts that are similar to the existing accounts on which a rate increase has been imposed. For example, consumers may have existing credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan but the card issuer may no longer offer a product to new consumers with similar characteristics, such as the availability of rewards, size of credit line, or other features. Similarly, some consumers' accounts may have been closed and therefore cannot be used for new transactions, while all new accounts can be used for new transactions. In those circumstances, § 226.59 requires that the card issuer nonetheless perform a review of the rate increase on the existing customers' accounts. A card issuer does not comply with § 226.59 by maintaining an increased rate without performing such an evaluation. In such circumstances, § 226.59(d)(1)(ii) requires that the card issuer compare the existing accounts to the most closely comparable new accounts that it offers.
5.
Consideration of consumer's conduct on existing account.
A card issuer that complies with § 226.59(a) by reviewing the factors that it currently considers in determining the annual percentage rates applicable to similar new accounts may consider the consumer's payment or other account behavior on the existing account only to the same extent and in the same manner that the issuer considers such information when one of its current cardholders applies for a new account with the card issuer. For example, a card issuer might obtain consumer reports for all of its applicants. The consumer reports contain certain information regarding the applicant's past performance on existing credit card accounts. However, the card issuer may have additional information about an existing cardholder's payment history or account usage that does not appear in the consumer report and that, accordingly, it would not generally have for all new applicants. For example, a consumer may have made a payment that is five days late on his or her account with the card issuer, but this information does not appear on the consumer report. The card issuer may consider this additional information in performing its review under § 226.59(a), but only to the extent and in the manner that it considers such information if a current cardholder applies for a new account with the issuer.
6.
Multiple rate increases between January 1, 2009 and February 21, 2010.
i.
General.
Section 226.59(d)(2) applies if an issuer increased the rate applicable to a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan between January 1, 2009 and February 21, 2010, and the increase was not based solely upon factors specific to the consumer. In some cases, a credit card account may have been subject to multiple rate increases during the period from January 1, 2009 to February 21, 2010. Some such rate increases may have been based solely upon factors specific to the consumer, while others may have been based on factors not specific to the consumer, such as the issuer's cost of funds or market conditions. In such circumstances, when conducting the first two reviews required under § 226.59, the card issuer may separately review: (i) Rate increases imposed based on factors not specific to the consumer, using the factors described in § 226.59(d)(1)(ii) (as required by § 226.59(d)(2)); and (ii) rate increases imposed based on consumer-specific factors, using the factors described in § 226.59(d)(1)(i). If the review of factors described in § 226.59(d)(1)(i) indicates that it is appropriate to continue to apply a penalty or other increased rate to the account as a result of the consumer's payment history or other factors specific to the consumer, § 226.59 permits the card issuer to continue to impose the penalty or other increased rate, even if the review of the factors described in § 226.59(d)(1)(ii) would otherwise require a rate decrease.
ii.
Example.
Assume a credit card account was subject to a rate of 15% on all transactions as of January 1, 2009. On May 1, 2009, the issuer increased the rate on existing balances and new transactions to 18%, based upon market conditions or other factors not specific to the consumer or the consumer's account. Subsequently, on September 1, 2009, based on a payment that was received five days after the due date, the issuer increased the applicable rate on existing balances and new transactions from 18% to a penalty rate of 25%. When conducting the first review required under § 226.59, the card issuer reviews the rate increase from 15% to 18% using the factors described in § 226.59(d)(1)(ii) (as required by § 226.59(d)(2)), and separately but concurrently reviews the rate increase from 18% to 25% using the factors described in paragraph § 226.59(d)(1)(i). The review of the rate increase from 15% to 18% based upon the factors described in § 226.59(d)(1)(ii) indicates that a similarly situated new consumer would receive a rate of 17%. The review of the rate increase from 18% to 25% based upon the factors described in § 226.59(d)(1)(i) indicates that it is appropriate to continue to apply the 25% penalty rate based upon the consumer's late payment. Section 226.59 permits the rate on the account to remain at 25%.
59(f) Termination of obligation to review factors.
1.
Revocation of temporary rates.
i.
In general.
If an annual percentage rate is increased due to revocation of a temporary
rate, § 226.59(a) requires that the card issuer periodically review the increased rate. In contrast, if the rate increase results from the expiration of a temporary rate previously disclosed in accordance with § 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B), the review requirements in § 226.59(a) do not apply. If a temporary rate is revoked such that the requirements of § 226.59(a) apply, § 226.59(f) permits an issuer to terminate the review of the rate increase if and when the applicable rate is the same as the rate that would have applied if the increase had not occurred.
ii.
Examples.
Assume that on January 1, 2011, a consumer opens a new credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. The annual percentage rate applicable to purchases is 15%. The card issuer offers the consumer a 10% rate on purchases made between February 1, 2012 and August 1, 2013 and discloses pursuant to § 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B) that on August 1, 2013 the rate on purchases will revert to the original 15% rate. The consumer makes a payment that is five days late in July 2012.
A. Upon providing 45 days' advance notice and to the extent permitted under § 226.55, the card issuer increases the rate applicable to new purchases to 15%, effective on September 1, 2012. The card issuer must review that rate increase under § 226.59(a) at least once each six months during the period from September 1, 2012 to August 1, 2013, unless and until the card issuer reduces the rate to 10%. The card issuer performs reviews of the rate increase on January 1, 2013 and July 1, 2013. Based on those reviews, the rate applicable to purchases remains at 15%. Beginning on August 1, 2013, the card issuer is not required to continue periodically reviewing the rate increase, because if the temporary rate had expired in accordance with its previously disclosed terms, the 15% rate would have applied to purchase balances as of August 1, 2013 even if the rate increase had not occurred on September 1, 2012.
B. Same facts as above except that the review conducted on July 1, 2013 indicates that a reduction to the original temporary rate of 10% is appropriate. Section 226.59(a)(2)(i) requires that the rate be reduced no later than 45 days after completion of the review, or no later than August 15, 2013. Because the temporary rate would have expired prior to the date on which the rate decrease is required to take effect, the card issuer may, at its option, reduce the rate to 10% for any portion of the period from July 1, 2013, to August 1, 2013, or may continue to impose the 15% rate for that entire period. The card issuer is not required to conduct further reviews of the 15% rate on purchases.
C. Same facts as above except that on September 1, 2012 the card issuer increases the rate applicable to new purchases to the penalty rate on the consumer's account, which is 25%. The card issuer conducts reviews of the increased rate in accordance with § 226.59 on January 1, 2013 and July 1, 2013. Based on those reviews, the rate applicable to purchases remains at 25%. The card issuer's obligation to review the rate increase continues to apply after August 1, 2013, because the 25% penalty rate exceeds the 15% rate that would have applied if the temporary rate expired in accordance with its previously disclosed terms. The card issuer's obligation to review the rate terminates if and when the annual percentage rate applicable to purchases is reduced to the 15% rate.
2.
Example—relationship to § 226.59(a).
Assume that on January 1, 2011, a consumer opens a new credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. The annual percentage rate applicable to purchases is 15%. Upon providing 45 days' advance notice and to the extent permitted under § 226.55, the card issuer increases the rate applicable to new purchases to 18%, effective on September 1, 2012. The card issuer conducts reviews of the increased rate in accordance with § 226.59 on January 1, 2013 and July 1, 2013, based on the factors described in § 226.59(d)(1)(ii). Based on the January 1, 2013 review, the rate applicable to purchases remains at 18%. In the review conducted on July 1, 2013, the card issuer determines that, based on the relevant factors, the rate it would offer on a comparable new account would be 14%. Consistent with § 226.59(f), § 226.59(a) requires that the card issuer reduce the rate on the existing account to the 15% rate that was in effect prior to the September 1, 2012 rate increase.
59(g) Acquired accounts.
59(g)(1) General.
1.
Relationship to § 226.59(d)(2) for rate increases imposed between January 1, 2009 and February 21, 2010.
Section 226.59(d)(2) applies to acquired accounts. Accordingly, if a card issuer acquires accounts on which a rate increase was imposed between January 1, 2009 and February 21, 2010 that was not based solely upon consumer-specific factors, that acquiring card issuer must consider the factors that it currently considers when determining the annual percentage rates applicable to similar new credit card accounts, if it conducts either or both of the first two reviews of such accounts that are required after August 22, 2010 under § 226.59(a).
59(g)(2) Review of acquired portfolio.
1.
Example—general.
A card issuer acquires a portfolio of accounts that currently are subject to annual percentage rates of 12%, 15%, and 18%. Not later than six months after the acquisition of such accounts, the card issuer reviews all of these accounts in accordance with the factors that it currently uses in determining the rates applicable to similar new credit card accounts. As a result of that review, the card issuer decreases the rate on the accounts that are currently subject to a 12% annual percentage rate to 10%,
leaves the rate applicable to the accounts currently subject to a 15% annual percentage rate at 15%, and increases the rate applicable to the accounts currently subject to a rate of 18% to 20%. Section 226.59(g)(2) requires the card issuer to review, no less frequently than once every six months, the accounts for which the rate has been increased to 20%. The card issuer is not required to review the accounts subject to 10% and 15% rates pursuant to § 226.59(a), unless and until the card issuer makes a subsequent rate increase applicable to those accounts.
2.
Example—penalty rates.
A card issuer acquires a portfolio of accounts that currently are subject to standard annual percentage rates of 12% and 15%. In addition, several acquired accounts are subject to a penalty rate of 24%. Not later than six months after the acquisition of such accounts, the card issuer reviews all of these accounts in accordance with the factors that it currently uses in determining the rates applicable to similar new credit card accounts. As a result of that review, the card issuer leaves the standard rates applicable to the accounts at 12% and 15%, respectively. The card issuer decreases the rate applicable to the accounts currently at 24% to its penalty rate of 23%. Section 226.59(g)(2) requires the card issuer to review, no less frequently than once every six months, the accounts that are subject to a penalty rate of 23%. The card issuer is not required to review the accounts subject to 12% and 15% rates pursuant to § 226.59(a), unless and until the card issuer makes a subsequent rate increase applicable to those accounts.

# Appendix A—Effect on State Laws
1.
Who may make requests.
Appendix A sets forth the procedures for preemption determinations. As discussed in § 226.28, which contains the standards for preemption, a request for a determination of whether a state law is inconsistent with the requirements of chapters 1, 2, or 3 may be made by creditors, states, or any interested party. However, only states may request and receive determinations in connection with the fair credit billing provisions of chapter 4.

# Appendix D—Multiple-Advance Construction Loans
1.
General rule.
Appendix D provides a special procedure that creditors may use, at their option, to estimate and disclose the terms of multiple-advance construction loans when the amounts or timing of advances is unknown at consummation of the transaction. This appendix reflects the approach taken in § 226.17(c)(6)(ii), which permits creditors to provide separate or combined disclosures for the construction period and for the permanent financing, if any; i.e., the construction phase and the permanent phase may be treated as one transaction or more than one transaction. Appendix D may also be used in multiple-advance transactions other than construction loans, when the amounts or timing of advances is unknown at consummation.
2.
Variable-rate multiple-advance loans.
The hypothetical disclosure required in variable-rate transactions by § 226.18(f)(1)(iv) is not required for multiple-advance loans disclosed pursuant to appendix D, part I.
3.
Calculation of the total of payments.
When disclosures are made pursuant to appendix D, the total of payments may reflect either the sum of the payments or the sum of the amount financed and the finance charge.
4.
Annual percentage rate.
Appendix D does not require the use of Volume I of the Board's Annual Percentage Rate Tables for calculation of the annual percentage rate.
Creditors utilizing appendix D in making calculations and disclosures may use other computation tools to determine the estimated annual percentage rate, based on the finance charge and payment schedule obtained by use of the appendix.
5.
Interest reserves.
In a multiple-advance construction loan, a creditor may establish an “interest reserve” to ensure that interest is paid as it accrues by designating a portion of the loan to be used for paying the interest that accrues on the loan. An interest reserve is not treated as a prepaid finance charge, whether the interest reserve is the same as or different from the estimated interest figure calculated under appendix D.
• If a creditor permits a consumer to make interest payments as they become due, the interest reserve should be disregarded in the disclosures and calculations under appendix D.
• If a creditor requires the establishment of an interest reserve and automatically deducts interest payments from the reserve amount rather than allow the consumer to make interest payments as they become due, the fact that interest will accrue on those interest payments as well as the other loan proceeds must be reflected in the calculations and disclosures. To reflect the effects of such compounding, a creditor should first calculate interest on the commitment amount (exclusive of the interest reserve) and then add the figure obtained by assuming that one-half of that interest is outstanding at the contract interest rate for the entire construction period. For example, using the example shown under paragraph A, part I of appendix D, the estimated interest would be $1,117.68 ($1093.75 plus an additional $23.93 calculated by assuming half of $1093.75 is outstanding at the contract interest rate for the entire construction period), and the estimated annual percentage rate would be 21.18%.
6.
Relation to § 226.18(s).
A creditor must disclose an interest rate and payment summary table for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, pursuant to § 226.18(s), instead of the general payment schedule required by § 226.18(g). Accordingly, home construction loans that are secured by real property or a dwelling are subject to § 226.18(s) and not § 226.18(g). Under § 226.176(c)(6)(ii), when a multiple-advance construction loan may be permanently financed by the same creditor, the construction phase and the permanent phase may be treated as either one transaction or more than one transaction.
i. If a creditor uses Appendix D and elects pursuant to § 226.17(c)(6)(ii) to disclose the construction and permanent phases as separate transactions, the construction phase must be disclosed according to the rules in § 226.18(s). Under § 226.18(s), the creditor must disclose the applicable interest rates and corresponding periodic payments during the construction phase in an interest rate and payment summary table. The provision in Appendix D, Part I.A.3, which allows the creditor to omit the number and amounts of any interest payments “in disclosing the payment schedule under § 226.18(g)” does not apply because the transaction is governed by § 226.18(s) rather than § 226.18(g). Also, because the construction phase is being disclosed as a separate transaction and its terms do not repay all principal, the creditor must disclose a balloon payment, pursuant to § 226.18(s)(5).
ii. On the other hand, if the creditor elects to disclose the construction and permanent phases as a single transaction, the construction phase must be disclosed pursuant to Appendix D, Part II.C, which provides that the creditor shall disclose the repayment schedule without reflecting the number or amounts of payments of interest only that are made during the construction phase. Appendix D also provides, however, that creditors must disclose (outside of the table) the fact that interest payments must be made and the timing of such payments. The rate and payment summary table disclosed under § 226.18(s) must reflect only the permanent phase of the transaction. Therefore, in determining the rates and payments that must be disclosed in the columns of the table, creditors should apply the requirements of § 226.18(s) to the permanent phase only. For example, under § 226.18(s)(2)(i)(A) or § 226.18(s)(2)(i)(B)(
1
), as applicable, the creditor should disclose the interest rate corresponding to the first installment due under the permanent phase and not any rate applicable during the construction phase.

# Appendices G and H—Open-End and Closed-End Model Forms and Clauses
1.
Permissible changes.
Although use of the model forms and clauses is not required, creditors using them properly will be deemed to be in compliance with the regulation with regard to those disclosures. Creditors may make certain changes in the format or content of the forms and clauses and may delete any disclosures that are inapplicable to a transaction or a plan without losing the act's protection from liability, except formatting changes may not be made to model forms and samples in H-18, H-19, H-20, H-21, H-22, H-23, G-2(A), G-3(A), G-4(A), G-10(A)-(E), G-17(A)-(D), G-18(A) (except as permitted pursuant to § 226.7(b)(2)), G-18(B)-(C), G-19, G-20, and G-21, or to the model clauses in H-4(E), H-4(F), H-4(G), and H-4(H). Creditors may modify the heading of the second column shown in Model Clause H-4(H) to read “first adjustment” or “first increase,” as applicable, pursuant to § 226.18(s)(2)(i)(C). The rearrangement of the model forms and clauses may not be so extensive as to affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the forms and clauses. Creditors making revisions with that effect will lose their protection from civil liability. Except as otherwise specifically required, acceptable changes include, for example
i. Using the first person, instead of the second person, in referring to the borrower.
ii. Using “borrower” and “creditor” instead of pronouns.
iii. Rearranging the sequences of the disclosures.
iv. Not using bold type for headings.
v. Incorporating certain state “plain English” requirements.
vi. Deleting inapplicable disclosures by whiting out, blocking out, filling in “N/A” (not applicable) or “0,” crossing out, leaving blanks, checking a box for applicable items, or circling applicable items. (This should permit use of multipurpose standard forms.)
vii. Using a vertical, rather than a horizontal, format for the boxes in the closed-end disclosures.
2.
Debt-cancellation coverage.
This regulation does not authorize creditors to characterize debt-cancellation fees as insurance premiums for purposes of this regulation. Creditors may provide a disclosure that refers to debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage whether or not the coverage is considered insurance. Creditors may use the model credit insurance disclosures only if the debt cancellation coverage constitutes insurance under state law.

# Appendixes G and H—Open-End and Closed-End Model Forms and Clauses
1.
Permissible changes.
Although use of the model forms and clauses is not required, creditors using them properly will be deemed to be in compliance with the regulation with regard to those disclosures. Creditors may make certain changes in the format or content of the forms and clauses and may delete any disclosures that are inapplicable to a transaction or a plan without losing the act's protection from liability, except formatting changes may not be made to model forms and samples in H-18, H-19, H-20, H-21, H-22, H-23, G-2(A), G-3(A), G-4(A), G-10(A)-(E), G-17(A)-(D), G-18(A) (except as permitted pursuant to § 226.7(b)(2)), G-18(B)-(C), G-19, G-20, and G-21. The rearrangement of the model forms and clauses may not be so extensive as to affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the forms and clauses. Creditors making revisions with that effect will lose their protection from civil liability. Except as otherwise specifically required, acceptable changes include, for example:
i. Using the first person, instead of the second person, in referring to the borrower.

2.
Debt cancellation coverage.
This regulation does not authorize creditors to characterize debt cancellation fees as insurance premiums for purposes of this regulation. Creditors may provide a disclosure that refers to debt cancellation coverage whether or not the coverage is considered insurance. Creditors may use the model credit insurance disclosures only if the debt cancellation coverage constitutes insurance under state law.

# Appendix G—Open-End Model Forms and Clauses
1.
Models G-1 and G-1(A).
The model disclosures in G-1 and G-1(A) (different balance
computation methods) may be used in both the account-opening disclosures under § 226.6 and the periodic disclosures under § 226.7. As is clear from the models given, “shorthand” descriptions of the balance computation methods are not sufficient, except where § 226.7(b)(5) applies. For creditors using model G-1, the phrase “a portion of” the finance charge should be included if the total finance charge includes other amounts, such as transaction charges, that are not due to the application of a periodic rate. If unpaid interest or finance charges are subtracted in calculating the balance, that fact must be stated so that the disclosure of the computation method is accurate. Only model G-1(b) contains a final sentence appearing in brackets, which reflects the total dollar amount of payments and credits received during the billing cycle. The other models do not contain this language because they reflect plans in which payments and credits received during the billing cycle are subtracted. If this is not the case, however, the language relating to payments and credits should be changed, and the creditor should add either the disclosure of the dollar amount as in model G-1(b) or an indication of which credits (disclosed elsewhere on the periodic statement) will not be deducted in determining the balance. (Such an indication may also substitute for the bracketed sentence in model G-1(b).) (See the commentary to § 226.7(a)(5) and (b)(5).) For open-end plans subject to the requirements of § 226.5b, creditors may, at their option, use the clauses in G-1 or G-1(A).
2.
Models G-2 and G-2(A).
These models contain the notice of liability for unauthorized use of a credit card. For home-equity plans subject to the requirements of § 226.5b, at the creditor's option, a creditor either may use G-2 or G-2(A). For open-end plans not subject to the requirements of § 226.5b, creditors properly use G-2(A).
3.
Models G-3, G-3(A), G-4 and G-4(A).
i. These set out models for the long-form billing-error rights statement (for use with the account-opening disclosures and as an annual disclosure or, at the creditor's option, with each periodic statement) and the alternative billing-error rights statement (for use with each periodic statement), respectively. For home-equity plans subject to the requirements of § 226.5b, at the creditor's option, a creditor either may use G-3 or G-3(A), and for creditors that use the short form, G-4 or G-4(A). For open-end (not home-secured) plans that not subject to the requirements of § 226.5b, creditors properly use G-3(A) and G-4(A). Creditors must provide the billing-error rights statements in a form substantially similar to the models in order to comply with the regulation. The model billing-rights statements may be modified in any of the ways set forth in the first paragraph to the commentary on appendices G and H. The models may, furthermore, be modified by deleting inapplicable information, such as:
A. The paragraph concerning stopping a debit in relation to a disputed amount, if the creditor does not have the ability to debit automatically the consumer's savings or checking account for payment.
B. The rights stated in the special rule for credit card purchases and any limitations on those rights.
ii. The model billing rights statements also contain optional language that creditors may use. For example, the creditor may:
A. Include a statement to the effect that notice of a billing error must be submitted on something other than the payment ticket or other material accompanying the periodic disclosures.
B. Insert its address or refer to the address that appears elsewhere on the bill.
C. Include instructions for consumers, at the consumer's option, to communicate with the creditor electronically or in writing.
iii. Additional information may be included on the statements as long as it does not detract from the required disclosures. For instance, information concerning the reporting of errors in connection with a checking account may be included on a combined statement as long as the disclosures required by the regulation remain clear and conspicuous.
4.
Models G-5 through G-9.
These models set out notices of the right to rescind that would be used at different times in an open-end plan. The last paragraph of each of the rescission model forms contains a blank for the date by which the consumer's notice of cancellation must be sent or delivered. A parenthetical is included to address the situation in which the consumer's right to rescind the transaction exists beyond 3 business days following the date of the transaction, for example, when the notice or material disclosures are delivered late or when the date of the transaction in paragraph 1 of the notice is an estimate. The language of the parenthetical is not optional. See the commentary to section 226.2(a)(25) regarding the specificity of the security interest disclosure for model form G-7.
5.
Model G-10(A), samples G-10(B) and G-10(C), model G-10(D), sample G-10(E), model G-17(A), and samples G-17(B), 17(C) and 17(D).
i. Model G-10(A) and Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) illustrate, in the tabular format, the disclosures required under § 226.5a for applications and solicitations for credit cards other than charge cards. Model G-10(D) and Sample G-10(E) illustrate the tabular format disclosure for charge card applications and solicitations and reflect the disclosures in the table. Model G-17(A) and Samples G-17(B), G-17(C) and G-17(D) illustrate, in the tabular format, the disclosures required under § 226.6(b)(2) for account-opening disclosures.
ii. Except as otherwise permitted, disclosures must be substantially similar in sequence and format to Models G-10(A), G-10(D) and G-17(A). While proper use of the model forms will be deemed in compliance with the regulation, card issuers and other creditors offering open-end (not home-secured) plans are permitted to disclose the annual percentage rates for purchases, cash advances, or balance transfers in the same row in the table for any transaction types for which the issuer or creditor charges the same annual percentage rate. Similarly, card issuer and other creditors offering open-end (not home-secured) plans are permitted to disclose fees of the same amount in the same row if the fees are in the same category. Fees in different categories may not be disclosed in the same row. For example, a transaction fee and a penalty fee that are of the same amount may not be disclosed in the same row. Card issuers and other creditors offering open-end (not home-secured) plans are also permitted to use headings other than those in the forms if they are clear and concise and are substantially similar to the headings contained in model forms, with the following exceptions. The heading “penalty APR” must be used when describing rates that may increase due to default or delinquency or as a penalty, and in relation to required insurance, or debt cancellation or suspension coverage, the term “required” and the name of the product must be used. (See also §§ 226.5a(b)(5) and 226.6(b)(2)(v) for guidance on headings that must be used to describe the grace period, or lack of grace period, in the disclosures required under § 226.5a for applications and solicitations for credit cards other than charge cards, and the disclosures required under § 226.6(b)(2) for account-opening disclosures, respectively.)
iii. Models G-10(A) and G-17(A) contain two alternative headings (“Minimum Interest Charge” and “Minimum Charge”) for disclosing a minimum interest or fixed finance charge under §§ 226.5a(b)(3) and 226.6(b)(2)(iii). If a creditor imposes a minimum charge in lieu of interest in those months where a consumer would otherwise incur an interest charge but that interest charge is less than the minimum charge, the creditor should disclose this charge under the heading “Minimum Interest Charge” or a substantially similar heading. Other minimum or fixed finance charges should be disclosed under the heading “Minimum Charge” or a substantially similar heading.
iv. Models G-10(A), G-10(D) and G-17(A) contain two alternative headings (“Annual Fees” and “Set-up and Maintenance Fees”) for disclosing fees for issuance or availability of credit under § 226.5a(b)(2) or § 226.6(b)(2)(ii). If the only fee for issuance or availability of credit disclosed under § 226.5a(b)(2) or § 226.6(b)(2)(ii) is an annual fee, a creditor should use the heading “Annual Fee” or a substantially similar heading to disclose this fee. If a creditor imposes fees for issuance or availability of credit disclosed under § 226.5a(b)(2) or § 226.6(b)(2)(ii) other than, or in addition to, an annual fee, the creditor should use the heading “Set-up and Maintenance Fees” or a substantially similar heading to disclose fees for issuance or availability of credit, including the annual fee.
v. Although creditors are not required to use a certain paper size in disclosing the §§ 226.5a or 226.6(b)(1) and (2) disclosures, samples G-10(B), G-10(C), G-17(B), G-17(C) and G-17(D) are designed to be printed on an 8
1/2
× 14 inch sheet of paper. A creditor may use a smaller sheet of paper, such as 8
1/2
× 11 inch sheet of paper. If the table is not provided on a single side of a sheet of paper, the creditor must include a reference or references, such as “SEE BACK OF PAGE for more important information about your account.” at the bottom of each page indicating that the table continues onto an additional page or pages. A creditor that splits the table onto two or more pages must disclose the table on consecutive pages and may not include any intervening information between portions of the table. In addition, the following formatting techniques were used in presenting the information in the sample tables to ensure that the information is readable:
A. A readable font style and font size (10-point Arial font style, except for the purchase annual percentage rate which is shown in 16-point type).
B. Sufficient spacing between lines of the text.
C. Adequate spacing between paragraphs when several pieces of information were included in the same row of the table, as appropriate. For example, in the samples in the row of the tables with the heading “APR for Balance Transfers,” the forms disclose two components: the applicable balance transfer rate and a cross reference to the balance transfer fee. The samples show these two components on separate lines with adequate space between each component. On the other hand, in the samples, in the disclosure of the late payment fee, the forms disclose two components: the late payment fee, and the cross reference to the penalty rate. Because the disclosure of both these components is short, these components are disclosed on the same line in the tables.
D. Standard spacing between words and characters. In other words, the text was not compressed to appear smaller than 10-point type.
E. Sufficient white space around the text of the information in each row, by providing sufficient margins above, below and to the sides of the text.
F. Sufficient contrast between the text and the background. Generally, black text was used on white paper.
vi. While the Board is not requiring issuers to use the above formatting techniques in presenting information in the table (except for the 10-point and 16-point font requirement), the Board encourages issuers to consider these techniques when deciding how to disclose information in the table, to ensure that the information is presented in a readable format.
vii. Creditors are allowed to use color, shading and similar graphic techniques with respect to the table, so long as the table remains substantially similar to the model and sample forms in appendix G.
6.
Model G-11.
Model G-11 contains clauses that illustrate the general disclosures required under § 226.5a(e) in applications and solicitations made available to the general public.
7.
Models G-13(A) and G-13(B).
These model forms illustrate the disclosures required under § 226.9(f) when the card issuer changes the entity providing insurance on a credit card account. Model G-13(A) contains the items set forth in § 226.9(f)(3) as examples of significant terms of coverage that may be affected by the change in insurance provider. The card issuer may either list all of these potential changes in coverage and place a check mark by the applicable changes, or list only the actual changes in coverage. Under either approach, the card issuer must either explain the changes or refer to an accompanying copy of the policy or group certificate for details of the new terms of coverage. Model G-13(A) also illustrates the permissible combination of the two notices required by § 226.9(f)—the notice required for a planned change in provider and the notice required once a change has occurred. This form may be modified for use in providing only the disclosures required before the change if the card issuer chooses to send two separate notices. Thus, for example, the references to the attached policy or certificate would not be required in a separate notice prior to a change in the insurance provider since the policy or certificate need not be provided at that time. Model G-13(B) illustrates the disclosures required under § 226.9(f)(2) when the insurance provider is changed.
8.
Samples G-18(A)-(D).
For home-equity plans subject to the requirements of § 226.5b, if a creditor chooses to comply with the requirements in § 226.7(b), the creditor may use Samples G-18(A) through G-18(D) to comply with these requirements, as applicable.
9.
Samples G-18(D).
Sample G-18(D) illustrates how credit card issuers may comply with proximity requirements for payment information on periodic statements. Creditors that offer card accounts with a charge card feature and a revolving feature may change the disclosure to make clear to which feature the disclosures apply.
10.
Forms G-18(F)-(G).
Forms G-18(F) and G-18(G) are intended as a compliance aid to illustrate front sides of a periodic statement, and how a periodic statement for open-end (not home-secured) plans might be designed to comply with the requirements of § 226.7. The samples contain information that is not required by Regulation Z. The samples also present information in additional formats that are not required by Regulation Z.
i. Creditors are not required to use a certain paper size in disclosing the § 226.7 disclosures. However, Forms G-18(F) and G-18(G) are designed to be printed on an 8 × 14 inch sheet of paper.
ii. The due date for a payment, if a late payment fee or penalty rate may be imposed, must appear on the front of the first page of the statement. See Sample G-18(D) that illustrates how a creditor may comply with proximity requirements for other disclosures. The payment information disclosures appear in the upper right-hand corner on Samples G-18(F) and G-18(G), but may be located elsewhere, as long as they appear on the front of the first page of the periodic statement. The summary of account activity presented on Samples G-18(F) and G-18(G) is not itself a required disclosure, although the previous balance and the new balance, presented in the summary, must be disclosed in a clear and conspicuous manner on periodic statements.
iii. Additional information not required by Regulation Z may be presented on the statement. The information need not be located in any particular place or be segregated from disclosures required by Regulation Z, although the effect of proximity requirements for required disclosures, such as the due date, may cause the additional information to be segregated from those disclosures required to be disclosed in close proximity to one another. Any additional information must be presented consistent with the creditor's obligation to provide required disclosures in a clear and conspicuous manner.
iv. Model Forms G-18(F) and G-18(G) demonstrate two examples of ways in which transactions could be presented on the periodic statement. Model Form G-18(G) presents transactions grouped by type and Model Form G-18(F) presents transactions in a list in chronological order. Neither of these approaches to presenting transactions is required; a creditor may present transactions differently, such as in a list grouped by authorized user or other means.
11.
Model Form G-19.
See § 226.9(b)(3) regarding the headings required to be disclosed when describing in the tabular disclosure a grace period (or lack of a grace period) offered on check transactions that access a credit card account.
12.
Sample G-24.
Sample G-24 includes two model clauses for use in complying with § 226.16(h)(4). Model clause (a) is for use in connection with credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer
credit plan. Model clause (b) is for use in connection with other open-end credit plans.

# Appendix H—Closed-End Model Forms and Clauses
1.
Models H-1 and H-2.
Creditors may make several types of changes to closed-end model forms H-1 (credit sale) and H-2 (loan) and still be deemed to be in compliance with the regulation, provided that the required disclosures are made clearly and conspicuously. Permissible changes include the addition of the information permitted by footnote 37 to § 226.17 and “directly related” information as set forth in the commentary to § 226.17(a).
The creditor may also delete or, on multi-purpose forms, indicate inapplicable disclosures, such as:
• The itemization of the amount financed option. (See Samples H-12 through H-15.)
• The credit life and disability insurance disclosures. (See Samples H-11 and H-12.)
• The property insurance disclosures. (See Samples H-10 through H-12, and H-14.)
• The “filing fees” and “non-filing insurance” disclosures. (See Samples H-11 and H-12.)
• The prepayment penalty or rebate disclosures. (See Samples H-12 and H-14.)
• The total sale price. (See Samples H-11 through H-15.)
Other permissible changes include:
• Adding the creditor's address or telephone number. (See the commentary to § 226.18(a).)
• Combining required terms where several numerical disclosures are the same, for instance, if the “total of payments” equals the “total sale price.” (See the commentary to § 226.18.)
• Rearranging the sequence or location of the disclosures—for instance, by placing the descriptive phrases outside the boxes containing the corresponding disclosures, or by grouping the descriptors together as a glossary of terms in a separate section of the segregated disclosures; by placing the payment schedule at the top of the form; or by changing the order of the disclosures in the boxes, including the annual percentage rate and finance charge boxes.
• Using brackets, instead of checkboxes, to indicate inapplicable disclosures.
• Using a line for the consumer to initial, rather than a checkbox, to indicate an election to receive an itemization of the amount financed.
• Deleting captions for disclosures.
• Using a symbol, such as an asterisk, for estimated disclosures, instead of an “e.”
• Adding a signature line to the insurance disclosures to reflect joint policies.
• Separately itemizing the filing fees.
• Revising the late charge disclosure in accordance with the commentary to § 226.18(l).
2.
Model H-3.
Creditors have considerable flexibility in filling out Model H-3 (itemization of the amount financed). Appropriate revisions, such as those set out in the commentary to § 226.18(c), may be made to this form without loss of protection from civil liability for proper use of the model forms.
3.
Models H-4 through H-7.
The model clauses are not included in the model forms although they are mandatory for certain transactions. Creditors using the model clauses when applicable to a transaction are deemed to be in compliance with the regulation with regard to that disclosure.
4.
Model H-4(A).
This model contains the variable rate model clauses applicable to transactions subject to § 226.18(f)(1) and is intended to give creditors considerable flexibility in structuring variable rate disclosures to fit individual plans. The information about circumstances, limitations, and effects of an increase may be given in terms of the contract interest rate or the annual percentage rate. Clauses are shown for hypothetical examples based on the specific amount of the transaction and based on a representative amount. Creditors may preprint the variable rate disclosures based on a representative amount for similar types of transactions, instead of constructing an individualized example for each transaction. In both representative examples and transaction-specific examples, creditors may refer either to the incremental change in rate, payment amount, or number of payments, or to the resulting rate, payment amount, or number of payments. For example, creditors may state that the rate will increase by 2%, with a corresponding $150 increase in the payment, or creditors may state that the rate will increase to 16%, with a corresponding payment of $850.
5.
Model H-4(B).
This model clause illustrates the variable-rate disclosure required under § 226.18(f)(2), which would alert consumers to the fact that the transaction contains a variable-rate feature and that disclosures were provided earlier.
6.
Model H-4(C).
This model clause illustrates the early disclosures required generally under § 226.19(b). It includes information on how the consumer's interest rate is determined and how it can change over the term of the loan, and explains changes that may occur in the borrower's monthly payment. It contains an example of how to disclose historical changes in the index or formula values used to compute interest rates for the preceding 15 years. The model clause also illustrates the disclosure of the initial and maximum interest rates and payments based on an initial interest rate (index value plus margin, adjusted by the amount of any discount or premium) in effect as of an identified month and year for the loan program disclosure and illustrates how to provide consumers with a method for calculating the
monthly payment for the loan amount to be borrowed.
7.
Models H-4(D) through H-4(J).
These model clauses illustrate certain notices, statements, and other disclosures required as follows
i. Model H-4(D) illustrates the adjustment notice required under § 226.20(c), and provides examples of payment change notices and annual notices of interest rate changes.
ii. Model H-4(E) illustrates the interest rate and payment summary table required under § 226.18(s) for a fixed-rate mortgage transaction.
iii. Model H-4(F) illustrates the interest rate and payment summary table required under § 226.18(s) for an adjustable-rate or a step-rate mortgage transaction.
iv. Model H-4(G) illustrates the interest rate and payment summary table required under § 226.18(s) for a mortgage transaction with negative amortization.
v. Model H-4(H) illustrates the interest rate and payment summary table required under § 226.18(s) for a fixed-rate, interest-only mortgage transaction.
vi. Model H-4(I) illustrates the introductory rate disclosure required by § 226.18(s)(2)(iii) for an adjustable-rate mortgage transaction with an introductory rate.
vii. Model H-4(J) illustrates the balloon payment disclosure required by § 226.18(s)(5) for a mortgage transaction with a balloon payment term.
viii. Model H-4(K) illustrates the no-guarantee-to-refinance statement required by § 226.18(t) for a mortgage transaction.
8.
Model H-5.
This contains the demand feature clause.
9.
Model H-6.
This contains the assumption clause.
10.
Model H-7.
This contains the required deposit clause.
11.
Models H-8 and H-9.
These models contain the rescission notices for a typical closed-end transaction and a refinancing, respectively. The last paragraph of each model form contains a blank for the date by which the consumer's notice of cancellation must be sent or delivered. A parenthetical is included to address the situation in which the consumer's right to rescind the transaction exists beyond 3 business days following the date of the transaction, for example, where the notice or material disclosures are delivered late or where the date of the transaction in paragraph 1 of the notice is an estimate. The language of the parenthetical is not optional. See the commentary to section 226.2(a)(25) regarding the specificity of the security interest disclosure for model form H-9. The prior version of model form H-9 is substantially similar to the current version and creditors may continue to use it, as appropriate. Creditors are encouraged, however, to use the current version when reordering or reprinting forms.
12.
Sample forms.
The sample forms (H-10 through H-15) serve a different purpose than the model forms. The samples illustrate various ways of adapting the model forms to the individual transactions described in the commentary to appendix H. The deletions and rearrangments shown relate only to the specific transactions described. As a result, the samples do not provide the general protection from civil liability provided by the model forms and clauses.
13.
Sample H-10.
This sample illustrates an automobile credit sale. The cash price is $7,500 with a downpayment of $1,500. There is an 8% add-on interest rate and a term of 3 years, with 36 equal monthly payments. The credit life insurance premium and the filing fees are financed by the creditor. There is a $25 credit report fee paid by the consumer before consummation, which is a prepaid finance charge.
14.
Sample H-11.
This sample illustrates an installment loan. The amount of the loan is $5,000. There is a 12% simple interest rate and a term of 2 years. The date of the transaction is expected to be April 15, 1981, with the first payment due on June 1, 1981. The first payment amount is labelled as an estimate since the transaction date is uncertain. The odd days' interest ($26.67) is collected with the first payment. The remaining 23 monthly payments are equal.
15.
Sample H-12.
This sample illustrates a refinancing and consolidation loan. The amount of the loan is $5,000. There is a 15% simple interest rate and a term of 3 years. The date of the transaction is April 1, 1981, with the first payment due on May 1, 1981. The first 35 monthly payments are equal, with an odd final payment. The credit disability insurance premium is financed. In calculating the annual percentage rate, the U.S. Rule has been used. Since an itemization of the amount financed is included with the disclosures, the statement regarding the consumer's option to receive an itemization is deleted.
16.
Samples H-13 through H-15.
These samples illustrate various mortgage transactions. They assume that the mortgages are subject to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). As a result, no option regarding the itemization of the amount financed has been included in the samples, because providing the good faith estimates of settlement costs required by RESPA satisfies Truth in Lending's amount financed itemization requirement. (See footnote 39 to § 226.18(c).)
17.
Sample H-13.
This sample illustrates a mortgage with a demand feature. The loan amount is $44,900, payable in 360 monthly installments at a simple interest rate of 14.75%. The 15 days of interim interest ($294.34) is collected as a prepaid finance charge at the time of consummation of the
loan (April 15, 1981). In calculating the disclosure amounts, the minor irregularities provision in § 226.17(c)(4) has been used. The property insurance premiums are not included in the payment schedule. This disclosure statement could be used for notes with the 7-year call option required by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) in states where due-on-sale clauses are prohibited.
18.
Sample H-14.
This sample disclosure form illustrates the disclosures under § 226.19(b) for a variable-rate transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling with a term greater than one year. The sample form shows a creditor how to adapt the model clauses in appendix H-4(C) to the creditor's own particular variable-rate program. The sample disclosure form describes the features of a specific variable-rate mortgage program and alerts the consumer to the fact that information on the creditor's other closed-end variable-rate programs is available upon request. It includes information on how the interest rate is determined and how it can change over time. Section 226.19(b)(2)(viii) permits creditors the option to provide either a historical example or an initial and maximum interest rates and payments disclosure; both are illustrated in the sample disclosure. The historical example explains how the monthly payment can change based on a $10,000 loan amount, payable in 360 monthly installments, based on historical changes in the values for the weekly average yield on U.S. Treasury Securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year. Index values are measured for 15 years, as of the first week ending in July. This reflects the requirement that the index history be based on values for the same date or period each year in the example. The sample disclosure also illustrates the alternative disclosure under § 226.19(b)(2)(viii)(B) that the initial and the maximum interest rates and payments be shown for a $10,000 loan originated at an initial interest rate of 12.41 percent (which was in effect July 1996) and to have 2 percentage point annual (and 5 percentage point overall) interest rate limitations or caps. Thus, the maximum amount that the interest rate could rise under this program is 5 percentage points higher than the 12.41 percent initial rate to 17.41 percent, and the monthly payment could rise from $106.03 to a maximum of $145.34. The loan would not reach the maximum interest rate until its fourth year because of the 2 percentage point annual rate limitations, and the maximum payment disclosed reflects the amortization of the loan during that period. The sample form also illustrates how to provide consumers with a method for calculating their actual monthly payment for a loan amount other than $10,000.
19.
Sample H-15.
This sample illustrates a graduated payment mortgage with a 5-year graduation period and a 7
1/2
percent yearly increase in payments. The loan amount is $44,900, payable in 360 monthly installments at a simple interest rate of 14.75%. Two points ($898), as well as an initial mortgage guarantee insurance premium of $225.00, are included in the prepaid finance charge. The mortgage guarantee insurance premiums are calculated on the basis of
1/4
of 1% of the outstanding principal balance under an annual reduction plan. The abbreviated disclosure permitted under § 226.18(g)(2) is used for the payment schedule for years 6 through 30. The prepayment disclosure refers to both penalties and rebates because information about penalties is required for the simple interest portion of the obligation and information about rebates is required for the mortgage insurance portion of the obligation.
20.
Sample H-16.
This sample illustrates the disclosures required under § 226.32(c). The sample illustrates the amount borrowed and the disclosures about optional insurance that are required for mortgage refinancings under § 226.32(c)(5). Creditors may, at their option, include these disclosures for all loans subject to § 226.32. The sample also includes disclosures required under § 226.32(c)(3) when the legal obligation includes a balloon payment.
21.
HRSA-500-1 9-82.
Pursuant to section 113(a) of the Truth in Lending Act, Form HRSA-500-1 9-82 issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for certain student loans has been approved for use for loans made prior to the mandatory compliance date of the disclosures required under Subpart F. The form was approved for all Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL) with a variable interest rate that were considered interim student credit extensions as defined in Regulation Z.
22.
HRSA-500-2 9-82.
Pursuant to section 113(a) of the Truth in Lending Act, Form HRSA-500-2 9-82 issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for certain student loans has been approved for use for loans made prior to the mandatory compliance date of the disclosures required under Subpart F. The form was approved for all HEAL loans with a fixed interest rate that were considered interim student credit extensions as defined in Regulation Z.
23.
HRSA-502-1 9-82.
Pursuant to section 113(a) of the Truth in Lending Act, Form HRSA-502-1 9-82 issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for certain student loans has been approved for use for loans made prior to the mandatory compliance date of the disclosures required under Subpart F. The form was approved for all HEAL loans with a variable interest rate in which the borrower has reached repayment status and is making payments of both interest and principal.
24.
HRSA-502-2 9-82.
Pursuant to section 113(a) of the Truth in Lending Act, Form
HRSA-502-2 9-82 issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for certain student loans has been approved for use for loans made prior to the mandatory compliance date of the disclosures required under Subpart F. The form was approved for all HEAL loans with a fixed interest rate in which the borrower has reached repayment status and is making payments of both interest and principal.
25.
Models H-18, H-19, H-20.
i. These model forms illustrate disclosures required under § 226.47 on or with an application or solicitation, at approval, and after acceptance of a private education loan. Although use of the model forms is not required, creditors using them properly will be deemed to be in compliance with the regulation with regard to private education loan disclosures. Creditors may make certain types of changes to private education loan model forms H-18 (application and solicitation), H-19 (approval), and H-20 (final) and still be deemed to be in compliance with the regulation, provided that the required disclosures are made clearly and conspicuously. The model forms aggregate disclosures into groups under specific headings. Changes may not include rearranging the sequence of disclosures, for instance, by rearranging which disclosures are provided under each heading or by rearranging the sequence of the headings and grouping of disclosures. Changes to the model forms may not be so extensive as to affect the substance or clarity of the forms. Creditors making revisions with that effect will lose their protection from civil liability.
The creditor may delete inapplicable disclosures, such as:
• The Federal student financial assistance alternatives disclosures
• The self-certification disclosure
Other permissible changes include, for example:
• Adding the creditor's address, telephone number, or Web site
• Adding loan identification information, such as a loan identification number
• Adding the date on which the form was printed or produced
• Placing the notice of the right to cancel in the top left or top right of the disclosure to accommodate a window envelope
• Combining required terms where several numerical disclosures are the same. For instance, if the itemization of the amount financed is provided, the amount financed need not be separately disclosed
• Combining the disclosure of loan term and payment deferral options required in § 226.47(a)(3) with the disclosure of cost estimates required in § 226.47(a)(4) in the same chart or table (
See
comment 47(a)(3)-4.)
• Using the first person, instead of the second person, in referring to the borrower
• Using “borrower” and “creditor” instead of pronouns
• Incorporating certain state “plain English” requirements
• Deleting inapplicable disclosures by whiting out, blocking out, filling in “N/A” (not applicable) or “0,” crossing out, leaving blanks, checking a box for applicable items, or circling applicable items
ii. Although creditors are not required to use a certain paper size in disclosing the §§ 226.47(a), (b) and (c) disclosures, samples H-21, H-22, and H-23 are designed to be printed on two 8
1/2
× 11 inch sheets of paper. A creditor may use a larger sheet of paper, such as 8
1/2
× 14 inch sheets of paper, or may use multiple pages. If the disclosures are provided on two sides of a single sheet of paper, the creditor must include a reference or references, such as “SEE BACK OF PAGE” at the bottom of each page indicating that the disclosures continue onto the back of the page. If the disclosures are on two or more pages, a creditor may not include any intervening information between portions of the disclosure. In addition, the following formatting techniques were used in presenting the information in the sample tables to ensure that the information is readable:
A. A readable font style and font size (10-point Helvetica font style for body text).
B. Sufficient spacing between lines of the text.
C. Standard spacing between words and characters. In other words, the body text was not compressed to appear smaller than the 10-point type size.
D. Sufficient white space around the text of the information in each row, by providing sufficient margins above, below and to the sides of the text.
E. Sufficient contrast between the text and the background. Generally, black text was used on white paper.
iii. While the Board is not requiring issuers to use the above formatting techniques in presenting information in the disclosure, the Board encourages issuers to consider these techniques when deciding how to disclose information in the disclosure to ensure that the information is presented in a readable format.
iv. Creditors are allowed to use color, shading and similar graphic techniques in the disclosures, so long as the disclosures remain substantially similar to the model and sample forms in appendix H.
26.
Sample H-21.
This sample illustrates a disclosure required under § 226.47(a). The sample assumes a range of interest rates between 7.375% and 17.375%. The sample assumes a variable interest rate that will never exceed 25% over the life of the loan. The term of the sample loan is 20 years for an amount up to $20,000 and 30 years for an amount more than $20,000. The repayment
options and sample costs have been combined into a single table, as permitted in the commentary to § 226.47(a)(3). It demonstrates the loan amount, interest rate, and total paid when a consumer makes loan payments while in school, pays only interest while in school, and defers all payments while in school.
27.
Sample H-22.
This sample illustrates a disclosure required under § 226.47(b). The sample assumes the consumer financed $10,000 at an 8.23% annual percentage rate. The sample assumes a variable interest rate that will never exceed 25% over the life of the loan. The payment schedule and terms assumes a 20-year loan term and that the consumer elected to defer payments while enrolled in school. This includes a sample disclosure of a total loan amount of $10,600 and prepaid finance charges totaling $600, for a total amount financed of $10,000.
28.
Sample H-22.
This sample illustrates a disclosure required under § 226.47(c). The sample assumes the consumer financed $10,000 at an 8.23% annual percentage rate. The sample assumes a variable annual percentage rate in an instance where there is no maximum interest rate. The sample demonstrates disclosure of an assumed maximum rate, and the statement that the consumer's actual maximum rate and payment amount could be higher. The payment schedule and terms assumes a 20-year loan term, the assumed maximum interest rate, and that the consumer elected to defer payments while enrolled in school. This includes a sample disclosure of a total loan amount of $10,600 and prepaid finance charges totaling $600, for a total amount financed of $10,000.

Use of appendix J.
Appendix J sets forth the actuarial equations and instructions for calculating the annual percentage rate in closed-end credit transactions. While the formulas contained in this appendix may be directly applied to calculate the annual percentage rate for an individual transaction, they may also be utilized to program calculators and computers to perform the calculations.
2.
Relation to Board tables.
The Board's Annual Percentage Rate Tables also provide creditors with a calculation tool that applies the technical information in appendix J. An annual percentage rate computed in accordance with the instructions in the tables is deemed to comply with the regulation. Volume I of the tables may be used for credit transactions involving equal payment amounts and periods, as well as for transactions involving any of the following irregularities: odd first period, odd first payment and odd last payment. Volume II of the tables may be used for transactions that involve any type of irregularities. These tables may be obtained from any Federal Reserve Bank or from the Board in Washington, DC 20551, upon request.

1981 changes:
Paragraph (b)(2) has been revised to clarify that the term of the transaction never begins earlier than consummation of the transaction. Paragraph (b)(5)(vi) has been revised to permit creditors in single-advance, single-payment transactions in which the term is less than a year and is equal to a whole number of months, to use either the 12-month method or the 365-day method to compute the number of unit-periods per year.

# Appendix K—Total Annual Loan Cost Rate Computations for Reverse Mortgage Transactions
1.
General.
The calculation of total annual loan cost rates under appendix K is based on the principles set forth and the estimation or “iteration” procedure used to compute annual percentage rates under appendix J. Rather than restate this iteration process in full, the regulation cross-references the procedures found in appendix J. In other aspects the appendix reflects the special nature of reverse mortgage transactions. Special definitions and instructions are included where appropriate.
(b) Instructions and equations for the total annual loan cost rate.
(b)(5) Number of unit-periods between two given dates.
1.
Assumption as to when transaction begins.
The computation of the total annual loan cost rate is based on the assumption that the reverse mortgage transaction begins on the first day of the month in which consummation is estimated to occur. Therefore, fractional unit-periods (used under appendix J for calculating annual percentage rates) are not used.
(b)(9) Assumption for discretionary cash advances.
1.
Amount of credit.
Creditors should compute the total annual loan cost rates for transactions involving discretionary cash advances by assuming that 50 percent of the initial amount of the credit available under the transaction is advanced at closing or, in
an open-end transaction, when the consumer becomes obligated under the plan. (For the purposes of this assumption, the initial amount of the credit is the principal loan amount less any costs to the consumer under section 226.33(c)(1).)
(b)(10) Assumption for variable-rate reverse mortgage transactions.
1.
Initial discount or premium rate.
Where a variable-rate reverse mortgage transaction includes an initial discount or premium rate, the creditor should apply the same rules for calculating the total annual loan cost rate as are applied when calculating the annual percentage rate for a loan with an initial discount or premium rate (see the commentary to § 226.17(c)).
(d) Reverse mortgage model form and sample form.
(d)(2) Sample form.
1.
General.
The “clear and conspicuous” standard for reverse mortgage disclosures does not require disclosures to be printed in any particular type size. Disclosures may be made on more than one page, and use both the front and the reverse sides, as long as the pages constitute an integrated document and the table disclosing the total annual loan cost rates is on a single page.

# Appendix L—Assumed Loan Periods for Computations of Total Annual Loan Cost Rates
1.
General.
The life expectancy figures used in appendix L are those found in the U.S. Decennial Life Tables for women, as rounded to the nearest whole year and as published by the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services. The figures contained in appendix L must be used by creditors for all consumers (men and women). Appendix L will be revised periodically by the Board to incorporate revisions to the figures made in the Decennial Tables.

# Appendix O—Illustrative Written Source Documents for Higher-Priced Mortgage Loan Appraisal Rules
1.
Title commitment report.
The “title commitment report” is a document from a title insurance company describing the property interest and status of its title, parties with interests in the title and the nature of their claims, issues with the title that must be resolved prior to closing of the transaction between the parties to the transfer, amount and disposition of the premiums, and endorsements on the title policy. This document is issued by the title insurance company prior to the company's issuance of an actual title insurance policy to the property's transferee and/or creditor financing the transaction. In different jurisdictions, this instrument may be referred to by different terms, such as a title commitment, title binder, title opinion, or title report.

# Subpart A—General
§ 228.11
Authority, purposes, and scope.
(a)
Authority.
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board) issues this part to implement the Community Reinvestment Act (12 U.S.C. 2901
et seq.
) (CRA). The regulations comprising this part are issued under the authority of the CRA and under the provisions of the United States Code authorizing the Board:
(1) To conduct examinations of State-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System (12 U.S.C. 325);
(2) To conduct examinations of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries (12 U.S.C. 1844) and savings and loan holding companies and their subsidiaries (12 U.S.C. 1467a); and
(3) To consider applications for:
(i) Domestic branches by State member banks (12 U.S.C. 321);
(ii) Mergers in which the resulting bank would be a State member bank (12 U.S.C. 1828(c));
(iii) Formations of, acquisitions of banks by, and mergers of, bank holding companies (12 U.S.C. 1842);
(iv) The acquisition of savings associations by bank holding companies (12 U.S.C. 1843); and
(v) Formations of, acquisitions of savings associations by, conversions of, and mergers of, savings and loan holding companies (12 U.S.C. 1467a).
(b)
Purposes.
This part implements the requirement in the CRA that the Board assess a bank's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which the bank is chartered, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank, and to take this record into account in the agency's evaluation of an application for a deposit facility by the bank. Accordingly, this part:
(1) Establishes the framework and criteria by which the Board assesses a bank's record of responding to the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank; and
(2) Provides that the Board takes that record into account in considering certain applications.
(c)
Scope
—(1)
General.
This part applies to all banks except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(2)
Foreign bank acquisitions.
This part also applies to an uninsured State branch (other than a limited branch) of a foreign bank that results from an acquisition described in section 5(a)(8) of the International Banking Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3103(a)(8)). The terms “State branch” and “foreign bank” have the same meanings as given to those terms in section 1(b) of the International Banking Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3101
et seq.
); the term “uninsured State branch” means a State branch the deposits of which are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; the term “limited branch” means a State branch that accepts only deposits that are permissible for a corporation organized under section 25A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 611
et seq.
).
(3)
Certain exempt banks.
This part does not apply to banks that do not perform commercial or retail banking services by granting credit to the public in the ordinary course of business,
other than as incident to their specialized operations and done on an accommodation basis. These banks include bankers' banks, as defined in 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh), and banks that engage only in one or more of the following activities: providing cash management controlled disbursement services or serving as correspondent banks, trust companies, or clearing agents.

Pt. 228, App. A

# Appendix A to Part 228—Calculations for the Retail Lending Test
This appendix, based on requirements described in §§ 228.22 and 228.28, includes the following sections:
I. Retail Lending Volume Screen
II. Retail Lending Test Distribution Metrics—Scope of Evaluation
III. Geographic Distribution Metrics and Benchmarks
IV. Borrower Distribution Metrics and Benchmarks
V. Supporting Conclusions for Major Product Lines Other Than Automobile Lending
VI. Supporting Conclusions for Automobile Lending
VII. Retail Lending Test Conclusions—All Major Product Lines
VIII. Retail Lending Test Weighting and Conclusions for States, Multistate MSAs, and the Institution

# I. Retail Lending Volume Screen
The Board calculates the Bank Volume Metric and the Market Volume Benchmark for a facility-based assessment area and determines whether the bank has met or surpassed the Retail Lending Volume Threshold in that facility-based assessment area.
a.
Bank Volume Metric.
The Board calculates the Bank Volume Metric for each facility-based assessment area by:
1. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the bank's annual dollar volume of loans included in the Bank Volume Metric (
i.e., volume metric loans
). The bank's annual dollar volume of volume metric loans is the total dollar amount of all home mortgage loans, multifamily loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and automobile loans originated or purchased by the bank in the facility-based assessment area in that year. Automobile loans are included in the bank's annual dollar amount of volume metric loans only if automobile loans are a product line for the bank.
2. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in the facility-based assessment area. For a bank that reports deposits data pursuant to § 228.42(b)(3), the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in a facility-based assessment area is the total of annual average daily balances of deposits reported by the bank in counties in the facility-based assessment area for that year. For a bank that
does not report deposits data pursuant to § 228.42(b)(3), the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in a facility-based assessment area is the total of deposits assigned to facilities reported by the bank in the facility-based assessment area in the FDIC's Summary of Deposits for that year.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph I.a.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph I.a.2 of this appendix.
Example A-1:
The bank has a three-year evaluation period. The bank's annual dollar amounts of
volume metric loans
are $300,000 (year 1), $300,000 (year 2), and $400,000 (year 3). The sum of the bank's annual dollar amount of
volume metric loans
in a facility-based assessment area, over the years in the evaluation period, is therefore $1 million. The annual dollar volumes of deposits in the bank located in the facility-based assessment area are $1.7 million (year 1), $1.6 million (year 2), and $1.7 million (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volume of deposits in the facility-based assessment area, over the years in the evaluation period, is therefore $5 million. The Bank Volume Metric for the facility-based assessment area would be $1 million divided by $5 million, or 0.2 (equivalently, 20 percent).
ER01FE24.064
b.
Market Volume Benchmark.
The Board calculates the Market Volume Benchmark for the facility-based assessment area. For purposes of calculating the Market Volume Benchmark, a
benchmark depository institution
for a particular year is a depository institution that, in that year, was subject to reporting pursuant to § 228.42(b)(1), 12 CFR 25.42(b)(1) or 345.42(b)(1), or 12 CFR part 1003, and operated a facility included in the FDIC's Summary of Deposits data in the facility-based assessment area. The Board calculates the Market Volume Benchmark by:
1. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the annual dollar volume of volume benchmark loans. The annual dollar volume of volume benchmark loans is the total dollar volume of all home mortgage loans, multifamily loans, small business loans, and small farm loans in the facility-based assessment area in that year that are reported loans originated by benchmark depository institutions.
2. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the annual dollar volume of deposits for benchmark depository institutions in the facility-based assessment area. The annual dollar volume of deposits for benchmark depository institutions in the facility-based assessment area is the sum across benchmark depository institutions of: (i) for a benchmark depository institution that reports data pursuant to § 228.42(b)(3) or 12 CFR 25.42(b)(3) or 345.42(b)(3), the total of annual average daily balances of deposits reported by that depository institution in counties in the facility-based assessment area for that year; and (ii) for a benchmark depository institution that does not report data pursuant to § 228.42(b)(3) or 12 CFR 25.42(b)(3) or 345.42(b)(3), the total of deposits assigned to facilities reported by that depository institution in counties in the facility-based assessment area in the FDIC's Summary of Deposits for that year.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph I.b.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph I.b.2 of this appendix.
Example A-2:
With reference to example A-1 to this appendix, the annual dollar volume of volume benchmark loans is $6 million (year 1), $7 million (year 2), and $7 million (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volume of volume benchmark loans, over the years in the evaluation period, is therefore $20 million. The annual dollar volume of deposits for benchmark depository institutions is $17 million (year 1), $15 million (year 2), and $18 million (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volume of deposits for benchmark depository institutions, over the years in the evaluation period, is therefore $50 million. The Market Volume Benchmark for that facility-based assessment area would be $20 million divided by $50 million, or 0.4 (equivalently, 40 percent).
ER01FE24.065
c.
Retail Lending Volume Threshold.
For each facility-based assessment area, the Board calculates a Retail Lending Volume
Threshold by multiplying the Market Volume Benchmark for that facility-based assessment area by 0.3 (equivalently, 30 percent). A bank meets or surpasses the Retail Lending Volume Threshold in a facility-based assessment area if the Bank Volume Metric is equal to or greater than the Retail Lending Volume Threshold.
Example A-3:
Based on examples A-1 and A-2 to this appendix, the Board calculates the Retail Lending Volume Threshold by multiplying the Market Volume Benchmark of 40 percent by 0.3, equal to 0.12 (equivalently, 12 percent). The Bank Volume Metric, 0.2 (equivalently, 20 percent), is greater than the Retail Lending Volume Threshold. Accordingly, the bank surpasses the Retail Lending Volume Threshold.
Bank Volume Metric (20%)
Retail Lending Volume Threshold [(40%) × 0.3 = 12%]

# II. Retail Lending Distribution Metrics—Scope Of Evaluation
a.
Retail Lending Test Areas evaluated.
A bank's major product lines are evaluated in its Retail Lending Test Areas, as provided in § 228.22(d) and as described in paragraphs II.a.1 and 2 of this appendix.
1.
Large banks exempt from evaluation in retail lending assessment areas.
Pursuant to § 228.17(a)(2), a large bank is not required to delineate retail lending assessment areas in a particular calendar year if the following ratio exceeds 80 percent, based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count as defined in § 228.12:
i. The sum, over the prior two calendar years, of the large bank's home mortgage loans, multifamily loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and automobile loans if automobile loans are a product line for the large bank, originated or purchased in its facility-based assessment areas; divided by
ii. The sum, over the prior two calendar years, of the large bank's home mortgage loans, multifamily loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and automobile loans if automobile loans are a product line for the large bank, originated or purchased overall.
Example A-4:
A large bank (for which automobile loans are not a product line) originated or purchased 20,000 closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans in the prior two calendar years, representing $6 billion in loan dollars. Of these loans, 18,000 loans, representing $4.5 billion in loan dollars, were originated or purchased in the large bank's facility-based assessment areas. As such, the large bank originated or purchased 75 percent of closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans ($4.5 billion/$6 billion) by loan dollars and 90 percent (18,000/20,000) of these loans by loan count within its facility-based assessment areas. The combination of loan dollars and loan count is 82.5 percent, or (75 + 90)/2. Thus, this large bank is not required to delineate retail lending assessment areas pursuant to § 228.17(a)(2) in the current calendar year because the 82.5 percent exceeds the 80 percent threshold.
2.
Small banks and intermediate banks evaluated in outside retail lending areas.
Pursuant to § 228.18(a)(2), the Board evaluates the geographic and borrower distributions of the major product lines of an intermediate bank, or a small bank that opts to be evaluated under the Retail Lending Test, in the bank's outside retail lending area if either:
i. The bank opts to have its major product lines evaluated in its outside retail lending area; or
ii. The following ratio exceeds 50 percent, based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count as defined in § 228.12:
A. The sum, over the prior two calendar years, of the bank's home mortgage loans, multifamily loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and automobile loans if automobile loans are a product line for the bank, originated or purchased outside of its facility-based assessment areas; divided by
B. The sum, over the prior two calendar years, of the bank's home mortgage loans, multifamily loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and automobile loans if automobile loans are a product line for the bank, originated or purchased overall.
b.
Product lines and major product lines.
In each of a bank's Retail Lending Test Areas, the Board evaluates each of a bank's major product lines, as provided in § 228.22(d)(2) and as described in paragraphs II.b.1 through 3 of this appendix.
1.
Major product line standard for facility-based assessment areas and outside retail lending areas.
Except as provided in paragraph II.b.1.iii of this appendix, a product line is a major product line in a facility-based assessment area or outside retail lending area if the following ratio is 15 percent or more, based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count as defined in § 228.12:
i. The sum, over the years of the evaluation period, of the bank's loans in the product line originated or purchased in the facility-based assessment area or outside retail lending area; divided by
ii. The sum, over the years of the evaluation period, of the bank's loans in all product lines originated or purchased in the facility-based assessment area or outside retail lending area.
iii. If a bank has not collected, maintained, or reported loan data on a product line in a facility-based assessment area or outside retail lending area for one or more years of an evaluation period, the product line is a major product line if the Board determines that the product line is material to the
bank's business in the facility-based assessment area or outside retail lending area.
2.
Major product line standard for retail lending assessment areas.
In a retail lending assessment area:
(i) Closed-end home mortgage loans are a major product line in any calendar year in the evaluation period in which the bank delineates a retail lending assessment area based on its closed-end home mortgage loans as determined by the standard in § 228.17(c)(1); and
(ii) Small business loans are a major product line in any calendar year in the evaluation period in which the bank delineates a retail lending assessment area based on its small business loans as determined by the standard in § 228.17(c)(2).
3.
Banks for which automobile loans are a product line.
i. If a bank's automobile loans are a product line (either because the bank is a majority automobile lender or opts to have its automobile loans evaluated pursuant to § 228.22), automobile loans are a product line for the bank for the entire evaluation period.
ii. A bank is a majority automobile lender if the following ratio, calculated at the institution level, exceeds 50 percent, based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count as defined in § 228.12:
A. The sum, over the two calendar years preceding the first year of the evaluation period, of the bank's automobile loans originated or purchased overall; divided by
B. The sum, over the two calendar years preceding the first year of the evaluation period, of the bank's automobile loans, home mortgage loans, multifamily loans, small business loans, and small farm loans originated or purchased overall.

# III. Geographic Distribution Metrics and Benchmarks
The Board calculates the Geographic Bank Metric, the Geographic Market Benchmark, and the Geographic Community Benchmark for low-income census tracts and for moderate-income census tracts, respectively, as set forth in this section. For each facility-based assessment area, retail lending assessment area, and component geographic area of the bank's outside retail lending area, the Board includes either low-income census tracts or moderate-income census tracts (
i.e., designated census tracts
) in the numerator of the metrics and benchmarks calculations for a particular year. To evaluate small banks and intermediate banks without data collection, maintenance and reporting requirements, the Board will use data collected by the bank in the ordinary course of business or through sampling of bank loan data.
a.
Calculation of Geographic Bank Metric.
The Board calculates the Geographic Bank Metric for low-income census tracts and for moderate-income census tracts, respectively, for each major product line in each Retail Lending Test Area. The Board calculates the Geographic Bank Metric by:
1. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the bank's annual number of originated and purchased loans in the major product line in designated census tracts in the Retail Lending Test Area.
2. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the bank's annual number of originated and purchased loans in the major product line in the Retail Lending Test Area.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph III.a.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph III.a.2 of this appendix.
Example A-5:
The bank has a three-year evaluation period, and small farm loans are a major product line for the bank in a facility-based assessment area (FBAA-1). The bank's annual numbers of originated and purchased small farm loans (
i.e.,
the bank's originated and purchased small farm loans) are 100 (year 1), 75 (year 2), and 75 (year 3) in FBAA-1. The sum of the annual numbers of originated and purchased small farm loans is therefore 250 in the evaluation period. In the low-income census tracts within FBAA-1, the bank originated and purchased 25 small farm loans (year 1), 15 small farm loans (year 2), and 10 small farm loans (year 3) (a total of 50 small farm loans). In FBAA-1, the Geographic Bank Metric for small farm loans in low-income census tracts would be 50 divided by 250, or 0.2 (equivalently, 20 percent).
In the moderate-income census tracts within FBAA-1, the bank originated and purchased 30 small farm loans (year 1), 20 small farm loans (year 2), and 10 small farm loans (year 3) (a total of 60 small farm loans). In FBAA-1, the Geographic Bank Metric for small farm loans in moderate-income census tracts would be 60 divided by 250, or 0.24 (equivalently, 24 percent).
ER01FE24.066
b.
Calculation of Geographic Market Benchmarks for facility-based assessment areas and retail lending assessment areas.
For each facility-based assessment area and retail lending assessment area, the Board calculates the Geographic Market Benchmark for designated census tracts for each major product line, excluding automobile loans. The Board calculates the Geographic Market Benchmark by:
1. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the annual number of reported loans in the major product line in designated census tracts in the facility-based assessment area or retail lending assessment area originated by all lenders.
2. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the annual number of reported loans in the major product line in the facility-based assessment area or retail lending assessment area originated by all lenders.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph III.b.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph III.b.2 of this appendix.
Example A-6:
The Geographic Market Benchmarks for small farm loans in FBAA-1 use a three-year evaluation period. Lenders that report small farm loan data originated 500 small farm loans (year 1), 250 small farm loans (year 2), and 250 small farm loans (year 3) within FBAA-1. The sum of the annual numbers of originated small farm loans is therefore 1,000 in the evaluation period. Lenders that report small farm loan data originated 200 small farm loans (year 1), 100 small farm loans (year 2) and 100 small farm loans (year 3) in low-income census tracts within FBAA-1. The sum of the annual numbers of originated small farm loans in low-income census tracts within FBAA-1 is therefore 400. The Geographic Market Benchmark for small farm loans in low-income census tracts within FBAA-1 would be 400 divided by 1,000, or 0.4 (equivalently, 40 percent).
Lenders that report small farm loan data originated 100 small farm loans (year 1), 100 small farm loans (year 2), and 100 small farm loans (year 3) in moderate-income census tracts within FBAA-1. The sum of the annual numbers of originated small farm loans in moderate-income census tracts within FBAA-1 is therefore 300. The Geographic Market Benchmark for small farm loans in moderate-income census tracts within FBAA-1 would be 300 divided by 1,000, or 0.3 (equivalently, 30 percent).
ER01FE24.067

iii. Dividing the result of paragraph III.c.8.i of this appendix by the result of paragraph III.c.8.ii of this appendix.
Example A-7:
The Geographic Community Benchmarks for small business loans in FBAA-1 use a three-year evaluation period. There were 1,300 non-farm businesses (year 1), 1,300 non-farm businesses (year 2), and 1,400 non-farm businesses (year 3) in FBAA-1. The sum of the number of non-farm businesses in FBAA-1 is therefore 4,000 in the evaluation period. In low-income census tracts within FBAA-1, there were 200 non-farm businesses (year 1), 150 non-farm businesses (year 2), and 150 non-farm businesses (year 3) (a total of 500 non-farm businesses). The Geographic Community Benchmark for small business loans in low-income census tracts within FBAA-1 would be 500 divided by 4,000, or 0.125 (equivalently, 12.5 percent).
In moderate-income census tracts within FBAA-1, there were 400 non-farm businesses (year 1), 300 non-farm businesses (year 2), and 300 non-farm businesses (year 3) (a total of 1,000 non-farm businesses).

# IV. Borrower Distribution Metrics and Benchmarks
The Board calculates the Borrower Bank Metric, the Borrower Market Benchmark, and the Borrower Community Benchmark for each category of borrowers (
i.e., designated borrowers
), as set forth in this section.
For closed-end home mortgage loans, the Board calculates these metrics and benchmarks for each of the following designated borrowers: (i) low-income borrowers; and (ii) moderate-income borrowers.
For small business loans, the Board calculates these metrics and benchmarks for each of the following designated borrowers: (i) businesses with gross annual revenues of $250,000 or less; and (ii) businesses with gross annual revenues greater than $250,000 but less than or equal to $1 million.
For small farm loans, the Board calculates these metrics and benchmarks for each of the following designated borrowers: (i) farms with gross annual revenues of $250,000 or less; and (ii) farms with gross annual revenues greater than $250,000 but less than or equal to $1 million.
For automobile loans, the Board calculates these metrics and benchmarks for each of the following designated borrowers: (i) low-income borrowers; and (ii) moderate income borrowers.
To evaluate small banks and intermediate banks without data collection, maintenance and reporting requirements, the Board will use data collected by the bank in the ordinary course of business or through sampling of bank loan data.
a.
Calculation of Borrower Bank Metric.
The Board calculates the Borrower Bank Metric for each major product line and category of designated borrowers in each Retail Lending Test Area by:
1. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the bank's annual number of originated and purchased loans in the major product line to designated borrowers in the Retail Lending Test Area.
2. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the bank's annual number of originated and purchased loans in the major product line in the Retail Lending Test Area.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph IV.a.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph IV.a.2 of this appendix.
Example A-8:
The bank has a three-year evaluation period, and closed-end home mortgage loans are a major product line for the bank in FBAA-1. The bank's annual numbers of originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage loans (
i.e.,
the bank's originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage loans) are 30 (year 1), 40 (year 2), and 30 (year 3) in FBAA-1. The sum of the annual numbers of originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage loans is therefore 100 in the evaluation period. In FBAA-1, the bank originated and purchased 10 closed-end home mortgage loans to low-income borrowers (year 1), 3 closed-end home mortgage loans to low-income borrowers (year 2), and 7 closed-end home mortgage loans to low-income borrowers (year 3) (a total of 20 closed-end home mortgage loans to low-income borrowers). In FBAA-1, the Borrower Bank Metric for closed-end home mortgage loans to low-income borrowers would be 20 divided by 100, or 0.2 (equivalently, 20 percent).
In FBAA-1, the bank also originated and purchased 12 closed-end home mortgage loans to moderate-income borrowers (year 1), 5 closed-end home mortgage loans to moderate-income borrowers (year 2), and 13 closed-end home mortgage loans to moderate-income borrowers (year 3) (a total of 30 closed-end home mortgage loans to moderate-income borrowers). In FBAA-1, the Borrower Bank Metric for closed-end home mortgage loans to moderate-income borrowers would be 30 divided by 100, or 0.3 (equivalently, 30 percent).
ER01FE24.069
b.
Calculation of Borrower Market Benchmarks for facility-based assessment areas and retail lending assessment areas.
For each facility-based assessment area and retail lending assessment area, the Board calculates the Borrower Market Metric for each major product line, excluding automobile loans, and for each category of designated borrowers by:
1. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the annual number of reported loans in the major product line to designated borrowers in the facility-based assessment area or retail lending assessment area originated by all lenders.
2. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the annual number of reported loans in the major product line in the facility-based assessment area or retail lending assessment area originated by all lenders.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph IV.b.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph IV.b.2 of this appendix.
Example A-9:
The Borrower Market Benchmarks for closed-end home mortgage loans use a three-year evaluation period. Lenders that report closed-end home mortgage loans originated 500 closed-end home mortgage loans (year 1), 275 closed-end home mortgage loans (year 2), and 225 closed-end home mortgage loans (year 3). The sum of the annual numbers of originated closed-end home mortgage loans is therefore 1,000 in the evaluation period. Lenders that report closed-end home mortgage loans originated 50 closed-end home mortgage loans to low-income borrowers (year 1), 20 closed-end home mortgage loans to low-income borrowers (year 2), and 30 closed-end home mortgage loans to low-income borrowers (year 3) in FBAA-1. The sum of the annual numbers of originated closed-end home mortgage loans to low-income borrowers within FBAA-1 is therefore 100. The Borrower Market Benchmark for closed-end home mortgage loans to low-income borrowers would be 100 divided by 1,000, or 0.1 (equivalently, 10 percent).
Lenders that report closed-end home mortgage loans originated 100 loans (year 1), 75 loans (year 2), and 25 loans (year 3) to moderate-income borrowers. The sum of the annual numbers of originated closed-end home mortgage loans to moderate-income borrowers within FBAA-1 is therefore 200. The Borrower Market Benchmark for closed-end home mortgage loans to moderate-income borrowers in FBAA-1 would be 200 divided by 1,000, or 0.2 (equivalently, 20 percent).

2. Calculating the weighting for each component geographic area and major product line as the percentage of the bank's loans in the major product line originated or purchased in the outside retail lending area that are within the component geographic area, based on loan count.
3. Calculating the weighted average benchmark for the outside retail lending area using the component geographic area benchmarks in paragraph IV.e.1 of this appendix and associated weightings calculated in paragraph IV.e.2 of this appendix.

# V. Supporting Conclusions for Major Product Lines Other Than Automobile Lending
The Board evaluates a bank's Retail Lending Test performance in each Retail Lending Test Area by comparing the bank's distribution metrics to sets of performance ranges determined by, as applicable, the market and community benchmarks, as described in this section.
a.
Supporting conclusions for categories of designated census tracts and designated borrowers.
For each major product line, excluding automobile lending, the Board develops separate supporting conclusions for each of the categories outlined in table 1 to this appendix.
Table 1 to Appendix A—Retail Lending Test Categories of Designated Census Tracts and Designated Borrowers
Major product line
Designated census tracts
Designated borrowers
Closed-End Home Mortgage Loans
Low-Income Census Tracts
Low-Income Borrowers.
Moderate-Income Census Tracts
Moderate-Income Borrowers.
Small Business Loans
Low-Income Census Tracts
Non-farm businesses with Gross Annual Revenues of $250,000 or Less.
Moderate-Income Census Tracts
Non-farm businesses with Gross Annual Revenues Greater than $250,000 but Less Than or Equal to $1 million.
Small Farm Loans
Low-Income Census Tracts
Farms with Gross Annual Revenues of $250,000 or Less.
Moderate-Income Census Tracts
Farms with Gross Annual Revenues Greater than $250,000 but Less Than or Equal to $1 million.
b.
Geographic distribution performance ranges.
To evaluate a bank's geographic distributions for each major product line, excluding automobile lending, the Board compares the relevant Geographic Bank Metric for each category of designated census tracts to the applicable set of performance ranges. The performance ranges are determined by the values of the Geographic Market Benchmark and the Geographic Community Benchmark, as well as the multipliers associated with each supporting conclusion category, as follows:
1. The performance threshold for an “Outstanding” supporting conclusion is the lesser of either:
i. The product of 1.0 times the Geographic Community Benchmark; or
ii. The product of 1.15 times the Geographic Market Benchmark.
The “Outstanding” performance range is all potential values of the Geographic Bank Metric equal to or above the “Outstanding” performance threshold.
2. The performance threshold for a “High Satisfactory” Retail Lending Test supporting conclusion is the lesser of either:
i. The product of 0.8 times the Geographic Community Benchmark; or
ii. The product of 1.05 times the Geographic Market Benchmark.
The “High Satisfactory” performance range is all potential values of the Geographic Bank Metric equal to or above the “High Satisfactory” performance threshold but below the Outstanding performance threshold.
3. The performance threshold for a “Low Satisfactory” supporting conclusion is the lesser of either:
i. The product of 0.6 times the Geographic Community Benchmark; or
ii. The product of the 0.8 times the Geographic Market Benchmark.
The “Low Satisfactory” performance range is all potential values of the Geographic Bank Metric equal to or above the “Low Satisfactory” performance threshold but below the High Satisfactory performance threshold.
4. The performance threshold for a “Needs to Improve” supporting conclusion is the lesser of either:
i. The product of 0.3 times the Geographic Community Benchmark; or
ii. The product of 0.33 times the Geographic Market Benchmark.
The “Needs to Improve” performance range is all potential values of the Geographic Bank Metric equal to or above the “Needs to Improve” performance threshold but below the “Low Satisfactory” performance threshold.
5. The “Substantial Noncompliance” performance range is all potential values of the Geographic Bank Metric below the “Needs to Improve” performance threshold.
c.
Geographic distribution supporting conclusions and performance scores.
The Board compares each Geographic Bank Metric to the performance ranges provided in paragraphs V.b.1 through V.b.5 of this appendix. The geographic distribution supporting conclusion for each category of designated census tracts is determined by the performance range within which the Geographic Bank Metric falls. Each supporting conclusion is assigned a numerical performance score using the following corresponding points values:
Conclusion
Performance score
Outstanding
10
High Satisfactory
7
Low Satisfactory
6
Needs to Improve
3
Substantial Noncompliance
0
d.
Borrower distribution performance ranges.
To evaluate a bank's borrower distributions for each major product line, excluding automobile lending, the Board compares the relevant Borrower Bank Metric for each category of designated borrowers to the applicable set of performance ranges. The performance ranges are determined by the values of the Borrower Market Benchmark and Borrower Community Benchmark, as well as the multipliers associated with each supporting conclusion category, as follows:
1. The performance threshold for an “Outstanding” supporting conclusion is the lesser of either:
i. The product of 1.0 times the Borrower Community Benchmark; or
ii. The product of 1.15 times the Borrower Market Benchmark.
The “Outstanding” performance range is all potential values of the Borrower Bank Metric equal to or above the “Outstanding” performance threshold.
2. The performance threshold for a “High Satisfactory” supporting conclusion is the lesser of either:
i. The product of 0.8 times the Borrower Community Benchmark; or
ii. The product of 1.05 times the Borrower Market Benchmark.
The “High Satisfactory” performance range is all potential values of the Borrower Bank Metric equal to or above the “High Satisfactory” performance threshold but below the Outstanding performance threshold.
3. The performance threshold for a “Low Satisfactory” supporting conclusion is the lesser of either:
i. The product of 0.6 times the Borrower Community Benchmark; or
ii. The product of 0.8 times the Borrower Market Benchmark.
The “Low Satisfactory” performance range is all potential values of the Borrower Bank Metric equal to or above the “Low Satisfactory” performance threshold but below the High Satisfactory performance threshold.
4. The performance threshold for a “Needs to Improve” supporting conclusion is the lesser of either:
i. The product of 0.3 times the Borrower Community Benchmark; or
ii. The product of 0.33 times the Borrower Market Benchmark.
The “Needs to Improve” performance range is all potential values of the Borrower Bank Metric equal to or above the “Needs to Improve” performance threshold but below the “Low Satisfactory” performance threshold.
5. The “Substantial Noncompliance” performance range is all potential values of the Borrower Bank Metric below the “Needs to Improve” performance threshold.
e.
Borrower distribution supporting conclusions and performance scores.
The Board compares each Borrower Bank Metric to the performance ranges provided in paragraphs V.d.1 through V.d.5 of this appendix. The borrower distribution supporting conclusion for each category of designated borrowers is determined by the performance range within which the Borrower Bank Metric falls. Each supporting conclusion is assigned a numerical performance score using the following corresponding point values:
Conclusion
Performance score
Outstanding
10
High Satisfactory
7
Low Satisfactory
6
Needs to Improve
3
Substantial Noncompliance

# VI. Supporting Conclusions for Automobile Lending
a.
Supporting conclusions for categories of designated census tracts and designated borrowers.
For any bank for which automobile lending is evaluated under § 228.22, the Board develops separate supporting conclusions for each of the categories outlined in table 2 to this appendix.
Table 2 to Appendix A—Automobile Loans: Categories of Designated Census Tracts and Designated Borrowers

# VII. Retail Lending Test Conclusions—All Major Product Lines
a. The Board determines a bank's Retail Lending Test performance conclusion for a major product line in a Retail Lending Test Area by calculating a weighted performance score for each major product line:
1. The Board develops a weighted average performance score for each major product line in each Retail Lending Test Area as follows:
i. The Board creates a weighted average performance score across the categories of designated census tracts (
i.e., geographic distribution average
) and a weighted average performance score across the categories of designated borrowers (
i.e., borrower distribution average
).
ii. For the geographic distribution average of each major product line, the weighting assigned to each category of designated census tracts is based on the demographics of the Retail Testing Area as outlined in the following table:
Table 3 to Appendix A—Retail Lending, Test Geographic Distribution Average—Weights
Major product line
Category of
designated census tracts
Weight
Closed-End Home Mortgage Loans
Low-Income Census Tracts
Percentage of total number of owner-occupied housing units in low- and moderate-income census tracts in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are in low-income census tracts.
Moderate-Income Census Tracts
Percentage of total number of owner-occupied housing units in low- and moderate-income census tracts in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are in moderate-income census tracts.
Small Business Loans
Low-Income Census Tracts
Percentage of total number of non-farm businesses in low- and moderate-income census tracts in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are in low-income census tracts.
Moderate-Income Census Tracts
Percentage of total number of non-farm businesses in low- and moderate-income census tracts in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are in moderate-income census tracts.
Small Farm Loans
Low-Income Census Tracts
Percentage of total number of farms in low- and moderate-income census tracts in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are in low-income census tracts.
Moderate-Income Census Tracts
Percentage of total number of farms in low- and moderate-income census tracts in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are in moderate-income census tracts.
Automobile Loans
Low-Income Census Tracts
Percentage of total number of households in low- and moderate-income census tracts in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are in low-income census tracts.
Moderate-Income Census Tracts
Percentage of total number of households in low- and moderate-income census tracts in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are in moderate-income census tracts.
In the case of a Retail Lending Test Area that contains no low-income census tracts and no moderate-income census tracts, the bank will not receive a geographic distribution average for that assessment area.
Example A-11:
A large bank's closed-end home mortgage loans constitute a major product line for the bank in a facility-based assessment area. The bank's geographic distribution supporting conclusions for closed-end home mortgage loans in this facility-based assessment area are “High Satisfactory” (performance score of 7 points) for low-income census tracts and “Needs to Improve” (performance score of 3 points) for moderate-income census tracts. Owner-occupied housing units in moderate-income census tracts represents 20 percent of all owner-occupied housing units in the facility-based assessment area, and owner-occupied housing units in low-income census tracts represents 5 percent of all owner-occupied housing units in the facility-based assessment area. Accordingly, the weight assigned to the moderate-income geographic distribution performance score is 80 percent [20 percent/(20 percent + 5 percent) = 80 percent] and the weight assigned to the low-income geographic distribution performance score is 20 percent [5 percent/(20 percent + 5 percent) = 20 percent]. The bank's geographic distribution average for closed-end home mortgage loans in this facility-based assessment area is 3.8 [(7 points × 0.2 weight = 1.4) + (3 points × 0.8 weight = 2.4)].
iii. For the borrower distribution average of each major product line, the weighting assigned to each category of designated borrowers is based on the demographics of the Retail Lending Test Area as outlined in the following table:
Table 4 to Appendix A—Retail Lending Test, Borrower Distribution Average—Weights
Major product line
Categories of designated borrowers
Weight
Closed-End Home Mortgage Loans
Low-Income Borrowers
Percentage of total number of low-income and moderate-income families in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are low-income families.
Moderate-Income Borrowers
Percentage of total number of low-income and moderate-income families in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are moderate-income families.
Small Business Loans
Non-farm businesses with gross annual revenues of $250,000 or less
Percentage of total number of non-farm businesses with gross annual revenues of $250,000 or less and non-farm businesses with gross annual revenues greater than $250,000 but less than or equal to $1 million in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are non-farm businesses with gross annual revenues of $250,000 or less.
Non-farm businesses with gross annual revenues greater than $250,000 and less than or equal to $1 million
Percentage of total number of non-farm businesses with gross annual revenues of $250,000 or less and non-farm businesses with gross annual revenues greater than $250,000 but less than or equal to $1 million in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are non-farm businesses with gross annual revenues greater than $250,00 but less than or equal to $1 million.
Small Farm Loans
Farms with gross annual revenues of $250,000 or less
Percentage of total number of farms with gross annual revenues of $250,000 or less and farms with gross annual revenues greater than $250,000 but less than or equal to $1 million in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are farms with gross annual revenues of $250,000 or less.
Farms with gross annual revenues greater than $250,000 and less than or equal to $1 million
Percentage of total number of farms with gross annual revenues of $250,000 or less and farms with gross annual revenues greater than $250,000 but less than or equal to $1 million in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are farms with gross annual revenues greater than $250,000 but less than or equal to $1 million.
Automobile Loans
Low-Income Borrowers
Percentage of total number of low-income and moderate-income households in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are low-income households.
Moderate-Income Borrowers
Percentage of total number of low-income and moderate-income households in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are moderate-income households.
Example A-12:
Building on example A-11 to this appendix, the bank's borrower distribution supporting conclusions for closed-end home mortgage loans in this facility-based assessment area are “Outstanding” (performance score of 10 points) for low-income borrowers and “Low Satisfactory” (performance score of 6 points) for moderate-income borrowers. Low-income families represent 14 percent of all families in the facility-based assessment area and moderate-income families represent 6 percent of all families in the facility-based assessment area. Accordingly, the weight assigned to the low-income borrower distribution performance score is 70 percent [14 percent/(14 percent + 6 percent) = 70 percent] and the weight assigned to the
moderate-income borrower distribution performance score is 30 percent [6 percent/(14 percent + 6 percent) = 30 percent]. The bank's borrower distribution average for closed-end home mortgage loans in this facility-based assessment area is 8.8 [(10 points × 0.7 weight = 7.0) + (6 points × 0.3 weight = 1.8)].
2. For each major product line, the Board calculates the average of the geographic distribution average and the borrower distribution average (
i.e., product line score
). If a bank has no geographic distribution average for a product (due to the absence of both low-income census tracts and moderate-income census tracts in the geographic area), the product line score is the borrower distribution average.
Example A-13:
Based on examples A-11 and A-12 to this appendix, the bank's product line score for closed-end home mortgage loans is 6.3 [(3.8 geographic distribution average × 0.5 weight = 1.9) + (8.8 borrower distribution average × 0.5 weight = 4.4)].
b. For each Retail Lending Test Area, the Board calculates a weighted average of product line scores across all major product lines (
i.e., Retail Lending Test Area Score
). For each Retail Lending Test Area, the Board uses a ratio of the bank's loan originations and purchases in each major product line to its loan originations and purchases in all major product lines during the evaluation period, based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count as defined in § 228.12, as weights in the weighted average.
Example A-14:
In addition to the product line score of 6.3 for closed-end home mortgage loans in example A-13 to this appendix, the bank has a product line score of 4.2 for small business lending in the same facility-based assessment area. Among major product lines, 60 percent of the bank's loans in the facility-based assessment area are closed-end home mortgages and 40 percent are small business loans based upon the combination of loan dollars and loan count. Accordingly, the weight assigned to the closed-end home mortgage product line score is 60 percent and the weight assigned to the small business product line score is 40 percent. The bank's Retail Lending Test Area Score for this facility-based assessment area is 5.46 [(6.3 closed-end home mortgage loan product line score × 0.6 weight = 3.78) + (4.2 small business loan product line score × 0.4 weight = 1.68)].
c. The Board then develops a Retail Lending Test recommended conclusion corresponding with the conclusion category that is nearest to the Retail Lending Test Area Score, as follows:
Recommended
conclusion
Retail lending test area score
Outstanding
8.5 or more.
High Satisfactory
6.5 or more but less than 8.5.
Low Satisfactory
4.5 or more but less than 6.5.
Needs to Improve
1.5 or more but less than 4.5.
Substantial Noncompliance
less than 1.5.
Example A-15:
Based on example A-14 to this appendix, the bank's Retail Lending Test Area Score is associated with a “Low Satisfactory” conclusion, so the bank's Retail Lending Test recommended conclusion for this facility-based assessment area is “Low Satisfactory.”
d. Once a recommended conclusion is determined for a Retail Lending Test Area, the performance context information provided in § 228.21(d) and the additional factors provided in § 228.22(g) inform the Board's determination of the Retail Lending Test conclusion for the Retail Lending Test Area. The agency assigns a Retail Lending Test conclusion for the Retail Lending Test Area of “Outstanding,” “High Satisfactory,” “Low Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve,” or “Substantial Noncompliance.”

# VIII. Retail Lending Test Weighting and Conclusions for States, Multistate MSAs, and the Institution
The Board develops the Retail Lending Test conclusions for States, multistate MSAs, and the institution as described in this section.
a. The Board translates Retail Lending Test conclusions for facility-based assessment areas, retail lending assessment areas, and as applicable, the outside retail lending area into numerical performance scores, as follows:
Conclusion
Performance score
Outstanding
10
High Satisfactory
7
Low Satisfactory
6
Needs to Improve
3
Substantial Noncompliance
0
b. The Board calculates the weighted average of Retail Lending Test Area performance scores for a State or multistate MSA, as applicable, and for the institution (
i.e., performance score for the Retail Lending Test
). For the weighted average for a State or multistate MSA, the Board considers facility-based assessment areas and retail lending assessment areas in the State or multistate MSA pursuant to § 228.28(c). For the weighted average for the institution, the Board considers all of the bank's facility-based assessment areas and retail lending assessment areas and, as applicable, the bank's outside retail lending area. Each Retail Lending Test Area performance score is weighted by the average of the following two ratios:
1. The ratio measuring the share of the bank's deposits in the Retail Lending Test Area, calculated by:
i. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in the Retail Lending Test Area.
ii. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in all Retail Lending Test Areas in the State, in the multistate MSA, or for the institution, as applicable.
iii. Dividing the result of paragraph VIII.b.1.i of this appendix by the result of paragraph VIII.b.1.ii of this appendix.
For a bank that reports deposits data pursuant to § 228.42(b)(3), the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in a Retail Lending Test Area is the total of annual average daily balances of deposits reported by the bank in counties in the Retail Lending Test Area for that year. For a bank that does not report deposits data pursuant to § 228.42(b)(3), the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in a Retail Lending Test Area is the total of deposits assigned to facilities reported by the bank in the Retail Lending Test Area in the FDIC's Summary of Deposits for that year.
2. The ratio measuring the share of the bank's loans in the Retail Lending Test Area, based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count, as defined in § 228.12, calculated by dividing:
i. The bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and, if a product line for the bank, automobile loans in the Retail Lending Test Area originated or purchased during the evaluation period; by
ii. The bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and, if a product line for the bank, automobile loans in all Retail Lending Test Areas in the State, in the multistate MSA, or for the institution, as applicable, originated or purchased during the evaluation period.
c. The Board develops a conclusion corresponding to the conclusion category that is nearest to the performance score for the Retail Lending Test for the State, the multistate MSA, or the institution, as applicable, as follows:
Conclusion
Retail lending test performance score
Outstanding
8.5 or more.
High Satisfactory
6.5 or more but less than 8.5.
Low Satisfactory
4.5 or more but less than 6.5.
Needs to Improve
1.5 or more but less than 4.5.
Substantial Noncompliance
Less than 1.5.
d. The agency considers relevant performance context information provided in § 228.21(d) to inform the Board's determination of the bank's Retail Lending Test conclusion for the State, the multistate MSA, or the institution, as applicable.
Example A-16:
A large bank operates in one State only, and has two facility-based assessment areas and one retail lending assessment area in that state and also engages in closed-end home mortgage lending, small business lending, and small farm lending (but not automobile lending, as it is not a product line for the bank) in its outside retail lending area.
Additionally:
i. Facility-based assessment area 1 (FBAA-1) is associated with 75 percent of the deposits in all of the Retail Lending Test Areas of the bank (based on dollar amount) and 10 percent of the bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans (based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count as defined in § 228.12). The bank received a “Needs to Improve” (3 points) Retail Lending Test conclusion in FBAA-1;
ii. Facility-based assessment area 2 (FBAA-2) is associated with 15 percent of the deposits in all of the Retail Lending Test Areas of the bank and 20 percent of the bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans (based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count as defined in § 228.12). The bank received a “Low Satisfactory” (6 points) Retail Lending Test conclusion in FBAA-2;
iii. The Retail lending assessment area is associated with 8 percent of the deposits in all of the Retail Lending Test Areas of the bank and 68 percent of the bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans (based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count as defined in § 228.12). The bank received an “Outstanding” (10 points) Retail Lending Test conclusion in the retail lending assessment area; and
iv. The bank's outside retail lending area, is associated with 2 percent of the deposits in all of the Retail Lending Test Areas of the bank and 2 percent of the bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans (based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count as defined in § 228.12). The bank received a “High Satisfactory” (7 points) Retail Lending Test conclusion in the outside retail lending area.
Calculating weights:
i. For facility-based assessment area 1: weight = 42.5 percent [(75 percent of deposits + 10 percent of closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans)/2];
ii. For facility-based assessment area 2: weight = 17.5 percent [(15 percent of deposits + 20 percent of closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans)/2];
iii. For the retail lending assessment area: weight = 38 percent [(8 percent of deposits + 68 percent of closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans)/2]; and
iv. For the outside retail lending area: weight = 2 percent [(2 percent of deposits + 2 percent of closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans)/2].
Institution Retail Lending Test Performance Score and Conclusion:
Using the relevant points values—“Outstanding” (10 points); “High Satisfactory” (7 points); “Low Satisfactory” (6 points); “Needs to Improve” (3 points); “Substantial Noncompliance” (0 points)—and based on the illustration in this example A-16, the bank's Retail Lending Test performance score for the institution is 6.3 [(0.425 weight × 3 points in facility-based assessment area 1) + (0.175 weight × 6 points in facility-based assessment area 2) + (0.38 weight × 10 points in retail lending assessment area) + (0.02 weight × 7 points in the outside retail lending area)].
A performance score of 6.3 corresponds with the conclusion category “Low Satisfactory,” so the bank's Retail Lending Test recommended conclusion at the institution level is “Low Satisfactory.” Relevant performance context information provided in § 228.21(d) may inform the Board's determination of the bank's conclusion at the institution level.
Example A-17:
An intermediate bank operates in a single State, has two facility-based assessment areas, and also engages in closed-end home mortgage lending, small business lending, and small farm lending (but not automobile lending, as automobile lending is not a product line for the bank) in its outside retail lending area.
Additionally:
i. Facility-based assessment area 1 (FBAA-1) is associated with 60 percent of the deposits in all of the Retail Lending Test Areas of the bank and 30 percent of the bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans. The bank received an “Outstanding” (10 points) Retail Lending Test conclusion in FBAA-1;
ii. Facility-based assessment area 2 (FBAA-2 is) associated with 40 percent of the deposits in all of the Retail Lending Test Areas of the bank and 10 percent of the bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans. The bank received a “High Satisfactory” (7 points) Retail Lending Test conclusion in FBAA-2; and
iii. The bank's outside retail lending area is associated with 0 percent of the deposits in all of the Retail Lending Test Areas of the bank (the bank did not voluntarily collect and maintain depositor location data, so all deposits in the bank are attributed to its branches within facility-based assessment areas) and 60 percent of the bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans. The bank received a “Needs to Improve” (3 points) Retail Lending Test conclusion in the outside retail lending area.
Calculating weights:
i. For FBAA-1: weight = 45 percent [(60 percent of deposits + 30 percent of closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans)/2];
ii. For FBAA-2: weight = 25 percent [(40 percent of deposits + 10 percent of closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans)/2]; and
iii. For the outside retail lending area: weight = 30 percent [(0 percent of deposits + 60 percent of closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans)/2].
Institution Retail Lending Test Performance Score and Conclusion:
Using the relevant points values—“Outstanding” (10 points); “High Satisfactory” (7 points); “Low Satisfactory” (6 points); “Needs to Improve” (3 points); “Substantial Noncompliance” (0 points)—and based on the illustration in this example A-17, the bank's recommended Retail Lending Test performance score at the institution level is 7.2 [(0.45 weight × 10 points in FBAA-1) + (0.25 weight × 7 points in FBAA-2) + (0.3 weight × 3 points in the outside retail lending area)].
A performance score of 7.2 corresponds with the conclusion category “High Satisfactory,” so the bank's Retail Lending Test recommended conclusion at the institution level is “High Satisfactory.” Relevant performance context information provided in § 228.21(d) may inform the Board's determination of the bank's conclusion at the institution level.

Example A-7.
The applicable benchmark uses a three-year evaluation period. There were 4,000 small business establishments, based upon the sum of the numbers of small business establishments over the years in the evaluation period (1,300 small business establishments in year 1, 1,300 small business establishments in year 2, and 1,400 small business establishments in year 3), in a bank's facility-based assessment area. Of these small business establishments, 500 small business establishments were in low-income census tracts, based upon the sum of the numbers of small business establishments in low-income census tracts over the years in the evaluation period (200 small business establishments in year 1,150 small business in year 2, and 150 small business establishments in year 3). The Geographic Community Benchmark for small business loans in low-income census tracts would be 500 divided by 4,000, or 0.125 (equivalently, 12.5 percent). In addition, 1,000 small business establishments in that facility-based assessment area were in moderate-income census tracts, over the years in the evaluation period (400 small business establishments in year 1,300 small business establishments in year 2, and 300 small business establishments in year 3). The Geographic Community
Benchmark for small business loans in moderate-income census tracts would be 1,000 divided by 4,000, or 0.25 (equivalently, 25 percent).

# Appendix B to Part 228—Calculations for the Community Development Tests
This appendix, based on requirements described in §§ 228.24 through 228.26 and 228.28, includes the following sections:
I. Community Development Financing Tests—Calculation Components and Allocation of Community Development Loans and Community Development Investments
II. Community Development Financing Test in § 228.24—Calculations for Metrics, Benchmarks, and Combining Performance Scores
III. Community Development Financing Test for Limited Purpose Banks in § 228.26—Calculations for Metrics and Benchmarks
IV. Weighting of Conclusions

# I. Community Development Financing Tests—Calculation Components and Allocation of Community Development Loans and Community Development Investments
For purposes of the Community Development Financing Test in § 228.24 and Community Development Financing Test for Limited Purpose Banks in § 228.26, the Board identifies the community development loans and community development investments included in the numerator of the metrics and benchmarks and the deposits or assets included in the denominator of the metrics and benchmarks, as applicable, pursuant to paragraph I.a of this appendix. The Board determines whether to include a community development loan or community development investment in the numerator for a particular metric or benchmark pursuant to the allocation provisions in paragraph I.b of this appendix.
a.
Community development loans and community development investments, deposits, and assets included in the community development financing metrics and benchmarks—in general.
The Board calculates the community development financing metrics and benchmarks in §§ 228.24 and 228.26 using community development loans and community development investments and deposits or assets, as follows:
1.
Numerator
—i.
Community development loans and community development investments considered.
The Board includes community development loans and community development investments originated, purchased, refinanced, or renewed by a depository institution or attributed to a depository institution pursuant to § 228.21(b) and (c) (
e.g.,
an affiliate community development loan) in the numerator of the metrics and benchmarks. The Board calculates the annual dollar volume of community development loans and community development investments by summing the dollar volume of the following community development loans and community development investments for each calendar year in an evaluation period (
i.e., annual dollar volume of community development loans and community development investments
):
A. The dollar volume of all community development loans originated or purchased and community development investments made, including legally binding commitments to
extend credit or legally binding commitments to invest,
1
in that calendar year;
1
The dollar volume of a legally binding commitment to extend credit or legally binding commitment to invest in any given year is: (1) the full dollar volume committed; or (2) if drawn upon, the combined dollar volume of the outstanding commitment and any drawn portion of the commitment.
B. The dollar volume of any increase in the calendar year to an existing community development loan that is refinanced or renewed and in an existing community development investment that is renewed;
C. The outstanding dollar volume of community development loans originated or purchased in previous calendar years and community development investments made in previous calendar years, as of December 31 for each calendar year that the loan or investment remains on the depository institution's balance sheet; and
D. The outstanding dollar volume, less any increase reported in paragraph I.a.1.B of this appendix in the same calendar year, of a community development loan the depository institution refinanced or renewed in a calendar year subsequent to the calendar year of origination or purchase, as of December 31 for each calendar year that the loan remains on the depository institution's balance sheet, and an existing community development investment renewed in a calendar year subsequent to the calendar year of the investment, as of December 31 for each calendar year that the investment remains on the depository institution's balance sheet.
ii.
Community development loan and community development investment allocation.
To calculate the metrics and benchmarks provided in §§ 228.24 and _.26, the Board includes all community development loans and community development investments that are allocated to the specific facility-based assessment area, State, multistate MSA, or nationwide area, respectively, in the numerator for the metric and benchmarks applicable to that geographic area.
See
paragraph I.b of this appendix for the community development financing allocation provisions.
2.
Denominator.
i.
Annual dollar volume of deposits.
For purposes of metrics and benchmarks in § 228.24, the Board calculates an annual dollar volume of deposits in a depository institution that is specific to each metric or benchmark for each calendar year in the evaluation period (
i.e., annual dollar volume of deposits
). For a depository institution that collects, maintains, and reports deposits data as provided in § 228.42 or 12 CFR 25.42 or 345.42, the annual dollar volume of deposits is determined using the annual average daily balance of deposits in the depository institution as provided in statements (
e.g.,
monthly or quarterly statements) based on the deposit location. For a depository institution that does not collect, maintain, and report deposits data as provided in § 228.42 or 12 CFR 25.42 or 345.42, the annual dollar volume of deposits is determined using the deposits assigned to each facility pursuant to the FDIC's Summary of Deposits.
ii.
Annual dollar volume of assets.
For purposes of the metrics and benchmarks in § 228.26, the Board calculates an annual dollar volume of assets for each calendar year in the evaluation period (
i.e., the annual dollar volume of assets
). The annual dollar volume of assets is calculated by averaging the assets for each quarter end in the calendar year.
b.
Allocation of community development loans and community development investments.
1.
In general.
For the Community Development Financing Test in § 228.24 and the Community Development Financing Test for Limited Purpose Banks in § 228.26, the Board considers community development loans and community development investments in the evaluation of a bank's performance in a facility-based assessment area, State and multistate MSA, as applicable, and the nationwide area, based on the data provided by the bank pursuant to § 228.42(a)(5)(ii)(E) and the specific location, if available, pursuant to § 228.42(a)(5)(ii)(D). As appropriate, the Board may also consider publicly available information and information provided by government or community sources that demonstrates that a community development loan or community development investment benefits or serves a facility-based assessment area, State, or multistate MSA, or the nationwide area.
2. A bank may allocate a community development loan or community development investment as follows:
i. A community development loan or community development investment that benefits or serves only one county, and not any areas beyond that one county, would have the full dollar amount of the activity allocated to that county.
ii. A community development loan or community development investment that benefits or serves multiple counties, a State, a multistate MSA, multiple States, multiple multistate MSAs, or the nationwide area is allocated according to either specific documentation that the bank can provide regarding the dollar amount allocated to each county or based on the geographic scope of the activity, as follows:
A.
Allocation approach if specific documentation is available.
A bank may allocate a community development loan or community development investment or portion of a loan or investment based on documentation that specifies the appropriate dollar volume to assign to each county, such as specific addresses and dollar volumes associated with each address, or other information that indicates
the specific dollar volume of the loan or investment that benefits or serves each county.
B.
Allocation approach based on geographic scope of a community development loan or community development investment.
2
In the absence of specific documentation, the Board will allocate a community development loan or community development investment based on the geographic scope of the loan or investment as follows:
2
For the purposes of allocating community development loans and community development investments, the Board considers low- or moderate-income families to be located in a State or multistate MSA, as applicable, consistent with § 228.28(c).
1.
Allocate at the county level for a loan or investment with a geographic scope of one county;
2.
Allocate at the county level based on the proportion of low- and moderate-income families in each county for a loan or investment with a geographic scope of less than an entire State or multistate MSA;
3.
Allocate at the State or multistate MSA level for a loan or investment with a geographic scope of the entire State or multistate MSA, as applicable;
4.
Allocate at the State or multistate MSA level, as applicable, based on the proportion of low- and moderate-income families in each State or multistate MSA for a loan or investment with a geographic scope of one or more State(s) or multistate MSA(s), but not the entire nation; and
5.
Allocate at the nationwide area level for a loan or investment with a geographic scope of the entire Nation.

# II. Community Development Financing Test in § 228.24—Calculations for Metrics, Benchmarks, and Combining Performance Scores
The calculations for metrics, benchmarks, and combination of performance scores for Community Development Financing Test in § 228.24 are provided in this section. Additional information regarding relevant calculation components is set forth in paragraph I.a of this appendix.
a.
Bank Assessment Area Community Development Financing Metric.
The Board calculates the Bank Assessment Area Community Development Financing Metric in § 228.24(b)(1) by:
1. Summing the bank's annual dollar volume of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve the facility-based assessment area for each year in the evaluation period.
2. Summing the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits located in the facility-based assessment area for each year in the evaluation period.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph II.a.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph II.a.2 of this appendix.
Example B-1:
The bank has a three-year evaluation period. The bank's annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve a facility-based assessment area are $35,000 (year 1), $25,000 (year 2), and $40,000 (year 3). The sum of the bank's annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve a facility-based assessment area is therefore $100,000. The bank's annual dollar volumes of deposits located in the facility-based assessment area are $3.1 million (year 1), $3.3 million (year 2), and $3.6 million (year 3). The sum of the
bank's annual dollar volumes of deposits located in the facility-based assessment is therefore $10 million. For the evaluation period, the Bank Assessment Area Community Development Financing Metric would be $100,000 divided by $10 million, or 0.01 (equivalently, 1 percent).
ER01FE24.072
b.
Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmark.
The Board calculates the Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmark in § 228.24(b)(2)(i) for each facility-based assessment area by:
1. Summing all large depository institutions' annual dollar volume of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve the facility-based assessment area for each year in the evaluation period.
2. Summing all large depository institutions' annual dollar volume of deposits located in the facility-based assessment area for each year in the evaluation period.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph II.b.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph II.b.2 of this appendix.
Example B-2:
The applicable benchmark uses a three-year evaluation period. The annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve a facility-based assessment area for all large depository institutions are $3.25 million (year 1), $3 million (year 2), and $3.75 million (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve the facility-based assessment area conducted by all large depository institutions is therefore $10 million. The annual dollar volumes of deposits located in the facility-based assessment area in all large depository institutions are $330 million (year 1), $330 million (year 2), and $340 million (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volumes of deposits located in the facility-based assessment area in all large depository institutions is therefore $1 billion. For the evaluation period, the Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmark for the facility-based assessment area would be $10 million divided by $1 billion, or 0.01 (equivalently, 1 percent).
ER01FE24.073
c.
MSA and Nonmetropolitan Nationwide Community Development Financing Benchmarks.
The Board calculates an MSA Nationwide Community Development Financing Benchmark to be used for each MSA in which the bank has a facility-based assessment area in the MSA. The Board calculates a Nonmetropolitan Nationwide Community Development Financing Benchmark to be used for each nonmetropolitan area in which the bank has a facility-based assessment area in the nonmetropolitan area.
1.
MSA Nationwide Community Development Financing Benchmark.
The Board calculates the MSA Nationwide Community Development Financing Benchmark in § 228.24(b)(2)(ii)(A) by:
i. Summing all large depository institutions' annual dollar volume of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve metropolitan areas in the nationwide area for each year in the evaluation period.
ii. Summing all large depository institutions' annual dollar volume of deposits located in metropolitan areas in the nationwide area for each year in the evaluation period.
iii. Dividing the result of paragraph II.c.1.i of this appendix by the result of paragraph II.c.1.ii of this appendix.
Example B-3:
The applicable benchmark uses a three-year evaluation period. The annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve metropolitan areas in the nationwide area conducted by all large depository institutions are $98 billion (year 1), $100 billion (year 2), and $102 billion (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve metropolitan areas in the nationwide area conducted by all large depository institutions is therefore $300 billion. The annual dollar volumes of deposits located in metropolitan areas in the nationwide area in all large depository institutions are $14.9 trillion (year 1), $15 trillion (year 2), and $15.1 trillion (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volumes of deposits located in metropolitan areas in the nationwide area in all large depository institutions is therefore $45 trillion. For the evaluation period, the Metropolitan Nationwide Community Development Financing Benchmark would be $300 billion divided by $45 trillion, or 0.007 (equivalently, 0.7 percent).
ER01FE24.074
2.
Nonmetropolitan Nationwide Community Development Financing Benchmark.
The Board calculates the Nonmetropolitan Nationwide Community Development Financing Benchmark in § 228.24(b)(2)(ii)(B) by:
i. Summing all large depository institutions' annual dollar volume of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve nonmetropolitan areas in the nationwide area for each year in the evaluation period.
ii. Summing all large depository institutions' annual dollar volume of deposits located in nonmetropolitan areas in the nationwide area for each year in the evaluation period.
iii. Dividing the result of paragraph II.c.2.i of this appendix by the result of paragraph II.c.2.ii of this appendix.
Example B-4:
The applicable benchmark uses a three-year evaluation period. The annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve nonmetropolitan areas in the nationwide area conducted by all large depository institutions are $3 billion (year 1), $3.2 billion (year 2), and $3.8 billion (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve nonmetropolitan areas in the nationwide area conducted by all large depository institutions is therefore $10 billion. The annual dollar volumes of deposits located in nonmetropolitan areas in all large depository institutions are $330 billion (year 1), $334 billion (year 2), and $336 billion (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volumes of deposits located in nonmetropolitan areas in the nationwide area in all large depository institutions is therefore $1 trillion. For the evaluation period, the Nonmetropolitan Nationwide Community Development Financing Benchmark would be $10 billion divided by $1 trillion, or 0.01 (equivalently, 1 percent).
ER01FE24.075
d.
Bank State Community Development Financing Metric.
The Board calculates the Bank State Community Development Financing Metric in § 228.24(c)(2)(i) for each State in which the bank has a facility-based assessment area by:
1. Summing the bank's annual dollar volume of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve a State (which includes all activities within the bank's facility-based assessment areas and outside of its facility-
based assessment areas but within the State) for each year in the evaluation period.
2. Summing the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits located in a State for each year in the evaluation period.
3. Dividing the result of paragraphs II.d.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph II.d.2 of this appendix.

The bank has a three-year evaluation period. The bank's annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve the State are $15 million (year 1), $17 million (year 2), and $18 million (year 3). The sum of the bank's annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve the State conducted by a bank is therefore $50 million. The bank's annual dollar volumes of deposits located in the State are $1.5 billion (year 1), $1.6 billion (year 2), and $1.9 billion (year 3). The sum of the bank's annual dollar volumes of deposits located in the State is therefore $5 billion. For the evaluation period, the Bank State Community Development Financing Metric would be $50 million divided by $5 billion, or 0.01 (equivalently, 1 percent).
ER01FE24.076
e.
State Community Development Financing Benchmark.
The Board calculates the State Community Development Financing Benchmark in § 228.24(c)(2)(ii)(A) by:
1. Summing all large depository institutions' annual dollar volume of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve all or part of a State for each year in the evaluation period.
2. Summing all large depository institutions' annual dollar volume of deposits located in the State for each year in the evaluation period.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph II.e.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph II.e.2 of this appendix.
Example B-6:
The applicable benchmark uses a three-year evaluation period. The annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve the State conducted by all large depository institutions are $2.3 billion (year 1), $2.5 billion (year 2), and $2.7 billion (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve the State conducted by all large depository institutions is therefore $7.5 billion. The annual dollar volumes of deposits located in the State in all large depository institutions are $160 billion (year 1), $170 billion (year 2), and $170 billion (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volumes of deposits located in the State in all large depository institutions is therefore $500 billion. For the evaluation period, the State Community Development Financing Benchmark would be $7.5 billion divided by $500 billion, or 0.015 (equivalently, 1.5 percent).
ER01FE24.077
f.
State Weighted Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmark.
The Board calculates the State Weighted Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmark in § 228.24(c)(2)(ii)(B) by averaging all of the applicable Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmarks (see paragraph II.b of this appendix) in a State for the evaluation period, after weighting each pursuant to paragraph II.o of this appendix.
Example B-7:
The bank has two facility-based assessment areas (FBAAs) in a State (FBAA-1 and FBAA-2). The Board does not evaluate the bank's automobile lending.
• In FBAA-1, the Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmark is 3.0 percent. FBAA-1 represents 70 percent of the combined dollar volume of the deposits in the bank in FBAA-1 and FBAA-2. FBAA-1 represents 65 percent of the bank's combined dollar volume of originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans in FBAA-1 and FBAA-2. FBAA-1 represents 55 percent of the bank's number of originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans in FBAA-1 and FBAA-2;
• In FBAA-2, the Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmark is 5.0 percent. FBAA-2 represents 30 percent of the combined dollar volume of the deposits in the bank in FBAA-1 and FBAA-2. FBAA-2 represents 35 percent of the bank's combined dollar volume of originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans in FBAA-1 and FBAA-2. FBAA-2 represents 45 percent of the bank's number of originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans in FBAA-1 and FBAA-2.

Bank Multistate MSA Community Development Financing Metric.
The Board calculates the Bank Multistate MSA Community Development Financing Metric in § 228.24(d)(2)(i) for each multistate MSA in which the bank has a facility-based assessment area by:
1. Summing the bank's annual dollar volume of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve a multistate MSA (which includes all activities within the bank's facility-based assessment areas and outside of its facility-based assessment areas but within the multistate MSA) for each year in the evaluation period.
2. Summing the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits located in the multistate MSA for each year in the evaluation period.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph II.g.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph II.g.2 of this appendix.
Example B-8:
The bank has a three-year evaluation period. The bank's annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve a multistate MSA are $47 million (year 1), $51 million (year 2), and $52 million (year 3). The sum of the bank's annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve a multistate MSA conducted by the bank is therefore $150 million. The bank's annual dollar volumes of deposits located in the multistate MSA are $3.1 billion (year 1), $3.3 billion (year 2), and $3.6 billion (year 3). The sum of the bank's annual dollar volumes of deposits located in the multistate MSA is therefore $10 billion. For the evaluation period, the Bank Multistate MSA Community Development Financing Metric would be $150 million divided by $10 billion, or 0.015 (equivalently, 1.5 percent).
ER01FE24.082
h.
Multistate MSA Community Development Financing Benchmark.
The Board calculates the Multistate MSA Community Development Financing Benchmark in § 228.24(d)(2)(ii)(A) by:
1. Summing all large depository institutions' annual dollar volume of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve all or part of a multistate MSA for each year in the evaluation period.
2. Summing all large depository institutions' annual dollar volume of deposits located in the multistate MSA for each year in the evaluation period.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph II.h.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph II.h.2 of this appendix.
Example B-9:
The applicable benchmark uses a three-year evaluation period. The annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve a multistate MSA for all large depository institutions are $135 million (year 1), $140 million (year 2), and $145 million (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve a multistate MSA conducted by all large depository institutions is therefore $420 million. The annual dollar volumes of deposits located in the multistate MSA in all large depository institutions are $4 billion (year 1), $5 billion (year 2), and $6 billion (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volume of deposits located in the multistate MSA in all large depository institutions is therefore $15 billion. For the evaluation period, the Multistate MSA Community Development Financing Benchmark would be $420 million divided by $15 billion, or 0.028 (equivalently, 2.8 percent).

Bank Nationwide Community Development Investment Metric.
The Board calculates the Bank Nationwide Community Development Investment Metric in § 228.24(e)(2)(iii) for the nationwide area by:
1. Summing the bank's annual dollar volume of community development investments, excluding mortgage-backed securities, that benefit or serve the nationwide area (which includes all activities within the bank's facility-based assessment areas and outside of its facility-based assessment areas within the nationwide area) for each year in the evaluation period.
2. Summing the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits located in the nationwide area for each year in the evaluation period.
3. Dividing the results of paragraph II.m.1 of this appendix by the results of paragraph II.m.2 of this appendix.
Example B-14:

The annual dollar volumes of community development investments (excluding mortgage-backed securities) that benefit or serve the nationwide area for all large depository institutions are $350 billion (year 1), $360 billion (year 2), and $390 billion (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volumes of community development investments (excluding mortgage-backed securities) that benefit or serve the nationwide area conducted by all large depository institutions is therefore $1.1 trillion. The annual dollar volumes of deposits located in the nationwide area in all large depository institutions are $21.9 trillion (year 1), $22 trillion (year 2), and $22.1 trillion (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volumes of deposits located in the nationwide area in all large depository institutions is therefore $66 trillion. For the evaluation period, the Nationwide Community Development Investment Benchmark would be $1.1 trillion divided by $66 trillion, or 0.0167 (equivalently, 1.67 percent).
ER01FE24.097
o.
Weighting of benchmarks.
The Board calculates a weighted average of the Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmarks for a bank's facility-based assessment areas in each State or multistate MSA, as applicable, or the nationwide area. For the weighted average for a State or multistate MSA, the Board considers Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmarks for facility-based assessment areas in the State or multistate MSA pursuant to § 228.28(c). For the weighted average for the nationwide area, the Board considers Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmarks for all of the bank's facility-based assessment areas. Each Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmark is weighted by the average of the following two ratios:
1. The ratio measuring the share of the deposits in the bank in the facility-based assessment area, calculated by:
i. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in the facility-based assessment area.
ii. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in all facility-based assessment areas in the State, multistate MSA, or nationwide area, as applicable.
iii. Dividing the result of paragraph II.o.1.i of this appendix by the result of paragraph II.o.1.ii of this appendix.
For a bank that reports deposits data pursuant to § 228.42(b)(3), the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in a facility-based assessment area is the total of annual average daily balances of deposits reported by the bank in counties in the facility-based assessment area for that year. For a bank that does not report deposits data pursuant to § 228.42(b)(3), the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in a facility-based assessment area is the total of deposits assigned to facilities reported by the bank in the facility-based assessment area in the FDIC's Summary of Deposits for that year.
2. The ratio measuring the share of the bank's loans in the facility-based assessment area, based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count, as defined in § 228.12, calculated by dividing:
i. The bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and, if a product line for the bank, automobile loans in the facility-based assessment area originated or purchased during the evaluation period; by
ii. The bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and, if a product line for the bank, automobile loans in all facility-based assessment areas in the State, multistate MSA, or nationwide area, as applicable, originated or purchased during the evaluation period.
p.
Combined score for facility-based assessment area conclusions and the metrics and benchmarks analyses and the impact and responsiveness reviews.
1. As described in § 228.24(c) through (e), the Board assigns a conclusion corresponding to the conclusion category that is nearest to the performance score calculated in paragraph p.2.iii of this appendix for a bank's performance under the Community Development Financing Test in
each State or multistate MSA, as applicable pursuant to § 228.28(c), and for the institution as follows:
Performance score
Conclusion
8.5 or more
Outstanding.
6.5 or more but less than 8.5
High Satisfactory.
4.5 or more but less than 6.5
Low Satisfactory.
1.5 or more but less than 4.5
Needs to Improve.
Less than 1.5
Substantial Noncompliance.
2. The Board bases a Community Development Financing Test combined performance score on the following:
i.
Component one—Weighted average of the bank's performance scores corresponding to facility-based assessment area conclusions.
The Board derives a performance score based on a weighted average of the performance scores corresponding to conclusions for facility-based assessment areas in each State or multistate MSA, as applicable, and the nationwide area, calculated pursuant to section IV of this appendix.
ii.
Component two—Bank score for metric and benchmarks analyses and the impact and responsiveness reviews.
For each State or multistate MSA, as applicable, and the nationwide area, the Board determines a performance score (as shown in paragraph IV.a of this appendix) corresponding to a conclusion category by considering the relevant metric and benchmarks and a review of the impact and responsiveness of the bank's community development loans and community development investments. In the nationwide area, for large banks that had assets greater than $10 billion as of December 31 in both of the prior two calendar years, the Board also considers whether the bank's performance under the Nationwide Community Development Investment Metric, compared to the Community Development Investment Benchmark, contributes positively to the bank's Community Development Financing Test conclusion.
iii.
Combined score.
The Board associates the performance score calculated pursuant to this paragraph II.p.2.iii with a conclusion category. The Board derives the combined performance score corresponding to a conclusion category as follows:
A. The Board calculates the average of two components to determine weighting:
1.
The percentage, calculated using the combination of loan dollars and loan count, as defined in § 228.12, of the bank's total originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage lending, small business lending, small farm lending, and automobile lending, as applicable, in its facility-based assessment areas out of all of the bank's originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage lending, small business lending, small farm lending, and automobile lending, as applicable, in the State or multistate MSA, as applicable, or the nationwide area during the evaluation period; and
2.
The percentage of the total dollar volume of deposits in its facility-based assessment areas out of all of the deposits in the bank in the State or multistate MSA, as applicable, or the nationwide area during the evaluation period. For purposes of this paragraph II.p.2.iii.A.
2,
“deposits” excludes deposits reported under § 228.42(b)(3)(ii).
B. If the average is:
1.
At least 80 percent, then component one receives a 50 percent weight and component two receives a 50 percent weight.
2.
At least 60 percent but less than 80 percent, then component one receives a 40 percent weight and component two receives a 60 percent weight.
3.
At least 40 percent but less than 60 percent, then component one receives a 30 percent weight and component two receives a 70 percent weight.
4.
At least 20 percent but less than 40 percent, then component one receives a 20 percent weight and component two receives an 80 percent weight.
5.
Below 20 percent, then component one receives a 10 percent weight and component two receives a 90 percent weight.

Example B-16:
• Assume that the weighted average of the bank's performance scores corresponding to its facility-based assessment area conclusions nationwide is 7.5. Assume further that the bank score for the metrics and benchmarks analysis and the review of the impact and responsiveness of the bank's community development loans and community development investments nationwide is 6.
• Assume further that 95 percent of the deposits in the bank and 75 percent of the
bank's originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage lending, small business lending, small farm lending, and automobile loans (calculated using the combination of loan dollars and loan count, as defined in § 228.12) during the evaluation period are associated with its facility-based assessment areas.
• The Board assigns weights for component one and component two based on the share of deposits in the bank and the share of the bank's originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage lending, small business lending, small farm lending, and automobile lending, calculated using the combination of loan dollars and loan count, as defined in § 228.12, associated with its facility-based assessment areas: (95 percent of deposits + 75 percent of originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage lending, small business lending, small farm lending, and automobile lending, based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count)/2 = 85 percent, which is between 80 percent and 100 percent.
• Thus, the weighted average of the bank's facility-based assessment area conclusions in the nationwide area (component one—paragraph II.p.2.i of this appendix) receives a weight of 50 percent, and the metrics and benchmarks analysis and the review of the impact and responsiveness of the bank's community development loans and community development investments in the nationwide area (component two—paragraph II.p.2.ii of this appendix) receives a weight of 50 percent.
• Using the point values—“Outstanding” (10 points); “High Satisfactory” (7 points); “Low Satisfactory” (6 points); “Needs to Improve” (3 points); “Substantial Noncompliance” (0 points)—the bank's Community Development Financing Test conclusion at the institution level is a “High Satisfactory”: (0.50 weight × 7.5 points for the weighted average of the performance scores corresponding to the bank's facility-based assessment area conclusions nationwide) + (0.50 weight × 6 points for the bank score for metrics and benchmarks analysis and review of the impact and responsiveness of the bank's community development loans and community development investments nationwide) results in a performance score of 6.75, which is closest to the point value (7) associated with “High Satisfactory.”

The bank's annual dollar volumes of community development investments (excluding mortgage-backed securities) that benefit or serve the nationwide area are $62 million (year 1), $65 million (year 2), and $73 million (year 3). The sum of the bank's annual dollar volumes of community development investments that benefit or serve the nationwide area conducted by the bank is therefore $200 million. The bank's annual dollar volumes of assets in the bank are $2.4 billion (year 1), $2.7 billion (year 2), and $2.9 billion (year 3). The sum of the bank's annual dollar volumes of assets in the bank over the evaluation period is therefore $8 billion. For the evaluation period, the Bank Nationwide Community Development Investment Metric would be $200 million divided by $8 billion, or 0.025 (equivalently, 2.5 percent).

e.
Nationwide Asset-Based Community Development Investment Benchmark.
The Board calculates the Nationwide Asset-Based Community Development Investment Benchmark, provided in § 228.26(f)(2)(iv), by:
1. Summing the annual dollar volume of community development investments, excluding mortgage-backed securities, of all depository institutions that had assets greater than $10 billion, as of December 31 in both of the prior two calendar years, that benefit or serve all or part of the nationwide area for each year in the evaluation period.
2. Summing the annual dollar volume of assets of all depository institutions that had assets greater than $10 billion, as of December 31 in both of the prior two calendar years, for each year in the evaluation period.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph III.e.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph III.e.2 of this appendix.
Example B-18:
The applicable benchmark uses a three-year evaluation period. The annual dollar volumes of community development investments (excluding mortgage-backed securities) that benefit or serve the nationwide area for all depository institutions that had assets greater than $10 billion are $35 billion (year 1), $37 million (year 2), and $38 billion (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volumes of community development investments that benefit or serve the nationwide area conducted by all depository institutions that had assets greater than $10 billion is therefore $110 billion. The annual dollar volumes of assets in all depository institutions that had assets greater than $10 billion are $1.8 trillion (year 1), $2.1 trillion (year 2), and $2.1 trillion (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volumes of assets in all depository institutions that had assets greater than $10 billion is therefore $6 trillion. For the evaluation period, the Nationwide Asset-Based Community Development Investment Benchmark would be $110 billion divided by $6 trillion, or 0.0183 (equivalently, 1.83 percent).

0
b. The Board calculates the weighted average of facility-based assessment area performance scores for a State or multistate MSA, as applicable, and for the institution. For the weighted average for a State or multistate MSA, the Board considers facility-based assessment areas in the State or multistate MSA pursuant to § 228.28(c). For the weighted average for the institution, the Board considers all of the bank's facility-based assessment areas. Each facility-based assessment area performance score is weighted by the average the following two ratios:
1. The ratio measuring the share of the deposits in the bank in the facility-based assessment area, calculated by:
i. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in the facility-based assessment area.
ii. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in all facility-based assessment areas in the State, in the multistate MSA, or for the nationwide area, as applicable.
iii. Dividing the result of paragraph IV.b.1.i of this appendix by the result of paragraph IV.b.1.ii of this appendix.
For a bank that reports deposits data pursuant to § 228.42(b)(3), the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in a facility-based assessment area is the total of annual average daily balances of deposits reported by the bank in counties in the facility-based assessment area for that year. For a bank that does not report deposits data pursuant to § 228.42(b)(3), the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in a facility-based assessment area is the total of deposits assigned to facilities reported by the bank in the facility-based assessment area in the FDIC's Summary of Deposits for that year.
2. The ratio measuring the share of the bank's loans in the facility-based assessment area, based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count, as defined in § 228.12, calculated by dividing:
i. The bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and, if a product line for the bank, automobile loans in the facility-based assessment area originated or purchased during the evaluation period; by
ii. The bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and, if a product line for the bank, automobile loans in all facility-based assessment areas in the State, in the multistate MSA, or for the nationwide area, as applicable, originated or purchased during the evaluation period.

# Appendix D to Part 228—Ratings
a.
Ratings, in general.
In assigning a rating, the Board evaluates a bank's performance under the applicable performance criteria in this part, pursuant to §§ 228.21 and 228.28. The agency calculates an overall performance score for each State and multistate MSA, as applicable pursuant to § 228.28(c), and for the institution. The Board assigns a rating of “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve,” or “Substantial Noncompliance”
for the bank's performance in each State and multistate MSA, as applicable pursuant to § 228.28(c), and for the institution that is nearest to the overall performance score, as follows:
Performance score
Rating
8.5 or more
Outstanding.
4.5 or more but less than 8.5
Satisfactory.
1.5 or more but less than 4.5
Needs to Improve.
Less than 1.5
Substantial Noncompliance.
The Board also considers any evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices pursuant to § 228.28(d) and the bank's past performance pursuant to § 228.28(e).
b.
Large bank ratings at the State, multistate MSA, and institution levels.
Subject to paragraph g of this appendix, the Board combines a large bank's performance scores for its State, multistate MSA, or institution-level performance under the Retail Lending Test in § 228.22, Retail Services and Products Test in § 228.23, Community Development Financing Test in § 228.24, and Community Development Services Test in § 228.25 to determine the bank's rating in each State or multistate MSA, as applicable pursuant to § 228.28(c), and for the institution.
1. The Board weights the performance scores as follows: Retail Lending Test (40 percent); Retail Services and Products Test (10 percent); Community Development Financing Test (40 percent); and Community Development Services Test (10 percent). The Board multiplies each of these weights by the bank's performance score on the respective performance test, and then adds the resulting values together to develop a State, multistate MSA, or institution-level performance score.
2. The Board assigns a rating corresponding with the rating category that is nearest to the State, multistate MSA, or institution performance score using the table in paragraph a of this appendix.
Example D-1:
A large bank received the following performance scores and conclusions in a State:
• On the Retail Lending Test, the bank received a 7.3 performance score and a corresponding conclusion of “High Satisfactory;”
• On the Retail Services and Products Test, the bank received a 6.0 performance score and a corresponding conclusion of “Low Satisfactory;”
• On the Community Development Financing Test, the bank received a 5.7 performance score and a corresponding conclusion of “Low Satisfactory;” and
• On the Community Development Services Test, the bank received a 3.0 performance score and a corresponding conclusion of “Needs to Improve.”
Calculating weights:
• For the Retail Lending Test, the weight is 40 percent (or 0.4);
• For the Retail Services and Products Test, the weight is 10 percent (or 0.1);
• For the Community Development Financing Test, the weight is 40 percent (or 0.4); and
• For the Community Development Services Test, the weight is 10 percent (or 0.1).
State Performance Score:
Based on the illustration in this example D-1, the bank's State performance score is 6.1.
(0.4 weight × 7.3 performance score on the Retail Lending Test = 2.92) + (0.1 weight × 6.0 performance score on the Retail Services and Products Test = 0.6) + (0.4 weight × 5.7 performance score on the Community Development Financing Test = 2.28) + (0.1 weight × 3.0 performance score on the Community Development Services Test = 0.3).
State Rating:
A State performance score of 6.1 is greater than 4.5 but less than 8.5, resulting in a rating of “Satisfactory.”
c.
Intermediate bank ratings.
1.
Intermediate banks evaluated pursuant to the Retail Lending Test and the Community Development Financing Test.
Subject to paragraph g of this appendix, the Board combines an intermediate bank's performance scores for its State, multistate MSA, or institution performance under the Retail Lending Test and the Community Development Financing Test to determine the bank's rating in each State or multistate MSA, as applicable pursuant to § 228.28(c), and for the institution.
i. The Board weights the performance scores as follows: Retail Lending Test (50 percent) and Community Development Financing Test (50 percent). The Board multiplies each of these weights by the bank's corresponding performance score on the respective performance test, and then adds the resulting values together to develop a State, multistate MSA, or institution performance score.
ii. The Board assigns a rating corresponding with the rating category that is nearest to the State, multistate MSA, or institution performance score, using the table in paragraph a of this appendix.
iii. The Board may adjust an intermediate bank's institution rating where the bank has requested and received sufficient additional consideration pursuant to § 228.30(b)(2) and (3).
2.
Intermediate banks evaluated pursuant to the Retail Lending Test and the Intermediate Bank Community Development Test in § 228.30(a)(2).

# Note:
The content of this appendix reproduces part 228 implementing the Community Reinvestment Act as of March 31, 2024. Cross-references to CFR parts (as well as to included sections, subparts, and appendices) in this appendix are to those provisions as contained within this appendix and the CFR as of March 31, 2024.
Subpart A—General
§ 228.11 Authority, purposes, and scope.
(a)
Authority.
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board) issues this part to implement the Community Reinvestment Act (12 U.S.C. 2901
et seq.
) (CRA). The regulations comprising this part are issued under the authority of the CRA and under the provisions of the United States Code authorizing the Board:
(1) To conduct examinations of State-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System (12 U.S.C. 325);
(2) To conduct examinations of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries (12 U.S.C. 1844) and savings and loan holding companies and their subsidiaries (12 U.S.C. 1467a); and(3) To consider applications for:
(i) Domestic branches by State member banks (12 U.S.C. 321);
(ii) Mergers in which the resulting bank would be a State member bank (12 U.S.C. 1828(c));
(iii) Formations of, acquisitions of banks by, and mergers of, bank holding companies (12 U.S.C. 1842);
(iv) The acquisition of savings associations by bank holding companies (12 U.S.C. 1843); and
(v) Formations of, acquisitions of savings associations by, conversions of, and mergers of, savings and loan holding companies (12 U.S.C. 1467a).
(b)
Purposes.
In enacting the CRA, the Congress required each appropriate Federal financial supervisory agency to assess an institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which the institution is chartered, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution, and to take this record into account in the agency's evaluation of an application for a deposit facility by the institution. This part is intended to carry out the purposes of the CRA by:
(1) Establishing the framework and criteria by which the Board assesses a bank's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank; and

Lending, investment, and service tests.
The Board applies the lending, investment, and service tests, as provided in §§ 228.22 through 228.24, in evaluating the performance of a bank, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(4) of this section.
(2)

The Board applies the community development test for a wholesale or limited purpose bank, as provided in § 228.25, except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(3)
Small bank performance standards.
The Board applies the small bank performance standards as provided in § 228.26 in evaluating the performance of a small bank or a bank
that was a small bank during the prior calendar year, unless the bank elects to be assessed as provided in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(4) of this section. The bank may elect to be assessed as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section only if it collects and reports the data required for other banks under § 228.42.
(4)
Strategic plan.
The Board evaluates the performance of a bank under a strategic plan if the bank submits, and the Board approves, a strategic plan as provided in § 228.27.
(b)
Performance context.
The Board applies the tests and standards in paragraph (a) of this section and also considers whether to approve a proposed strategic plan in the context of:
(1) Demographic data on median income levels, distribution of household income, nature of housing stock, housing costs, and other relevant data pertaining to a bank's assessment area(s);
(2) Any information about lending, investment, and service opportunities in the bank's assessment area(s) maintained by the bank or obtained from community organizations, state, local, and tribal governments, economic development agencies, or other sources;
(3) The bank's product offerings and business strategy as determined from data provided by the bank;
(4) Institutional capacity and constraints, including the size and financial condition of the bank, the economic climate (national, regional, and local), safety and soundness limitations, and any other factors that significantly affect the bank's ability to provide lending, investments, or services in its assessment area(s);
(5) The bank's past performance and the performance of similarly situated lenders;
(6) The bank's public file, as described in § 228.43, and any written comments about the bank's CRA performance submitted to the bank or the Board; and
(7) Any other information deemed relevant by the Board.
(c)
Assigned ratings.
The Board assigns to a bank one of the following four ratings pursuant to § 228.28 and appendix A of this part: “outstanding”; “satisfactory”; “needs to improve”; or “substantial noncompliance” as provided in 12 U.S.C. 2906(b)(2). The rating assigned by the Board reflects the bank's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank.
(d)
Safe and sound operations.
This part and the CRA do not require a bank to make loans or investments or to provide services that are inconsistent with safe and sound operations. To the contrary, the Board anticipates banks can meet the standards of this part with safe and sound loans, investments, and services on which the banks expect to make a profit. Banks are permitted and encouraged to develop and apply flexible underwriting standards for loans that benefit low- or moderate-income geographies or individuals, only if consistent with safe and sound operations.
(e)
Low-cost education loans provided to low-income borrowers.
In assessing and taking into account the record of a bank under this part, the Board considers, as a factor, low-cost education loans originated by the bank to borrowers, particularly in its assessment area(s), who have an individual income that is less than 50 percent of the area median income. For purposes of this paragraph, “low-cost education loans” means any education loan, as defined in section 140(a)(7) of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1650(a)(7)) (including a loan under a state or local education loan program), originated by the bank for a student at an “institution of higher education,” as that term is generally defined in sections 101 and 102 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001 and 1002) and the implementing regulations published by the U.S. Department of Education, with interest rates and fees no greater than those of comparable education loans offered directly by the U.S. Department of Education. Such rates and fees are specified in section 455 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087e).
(f)
Activities in cooperation with minority- or women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions.
In assessing and taking into account the record of a nonminority-owned and nonwomen-owned bank under this part, the Board considers as a factor capital investment, loan participation, and other ventures undertaken by the bank in cooperation with minority- and women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions. Such activities must help meet the credit needs of local communities in which the minority- and women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions are chartered. To be considered, such activities need not also benefit the bank's assessment area(s) or the broader statewide or regional area that includes the bank's assessment area(s).
§ 228.22 Lending test.
(a)
Scope of test.
(1) The lending test evaluates a bank's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its assessment area(s) through its lending activities by considering a bank's home mortgage, small business, small farm, and community development lending. If consumer lending constitutes a substantial majority of a bank's business, the Board will evaluate the bank's consumer lending in one or more of the following categories: motor vehicle, credit card, other secured, and other unsecured loans. In addition, at a bank's option, the Board will
evaluate one or more categories of consumer lending, if the bank has collected and maintained, as required in § 228.42(c)(1), the data for each category that the bank elects to have the Board evaluate.
(2) The Board considers originations and purchases of loans. The Board will also consider any other loan data the bank may choose to provide, including data on loans outstanding, commitments and letters of credit.
(3) A bank may ask the Board to consider loans originated or purchased by consortia in which the bank participates or by third parties in which the bank has invested only if the loans meet the definition of community development loans and only in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. The Board will not consider these loans under any criterion of the lending test except the community development lending criterion.
(b)
Performance criteria.
The Board evaluates a bank's lending performance pursuant to the following criteria:

(3)
Borrower characteristics.
The distribution, particularly in the bank's assessment area(s), of the bank's home mortgage, small business, small farm, and consumer loans, if applicable, based on borrower characteristics, including the number and amount of:
(i) Home mortgage loans to low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income individuals;
(ii) Small business and small farm loans to businesses and farms with gross annual revenues of $1 million or less;
(iii) Small business and small farm loans by loan amount at origination; and(iv) Consumer loans, if applicable, to low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income individuals;

The bank's use of innovative or flexible lending practices in a safe and sound manner to address the credit needs of low- or moderate-income individuals or geographies.
(c)
Affiliate lending.
(1) At a bank's option, the Board will consider loans by an affiliate of the bank, if the bank provides data on the affiliate's loans pursuant to § 228.42.
(2) The Board considers affiliate lending subject to the following constraints:
(i) No affiliate may claim a loan origination or loan purchase if another institution claims the same loan origination or purchase; and
(ii) If a bank elects to have the Board consider loans within a particular lending category made by one or more of the bank's affiliates in a particular assessment area, the bank shall elect to have the Board consider, in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, all the loans within that lending category in that particular assessment area made by all of the bank's affiliates.
(3) The Board does not consider affiliate lending in assessing a bank's performance under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
(d)
Lending by a consortium or a third party.
Community development loans originated or purchased by a consortium in which the bank participates or by a third party in which the bank has invested:

(ii) A bank shall address in its plan all three performance categories and, unless the bank has been designated as a wholesale or limited purpose bank, shall emphasize lending and lending-related activities. Nevertheless, a different emphasis, including a focus on one or more performance categories, may be appropriate if responsive to the characteristics and credit needs of its assessment area(s), considering public comment and the bank's capacity and constraints, product offerings, and business strategy.

Plan approval
—(1)
Timing.
The Board will act upon a plan within 60 calendar days after the Board receives the complete plan and other material required under paragraph (e) of this section.

Geographic area(s) for wholesale or limited purpose banks.
The assessment area(s) for a wholesale or limited purpose bank must consist generally of one or more MSAs or metropolitan divisions (using the MSA or metropolitan division boundaries that were in effect as of January 1 of the calendar year in which the delineation is made) or one or more contiguous political subdivisions, such as counties, cities, or towns, in which the bank has its main office, branches, and deposit-taking ATMs.
(c)
Geographic area(s) for other banks.
The assessment area(s) for a bank other than a wholesale or limited purpose bank must:

(d)
Adjustments to geographic area(s).
A bank may adjust the boundaries of its assessment area(s) to include only the portion of a political subdivision that it reasonably can be expected to serve.

(iii)
Needs to improve or substantial noncompliance overall ratings.
A small bank may also receive a rating of “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance” depending on the degree to which its performance has failed to meet the standards for a “satisfactory” rating.

The Board approves as “satisfactory” measurable goals that adequately help to meet the credit needs of the bank's assessment area(s).

(iii) If the bank fails to meet substantially its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, the Board will rate the bank as either “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance,” depending on the extent to which it falls short of its plan goals, unless the bank elected in its plan to be rated otherwise, as provided in § 228.27(f)(4).

§ 229.10, Nt.

# Effective Date Note:
At 89 FR 43738, May 20, 2024, § 229.10 was amended in paragraph (c)(1)(vii)(A) by removing “$225” and adding in its place “$275;”, effective July 1, 2025.
§ 229.11
Adjustment of dollar amounts.
(a)
Dollar amounts indexed.
The dollar amounts specified in §§ 229.10(c)(1)(vii),
229.12(d), 229.13(a), 229.13(b), 229.13(d), and 229.21(a) shall be adjusted effective on July 1, 2020, on July 1, 2025, and on July 1 of every fifth year after 2025, in accordance with the procedure set forth in paragraph (b) of this section using the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
(b)
Indexing procedure
—(1)
Inflation measurement periods.
For dollar amount adjustments that are effective on July 1, 2020, the inflation measurement period begins in July 2011 and ends in July 2018. For dollar amount adjustments that are effective on July 1, 2025, the inflation measurement period begins in July 2018 and ends in July 2023. For dollar amount adjustments that are effective on July 1 of every fifth year after 2025, the inflation measurement period begins in July of every fifth year after 2018 and ends in July of every fifth year after 2023. Following each inflation measurement period, the dollar amount adjustments will be published in the
Federal Register
.
(2)
Percentage change.
Any dollar amount adjustment under this section shall be calculated across an inflation measurement period by the aggregate percentage change in the CPI-W, including both positive and negative percentage changes. The aggregate percentage change over the inflation measurement period will be rounded to one decimal place, using the CPI-W value for July (which is generally released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in August).
(3)
Adjustment amount.
The adjustment amount for each dollar amount listed in paragraph (a) of this section shall be equal to the aggregate percentage change multiplied by the existing dollar amount listed in paragraph (c) of this section and rounded to the nearest multiple of $25. The adjusted dollar amount will be equal to the sum of the existing dollar amount and the adjustment amount. No dollar adjustment will be made when the aggregate percentage change is zero or a negative percentage change, or when the aggregate percentage change multiplied by the existing dollar amount listed in paragraph (c) and rounded to the nearest multiple of $25 results in no change.
(4)
Carry-forward.
When there is an aggregate negative percentage change over an inflation measurement period, or when an aggregate positive percentage change over an inflation measurement period multiplied by the existing dollar amount listed in paragraph (c) of this section and rounded to the nearest multiple of $25 results in no change, the aggregate percentage change over the inflation measurement period will be included in the calculation to determine the percentage change at the end of the subsequent inflation measurement period. That is, the cumulative change in the CPI-W over the two (or more) inflation measurement periods will be used in the calculation until the cumulative change results in publication of an adjusted dollar amount in the regulation.
(c)

An account is not considered a new account if each customer on the account has had, within 30 calendar days before the account is established, another account at the depositary bank for at least 30 calendar days.
(b)
Large deposits.
Sections 229.10(c) and 229.12 do not apply to the aggregate amount of deposits by one or more checks to the extent that the aggregate amount is in excess of $5,525 on any one banking. day.

(c)
Redeposited checks.
Sections 229.10(c) and 229.12 do not apply to a check that has been returned unpaid and redeposited by the customer or the depositary bank. This exception does not apply—
(1) To a check that has been returned due to a missing indorsement and redeposited after the missing indorsement has been obtained, if the reason for return indication on the check states
that it was returned due to a missing indorsement; or
(2) To a check that has been returned because it was post dated, if the reason for return indicated on the check states that it was returned because it was post dated, and if the check is no longer postdated when redeposited.

(i) The overdraft or return of the check would not have occurred except for the fact that the deposited funds were delayed under paragraph (e)(1) of this section; and
(ii) The deposited check was paid by the paying bank.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the depositary bank may assess an overdraft or returned check fee if it includes a notice concerning overdraft and returned check fees with the notice of exception required in paragraph (g) of this section and, when required, refunds any such fees upon the request of the customer. The notice must state that the customer may be entitled to a refund of overdraft or returned check fees that are assessed if the check subject to the exception is paid and how to obtain a refund.

If the notice is not given at the time of the deposit, the depositary bank shall mail or deliver the notice to the customer as soon as practicable, but no later than the first business day following the day the facts become known to the depositary bank, or the deposit is made, whichever is later.

(i) The reason(s) the exception may be invoked; and
(ii) The time period within which deposits subject to the exception generally will be available for withdrawal.
This one-time notice shall be provided only if each type of exception cited in the notice will be invoked for most check deposits in the account to which the exception could apply. This notice shall be provided at or prior to the time notice must be provided under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section.
(3)
Notice of repeated overdrafts exception.

(ii) The fact that the availability of funds deposited in the customer's account will be delayed because the repeated overdrafts exception will be invoked;
(iii) The time period within which deposits subject to the exception generally will be available for withdrawal; and
(iv) The time period during which the exception will apply.
This notice shall be provided at or prior to the time notice must be provided under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section and only if the exception cited in the notice will be invoked for most check deposits in the account.
(4)
Emergency conditions exception notice.
When a depositary bank extends the time when funds will be available for withdrawal based on the application of the emergency conditions exception contained in paragraph (f) of this section, it must provide the depositor with notice in a reasonable form and within a reasonable time given the circumstances. The notice shall include the reason the exception was invoked and the time period within which funds shall be made available for withdrawal, unless the depositary bank, in good faith, does not know at the time the notice is given the duration of the emergency and, consequently, when the funds must be made available. The depositary bank is not required to provide a notice if the funds subject to the exception become available before the notice must be sent.
(5)
Record retention.
A depositary bank shall retain a record, in accordance with § 229.21(g), of each notice provided pursuant to its application of the reasonable cause exception under paragraph (e) of this section, together with a brief statement of the facts giving rise to the bank's reason to doubt the collectibility of the check.
(h)
Availability of deposits subject to exceptions.
(1) If an exception contained in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section applies, the depositary bank may extend the time periods established under §§ 229.10(c) and 229.12 by a reasonable period of time.
(2) If a depositary bank invokes an exception contained in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section with respect to a check described in § 229.10(c)(1) (i) through (v) or § 229.10(c)(2), it shall
make the funds available for withdrawal not later than a reasonable period after the day the funds would have been required to be made available had the check been subject to 229.12.
(3) If a depositary bank invokes an exception under paragraph (f) of this section based on an emergency condition, the depositary bank shall make the funds available for withdrawal not later than a reasonable period after the emergency has ceased or the period established in §§ 229.10(c) and 229.12, whichever is later.
(4) For the purposes of this section, a “reasonable period” is an extension of up to one business day for checks described in § 229.10(c)(1)(vi), five business days for checks described in § 229.12(b) (1) through (4), and six business days for checks described in § 229.12(c) (1) and (2) or § 229.12(f). A longer extension may be reasonable, but the bank has the burden of so establishing.

In general.
A depositary bank shall begin to accrue interest or dividends on funds deposited in an interest-bearing account not later than the business day on which the depositary bank receives credit for the funds. For the purposes of this section, the depositary bank may—

§ 229.15
General disclosure requirements.
(a)
Form of disclosures.
A bank shall make the disclosures required by this subpart clearly and conspicuously in writing. Disclosures, other than those posted at locations where employees accept consumer deposits and ATMs and the notice on preprinted deposit slips, must be in a form that the customer may keep. The disclosures shall be grouped together and shall not contain any information not related to the disclosures required by this subpart. If contained in a document that sets forth other account terms, the disclosures shall be highlighted within the document by, for example, use of a separate heading.
(b)
Uniform reference to day of availability.
In its disclosure, a bank shall describe funds as being available for withdrawal on “the __________ business day after” the day of deposit. In this calculation, the first business day is the business day following the banking day the deposit was received, and the last business day is the day on which the funds are made available.
(c)
Multiple accounts and multiple account holders.
A bank need not give multiple disclosures to a customer that holds multiple accounts if the accounts are subject to the same availability policies. Similarly, a bank need not give separate disclosures to each customer on a jointly held account.
(d)
Dormant or inactive accounts.
A bank need not give availability disclosures to a customer that holds a dormant or inactive account.
§ 229.16
Specific availability policy disclosure.
(a)
General.
To meet the requirements of a specific availability policy disclosure under §§ 229.17 and 229.18(d), a bank shall provide a disclosure describing the bank's policy as to when funds deposited in an account are available for withdrawal. The disclosure must reflect the policy followed by the bank in most cases. A bank may impose longer delays on a case-by-case basis or by invoking one of the exceptions in § 229.l3, provided this is reflected in the disclosure.
(b)
Content of specific availability policy disclosure.
The specific availability policy disclosure shall contain the following, as applicable—
(1) A summary of the bank's availability policy;
(2) A description of any categories of deposits or checks used by the bank when it delays availability (such as local or nonlocal checks); how to determine the category to which a particular deposit or check belongs; and when each category will be available for withdrawal (including a description of the bank's business days and when a deposit is considered received);
1
1
A bank that distinguishes in its disclosure between local and nonlocal checks based on the routing number on the check must disclose that certain checks, such as some credit union share drafts that are payable by one bank but payable through another bank, will be treated as local or nonlocal checks based upon the location of the bank by which they are payable and not on the basis of the location of the bank whose routing number appears on the check. A bank that makes funds from nonlocal checks available for withdrawal within the time periods required for local checks under §§ 229.12 and 229.13 is not required to provide this disclosure on payable-through checks to its customers. The statement concerning payable-through checks must describe how the customer can determine whether these checks will be treated as local or nonlocal, or state that special rules apply to such checks and that the customer may ask about the availability of these checks.
(3) A description of any of the exceptions in § 229.13 that may be invoked by the bank, including the time following a deposit that funds generally will be available for withdrawal and a statement that the bank will notify the customer if the bank invokes one of the exceptions;
(4) A description, as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, of any case-by-case policy of delaying availability that may result in deposited funds being available for withdrawal later than the time periods stated in the bank's availability policy; and
(5) A description of how the customer can differentiate between a proprietary and a nonproprietary ATM, if the bank makes funds from deposits at nonproprietary ATMs available for withdrawal later than funds from deposits at proprietary ATMs.
(c)
Longer delays on a case-by-case basis
—(1)
Notice in specific policy disclosure.
A bank that has a policy of making deposited funds available for withdrawal sooner than required by this subpart may extend the time when funds are available up to the time periods allowed under this subpart on a case-by-case basis, provided the bank includes the following in its specific policy disclosure—
(i) A statement that the time when deposited funds are available for withdrawal may be extended in some cases, and the latest time following a deposit that funds will be available for withdrawal;
(ii) A statement that the bank will notify the customer if funds deposited in the customer's account will not be available for withdrawal until later than the time periods stated in the bank's availability policy; and
(iii) A statement that customers should ask if they need to be sure about when a particular deposit will be available for withdrawal.
(2)
Notice at time of case-by-case delay
—(i)
In general.
When a depositary bank extends the time when funds will be available for withdrawal on a case-by-case basis, it must provide the depositor with a written notice. The notice shall include the following information—
(A) A number or code, which need not exceed four digits, that identifies the customer's account.
(B) The date of the deposit;
(C) The amount of the deposit that is being delayed; and
(D) The day the funds will be available for withdrawal.
(ii)
Timing of notice.
The notice shall be provided to the depositor at the time of the deposit, unless the deposit is not made in person to an employee of the depositary bank or the decision to extend the time when the deposited funds will be available is made after the time of the deposit. If notice is not given at the time of the deposit, the depositary bank shall mail or deliver the notice to the customer not later than the first business day following the banking day the deposit is made.
(3) Overdraft and returned check fees. A depositary bank that extends the time when funds will be available for withdrawal on a case-by-case basis and does not furnish the depositor with written notice at the time of deposit shall not assess any fees for any subsequent overdrafts (including use of a line of credit) or return of checks or other debits to the account, if—
(i) The overdraft or return of the check or other debit would not have occurred except for the fact that the deposited funds were delayed under paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and
(ii) The deposited check was paid by the paying bank.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the depositary bank may assess an overdraft or returned check fee if it includes a notice concerning overdraft and returned check fees with the notice required in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and, when required, refunds any such fees upon the request of the customer. The notice must state that the customer may be entitled to a refund of overdraft or returned check fees that are assessed if the check subject to the delay is paid and how to obtain a refund.
(d)
Credit union notice of interest payment policy.
If a bank described in § 229.2(e)(4) begins to accrue interest or dividends on all deposits made in an interest-bearing account, including cash deposits, at a later time than the day specified in § 229.14(a), the bank's specific policy disclosures shall contain an explanation of when interest or dividends on deposited funds begin to accrue.

§ 229.20
Relation to state law.
(a)
In general.
Any provision of a law or regulation of any state in effect on or before September 1, 1989, that requires funds deposited in an account at a bank chartered by the state to be made available for withdrawal in a shorter time than the time provided in subpart B, and, in connection therewith, subpart A, shall—
(1) Supersede the provisions of the EFA Act and subpart B, and, in connection therewith, subpart A, to the extent the provisions relate to the time by which funds deposited or received for deposit in an account are available for withdrawal; and
(2) Apply to all federally insured banks located within the state.
No amendment to a state law or regulation governing the availability of funds that becomes effective after September 1, 1989, shall supersede the EFA Act and subpart B, and, in connection therewith, subpart A, but unamended provisions of state law shall remain in effect.
(b)
Preemption of inconsistent law.
Except as provided in paragraph (a), the EFA Act and subpart B, and, in connection therewith, subpart A, supersede any provision of inconsistent state law.
(c)
Standards for preemption.
A provision of a state law in effect on or before September 2, 1989, is not inconsistent with the EFA Act, or subpart B, or in connection therewith, subpart A, if it requires that funds shall be available in a shorter period of time than the time provided in this subpart. Inconsistency with the EFA Act and subpart B, and in connection therewith, subpart A, may exist when state law—
(1) Permits a depositary bank to make funds deposited in an account by cash, electronic payment, or check available for withdrawal in a longer period of time than the maximum period of time permitted under subpart B, and, in connection therewith, subpart A; or
(2) Provides for disclosures or notices concerning funds availability relating to accounts.
(d)
Preemption determinations.
The Board may determine, upon the request of any state, bank, or other interested party, whether the EFA Act and subpart B, and, in connection therewith, subpart A, preempt provisions of state laws relating to the availability of funds.
(e)
Procedures for preemption determinations.
A request for a preemption determination shall include the following—
(1) A copy of the full text of the state law in question, including any implementing regulations or judicial interpretations of that law; and
(2) A comparison of the provisions of state law with the corresponding provisions in the EFA Act and subparts A and B of this part, together with a discussion of the reasons why specific provisions of state law are either consistent or inconsistent with corresponding sections of the EFA Act and subparts A and B of this part.
A request for a preemption determination shall be addressed to the Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

§ 229.21
Civil liability.
(a)
Civil liability.
A bank that fails to comply with any requirement imposed under subpart B, and in connection therewith, subpart A, of this part or any provision of state law that supersedes any provision of subpart B, and in connection therewith, subpart A, with respect to any person is liable to that person in an amount equal to the sum of—
(1) Any actual damage sustained by that person as a result of the failure;
(2) Such additional amount as the court may allow, except that—
(i) In the case of an individual action, liability under this paragraph shall not be less than $100 nor greater than $1,100; and
(ii) In the case of a class action—
(A) No minimum recovery shall be applicable to each member of the class; and

(3) In the case of a successful action to enforce the foregoing liability, the costs of the action, together with a reasonable attorney's fee as determined by the court.
(b)
Class action awards.
In determining the amount of any award in any class action, the court shall consider, among other relevant factors—
(1) The amount of any damages awarded;
(2) The frequency and persistence of failures of compliance;
(3) The resources of the bank;
(4) The number of persons adversely affected; and
(5) The extent to which the failure of compliance was intentional.
(c)
Bona fide errors
—(1)
General rule.
A bank is not liable in any action brought under this section for a violation of this subpart if the bank demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error, notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.
(2)
Examples.
Examples of a bona fide error include clerical, calculation, computer malfunction and programming, and printing errors, except that an error of legal judgment with respect to the bank's obligation under this subpart is not a bona fide error.
(d)
Jurisdiction.
Any action under this section may be brought in any United States district court or in any other court of competent jurisdiction, and shall be brought within one year after the date of the occurrence of the violation involved.
(e)
Reliance on Board rulings.
No provision of this subpart imposing any liability shall apply to any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any rule, regulation, or interpretation thereof by the Board, regardless of whether such rule, regulation, or interpretation is amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason after the act or omission has occurred.
(f)
Exclusions.
This section does not apply to claims that arise under subpart C of this part or to actions for wrongful dishonor.
(g)
Record retention.
(1) A bank shall retain evidence of compliance with the requirements imposed by this subpart for not less than two years. Records may be stored by use of microfiche, microfilm, magnetic tape, or other methods capable of accurately retaining and reproducing information.
(2) If a bank has actual notice that it is being investigated, or is subject to an enforcement proceeding by an agency charged with monitoring that bank's compliance with the EFA Act and this subpart, or has been served with notice of an action filed under
this section, it shall retain the records pertaining to the action or proceeding pending final disposition of the matter, unless an earlier time is allowed by order of the agency or court.

§ 229.31
Paying bank's responsibility for return of checks and notices of nonpayment.
(a)
Return of checks.

(2) A paying bank that is unable to identify the depositary bank with respect to a check may send the returned check to any bank that handled the check for forward collection and must advise the bank to which the check is sent that the paying bank is unable to identify the depositary bank.
(3) A paying bank may convert a check to a qualified returned check. A qualified returned check shall be encoded in magnetic ink with the routing number of the depositary bank, the amount of the returned check, and a “2” in the case of an original check (or a “5” in the case of a substitute check) in position 44 of the qualified return MICR line as a return identifier. A qualified returned original check shall be encoded in accordance with ANS X9.13, and a qualified returned substitute check shall be encoded in accordance with ANS X9.100-140.
(4) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, this section does not affect a paying bank's responsibility to return a check within the deadlines required by the UCC or Regulation J (12 CFR part 210).
(b)
Expeditious return of checks.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, if a paying bank determines not to pay a check, it shall return the check in an expeditious manner such that the check would normally be received by the depositary bank not later than 2 p.m. (local time of the depositary bank) on the second business day following the banking day on which the check was presented to the paying bank.
(2) If the second business day following the banking day on which the check was presented to the paying bank is not a banking day for the depositary bank, the paying bank satisfies the expeditious return requirement if it sends the returned check in a manner such that the depositary bank would normally receive the returned check not later than 2 p.m. (local time of the depositary bank) on the depositary bank's next banking day.
(c)
Notice of nonpayment.
(1) If a paying bank determines not to pay a check in the amount of $5,000 or more, it shall provide notice of nonpayment such that the notice would normally be received by the depositary bank not later than 2 p.m. (local time of the depositary bank) on the second business day following the banking day on which the check was presented to the paying
bank. If the day the paying bank is required to provide notice is not a banking day for the depositary bank, receipt of notice not later than 2 p.m. (local time of the depositary bank) on the depositary bank's next banking day constitutes timely notice. Notice may be provided by any reasonable means, including the returned check, a writing (including a copy of the check), or telephone.
(2)(i) To the extent available to the paying bank, notice must include the information contained in the check's MICR line when the check is received by the paying bank, as well as—
(A) Name of the payee(s);
(B) Amount;
(C) Date of the indorsement of the depositary bank;
(D) The bank name, routing number, and trace or sequence number associated with the indorsement of the depositary bank; and

(d)
Exceptions to the expeditious return of checks and notice of nonpayment requirements.
The expeditious return and notice of nonpayment requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section do not apply if—
(1) The check is deposited in a depositary bank that is not subject to subpart B of this part; or
(2) A paying bank is unable to identify the depositary bank with respect to the check.
(e)
Identification of returned check.
A paying bank returning a check shall clearly indicate on the front of the check that it is a returned check and the reason for return. If the paying bank is returning a substitute check or an electronic returned check, the paying bank shall include this information such that the information would be retained on any subsequent substitute check.
(f)
Notice in Lieu of Return.
If a check is unavailable for return, the paying bank may send in its place a copy of the front and back of the returned check, or, if no such copy is available, a written notice of nonpayment containing the information specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The copy or written notice shall clearly state that it constitutes a notice in lieu of return. A notice in lieu of return is considered a returned check subject to the requirements of this subpart.

Extension of deadline.
The deadline for return or notice of dishonor or nonpayment under the UCC or Regulation J (12 CFR part 210), or § 229.36(d)(3) and (4) is extended to the time of dispatch of such return or notice if the depositary bank (or the receiving bank, if the depositary bank is unidentifiable) receives the returned check or notice—
(1) On or before the depositary bank's (or receiving bank's) next banking day following the otherwise applicable deadline by the earlier of the close of that banking day or a cutoff hour of 2 p.m. (local time of the depositary bank or receiving bank) or later set by the depositary bank (or receiving bank) under UCC 4-108, for all deadlines other than those described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section; or

Payable-through and payable-at checks.
A check payable at or through a paying bank is considered to be drawn on that bank for purposes of the expeditious return and notice of nonpayment requirements of this subpart.
(i)
Reliance on routing number.
A paying bank may return a returned check based on any routing number designating the depositary bank appearing on the returned check in the depositary bank's indorsement.

(b)
Expeditious return of checks.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a returning bank shall return a returned check in an expeditious manner such that the check would normally be received by the depositary bank not later than 2 p.m. (local time of the depositary bank) on the second business day following the banking day on which the check was presented to the paying bank.
(2) If the second business day following the banking day on which the check was presented to the paying bank is not a banking day for the depositary bank, the returning bank satisfies the expeditious return requirement if it sends the returned check in a manner such that the depositary bank would normally receive the returned check not later than 2 p.m. (local time of the depositary bank) on the depositary bank's next banking day.
(c)
Exceptions to the expeditious return of checks.
The expeditious return requirement of paragraph (b) of this section does not apply if—

(f)
Charges.
A returning bank may impose a charge on a bank sending a returned check for handling the returned check.
(g)

Right to assert claim.
(1) A paying bank or returning bank may be liable to a depositary bank under § 229.38 for failing to return a check in an expeditious manner only if the depositary bank has arrangements in place such
that the paying bank or returning bank could return a returned check to the depositary bank electronically, directly or indirectly, by commercially reasonable means.
(2) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the depositary bank that has asserted a claim has the burden of proof for demonstrating that the depositary bank's arrangements meet the standard of paragraph (a)(1).

(iv) Any other form of payment acceptable to the returning bank or paying bank.

These payments are final when made.
(f)
Misrouted returned checks and written notices of nonpayment.
If a bank receives a returned check or written notice of nonpayment on the basis that it is the depositary bank, and the bank determines that it is not the depositary bank with respect to the check or notice, it shall either promptly send the returned check or notice to the depositary bank directly or by means of a returning bank agreeing to handle the returned check or notice, or send the check or notice back to the bank from which it was received.

(4) If a bank settles with another bank for checks presented, or for returned checks for which it is the depositary bank, in an amount exceeding the total amount of the checks, the settling bank may set off the excess settlement amount against subsequent settlements for checks presented, or for returned checks for which it is the depositary bank, that it receives from the other bank.

(f)
Remote deposit capture indemnity.
(1) The indemnity described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section is provided by a depositary bank that—
(i) Is a truncating bank under § 229.2(eee)(2) because it accepts deposit of an electronic image or other electronic information related to an original check;

(g)
Indemnities with respect to electronically-created items.

(2)(i) If a loss described in paragraph (f)(2) or (g) of this section results in whole or in part from the indemnified bank's negligence or failure to act in good faith, then the indemnity amount described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of negligence or bad faith attributable to the indemnified bank.
(ii) Nothing in this paragraph (i)(2) affects the rights of a person under the UCC or other applicable provision of state or federal law.
(j)
Tender of defense.
If a bank is sued for breach of a warranty or for indemnity under this section, it may give a prior bank in the collection or return chain written notice of the litigation, and the bank notified may then give similar notice to any other prior bank. If the notice states that the bank notified may come in and defend and that failure to do so will bind the bank notified in an action later brought by the bank giving the notice as to any determination of fact common to the two litigations, the bank notified is so bound unless after seasonable receipt of the notice the bank notified does come in and defend.
(k)
Notice of claim.
Unless a claimant gives notice of a claim for breach of warranty or for indemnity under this section to the bank that made the warranty or indemnification within 30 days after the claimant has reason to know of the breach or facts and circumstances giving rise to the indemnity and the identity of the warranting or indemnifying bank, the warranting or indemnifying bank is discharged to the extent of any loss caused by the delay in giving notice of the claim.
[82 FR 27581, June 15, 2017]
§ 229.35
Indorsements.
(a)
Indorsement standards.
A bank (other than a paying bank) that handles a check during forward collection or a returned check shall indorse the check in a manner that permits a person to interpret the indorsement, in accordance with American National Standard (ANS) Specifications for Physical Check Endorsements, X9.100-111 (ANS X9.100-111), for a paper check other than a substitute check; ANS Specifications for an Image Replacement Document, X9.100-140 (ANS X9.100-140), for a substitute check; and ANS Specifications for Electronic Exchange of Check and Image Data—Domestic, X9.100-187 (ANS X9.100-187), for an electronic check; unless the Board by rule or order determines that different standards apply or the parties otherwise agree.
(b)
Liability of bank handling check.
A bank that handles a check for forward collection or return is liable to any bank that subsequently handles the check to the extent that the subsequent bank does not receive payment for the check because of suspension of payments by another bank or otherwise. This paragraph applies whether or not a bank has placed its indorsement on the check. This liability is not affected by the failure of any bank to exercise ordinary care, but any bank failing to do so remains liable. A bank seeking recovery against a prior bank shall send notice to that prior bank reasonably promptly after it learns the facts entitling it to recover. A bank may recover from the bank with which it settled for the check by revoking the settlement, charging back any credit given to an account, or obtaining a refund. A bank may have the rights of a holder with respect to each check it handles.
(c)
Indorsement by a bank.
After a check has been indorsed by a bank, only a bank may acquire the rights of a holder—
(1) Until the check has been returned to the person initiating collection; or
(2) Until the check has been specially indorsed by a bank to a person who is not a bank.
(d)
Indorsement for depositary bank.
A depositary bank may arrange with another bank to apply the other bank's indorsement as the depositary bank indorsement, provided that any indorsement of the depositary bank on the check avoids the area reserved for the depositary bank indorsement as specified in the indorsement standard applicable to the check under paragraph (a) of this section. The other bank indorsing as depositary bank is
considered the depositary bank for purposes of subpart C of this part.
[53 FR 19433, May 27, 1988, as amended at 82 FR 27582, June 15, 2017]
§ 229.36
Presentment and issuance of checks.
(a)
Receipt of electronic checks.
The terms under which a paying bank will accept presentment of an electronic check is governed by the paying bank's agreement with the presenting bank.
(b)
Receipt of paper checks.
(1) A paper check is considered received by the paying bank when it is received—
(i) At a location to which delivery is requested by the paying bank;
(ii) At an address of the bank associated with the routing number on the check, whether contained in the MICR line or in fractional form;
(iii) At a branch, head office, or other location consistent with the name and address of the bank on the check if the bank is identified on the check by name and address; or
(iv) At any branch or head office, if the bank is identified on the check by name without address.
(2) A bank may require that checks presented to it as a paying bank be separated from returned checks.
(c)
Liability of bank during forward collection.
Settlements between banks for the forward collection of a check are final when made; however, a collecting bank handling a check for forward collection may be liable to a prior collecting bank, including the depositary bank, and the depositary bank's customer.
(d)
Same-day settlement.
(1) A paper check is considered presented, and a paying bank must settle for or return the check pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, if a presenting bank delivers the check in accordance with reasonable delivery requirements established by the paying bank and demands payment under this paragraph (d)—
(i) At a location designated by the paying bank for receipt of paper checks under this paragraph (d) at which the paying bank would be considered to have received the paper check under paragraph (b) of this section or, if no location is designated, at any location described in paragraph (b) of this section; and
(ii) By 8 a.m. on a business day (local time of the location described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section).
(2) A paying bank may require that paper checks presented for settlement pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section be separated from other forward-collection checks or returned checks.
(3) If presentment of a paper check meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the paying bank is accountable to the presenting bank for the amount of the check unless, by the close of Fedwire on the business day it receives the check, it either—
(i) Settles with the presenting bank for the amount of the check by credit to an account at a Federal Reserve Bank designated by the presenting bank; or
(ii) Returns the check.
(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(3) of this section, if a paying bank closes on a business day and receives presentment of a paper check on that day in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section—
(i) The paying bank is accountable to the presenting bank for the amount of the check unless, by the close of Fedwire on its next banking day, it either—
(A) Settles with the presenting bank for the amount of the check by credit to an account at a Federal Reserve Bank designated by the presenting bank; or
(B) Returns the check.
(ii) If the closing is voluntary, unless the paying bank settles for or returns the check in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section, it shall pay interest compensation to the presenting bank for each day after the business day on which the check was presented until the paying bank settles for the check, including the day of settlement.
[82 FR 27583, June 15, 2017]
§ 229.37
Variation by agreement.
The effect of the provisions of subpart C may be varied by agreement, except that no agreement can disclaim the responsibility of a bank for its own lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care, or can limit the measure
of damages for such lack or failure; but the parties may determine by agreement the standards by which such responsibility is to be measured if such standards are not manifestly unreasonable.
§ 229.38
Liability.
(a)
Standard of care; liability; measure of damages.
A bank shall exercise ordinary care and act in good faith in complying with the requirements of this subpart. A bank that fails to exercise ordinary care or act in good faith under this subpart may be liable to the depositary bank, the depositary bank's customer, the owner of a check, or another party to the check. The measure of damages for failure to exercise ordinary care is the amount of the loss incurred, up to the amount of the check, reduced by the amount of the loss that party would have incurred even if the bank had exercised ordinary care. A bank that fails to act in good faith under this subpart may be liable for other damages, if any, suffered by the party as a proximate consequence. Subject to a bank's duty to exercise ordinary care or act in good faith in choosing the means of return or notice of nonpayment, the bank is not liable for the insolvency, neglect, misconduct, mistake, or default of another bank or person, or for loss or destruction of a check or notice of nonpayment in transit or in the possession of others. This section does not affect a paying bank's liability to its customer under the U.C.C. or other law.
(b)
Paying bank's failure to make timely return.
If a paying bank fails both to comply with its expeditious return requirements under § 229.31(b) and with the deadline for return under the UCC, Regulation J (12 CFR part 210), or the extension of deadline under § 229.31(g) in connection with a single nonpayment of a check, the paying bank shall be liable under either § 229.31(b) or such other provision, but not both.
(c)
Comparative negligence.
If a person, including a bank, fails to exercise ordinary care or act in good faith under this subpart in indorsing a check (§ 229.35), accepting a returned check or notice of nonpayment (§ 229.33(b), (c), and (d)), or otherwise, the damages incurred by that person under § 229.38(a) shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence or bad faith attributable to that person.
(d)
Responsibility for certain aspects of checks.
(1) A paying bank, or in the case of a check payable through the paying bank and payable by another bank, the bank by which the check is payable, is responsible for damages under paragraph (a) of this section to the extent that the condition of the check when issued by it or its customer adversely affects the ability of a bank to indorse the check legibly in accordance with § 229.35. A depositary bank is responsible for damages under paragraph (a) of this section to the extent that the condition of the back of a check arising after the issuance of the check and prior to acceptance of the check by it adversely affects the ability of a bank to indorse the check legibly in accordance with § 229.35. A reconverting bank is responsible for damages under paragraph (a) of this section to the extent that the condition of the back of a substitute check transferred, presented, or returned by it—
(i) Adversely affects the ability of a subsequent bank to indorse the check legibly in accordance with § 229.35; or
(ii) Causes an indorsement that previously was applied in accordance with § 229.35 to become illegible.
(2) Responsibility under this paragraph (d) shall be treated as negligence of the paying bank, depositary bank, or reconverting bank for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section.
(e)
Timeliness of action.
If a bank is delayed in acting beyond the time limits set forth in this subpart because of interruption of communication or computer facilities, suspension of payments by a bank, war, emergency conditions, failure of equipment, or other circumstances beyond its control, its time for acting is extended for the time necessary to complete the action, if it exercises such diligence as the circumstances require.
(f)
Exclusion.
Section 229.21 of this part and section 611 (a), (b), and (c) of the EFA Act (12 U.S.C. 4010 (a), (b), and (c)) do not apply to this subpart.
(g)
Jurisdiction.
Any action under this subpart may be brought in any United States district court, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction, and
shall be brought within one year after the date of the occurrence of the violation involved.
(h)
Reliance on Board rulings.
No provision of this subpart imposing any liability shall apply to any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any rule, regulation, or interpretation thereof by the Board, regardless of whether the rule, regulation, or interpretation is amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason after the act or omission has occurred.
(i)
Presumption of Alteration
—(1)
Presumption.
Subject to paragraphs (i)(2) and (3) of this section and in the absence of a Federal statute or regulation to the contrary, the presumption in this paragraph applies with respect to any dispute between banks arising under Federal or State law as to whether a substitute check or electronic check transferred between those banks contains an alteration or is derived from an original check that was issued with an unauthorized signature of the drawer. When such a dispute arises, there is a rebuttable presumption that the substitute check or electronic check contains an alteration.
(2)
Rebuttal of presumption.
The presumption of alteration may be overcome by proving by a preponderance of evidence that either the substitute check or electronic check does not contain an alteration, or that the substitute check or electronic check is derived from an original check that was issued with an unauthorized signature of the drawer.
(3)
Effect of producing original check.
If the original check is made available for examination by all banks involved in the dispute, the presumption in paragraph (i)(1) of this section shall no longer apply.

§ 229.39
Insolvency of bank.
(a)
Duty of receiver to return unpaid checks.
A check or returned check in, or coming into, the possession of a paying bank, collecting bank, depositary bank, or returning bank that suspends payment, and which is not paid, shall be returned by the receiver, trustee, or agent in charge of the closed bank to the bank or customer that transferred the check to the closed bank.
(b)
Claims against banks for checks not returned by receiver.
If a check or returned check is not returned by the receiver, trustee, or agent in charge of the closed bank under paragraph (a) of this section, a bank shall have claims with respect to the check or returned check as follows:
(1) If the paying bank has finally paid the check, or if a depositary bank is obligated to pay the returned check, and suspends payment without making a settlement for the check or returned check with the prior bank that is or becomes final, the prior bank has a claim against the paying bank or the depositary bank.
(2) If a collecting bank, paying bank, or returning bank receives settlement from a subsequent bank for a check or returned check, which settlement is or becomes final, and suspends payments without making a settlement for the check with the prior bank, which is or becomes final, the prior bank has a claim against the collecting bank or returning bank.
(c)
Preferred claim against presenting bank for breach of warranty.
If a paying bank settles with a presenting bank for one or more checks, and if the presenting bank breaches a warranty specified in § 229.34(c)(1) or (3) with respect to those checks and suspends payments before satisfying the paying bank's warranty claim, the paying bank has a preferred claim against the presenting bank for the amount of the warranty claim.
(d)
Finality of settlement.
If a paying bank or depositary bank gives, or a collecting bank, paying bank, or returning bank gives or receives, a settlement for a check or returned check and thereafter suspends payment, the suspension does not prevent or interfere with the settlement becoming final if such finality occurs automatically upon the lapse of a certain time or the happening of certain events.

Relation to State law.
The provisions of this subpart supersede any inconsistent provisions of the U.C.C. as adopted in any state, or of any other state law, but only to the extent of the inconsistency.
§ 229.42
Exclusions.
The expeditious return (§§ 229.31(b) and 229.32(b)), notice of nonpayment (§ 229.31(c)), and same-day settlement (§ 229.36(d)) requirements of this subpart do not apply to a check drawn upon the United States Treasury, to a U.S. Postal Service money order, or to a check drawn on a state or a unit of general local government that is not payable through or at a bank.

returns the substitute check or a paper or electronic representation of such substitute check and to any subsequent recipient, which could include a collecting or returning bank, the depositary bank, the drawer, the drawee, the payee, the depositor, and any indorser. These parties receive the warranties regardless of whether they received the substitute check or a paper or electronic representation of a substitute check.

(B) Interest and expenses (including costs and reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses of representation) related to the substitute check.
(2)
Comparative negligence.
(i) If a loss described in paragraph (a) of this section results in whole or in part from the indemnified person's negligence or failure to act in good faith, then the indemnity amount described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of negligence or bad faith attributable to the indemnified person.
(ii) Nothing in this paragraph (b)(2) reduces the rights of a consumer or any other person under the U.C.C. or other applicable provision of state or federal law.
(3)
Effect of producing the original check or a sufficient copy
—
(i) If an indemnifying bank produces the original check or a sufficient copy, the indemnifying bank shall—

(B) Have a right to the return of any funds it has paid under this section in excess of those losses.

(c)
Subrogation of rights
—(1)
In general.
An indemnifying bank shall be subrogated to the rights of the person that it indemnifies to the extent of the indemnity it has provided and may attempt to recover from another person based on a warranty or other claim.
(2)
Duty of indemnified person for subrogated claims.
Each indemnified person shall have a duty to comply with all reasonable requests for assistance from an indemnifying bank in connection with any claim the indemnifying bank brings against a warrantor or other person related to a check that forms the basis for the indemnification.
[69 FR 47311, Aug. 4, 2004, as amended at 82 FR 27585, June 15, 2017]
§ 229.54
Expedited recredit for consumers.
(a)
Circumstances giving rise to a claim.
A consumer may make a claim under this section for a recredit with respect to a substitute check if the consumer asserts in good faith that—
(1) The bank holding the consumer's account charged that account for a substitute check that was provided to the consumer (although the consumer need not be in possession of that substitute check at the time he or she submits a claim);
(2) The substitute check was not properly charged to the consumer account or the consumer has a warranty claim with respect to the substitute check;
(3) The consumer suffered a resulting loss; and
(4) Production of the original check or a sufficient copy is necessary to determine whether or not the substitute check in fact was improperly charged or whether the consumer's warranty claim is valid.
(b)
Procedures for making claims.
A consumer shall make his or her claim for a recredit under this section with the bank that holds the consumer's account in accordance with the timing, content, and form requirements of this section.
(1)
Timing of claim.
(i) The consumer shall submit his or her claim such that the bank receives the claim by the end of the 40th calendar day after the later of the calendar day on which the bank mailed or delivered, by a means agreed to by the consumer—
(A) The periodic account statement that contains information concerning the transaction giving rise to the claim; or
(B) The substitute check giving rise to the claim.
(ii) If the consumer cannot submit his or her claim by the time specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section because of extenuating circumstances, the bank shall extend the 40-calendar-day period by an additional reasonable amount of time.
(iii) If a consumer makes a claim orally and the bank requires the claim to be in writing, the consumer's claim is timely if the oral claim was received within the time described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)-(ii) of this section and the written claim was received within the time described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.
(2)
Content of claim.
(i) The consumer's claim shall include the following information:
(A) A description of the consumer's claim, including the reason why the consumer believes his or her account was improperly charged for the substitute check or the nature of his or her warranty claim with respect to such check;
(B) A statement that the consumer suffered a loss and an estimate of the amount of that loss;
(C) The reason why production of the original check or a sufficient copy is necessary to determine whether or not the charge to the consumer's account was proper or the consumer's warranty claim is valid; and
(D) Sufficient information to allow the bank to identify the substitute check and investigate the claim.
(ii) If a consumer attempts to make a claim but fails to provide all the information in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section that is required to constitute a claim, the bank shall inform the consumer that the claim is not complete and identify the information that is missing.
(3)
Form and submission of claim; computation of time for bank action.
The bank holding the account that is the subject of the consumer's claim may, in its discretion, require the consumer to submit the information required by this section in writing. A bank that requires a written submission—
(i) May permit the consumer to submit the written claim electronically;
(ii) Shall inform a consumer who submits a claim orally of the written claim requirement at the time of the oral claim and may require such consumer to submit the written claim such that the bank receives the written claim by the 10th business day after the banking day on which the bank received the oral claim; and
(iii) Shall compute the time periods for acting on the consumer's claim described in paragraph (c) of this section from the date on which the bank received the written claim.
(c)
Action on claims.
A bank that receives a claim that meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section shall act as follows:
(1)
Valid consumer claim.
If the bank determines that the consumer's claim is valid, the bank shall—
(i) Recredit the consumer's account for the amount of the consumer's loss, up to the amount of the substitute check, plus interest if the account is an interest-bearing account, no later than the end of the business day after the banking day on which the bank makes that determination; and
(ii) Send to the consumer the notice required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(2)
Invalid consumer claim.
If a bank determines that the consumer's claim is not valid, the bank shall send to the consumer the notice described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(3)
Recredit pending investigation.
If the bank has not taken an action described in paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section before the end of the 10th business day after the banking day on which the bank received the claim, the bank shall—
(i) By the end of that business day—
(A) Recredit the consumer's account for the amount of the consumer's loss, up to the lesser of the amount of the substitute check or $2,500, plus interest on that amount if the account is an interest-bearing account; and
(B) Send to the consumer the notice required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section; and
(ii) Recredit the consumer's account for the remaining amount of the consumer's loss, if any, up to the amount of the substitute check, plus interest if the account is an interest-bearing account, no later than the end of the 45th calendar day after the banking day on which the bank received the claim and send to the consumer the notice required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, unless the bank prior to that time has determined that the consumer's claim is or is not valid in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section.
(4)
Reversal of recredit.
A bank may reverse a recredit that it has made to a consumer account under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(3) of this section, plus interest that the bank has paid, if any, on that amount, if the bank—
(i) Determines that the consumer's claim was not valid; and
(ii) Notifies the consumer in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(d)
Availability of recredit
—(1)
Next-day availability.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a bank shall make any amount that it recredits to a consumer account under this section available for withdrawal no later than the start of the business day after the banking day on which the bank provides the recredit.
(2)
Safeguard exceptions.
A bank may delay availability to a consumer of a recredit provided under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section until the start of the earlier of the business day after the banking day on which the bank determines the consumer's claim is valid or the 45th calendar day after the banking day on which the bank received the oral or written claim, as required by paragraph (b) of this section, if—
(i) The consumer submits the claim during the 30-calendar-day period beginning on the banking day on which the consumer account was established;
(ii) Without regard to the charge that gave rise to the recredit claim—
(A) On six or more business days during the six-month period ending on the calendar day on which the consumer submitted the claim, the balance in the consumer account was negative or would have become negative if checks or other charges to the account had been paid; or
(B) On two or more business days during such six-month period, the balance in the consumer account was negative or would have become negative in the amount of $5,000 or more if checks or other charges to the account had been paid; or
(iii) The bank has reasonable cause to believe that the claim is fraudulent, based on facts that would cause a well-grounded belief in the mind of a reasonable person that the claim is fraudulent. The fact that the check in question or the consumer is of a particular class may not be the basis for invoking this exception.
(3)
Overdraft fees.
A bank that delays availability as permitted in paragraph
(d)(2) of this section may not impose an overdraft fee with respect to drafts drawn by the consumer on such recredited funds until the fifth calendar day after the calendar day on which the bank sent the notice required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(e)
Notices relating to consumer expedited recredit claims
—(1)
Notice of recredit.
A bank that recredits a consumer account under paragraph (c) of this section shall send notice to the consumer of the recredit no later than the business day after the banking day on which the bank recredits the consumer account. This notice shall describe—
(i) The amount of the recredit; and
(ii) The date on which the recredited funds will be available for withdrawal.
(2)
Notice that the consumer's claim is not valid.
If a bank determines that a substitute check for which a consumer made a claim under this section was in fact properly charged to the consumer account or that the consumer's warranty claim for that substitute check was not valid, the bank shall send notice to the consumer no later than the business day after the banking day on which the bank makes that determination. This notice shall—
(i) Include the original check or a sufficient copy, except as provided in § 229.58;
(ii) Demonstrate to the consumer that the substitute check was properly charged or the consumer's warranty claim is not valid; and
(iii) Include the information or documents (in addition to the original check or sufficient copy), if any, on which the bank relied in making its determination or a statement that the consumer may request copies of such information or documents.
(3)
Notice of a reversal of recredit.
A bank that reverses an amount it previously recredited to a consumer account shall send notice to the consumer no later than the business day after the banking day on which the bank made the reversal. This notice shall include the information listed in paragraph (e)(2) of this section and also describe—
(i) The amount of the reversal, including both the amount of the recredit (including the interest component, if any) and the amount of interest paid on the recredited amount, if any, being reversed; and
(ii) The date on which the bank made the reversal.
(f)
Other claims not affected.
Providing a recredit in accordance with this section shall not absolve the bank from liability for a claim made under any other provision of law, such as a claim for wrongful dishonor of a check under the U.C.C., or from liability for additional damages, such as damages under § 229.53 or § 229.56 of this subpart or U.C.C. 4-402.
§ 229.55
Expedited recredit for banks.
(a)
Circumstances giving rise to a claim.
A bank that has an indemnity claim under § 229.53 with respect to a substitute check may make an expedited recredit claim against an indemnifying bank if—
(1) The claimant bank or a bank that the claimant bank has indemnified—
(i) Has received a claim for expedited recredit from a consumer under § 229.54; or
(ii) Would have been subject to such a claim if the consumer account had been charged for the substitute check;
(2) The claimant bank is obligated to provide an expedited recredit with respect to such substitute check under § 229.54 or otherwise has suffered a resulting loss; and
(3) The production of the original check or a sufficient copy is necessary to determine the validity of the charge to the consumer account or the validity of any warranty claim connected with such substitute check.
(b)
Procedures for making claims.
A claimant bank shall send its claim to the indemnifying bank, subject to the timing, content, and form requirements of this section.
(1)
Timing of claim.
The claimant bank shall submit its claim such that the indemnifying bank receives the claim by the end of the 120th calendar day after the date of the transaction that gave rise to the claim.
(2)
Content of claim.
The claimant bank's claim shall include the following information—
(i) A description of the consumer's claim or the warranty claim related to the substitute check, including why
the bank believes that the substitute check may not be properly charged to the consumer account;
(ii) A statement that the claimant bank is obligated to recredit a consumer account under § 229.54 or otherwise has suffered a loss and an estimate of the amount of that recredit or loss, including interest if applicable;
(iii) The reason why production of the original check or a sufficient copy is necessary to determine the validity of the charge to the consumer account or the warranty claim; and
(iv) Sufficient information to allow the indemnifying bank to identify the substitute check and investigate the claim.
(3)
Requirements relating to copies of substitute checks.
If the information submitted by a claimant bank under paragraph (b)(2) of this section includes a copy of any substitute check, the claimant bank shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the copy cannot be mistaken for the legal equivalent of the check under § 229.51(a) or sent or handled by any bank, including the indemnifying bank, for forward collection or return.
(4)
Form and submission of claim; computation of time.
The indemnifying bank may, in its discretion, require the claimant bank to submit the information required by this section in writing, including a copy of the paper or electronic claim submitted by the consumer, if any. An indemnifying bank that requires a written submission—
(i) May permit the claimant bank to submit the written claim electronically;
(ii) Shall inform a claimant bank that submits a claim orally of the written claim requirement at the time of the oral claim; and
(iii) Shall compute the 10-day time period for acting on the claim described in paragraph (c) of this section from the date on which the bank received the written claim.

(1) Recredit the claimant bank for the amount of the claim, up to the amount of the substitute check, plus interest if applicable;
(2) Provide to the claimant bank the original check or a sufficient copy; or
(3) Provide information to the claimant bank regarding why the indemnifying bank is not obligated to comply with paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section.
(d)
Recredit does not abrogate other liabilities.
Providing a recredit to a claimant bank under this section does not absolve the indemnifying bank from liability for claims brought under any other law or from additional damages under § 229.53 or § 229.56.
(e)
Indemnifying bank's right to a refund.
(1) If a claimant bank reverses a recredit it previously made to a consumer account under § 229.54 or otherwise receives reimbursement for a substitute check that formed the basis of its claim under this section, the claimant bank shall provide a refund promptly to any indemnifying bank that previously advanced funds to the claimant bank. The amount of the refund to the indemnifying bank shall be the amount of the reversal or reimbursement obtained by the claimant bank, up to the amount previously advanced by the indemnifying bank.
(2) If the indemnifying bank provides the claimant bank with the original check or a sufficient copy under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, § 229.53(b)(3) governs the indemnifying bank's entitlement to repayment of any amount provided to the claimant bank that exceeds the amount of losses the claimant bank incurred up to that time.
§ 229.56
Liability.
(a)
Measure of damages
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section or § 229.53, any person that breaches a warranty described in § 229.52 or fails to comply with any requirement of this subpart with respect to any other person shall be liable to that person for an amount equal to the sum of—
(i) The amount of the loss suffered by the person as a result of the breach or failure, up to the amount of the substitute check; and
(ii) Interest and expenses (including costs and reasonable attorney's fees
and other expenses of representation) related to the substitute check.
(2)
Offset of recredits.
The amount of damages a person receives under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be reduced by any amount that the person receives and retains as a recredit under § 229.54 or § 229.55.
(3)
Comparative negligence.
(i) If a person incurs damages that resulted in whole or in part from that person's negligence or failure to act in good faith, then the amount of any damages due to that person under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of negligence or bad faith attributable to that person.
(ii) Nothing in this paragraph (a)(3) reduces the rights of a consumer or any other person under the U.C.C. or other applicable provision of federal or state law.
(b)
Timeliness of action.
Delay by a bank beyond any time limits prescribed or permitted by this subpart is excused if the delay is caused by interruption of communication or computer facilities, suspension of payments by another bank, war, emergency conditions, failure of equipment, or other circumstances beyond the control of the bank and if the bank uses such diligence as the circumstances require.
(c)
Jurisdiction.
A person may bring an action to enforce a claim under this subpart in any United States district court or in any other court of competent jurisdiction. Such claim shall be brought within one year of the date on which the person's cause of action accrues. For purposes of this paragraph, a cause of action accrues as of the date on which the injured person first learns, or by which such person reasonably should have learned, of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the cause of action, including the identity of the warranting or indemnifying bank against which the action is brought.
(d)
Notice of claims.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d), unless a person gives notice of a claim under this section to the warranting or indemnifying bank within 30 calendar days after the person has reason to know of both the claim and the identity of the warranting or indemnifying bank, the warranting or indemnifying bank is discharged from liability in an action to enforce a claim under this subpart to the extent of any loss caused by the delay in giving notice of the claim. A timely recredit claim by a consumer under § 229.54 constitutes timely notice under this paragraph.
§ 229.57
Consumer awareness.
(a)
General disclosure requirement and content.
Each bank shall provide, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, a brief disclosure to each of its consumer customers that describes—
(1) That a substitute check is the legal equivalent of an original check; and
(2) The consumer recredit rights that apply when a consumer in good faith believes that a substitute check was not properly charged to his or her account.
(b)
Distribution
—(1)
Disclosure to consumers who receive paid checks with periodic account statements.
A bank shall provide the disclosure described in paragraph (a) of this section to a consumer customer who receives paid original checks or paid substitute checks with his or her periodic account statement—
(i) No later than the first regularly scheduled communication with the consumer after October 28, 2004, for each consumer who is a customer of the bank on that date; and
(ii) At the time the customer relationship is initiated, for each customer relationship established after October 28, 2004.
(2)
Disclosure to consumers who receive substitute checks on an occasional basis
—(i) The bank shall provide the disclosure described in paragraph (a) of this section to a consumer customer of the bank who requests an original check or a copy of a check and receives a substitute check. If feasible, the bank shall provide this disclosure at the time of the consumer's request; otherwise, the bank shall provide this disclosure no later than the time at which the bank provides a substitute check in response to the consumer's request.
(ii) The bank shall provide the disclosure described in paragraph (a) of this section to a consumer customer of the
bank who receives a returned substitute check, at the time the bank provides such substitute check.
(3)
Multiple account holders.
A bank need not give separate disclosures to each customer on a jointly held account.
§ 229.58
Mode of delivery of information.
A bank may deliver any notice or other information that it is required to provide under this subpart by United States mail or by any other means through which the recipient has agreed to receive account information. If a bank is required to provide an original check or a sufficient copy, the bank instead may provide an electronic image of the original check or sufficient copy if the recipient has agreed to receive that information electronically.
§ 229.59
Relation to other law.
The Check 21 Act and this subpart supersede any provision of federal or state law, including the Uniform Commercial Code, that is inconsistent with the Check 21 Act or this subpart, but only to the extent of the inconsistency.
§ 229.60
Variation by agreement.
Any provision of § 229.55 may be varied by agreement of the banks involved. No other provision of this subpart may be varied by agreement by any person or persons.
Pt. 229, App. A

# Appendix A to Part 229—Routing Number Guide to Next-Day Availability Checks and Local Checks
A. Each bank is assigned a routing number by an agent of the American Bankers Association. The routing number takes two forms: a fractional form and a nine-digit form. A paying bank generally is identified on the face of a check by its routing number in both the fractional form (which generally appears in the upper right-hand corner of the check) and the nine-digit form (which is printed in magnetic ink along the bottom of the check). Where a check is payable by one bank but payable through another bank, the routing number appearing on the check is that of the payable-through bank, not the payor bank.
B. The first four digits of the nine-digit routing number (and the denominator of the fractional routing number) form the “Federal Reserve routing symbol,” and the first two digits of the routing number identify the Federal Reserve District in which the bank is located. Thus, 01 will be the first two digits of the routing number of a bank in the First Federal Reserve District (Boston), and 12 will be the first two digits of the routing number of a bank in the Twelfth District (San Francisco). Adding 2 to the first digit denotes a thrift institution. Thus, 21 identifies a thrift in the First District, and 32 denotes a thrift in the Twelfth District.
