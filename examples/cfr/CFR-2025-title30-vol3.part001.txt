(3) If the regulatory authority determines in writing that an alluvial valley does not exist pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, no further consideration of this section is required.
(b)
Applicability of statutory exclusions.
(1) If an alluvial valley floor is identified pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section and the proposed surface coal mining operation may affect this alluvial valley floor or waters that supply the alluvial valley floor, the applicant may request the regulatory authority, as a preliminary step in the permit application process, to separately determine the applicability of the statutory exclusions set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The regulatory authority may make such a determination based on the available data, may require additional data collection and analysis in order to make the determination, or may require the applicant to submit a complete permit application and not make the determination until after the complete application is evaluated.
(2) An applicant need not submit the information required in paragraphs (d)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section and a regulatory authority is not required to make the findings of paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section when the regulatory authority determines that one of the following circumstances, heretofore called statutory exclusions, exist:
(i) The premining land use is undeveloped rangeland which is not significant to farming;
(ii) Any farming on the alluvial valley floor that would be affected by the surface coal mining operation is of such small acreage as to be of negligible impact on the farm's agricultural production. Negligible impact of the proposed operation on farming will be based on the relative importance of the affected farmland areas of the alluvial valley floor area to the farm's total agricultural production over the life of the mine; or
(iii) The circumstances set forth in § 822.12(b) (3) or (4) of this chapter exist.
(3) For the purpose of this section, a farm is one or more land units on which farming is conducted. A farm is generally considered to be the combination of land units with acreage and boundaries in existence prior to August 3, 1977, or if established after August 3, 1977, with those boundaries based on enhancement of the farm's agricultural productivity and not related to surface coal operations.
(c)
Summary denial.
If the regulatory authority determines that the statutory exclusions are not applicable and that any of the required findings of paragraph (e)(2) of this section cannot be made, the regulatory authority may, at the request of the applicant:
(1) Determine that mining is precluded on the proposed permit area and deny the permit without the applicant filing any additional information required by this section; or
(2) Prohibit surface coal mining and reclamation operations in all or parts of the area to be affected by mining.
(d)
Application contents for operations affecting designated alluvial valley floors.
(1) If land within the permit area or adjacent area is identified as an alluvial valley floor and the proposed surface coal mining operation may affect an alluvial valley floor or waters supplied to an alluvial valley floor, the applicant shall submit a complete application for the proposed surface coal mining and reclamation operations to be used by the regulatory authority together with other relevant information as a basis for approval or denial of the permit. If an exclusion of paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies, then the applicant need not submit the information required in paragraphs (d)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section.
(2) The complete application shall include detailed surveys and baseline data required by the regulatory authority for a determination of—
(i) The essential hydrologic functions of the alluvial valley floor which might be affected by the mining and reclamation process. The information required by this subparagraph shall evaluate those factors which contribute to the collecting, storing, regulating and making the natural flow of water available for agricultural activities on the alluvial valley floor and shall include, but are not limited to:
(A) Factors contributing to the function of collecting water, such as amount, rate and frequency of rainfall and runoff, surface roughness, slope and vegetative cover, infiltration, and evapotranspiration, relief, slope and density of drainage channels;
(B) Factors contributing to the function of storing water, such as permeability, infiltration, porosity, depth and direction of ground water flow, and water holding capacity;
(C) Factors contributing to the function of regulating the flow of surface and ground water, such as the longitudinal profile and slope of the valley and channels, the sinuosity and cross-sections of the channels, interchange of water between streams and associated alluvial and bedrock aquifers, and rates and amount of water supplied by these aquifers; and
(D) Factors contributing to water availability, such as the presence of flood plains and terraces suitable for agricultural activities.
(ii) Whether the operation will avoid during mining and reclamation the interruption, discontinuance, or preclusion of farming on the alluvial valley floor;
(iii) Whether the operation will cause material damage to the quantity or quality of surface or ground waters supplied to the alluvial valley floor;
(iv) Whether the reclamation plan is in compliance with requirements of the Act, this chapter, and regulatory program; and
(v) Whether the proposed monitoring system will provide sufficient information to measure compliance with part 822 of this chapter during and after mining and reclamation operations.
(e)
Findings.
(1) The findings of paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section are not required with regard to alluvial valley floors to which are applicable any of the exclusions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(2) No permit or permit revision application for surface coal mining and reclamation operations on lands located west of the 100th meridian west longitude shall be approved by the regulatory authority unless the application demonstrates and the regulatory authority finds in writing, on the basis of information set forth in the application, that—
(i) The proposed operations will not interrupt, discontinue, or preclude farming on an alluvial valley floor;
(ii) The proposed operations will not materially damage the quantity or quality of water in surface and underground water systems that supply alluvial valley floors; and
(iii) The proposed operations will comply with part 822 of this chapter and the other applicable requirements of the Act and the regulatory program.

(a) After a permit application under subchapter G of this chapter has been approved, but before a permit is issued, the applicant shall file with the regulatory authority, on a form prescribed and furnished by the regulatory authority, a bond or bonds for performance made payable to the regulatory authority and conditioned upon the faithful performance of all the requirements of the Act, the regulatory program, the permit, and the reclamation plan.
(b)(1) The bond or bonds shall cover the entire permit area, or an identified increment of land within the permit area upon which the operator will initiate and conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations during the initial term of the permit.
(2) As surface coal mining and reclamation operations on succeeding increments are initiated and conducted within the permit area, the permittee shall file with the regulatory authority an additional bond or bonds to cover such increments in accordance with this section.
(3) The operator shall identify the initial and successive areas or increments for bonding on the permit application map submitted for approval as provided in the application (under
parts 780 and 784 of this chapter), and shall specify the bond amount to be provided for each area or increment.
(4) Independent increments shall be of sufficient size and configuration to provide for efficient reclamation operations should reclamation by the regulatory authority become necessary pursuant to § 800.50.
(c) An operator shall not disturb any surface areas, succeeding increments, or extend any underground shafts, tunnels or operations prior to acceptance by the regulatory authority of the required performance bond.
(d) The applicant shall file, with the approval of the regulatory authority, a bond or bonds under one of the following schemes to cover the bond amounts for the permit area as determined in accordance with § 800.14:
(1) A performance bond or bonds for the entire permit area;
(2) A cumulative bond schedule and the performance bond required for full reclamation of the initial area to be disturbed; or
(3) An incremental bond schedule and the performance bond required for the first increment in the schedule.
(e) OSM may approve, as part of a State or Federal program, an alternative bonding system, if it will achieve the following objectives and purposes of the bonding program:
(1) The alternative must assure that the regulatory authority will have available sufficient money to complete the reclamation plan for any areas which may be in default at any time; and
(2) The alternative must provide a substantial economic incentive for the permittee to comply with all reclamation provisions.

§ 800.13
Period of liability.
(a)(1) Performance bond liability shall be for the duration of the surface coal mining and reclamation operation and for a period which is coincident with the operator's period of extended responsibility for successful revegetation provided in § 816.116 or § 817.116 of this chapter or until achievement of the reclamation requirements of the Act, regulatory programs, and permit, whichever is later.
(2) With the approval of regulatory authority, a bond may be posted and approved to guarantee specific phases of reclamation within the permit area provided the sum of phase bonds posted equals or exceeds the total amount required under §§ 800.14 and 800.15. The scope of work to be guaranteed and the liability assumed under each phase bond shall be specified in detail.
(b) Isolated and clearly defined portions of the permit area requiring extended liability may be separated from the original area and bonded separately with the approval of the regulatory authority. Such areas shall be limited in extent and not constitute a scattered, intermittent, or checkerboard pattern of failure. Access to the separated areas for remedial work may be included in the area under extended liability if deemed necessary by the regulatory authority.
(c) If the regulatory authority approves a long-term, intensive agricultural postmining land use, in accordance with § 816.133 or § 817.133 of this chapter, the applicable 5 or 10 year period of liability shall commence at the date of initial planting for such long-term agricultural use.
(d)(1) The bond liability of the permittee shall include only those actions which he or she is obligated to take under the permit, including completion of the reclamation plan, so that the land will be capable of supporting the postmining land use approved under § 816.133 or § 817.133 of this chapter.
(2) Implementation of an alternative postmining land use approved under
§§ 816.133(c) and 817.133(c) which is beyond the control of the permittee, need not be covered by the bond. Bond liability for prime farmland shall be as specified in § 800.40(c)(2).

§ 800.14
Determination of bond amount.
(a) The amount of the bond required for each bonded area shall:
(1) Be determined by the regulatory authority;
(2) Depend upon the requirements of the approved permit and reclamation plan;
(3) Reflect the probable difficulty of reclamation, giving consideration to such factors as topography, geology, hydrology, and revegetation potential; and
(4) Be based on, but not limited to, the estimated cost submitted by the permit applicant.
(b) The amount of the bond shall be sufficient to assure the completion of the reclamation plan if the work has to be performed by the regulatory authority in the event of forfeiture, and in no case shall the total bond initially posted for the entire area under one permit be less than $10,000.
(c) An operator's financial responsibility under § 817.121(c) of this chapter for repairing material damage resulting from subsidence may be satisfied by the liability insurance policy required under § 800.60.
[48 FR 32959, July 19, 1983, as amended at 81 FR 93381, Dec. 20, 2016; 82 FR 54972, Nov. 17, 2017]
§ 800.15
Adjustment of amount.
(a) The amount of the bond or deposit required and the terms of the acceptance of the applicant's bond shall be adjusted by the regulatory authority from time to time as the area requiring bond coverage is increased or decreased or where the cost of future reclamation changes. The regulatory authority may specify periodic times or set a schedule for reevaluating and adjusting the bond amount to fulfill this requirement.
(b) The regulatory authority shall—
(1) Notify the permittee, the surety, and any person with a property interest in collateral who has requested notification under § 800.21(f) of any proposed adjustment to the bond amount; and
(2) Provide the permittee an opportunity for an informal conference on the adjustment.
(c) A permittee may request reduction of the amount of the performance bond upon submission of evidence to the regulatory authority proving that the permittee's method of operation or other circumstances reduces the estimated cost for the regulatory authority to reclaim the bonded area. Bond adjustments which involve undisturbed land or revision of the cost estimate of reclamation are not considered bond release subject to procedures of § 800.40.
(d) In the event that an approved permit is revised in accordance with subchapter G of this chapter, the regulatory authority shall review the bond for adequacy and, if necessary, shall require adjustment of the bond to conform to the permit as revised.

§ 800.16
General terms and conditions of bond.
(a) The performance bond shall be in an amount determined by the regulatory authority as provided in § 800.14.
(b) The performance bond shall be payable to the regulatory authority.
(c) The performance bond shall be conditioned upon faithful performance of all the requirements of the Act, this chapter, the regulatory program, and the approved permit, including completion of the reclamation plan.

(e)(1) The bond shall provide a mechanism for a bank or surety company to give prompt notice to the regulatory authority and the permittee of any action filed alleging the insolvency or bankruptcy of the surety company, the bank, or the permittee, or alleging any violations which would result in suspension or revocation of the surety or bank charter or license to do business.
(2) Upon the incapacity of a bank or surety company by reason of bankruptcy, insolvency, or suspension or revocation of a charter or license, the
permittee shall be deemed to be without bond coverage and shall promptly notify the regulatory authority. The regulatory authority, upon notification received through procedures of paragraph (e)(1) of this section or from the permittee, shall, in writing, notify the operator who is without bond coverage and specify a reasonable period, not to exceed 90 days, to replace bond coverage. If an adequate bond is not posted by the end of the period allowed, the operator shall cease coal extraction and shall comply with the provisions of § 816.132 or § 817.132 of this chapter and shall immediately begin to conduct reclamation operations in accordance with the reclamation plan. Mining operations shall not resume until the regulatory authority has determined that an acceptable bond has been posted.

(1) The period of liability for every bond covering long-term surface disturbances shall commence with the issuance of a permit, except that to the extent that such disturbances will occur on a succeeding increment to be bonded, such liability will commence upon the posting of the bond for that increment before the initial surface disturbance of that increment. The liability period shall extend until all reclamation, restoration, and abatement work under the permit has been completed and the bond is released under the provisions of § 800.40, or until the bond has been replaced or extended in accordance with § 800.17(b)(3).
(2) Long-term surface disturbances shall include long-term coal-related surface facilities and structures, and surface impacts incident to underground coal mining, which disturb an area for a period that exceeds 5 years. Long-term surface disturbances include, but are not limited to: surface features of shafts and slope facilities, coal refuse areas, powerlines, bore-holes, ventilation shafts, preparation plants, machine shops, roads, and loading and treatment facilities.
(3) To achieve continuous bond coverage for long-term surface disturbances, the bond shall be conditioned upon extension, replacement, or payment in full, 30 days prior to the expiration of the bond term.
(4) Continuous bond coverage shall apply throughout the period of extended responsibility for successful revegetation and until the provisions of § 800.40 have been met.
(c)
Bond forfeiture.
The regulatory authority shall take action to forfeit a bond pursuant to this section, if 30 days prior to bond expiration, the operator has not filed: (1) A performance bond for a new term as required for continuous coverage, or (2) a performance bond providing coverage for the period of liability, including the period of extended responsibility for successful revegetation.

The list shall include—
(i) A description of the property;
(ii) The fair market value as determined by an independent appraisal conducted by a certified appraiser; and
(iii) Proof of possession and title to the real property.

(d) Cash accounts shall be subject to the following conditions:
(1) The regulatory authority may authorize the operator to supplement the bond through the establishment of a cash account in one or more federally-insured or equivalently protected accounts made payable upon demand to, or deposited directly with, the regulatory authority. The total bond including the cash account shall not be less than the amount required under terms of performance bonds including any adjustments, less amounts released in accordance with § 800.40.
(2) Any interest paid on a cash account shall be retained in the account and applied to the bond value of the account unless the regulatory authority has approved the payment of interest to the operator.
(3) Certificates of deposit may be substituted for a cash account with the approval of the regulatory authority.
(4) The regulatory authority shall not accept an individual cash account in an amount in excess of $100,000 or the maximum insurable amount as determined by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.
(e)(1) The estimated bond value of all collateral posted as assurance under this section shall be subject to a margin which is the ratio of bond value to market value, as determined by the
regulatory authority. The margin shall reflect legal and liquidation fees, as well as value depreciation, marketability, and fluctuations which might affect the net cash available to the regulatory authority to complete reclamation.

[48 FR 32959, July 19, 1983, as amended at 81 FR 93381, Dec. 20, 2016; 82 FR 54972, Nov. 17, 2017]
§ 800.40
Requirement to release performance bonds.
(a)
Bond release application.
(1) The permittee may file an application with the regulatory authority for the release of all or part of a performance bond. Applications may be filed only at times or during seasons authorized by the regulatory authority in order to properly evaluate the completed reclamation operations. The times or seasons appropriate for the evaluation of certain types of reclamation shall be established in the regulatory program or identified in the mining and reclamation plan required in subchapter G of this chapter and approved by the regulatory authority.
(2) Within 30 days after an application for bond release has been filed with the regulatory authority, the permittee shall submit a copy of an advertisement placed at least once a week for four successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the locality of the surface coal mining operation. The advertisement shall be considered part of any bond release application and shall contain the permittee's name, permit number and approval date, notification of the precise location of the land affected, the number of acres, the type and amount of the bond filed and the portion sought to be released, the type and appropriate dates of reclamation work performed, a description of the results achieved as they relate to the permittee's approved reclamation plan, and the name and address of the regulatory authority to which written comments, objections, or requests for public hearings and informal conferences on the specific bond release may be submitted pursuant to § 800.40 (f) and (h). In addition, as part of any bond release application, the permittee shall submit copies of letters which he or she has sent to adjoining property owners, local governmental bodies, planning agencies, sewage and water treatment authorities, and water companies in the locality in which the surface coal mining and reclamation operation took place, notifying them of the intention to seek release from the bond.
(3) The permittee shall include in the application for bond release a notarized
statement which certifies that all applicable reclamation activities have been accomplished in accordance with the requirements of the Act, the regulatory program, and the approved reclamation plan. Such certification shall be submitted for each application or phase of bond release.
(b)
Inspection by regulatory authority.
(1) Upon receipt of the bond release application, the regulatory authority shall, within 30 days, or as soon thereafter as weather conditions permit, conduct an inspection and evaluation of the reclamation work involved. The evaluation shall consider, among other factors, the degree of difficulty to complete any remaining reclamation, whether pollution of surface and subsurface water is occurring, the probability of future occurrence of such pollution, and the estimated cost of abating such pollution. The surface owner, agent, or lessee shall be given notice of such inspection and may participate with the regulatory authority in making the bond release inspection. The regulatory authority may arrange with the permittee to allow access to the permit area, upon request by any person with an interest in bond release, for the purpose of gathering information relevant to the proceeding.
(2) Within 60 days from the filing of the bond release application, if no public hearing is held pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, or, within 30 days after a public hearing has been held pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, the regulatory authority shall notify in writing the permittee, the surety or other persons with an interest in bond collateral who have requested notification under § 800.21(f), and the persons who either filed objections in writing or objectors who were a party to the hearing proceedings, if any, of its decision to release or not to release all or part of the performance bond.
(c) The regulatory authority may release all or part of the bond for the entire permit area or incremental area if the regulatory authority is satisfied that all the reclamation or a phase of the reclamation covered by the bond or portion thereof has been accomplished in accordance with the following schedules for reclamation of Phases I, II, and III:
(1) At the completion of Phase I, after the operator completes the backfilling, regrading (which may include the replacement of topsoil) and drainage control of a bonded area in accordance with the approved reclamation plan, 60 percent of the bond or collateral for the applicable area.
(2) At the completion of Phase II, after revegetation has been established on the regraded mined lands in accordance with the approved reclamation plan, an additional amount of bond. When determining the amount of bond to be released after successful revegetation has been established, the regulatory authority shall retain that amount of bond for the revegetated area which would be sufficient to cover the cost of reestablishing revegetation if completed by a third party and for the period specified for operator responsibility in section 515 of the Act for reestablishing revegetation. No part of the bond or deposit shall be released under this paragraph so long as the lands to which the release would be applicable are contributing suspended solids to streamflow or runoff outside the permit area in excess of the requirements set by section 515(b)(10) of the Act and by subchapter K of this chapter or until soil productivity for prime farmlands has returned to the equivalent levels of yield as nonmined land of the same soil type in the surrounding area under equivalent management practices as determined from the soil survey performed pursuant to section 507(b)(16) of the Act and part 823 of this chapter. Where a silt dam is to be retained as a permanent impoundment pursuant to subchapter K of this chapter, the Phase II portion of the bond may be released under this paragraph so long as provisions for sound future maintenance by the operator or the landowner have been made with the regulatory authority.
(3) At the completion of Phase III, after the operator has completed successfully all surface coal mining and reclamation activities, the release of the remaining portion of the bond, but not before the expiration of the period specified for operator responsibility in § 816.116 or § 817.116 of this chapter.
However, no bond shall be fully released under provisions of this section until reclamation requirements of the Act and the permit are fully met.
(d) If the regulatory authority disapproves the application for release of the bond or portion thereof, the regulatory authority shall notify the permittee, the surety, and any person with an interest in collateral as provided for in § 800.21(f), in writing, stating the reasons for disapproval and recommending corrective actions necessary to secure the release and allowing an opportunity for a public hearing.
(e) When any application for total or partial bond release is filed with the regulatory authority, the regulatory authority shall notify the municipality in which the surface coal mining operation is located by certified mail at least 30 days prior to the release of all or a portion of the bond.
(f) Any person with a valid legal interest which might be adversely affected by release of the bond, or the responsible officer or head of any Federal, State, or local governmental agency which has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental, social, or economic impact involved in the operation or which is authorized to develop and enforce environmental standards with respect to such operations, shall have the right to file written objections to the proposed release from bond with the regulatory authority within 30 days after the last publication of the notice required by § 800.40(a)(2). If written objections are filed and a hearing is requested, the regulatory authority shall inform all the interested parties of the time and place of the hearing, and shall hold a public hearing within 30 days after receipt of the request for the hearing. The date, time, and location of the public hearing shall be advertised by the regulatory authority in a newspaper of general circulation in the locality for two consecutive weeks.

§ 800.50
Forfeiture of bonds.
(a) If an operator refuses or is unable to conduct reclamation of an unabated violation, if the terms of the permit are not met, or if the operator defaults on the conditions under which the bond was accepted, the regulatory authority shall take the following action to forfeit all or part of a bond or bonds for any permit area or an increment of a permit area:
(1) Send written notification by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the permittee and the surety on the bond, if any, informing them of the determination to forfeit all or part of the bond, including the reasons for the forfeiture and the amount to be forfeited. The amount shall be based on the estimated total cost of achieving the reclamation plan requirements.
(2) Advise the permittee and surety, if applicable, of the conditions under
which forfeiture may be avoided. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to—
(i) Agreement by the permittee or another party to perform reclamation operations in accordance with a compliance schedule which meets the conditions of the permit, the reclamation plan, and the regulatory program and a demonstration that such party has the ability to satisfy the conditions; or
(ii) The regulatory authority may allow a surety to complete the reclamation plan, or the portion of the reclamation plan applicable to the bonded phase or increment, if the surety can demonstrate an ability to complete the reclamation in accordance with the approved reclamation plan. Except where the regulatory authority may approve partial release authorized under § 800.40, no surety liability shall be released until successful completion of all reclamation under the terms of the permit, including applicable liability periods of § 800.13.
(b) In the event forfeiture of the bond is required by this section, the regulatory authority shall—
(1) Proceed to collect the forfeited amount as provided by applicable laws for the collection of defaulted bonds or other debts if actions to avoid forfeiture have not been taken, or if rights of appeal, if any, have not been exercised within a time established by the regulatory authority, or if such appeal, if taken, is unsuccessful.
(2) Use funds collected from bond forfeiture to complete the reclamation plan, or portion thereof, on the permit area or increment, to which bond coverage applies.
(c) Upon default, the regulatory authority may cause the forfeiture of any and all bonds deposited to complete reclamation for which the bonds were posted. Unless specifically limited, as provided in § 800.11(b), bond liability shall extend to the entire permit area under conditions of forfeiture.
(d)(1) In the event the estimated amount forfeited is insufficient to pay for the full cost of reclamation, the operator shall be liable for remaining costs. The regulatory authority may complete, or authorize completion of, reclamation of the bonded area and may recover from the operator all costs of reclamation in excess of the amount forfeited.
(2) In the event the amount of performance bond forfeited was more than the amount necessary to complete reclamation, the unused funds shall be returned by the regulatory authority to the party from whom they were collected.

§ 816.22
Topsoil and subsoil.
(a)
Removal.
(1)(i) All topsoil shall be removed as a separate layer from the area to be disturbed, and segregated.
(ii) Where the topsoil is of insufficient quantity or poor quality for sustaining vegetation, the materials approved by the regulatory authority in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section shall be removed as a separate layer from the area to be disturbed, and segregated.
(2) If topsoil is less than 6 inches thick, the operator may remove the topsoil and the unconsolidated materials immediately below the topsoil and treat the mixture as topsoil.
(3) The regulatory authority may choose not to require the removal of topsoil for minor disturbances which—
(i) Occur at the site of small structures, such as power poles, signs, or fence lines; or
(ii) Will not destroy the existing vegetation and will not cause erosion.
(4)
Timing.
All material to be removed under this section shall be removed after the vegetative cover that would interfere with its salvage is cleared from the area to be disturbed, but before any drilling, blasting, mining, or other surface disturbance takes place.
(b)
Substitutes and supplements.
Selected overburden materials may be substituted for, or used as a supplement to topsoil if the operator demonstrates to the regulatory authority that the resulting soil medium is equal to, or more suitable for sustaining vegetation than, the existing topsoil, and the resulting soil medium is the best available in the permit area to support revegetation.
(c)
Storage.
(1) Materials removed under paragraph (a) of this section shall be segregated and stockpiled when it is impractical to redistribute such materials promptly on regraded areas.
(2) Stockpiled materials shall—
(i) Be selectively placed on a stable site within the permit area;
(ii) Be protected from contaminants and unnecessary compaction that would interfere with revegetation;
(iii) Be protected from wind and water erosion through prompt establishment and maintenance of an effective, quick growing vegetative cover or through other measures approved by the regulatory authority; and
(iv) Not be moved until required for redistribution unless approved by the regulatory authority.
(3) Where long-term surface disturbances will result from facilities such as support facilities and preparation plants and where stockpiling of materials removed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section would be detrimental to the quality or quantity of those materials, the regulatory authority may approve the temporary distribution of the soil materials so removed to an approved site within the permit area to enhance the current use of that site until needed for later reclamation, provided that—
(i) Such action will not permanently diminish the capability of the topsoil of the host site; and
(ii) The material will be retained in a condition more suitable for redistribution than if stockpiled.
(d)
Redistribution.
(1) Topsoil materials and topsoil substitutes and supplements removed under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be redistributed in a manner that—
(i) Achieves an approximately uniform, stable thickness when consistent with the approved postmining land use, contours, and surface-water drainage systems. Soil thickness may also be varied to the extent such variations help meet the specific revegetation goals identified in the permit;
(ii) Prevents excess compaction of the materials; and
(iii) Protects the materials from wind and water erosion before and after seeding and planting.
(2) Before redistribution of the material removed under paragraph (a) of this section the regraded land shall be treated if necessary to reduce potential slippage of the redistributed material and to promote root penetration. If no harm will be caused to the redistributed material and reestablished vegetation, such treatment may be conducted after such material is replaced.

§ 816.41
Hydrologic-balance protection.
(a)
General.
All surface mining and reclamation activities shall be conducted to minimize disturbance of the hydrologic balance within the permit and adjacent areas, to prevent material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area, to assure the protection or replacement of water rights, and to support approved postmining land uses in accordance with the terms and conditions of the approved permit and the performance standards of this part. The regulatory authority may require additional preventative, remedial, or monitoring measures to assure that material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area is prevented. Mining and reclamation practices that minimize water pollution and changes in flow shall be used in preference to water treatment.
(b)
Ground-water protection.
In order to protect the hydrologic balance, surface mining activities shall be conducted according to the plan approved under § 780.21(h) of this chapter and the following:
(1) Ground-water quality shall be protected by handling earth materials and runoff in a manner that minimizes acidic, toxic, or other harmful infiltration to ground-water systems and by managing excavations and other disturbances to prevent or control the discharge of pollutants into the ground water.
(2) Ground-water quantity shall be protected by handling earth materials and runoff in a manner that will restore the approximate premining recharge capacity of the reclaimed area as a whole, excluding coal mine waste disposal areas and fills, so as to allow the movement of water to the ground-water system.
(c)
Ground-water monitoring.
(1) Ground-water monitoring shall be conducted according to the ground-water monitoring plan approved under § 780.21(i) of this chapter. The regulatory authority may require additional monitoring when necessary.
(2) Ground-water monitoring data shall be submitted every 3 months to the regulatory authority or more frequently as prescribed by the regulatory authority. Monitoring reports shall include analytical results from each sample taken during the reporting period. When the analysis of any ground-water sample indicates noncompliance with the permit conditions, then the operator shall promptly notify the regulatory authority and immediately take the actions provided for in §§ 773.17(e) and 780.21(h) of this chapter.
(3) Ground-water monitoring shall proceed through mining and continue during reclamation until bond release. Consistent with the procedures of § 774.13 of this chapter, the regulatory authority may modify the monitoring requirements, including the parameters covered and the sampling frequency, if the operator demonstrates, using the monitoring data obtained under this paragraph, that—
(i) The operation has minimized disturbance to the hydrologic balance in the permit and adjacent areas and prevented material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area; water quantity and quality are suitable to support approved postmining land uses; and the water rights of other users have been protected or replaced; or
(ii) Monitoring is no longer necessary to achieve the purposes set forth in the monitoring plan approved under § 780.21(i) of this chapter.
(4) Equipment, structures, and other devices used in conjunction with monitoring the quality and quantity of ground water onsite and offsite shall be properly installed, maintained, and operated and shall be removed by the operator when no longer needed.
(d)
Surface-water protection.
In order to protect the hydrologic balance, surface mining activities shall be conducted according to the plan approved
under § 780.21(h) of this chapter, and the following:
(1) Surface-water quality shall be protected by handling earth materials, ground-water discharges, and runoff in a manner that minimizes the formation of acidic or toxic drainage; prevents, to the extent possible using the best technology currently available, additional contribution of suspended solids to streamflow outside the permit area; and otherwise prevents water pollution. If drainage control, restabilization and revegetation of disturbed areas, diversion of runoff, mulching, or other reclamation and remedial practices are not adequate to meet the requirements of this section and § 816.42, the operator shall use and maintain the necessary water-treatment facilities or water quality controls.

General.
Excess spoil shall be placed in designated disposal areas within the permit area, in a controlled manner to—
(1) Minimize the adverse effects of leachate and surface water runoff from the fill on surface and ground waters;
(2) Ensure mass stability and prevent mass movement during and after construction; and
(3) Ensure that the final fill is suitable for reclamation and revegetation compatible with the natural surroundings and the approved postmining land use.
(b)
Design certification.
(1) The fill and appurtenant structures shall be designed using current, prudent engineering practices and shall meet any design criteria established by the regulatory authority. A qualified registered professional engineer experienced in the design of earth and rock fills shall certify the design of the fill and appurtenant structures.
(2) The fill shall be designed to attain a minimum long-term static safety factor of 1.5. The foundation and abutments of the fill must be stable under all conditions of construction.
(c)
Location.
The disposal area shall be located on the most moderately sloping and naturally stable areas available, as approved by the regulatory authority, and shall be placed, where possible, upon or above a natural terrace, bench, or berm, if such placement provides additional stability and prevents mass movement.
(d)
Foundation.
(1) Sufficient foundation investigations, as well as any necessary laboratory testing of foundation material, shall be performed in order to determine the design requirements for foundation stability. The analyses of foundation conditions shall take into consideration the effect of underground mine workings, if any, upon the stability of the fill and appurtenant structures.
(2) Where the slope in the disposal area is in excess of 2.8h:1v (36 percent), or such lesser slope as may be designated by the regulatory authority based on local conditions, keyway cuts (excavations to stable bedrock) or rock toe buttresses shall be constructed to ensure stability of the fill. Where the toe of the spoil rests on a downslope, stability analyses shall be performed in accordance with § 780.35(c) of this chapter to determine the size of rock toe buttresses and keyway cuts.
(e)
Placement of excess spoil.
(1) All vegetative and organic materials shall be removed from the disposal area
prior to placement of the excess spoil. Topsoil shall be removed, segregated and stored or redistributed in accordance with § 816.22. If approved by the regulatory authority, organic material may be used as mulch or may be included in the topsoil to control erosion, promote growth of vegetation or increase the moisture retention of the soil.
(2) Excess spoil shall be transported and placed in a controlled manner in horizontal lifts not exceeding 4 feet in thickness; concurrently compacted as necessary to ensure mass stability and to prevent mass movement during and after construction; graded so that surface and subsurface drainage is compatible with the natural surroundings; and covered with topsoil or substitute material in accordance with § 816.22 of this chapter. The regulatory authority may approve a design which incorporates placement of excess spoil in horizontal lifts other than 4 feet in thickness when it is demonstrated by the operator and certified by a qualified registered professional engineer that the design will ensure the stability of the fill and will meet all other applicable requirements.
(3) The final configuration of the fill shall be suitable for the approved postmining land use. Terraces may be constructed on the outslope of the fill if required for stability, control of erosion, to conserve soil moisture, or to facilitate the approved postmining land use. The grade of the outslope between terrace benches shall not be steeper than 2h: 1v (50 percent).
(4) No permanent impoundments are allowed on the completed fill. Small depressions may be allowed by the regulatory authority if they are needed to retain moisture, minimize erosion, create and enhance wildlife habitat, or assist revegetation; and if they are not incompatible with the stability of the fill.
(5) Excess spoil that is acid- or toxic-forming or combustible shall be adequately covered with nonacid, nontoxic and noncombustible material, or treated, to control the impact on surface and ground water in accordance with § 816.41, to prevent sustained combustion, and to minimize adverse effects on plant growth and the approved postmining land use.
(f)
Drainage control.
(1) If the disposal area contains springs, natural or manmade water courses, or wet weather seeps, the fill design shall include diversions and underdrains as necessary to control erosion, prevent water infiltration into the fill, and ensure stability.
(2) Diversions shall comply with the requirements of § 816.43.
(3) Underdrains shall consist of durable rock or pipe, be designed and constructed using current, prudent engineering practices and meet any design criteria established by the regulatory authority. The underdrain system shall be designed to carry the anticipated seepage of water due to rainfall away from the excess spoil fill and from seeps and springs in the foundation of the disposal area and shall be protected from piping and contamination by an adequate filter. Rock underdrains shall be constructed of durable, nonacid-,nontoxic-forming rock (
e.g.,
natural sand and gravel, sandstone, limestone, or other durable rock) that does not slake in water or degrade to soil material, and which is free of coal, clay or other nondurable material. Perforated pipe underdrains shall be corrosion resistant and shall have characteristics consistent with the long-term life of the fill.
(g)
Surface area stabilization.
Slope protection shall be provided to minimize surface erosion at the site. All disturbed areas, including diversion channels that are not riprapped or otherwise protected, shall be revegetated upon completion of construction.
(h)
Inspections.
A qualified registered professional engineer, or other qualified professional specialist under the direction of the professional engineer, shall periodically inspect the fill during construction. The professional engineer or specialist shall be experienced in the construction of earth and rock fills.
(1) Such inspections shall be made at least quarterly throughout construction and during critical construction periods. Critical construction periods shall include at a minimum:
(i) Foundation preparation, including the removal of all organic material and
topsoil; (ii) placement of underdrains and protective filter systems; (iii) installation of final surface drainage systems; and (iv) the final graded and revegetated fill. Regular inspections by the engineer or specialist shall also be conducted during placement and compaction of fill materials.
(2) The qualified registered professional engineer shall provide a certified report to the regulatory authority promptly after each inspection that the fill has been constructed and maintained as designed and in accordance with the approved plan and this chapter. The report shall include appearances of instability, structural weakness, and other hazardous conditions.
(3)(i) The certified report on the drainage system and protective filters shall include color photographs taken during and after construction, but before underdrains are covered with excess spoil. If the underdrain system is constructed in phases, each phase shall be certified separately.
(ii) Where excess durable rock spoil is placed in single or multiple lifts such that the underdrain system is constructed simultaneously with excess spoil placement by the natural segregation of dumped materials, in accordance with § 816.73, color photographs shall be taken of the underdrain as the underdrain system is being formed.
(iii) The photographs accompanying each certified report shall be taken in adequate size and number with enough terrain or other physical features of the site shown to provide a relative scale to the photographs and to specifically and clearly identify the site.
(4) A copy of each inspection report shall be retained at or near the mine site.
(i)
Coal mine waste.
Coal mine waste may be disposed of in excess spoil fills if approved by the regulatory authority and, if such waste is—
(1) Placed in accordance with § 816.83;
(2) Nontoxic and nonacid forming; and
(3) Of the proper characteristics to be consistent with the design stability of the fill.
(j)
Underground disposal.
Excess spoil may be disposed of in underground mine workings, but only in accordance with a plan approved by the regulatory authority and MSHA under § 784.25 of this chapter.

§ 816.72
Disposal of excess spoil: Valley fills/head-of-hollow fills.
Valley fills and head-of-hollow fills shall meet the requirements of § 816.71 and the additional requirements of this section.
(a)
Drainage control.
(1) The top surface of the completed fill shall be graded such that the final slope after settlement will be toward properly designed drainage channels. Uncontrolled surface drainage may not be directed over the outslope of the fill.
(2) Runoff from areas above the fill and runoff from the surface of the fill shall be diverted into stabilized diversion channels designed to meet the requirements of § 816.43 and, in addition, to safely pass the runoff from a 100-year, 6-hour precipitation event.
(b)
Rock-core chimney drains.
A rock-core chimney drain may be used in a head-of-hollow fill, instead of the underdrain and surface diversion system normally required, as long as the fill is not located in an area containing intermittent or perennial streams. A rock-core chimney drain may be used in a valley fill if the fill does not exceed 250,000 cubic yards of material and upstream drainage is diverted around the fill. The alternative rock-core chimney drain system shall be incorporated into the design and construction of the fill as follows.
(1) The fill shall have, along the vertical projection of the main buried stream channel or rill, a vertical core of durable rock at least 16 feet thick which shall extend from the toe of the fill to the head of the fill, and from the base of the fill to the surface of the fill. A system of lateral rock underdrains shall connect this rock core to each area of potential drainage or seepage in the disposal area. The underdrain system and rock core shall be designed to carry the anticipated seepage of water due to rainfall away from the excess spoil fill and from seeps and springs in the foundation of the disposal area.
Rocks used in the rock core and underdrains shall meet the requirements of § 816.71(f).
(2) A filter system to ensure the proper long-term functioning of the rock core shall be designed and constructed using current, prudent engineering practices.
(3) Grading may drain surface water away from the outslope of the fill and toward the rock core. In no case, however, may intermittent or perennial streams be diverted into the rock core. The maximum slope of the top of the fill shall be 33h:1v (3 percent). A drainage pocket may be maintained at the head of the fill during and after construction, to intercept surface runoff and discharge the runoff through or over the rock drain, if stability of the fill is not impaired. In no case shall this pocket or sump have a potential capacity for impounding more than 10,000 cubic feet of water. Terraces on the fill shall be graded with a 3 to 5 percent grade toward the fill and a 1 percent slope toward the rock core.
[48 FR 32926, July 19, 1983, as amended at 81 FR 93392, Dec. 20, 2016; 82 FR 54979, Nov. 17, 2017]
§ 816.73

(2) Blend into and complement the drainage pattern of the surrounding terrain.
(b)
Performance standards.
Where thick overburden occurs within the permit area, the permittee at a minimum shall:
(1) Restore the approximate original contour and then use the remaining spoil and other waste materials to attain the lowest practicable grade, but not more than the angle of repose;
(2) Meet the requirements of §§ 816.102 (a)(2) through (j) of this part; and
(3) Dispose of any excess spoil in accordance with §§ 816.71 through 816.74 of this part.

Backfilling and grading: Previously mined areas.
(a) Remining operations on previously mined areas that contain a preexisting highwall shall comply with the requirements of §§ 816.102 through 816.107 of this chapter, except as provided in this section.
(b) The requirements of § 816.102(a) (1) and (2) requiring the elimination of highwalls shall not apply to remining operations where the volume of all reasonably available spoil is demonstrated in writing to the regulatory authority to be insufficient to completely backfill the reaffected or enlarged highwall. The highwall shall be eliminated to the maximum extent technically practical
in accordance with the following criteria:
(1) All spoil generated by the remining operation and any other reasonably available spoil shall be used to backfill the area. Reasonably available spoil in the immediate vicinity of the remining operation shall be included within the permit area.
(2) The backfill shall be graded to a slope which is compatible with the approved postmining land use and which provides adequate drainage and long-term stability.
(3) Any highwall remnant shall be stable and not pose a hazard to the public health and safety or to the environment. The operator shall demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority, that the highwall remnant is stable.
(4) Spoil placed on the outslope during previous mining operations shall not be disturbed if such disturbances will cause instability of the remaining spoil or otherwise increase the hazard to the public health and safety or to the environment.

[48 FR 40160, Sept. 2, 1983, as amended at 81 FR 93392, Dec. 20, 2016; 82 FR 54979, Nov. 17, 2017]
§ 816.114
Revegetation: Mulching and other soil stabilizing practices.
Suitable mulch and other soil stabilizing practices shall be used on all areas that have been regraded and covered by topsoil or topsoil substitutes. The regulatory authority may waive this requirement if seasonal, soil, or slope factors result in a condition where mulch and other soil stabilizing practices are not necessary to control erosion and to promptly establish an effective vegetative cover.
[48 FR 40160, Sept. 2, 1983, as amended at 81 FR 93392, Dec. 20, 2016; 82 FR 54979, Nov. 17, 2017]
§ 816.116
Revegetation: Standards for success.
(a) Success of revegetation shall be judged on the effectiveness of the vegetation for the approved postmining land use, the extent of cover compared to the cover occurring in natural vegetation of the area, and the general requirements of § 816.111.
(1) Standards for success and statistically valid sampling techniques for measuring success shall be selected by the regulatory authority, described in writing, and made available to the public.
(2) Standards for success shall include criteria representative of unmined lands in the area being reclaimed to evaluate the appropriate vegetation parameters of ground cover, production, or stocking. Ground cover, production, or stocking shall be considered equal to the approved success standard when they are not less than 90 percent of the success standard. The sampling techniques for measuring success shall use a 90-percent statistical confidence interval (
i.e.,
one-sided test with a 0.10 alpha error).
(b) Standards for success shall be applied in accordance with the approved postmining land use and, at a minimum, the following conditions:
(1) For areas developed for use as grazing land or pasture land, the ground cover and production of living plants on the revegetated area shall be at least equal to that of a reference area or such other success standards approved by the regulatory authority.
(2) For areas developed for use as cropland, crop production on the revegetated area shall be at least equal to that of a reference area or such other success standards approved by the regulatory authority.
(3) For areas to be developed for fish and wildlife habitat, recreation, undeveloped land, or forest products, success of vegetation shall be determined on the basis of tree and shrub stocking and vegetative ground cover. Such parameters are described as follows:
(i) Minimum stocking and planting arrangements shall be specified by the regulatory authority on the basis of local and regional conditions and after consultation with and approval by the State agencies responsible for the administration of forestry and wildlife programs. Consultation and approval may occur on either a programwide or a permit-specific basis.
(ii) Trees and shrubs that will be used in determining the success of stocking and the adequacy of the plant arrangement shall have utility for the approved postmining land use. Trees and shrubs counted in determining such success shall be healthy and have been in place for not less than two growing seasons. At the time of bond release, at least 80 percent of the trees and shrubs used to determine such success shall
have been in place for 60 percent of the applicable minimum period of responsibility. The requirements of this section apply to trees and shrubs that have been seeded or transplanted and can be met when records of woody vegetation planted show that no woody plants were planted during the last two growing seasons of the responsibility period and, if any replanting of woody plants took place during the responsibility period, the total number planted during the last 60 percent of that period is less than 20 percent of the total number of woody plants required. Any replanting must be by means of transplants to allow for adequate accounting of plant stocking. This final accounting may include volunteer trees and shrubs of approved species. Volunteer trees and shrubs of approved species shall be deemed equivalent to planted specimens two years of age or older and can be counted towards success. Suckers on shrubby vegetation can be counted as volunteer plants when it is evident the shrub community is vigorous and expanding.
(iii) Vegetative ground cover shall not be less than that required to achieve the approved postmining land use.
(4) For areas to be developed for industrial, commercial, or residential use less than 2 years after regrading is completed, the vegetative ground cover shall not be less than that required to control erosion.
(5) For areas previously disturbed by mining that were not reclaimed to the requirements of this subchapter and that are remined or otherwise redisturbed by surface coal mining operations, as a minimum, the vegetative ground cover shall be not less than the ground cover existing before redisturbance and shall be adequate to control erosion.
(c)(1) The period of extended responsibility for successful revegetation shall begin after the last year of augmented seeding, fertilizing, irrigation, or other work, excluding husbandry practices that are approved by the regulatory authority in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(2) In areas of more than 26.0 inches of annual average precipitation, the period of responsibility shall continue for a period of not less than:
(i) Five full years, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. The vegetation parameters identified in paragraph (b) of this section for grazing land, pasture land, or cropland shall equal or exceed the approved success standard during the growing season of any 2 years of the responsibility period, except the first year. Areas approved for the other uses identified in paragraph (b) of this section shall equal or exceed the applicable success standard during the growing season of the last year of the responsibility period.
(ii) Two full years for lands eligible for remining included in a permit for which a finding has been made under § 773.15(m) of this chapter. To the extent that the success standards are established by paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the lands must equal or exceed the standards during the growing season of the last year of the responsibility period.
(3) In areas of 26.0 inches or less average annual precipitation, the period of responsibility shall continue for a period of not less than:
(i) Ten full years, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) in this section. The vegetation parameters identified in paragraph (b) of this section for grazing land, pasture land, or cropland shall equal or exceed the approved success standard during the growing season of any two years after year six of the responsibility period. Areas approved for the other uses identified in paragraph (b) of this section shall equal or exceed the applicable success standard during the growing season of the last year of the responsibility period.
(ii) Five full years for lands eligible for remining included in a permit for which a finding has been made under § 773.15(m) of this chapter. To the extent that the success standards are established by paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the lands must equal or exceed the standards during the growing seasons of the last two consecutive years of the responsibility period.
(4) The regulatory authority may approve selective husbandry practices,
excluding augmented seeding, fertilization, or irrigation, provided it obtains prior approval from the Director in accordance with § 732.17 of this chapter that the practices are normal husbandry practices, without extending the period of responsibility for revegetation success and bond liability, if such practices can be expected to continue as part of the postmining land use or if discontinuance of the practices after the liability period expires will not reduce the probability of permanent revegetation success. Approved practices shall be normal husbandry practices within the region for unmined lands having land uses similar to the approved postmining land use of the disturbed area, including such practices as disease, pest, and vermin control; and any pruning, reseeding, and transplanting specifically necessitated by such actions.

§ 816.131
Cessation of operations: Temporary.
(a) Each person who conducts surface mining activities shall effectively secure surface facilities in areas in which there are no current operations, but in which operations are to be resumed under an approved permit. Temporary abandonment shall not relieve a person of their obligation to comply with any provisions of the approved permit.
(b) Before temporary cessation of mining and reclamation operations for a period of thirty days or more, or as soon as it is known that a temporary cessation will extend beyond 30 days, persons who conduct surface mining activities shall submit to the regulatory authority a notice of intention to cease or abandon mining and reclamation operations. This notice shall include a statement of the exact number of acres which will have been affected in the permit area, prior to such temporary cessation, the extent and kind of reclamation of those areas which will have been accomplished, and identification of the backfilling, regrading, revegetation, environmental monitoring, and water treatment activities that will continue during the temporary cessation.

(2) Higher or better uses.
(b)
Determining premining uses of land.
The premining uses of land to which the postmining land use is compared shall be those uses which the land previously supported, if the land has not been previously mined and has been properly managed. The postmining land use for land that has been previously mined and not reclaimed shall be judged on the basis of the land use that existed prior to any mining:
Provided that,
if the land cannot be reclaimed to the land use that existed prior to any mining because of the previously mined condition, the postmining land use shall be judged on the basis of the highest and best use that can be achieved which is compatible with surrounding areas and does not require the disturbance of areas previously unaffected by mining.
(c)
Criteria for alternative postmining land uses.
Higher or better uses may be approved by the regulatory authority as alternative postmining land uses after consultation with the landowner or the land management agency having
jurisdiction over the lands, if the proposed uses meet the following criteria:
(1) There is a reasonable likelihood for achievement of the use.
(2) The use does not present any actual or probable hazard to public health or safety, or threat of water diminution or pollution.
(3) The use will not—
(i) Be impractical or unreasonable;
(ii) Be inconsistent with applicable land use policies or plans;
(iii) Involve unreasonable delay in implementation; or
(iv) Cause or contribute to violation of Federal, State, or local law.
(d)
Approximate original contour: Criteria for variance.
Surface coal mining operations that meet the requirements of this paragraph may be conducted under a variance from the requirement to restore disturbed areas to their approximate original contour, if the following requirements are satisfied:
(1) The regulatory authority grants the variance under a permit issued in accordance with § 785.16 of this chapter.
(2) The alternative postmining land use requirements of paragraph (c) of this section are met.
(3) All applicable requirements of the Act and the regulatory program, other than the requirement to restore disturbed areas to their approximate original contour, are met.
(4) After consultation with the appropriate land use planning agencies, if any, the potential use is shown to constitute an equal or better economic or public use.
(5) The proposed use is designed and certified by a qualified registered professional engineer in conformance with professional standards established to assure the stability, drainage, and configuration necessary for the intended use of the site.
(6) After approval, where required, of the appropriate State environmental agencies, the watershed of the permit and adjacent areas is shown to be improved.
(7) The highwall is completely backfilled with spoil material, in a manner which results in a static factor of safety of at least 1.3, using standard geotechnical analysis.
(8) Only the amount of spoil as is necessary to achieve the postmining land use, ensure the stability of spoil retained on the bench, and meet all other requirements of the Act and this chapter is placed off the mine bench. All spoil not retained on the bench shall be placed in accordance with §§ 816.71-816.74 of this chapter.
(9) The surface landowner of the permit area has knowingly requested, in writing, that a variance be granted, so as to render the land, after reclamation, suitable for an industrial, commercial, residential, or public use (including recreational facilities).
(10) Federal, State, and local government agencies with an interest in the proposed land use have an adequate period in which to review and comment on the proposed use.

Permanent closure measures shall be designed to prevent access to the mine workings by people, livestock, fish and wildlife, machinery and to keep acid or other toxic drainage from entering ground or surface waters.
[44 FR 15422, Mar. 13, 1979, as amended at 48 FR 43992, Sept. 26, 1983; 75 FR 60275, Sept. 29, 2010; 81 FR 93418, Dec. 20, 2016; 82 FR 54999, Nov. 17, 2017]
§ 817.22
Topsoil and subsoil.
(a)
Removal.
(1)(i) All topsoil shall be removed as a separate layer from the area to be disturbed, and segregated.
(ii) Where the topsoil is of insufficient quantity or of poor quality for sustaining vegetation, the materials approved by the regulatory authority in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section shall be removed as a separate layer from the area to be disturbed, and segregated.
(2) If topsoil is less than 6 inches thick, the operator may remove the topsoil and the unconsolidated materials immediately below the topsoil and treat the mixture as topsoil.
(3) The regulatory authority may choose not to require the removal of topsoil for minor disturbances which—
(i) Occur at the site of small structures, such as power poles, signs, or fence lines; or
(ii) Will not destroy the existing vegetation and will not cause erosion.
(4)
Timing.
All materials to be removed under this section shall be removed after the vegetative cover that would interfere with its salvage is cleared from the area to be disturbed, but before any drilling, blasting, mining, or other surface disturbance takes place.
(b)
Substitutes and supplements.
Selected overburden materials may be substituted for, or used as a supplement to, topsoil if the operator demonstrates to the regulatory authority that the resulting soil medium is equal to, or more suitable for sustaining vegetation than, the existing topsoil, and the resulting soil medium is the best available in the permit area to support revegetation.
(c)
Storage.
(1) Materials removed under Paragraph (a) of this section shall be segregated and stockpiled when it is impractical to redistribute such materials promptly on regraded areas.
(2) Stockpiled materials shall—
(i) Be selectively placed on a stable site within the permit area;
(ii) Be protected from contaminants and unnecessary compaction that would interfere with revegetation;
(iii) Be protected from wind and water erosion through prompt establishment and maintenance of an effective, quick growing vegetative cover or through other measures approved by the regulatory authority; and
(iv) Not be moved until required for redistribution unless approved by the regulatory authority.
(3) Where long-term surface disturbances will result from facilities such as support facilities and preparation plants and where stockpiling of materials removed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section would be detrimental to the quality or quantity of those materials, the regulatory authority may approve the temporary distribution of the soil materials so removed to an approved site within the permit area to enhance the current use of that site until needed for later reclamation, provided that—
(i) Such action will not permanently diminish the capability of the topsoil of the host site; and
(ii) The material will be retained in a condition more suitable for redistribution than if stockpiled.
(d)
Redistribution.
(1) Topsoil materials and topsoil substitutes and supplements removed under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be redistributed in a manner that—
(i) Achieves an approximately uniform, stable thickness when consistent with the approved postmining land use, contours, and surface-water drainage systems. Soil thickness may also be varied to the extent such variations help meet the specific revegetation goals identified in the permit;
(ii) Prevents excess compaction of the materials; and
(iii) Protects the materials from wind and water erosion before and after seeding and planting.
(2) Before redistribution of the material removed under paragraph (a) of this section, the regraded land shall be treated if necessary to reduce potential slippage of the redistributed material and to promote root penetration. If no harm will be caused to the redistributed material and reestablished vegetation, such treatment may be conducted after such material is replaced.
(3) The regulatory authority may choose not to require the redistribution of topsoil or topsoil substitutes on the approved postmining embankments of permanent impoundments or of roads if it determines that—
(i) Placement of topsoil or topsoil substitutes on such embankments is inconsistent with the requirement to use the best technology currently available to prevent sedimentation, and
(ii) Such embankments will be otherwise stabilized.
(4)
Nutrients and soil amendments.
Nutrients and soil amendments shall be applied to the initially redistributed material when necessary to establish the vegetative cover.
(e)
Subsoil segregation.
The regulatory authority may require that the B horizon, C horizon, or other underlying strata, or portions thereof, be removed and segregated, stockpiled, and redistributed as subsoil in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section if it finds that such subsoil layers are necessary to comply
with the revegetation requirements of §§ 817.111, 817.113, 817.114, and 817.116 of this chapter.
[48 FR 22101, May 16, 1983, as amended at 71 FR 51706, Aug. 30, 2006; 81 FR 93418, Dec. 20, 2016; 82 FR 54999, Nov. 17, 2017]
§ 817.41
Hydrologic-balance protection.
(a)
General.
All underground mining and reclamation activities shall be conducted to minimize disturbance of the hydrologic balance within the permit and adjacent areas, to prevent material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area, and to support approved postmining land uses in accordance with the terms and conditions of the approved permit and the performance standards of this part. The regulatory authority may require additional preventative, remedial, or monitoring measures to assure that material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area is prevented. Mining and reclamation practices that minimize water pollution and changes in flow shall be used in preference to water treatment.
(b)
Ground-water protection.
In order to protect the hydrologic balance underground mining activities shall be conducted according to the plan approved under § 784.14(g) of this chapter and the following.
(1) Ground-water quality shall be protected by handling earth materials and runoff in a manner that minimizes acidic, toxic, or other harmful infiltration to ground-water systems and by managing excavations and other disturbances to prevent or control the discharge of pollutants into the ground water.
(c)
Ground-water monitoring.
(1) Ground-water monitoring shall be conducted according to the ground-water monitoring plan approved under § 784.14(h) of this chapter. The regulatory authority may require additional monitoring when necessary.
(2) Ground-water monitoring data shall be submitted every 3 months to the regulatory authority or more frequently as prescribed by the regulatory authority. Monitoring reports shall include analytical results from each sample taken during the reporting period. When the analysis of any ground-water sample indicates noncompliance with the permit conditions, then the operator shall promptly notify the regulatory authority and immediately take the actions provided for in §§ 773.17(e) and 784.14(g) of this chapter.
(3) Ground-water monitoring shall proceed through mining and continue during reclamation until bond release. Consistent with the procedures of § 774.13 of this chapter, the regulatory authority may modify the monitoring requirements including the parameters covered and the sampling frequency if the operator demonstrates, using the monitoring data obtained under this paragraph, that—
(i) The operation has minimized disturbance to the prevailing hydrologic balance in the permit and adjacent areas and prevented material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area; water quantity and quality are suitable to support approved postmining land uses; or
(ii) Monitoring is no longer necessary to achieve the purposes set forth in the monitoring plan approved under § 784.14(h) of this chapter.
(4) Equipment, structures, and other devices used in conjunction with monitoring the quality and quantity of ground water onsite and offsite shall be properly installed, maintained, and operated and shall be removed by the operator when no longer needed.
(d)
Surface-water protection.
In order to protect the hydrologic balance, underground mining activities shall be conducted according to the plan approved under § 784.14(g) of this chapter, and the following:
(1) Surface-water quality shall be protected by handling earth materials, ground-water discharges, and runoff in a manner that minimizes the formation of acidic or toxic drainage; prevents, to the extent possible using the best technology currently available, additional contribution of suspended solids to streamflow outside the permit area; and otherwise prevent water pollution. If drainage control, restabilization and revegetation of disturbed areas, diversion of runoff, mulching, or other reclamation and remedial practices are not adequate to meet the requirements of this section and § 817.42, the operator shall use and maintain
the necessary water-treatment facilities or water quality controls.
(2) Surface-water quantity and flow rates shall be protected by handling earth materials and runoff in accordance with the steps outlined in the plan approved under § 784.14(g) of this chapter.
(e)
Surface-water monitoring.
(1) Surface-water monitoring shall be conducted according to the surface-water monitoring plan approved under § 784.14(i) of this chapter. The regulatory authority may require additional monitoring when necessary.
(2) Surface-water monitoring data shall be submitted every 3 months to the regulatory authority or more frequently as prescribed by the regulatory authority. Monitoring reports shall include analytical results from each sample taken during the reporting period. When the analysis of any surface-water sample indicates noncompliance with the permit conditions, the operator shall promptly notify the regulatory authority and immediately take the actions provided for in §§ 773.17(e) and 784.14(g) of this chapter. The reporting requirements of this paragraph do not exempt the operator from meeting any National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) reporting requirements.
(3) Surface-water monitoring shall proceed through mining and continue during reclamation until bond release. Consistent with § 774.13 of this chapter, the regulatory authority may modify the monitoring requirements, except those required by the NPDES permitting authority, including the parameters covered and sampling frequency if the operator demonstrates, using the monitoring data obtained under this paragraph, that—
(i) The operation has minimized disturbance to the hydrologic balance in the permit and adjacent areas and prevented material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area; water quantity and quality are suitable to support approved postmining land uses; and
(ii) Monitoring is no longer necessary to achieve the purposes set forth in the monitoring plan approved under § 784.14(i) of this chapter.
(4) Equipment, structures, and other devices used in conjunction with monitoring the quality and quantity of surface water onsite and offsite shall be properly installed, maintained, and operated and shall be removed by the operator when no longer needed.
(f)
Acid- and toxic-forming materials.
(1) Drainage from acid- and toxic-forming materials and underground development waste into surface water and ground water shall be avoided by—
(i) Identifying and burying and/or treating, when necessary, materials which may adversely affect water quality, or be detrimental to vegetation or to public health and safety if not buried and/or treated, and
(ii) Storing materials in a manner that will protect surface water and ground water by preventing erosion, the formation of polluted runoff, and the infiltration of polluted water. Storage shall be limited to the period until burial and/or treatment first become feasible, and so long as storage will not result in any risk of water pollution or other environmental damage.
(2) Storage, burial or treatment practices shall be consistent with other material handling and disposal provisions of this chapter.
(g)
Transfer of wells.
Before final release of bond, exploratory or monitoring wells shall be sealed in a safe and environmentally sound manner in accordance with §§ 817.13 and 817.15. With the prior approval of the regulatory authority, wells may be transferred to another party for further use. However, at a minimum, the conditions of such transfer shall comply with State and local laws and the permittee shall remain responsible for the proper management of the well until bond release in accordance with §§ 817.13 to 817.15.
(h)
Discharges into an underground mine.
(1) Discharges into an underground mine are prohibited, unless specifically approved by the regulatory authority after a demonstration that the discharge will—
(i) Minimize disturbance to the hydrologic balance on the permit area, prevent material damage outside the permit area and otherwise eliminate public hazards resulting from underground mining activities;
(ii) Not result in a violation of applicable water quality standards or effluent limitations;
(iii) Be at a known rate and quality which shall meet the effluent limitations of § 817.42 for pH and total suspended solids, except that the pH and total suspended solids limitations may be exceeded, if approved by the regulatory authority; and
(iv) Meet with the approval of the Mine Safety and Health Administration.
(2) Discharges shall be limited to the following:
(i) water;
(ii) Coal-processing waste;
(iii) Fly ash from a coal-fired facility;
(iv) Sludge from an acid-mine-drainage treatment facility;
(v) Flue-gas desulfurization sludge;
(vi) Inert materials used for stabilizing underground mines; and
(vii) Underground mine development wastes.
(3) Water from one underground mine may be diverted into other underground workings according to the requirements of this section.
(i)
Gravity discharges from underground mines.
(1) Surface entries and accesses to underground workings shall be located and managed to prevent or control gravity discharge of water from the mine. Gravity discharges of water from an underground mine, other than a drift mine subject to paragraph (i)(2) of this section, may be allowed by the regulatory authority if it is demonstrated that the untreated or treated discharge complies with the performance standards of this part and any additional NPDES permit requirements.
(2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, the surface entries and accesses of drift mines first used after the implementation of a State, Federal, or Federal Lands Program and located in acid-producing or iron-producing coal seams shall be located in such a manner as to prevent any gravity discharge from the mine.
(j)
Drinking, domestic or residential water supply.
The permittee must promptly replace any drinking, domestic or residential water supply that is contaminated, diminished or interrupted by underground mining activities conducted after October 24, 1992, if the affected well or spring was in existence before the date the regulatory authority received the permit application for the activities causing the loss, contamination or interruption. The baseline hydrologic information required in §§ 780.21 and 784.14 of this chapter and the geologic information concerning baseline hydrologic conditions required in §§ 780.21 and 784.22 of this chapter will be used to determine the impact of mining activities upon the water supply.
[48 FR 43992, Sept. 26, 1983, as amended at 52 FR 45924, Dec. 2, 1987; 60 FR 16749, Mar. 31, 1995; 81 FR 93418, Dec. 20, 2016; 82 FR 54999, Nov. 17, 2017]

General requirements.
(1) With the approval of the regulatory authority, any flow from mined areas abandoned before May 3, 1978, and any flow from undisturbed areas or reclaimed areas, after meeting the criteria of § 817.46 for siltation structure removal, may be diverted from disturbed areas by means of temporary or permanent diversions. All diversions shall be designed to minimize adverse impacts to the hydrologic balance within the permit and adjacent areas, to prevent material damage outside the permit area and to assure the safety of the public. Diversions shall not be used to divert water into underground mines without approval of the regulatory authority in accordance with § 817.41(h).
(2) The diversion and its appurtenant structures shall be designed, located, constructed, and maintained to—
(i) Be stable;
(ii) Provide protection against flooding and resultant damage to life and property;
(iii) Prevent, to the extent possible using the best technology currently available, additional contributions of suspended solids to streamflow outside the permit area; and
(iv) Comply with all applicable local, State, and Federal laws and regulations.
(3) Temporary diversions shall be removed promptly when no longer needed to achieve the purpose for which they were authorized. The land disturbed by the removal process shall be restored in accordance with this part. Before diversions are removed, downstream water-treatment facilities previously protected by the diversion shall be modified or removed, as necessary, to prevent overtopping or failure of the facilities. This requirement shall not relieve the operator from maintaining water-treatment facilities as otherwise required. A permanent diversion or a stream channel reclaimed after the removal of a temporary diversion shall be designed and constructed so as to restore or approximate the premining characteristics of the original stream channel including the natural riparian vegetation to promote the recovery and the enhancement of the aquatic habitat.
(4) The regulatory authority may specify additional design criteria for diversions to meet the requirements of this section.
(b)
Diversion of perennial and intermittent streams.
(1) Diversion of perennial and intermittent streams within the permit area may be approved by the regulatory authority after making the finding relating to stream buffer zones called for in 30 CFR 817.57 that the diversions will not adversely affect the water quantity and quality and related environmental resources of the stream.
(2) The design capacity of channels for temporary and permanent stream channel diversions shall be at least equal to the capacity of the unmodified stream channel immediately upstream and downstream from the diversion.
(3) The requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section shall be met when the temporary and permanent diversions for perennial and intermittent streams are designed so that the combination of channel, bank and flood-plain configuration is adequate to pass safely the peak runoff of a 10-year, 6-hour precipitation event for a temporary diversion and a 100-year, 6-hour precipitation event for a permanent diversion.
(4) The design and construction of all stream channel diversions of perennial and intermittent streams shall be certified by a qualified registered professional engineer as meeting the performance standards of this part and any design criteria set by the regulatory authority.
(c)
Diversion of miscellaneous flows.
(1) Miscellaneous flows, which consist of all flows except for perennial and intermittent streams, may be diverted away from disturbed areas if required or approved by the regulatory authority. Miscellaneous flows shall include ground-water discharges and ephemeral streams.
(2) The design, location, construction, maintenance, and removal of diversions of miscellaneous flows shall meet all of the performance standards set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.
(3) The requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section shall be met when the temporary and permanent diversions for miscellaneous flows are designed so that the combination of channel, bank and flood-plain configuration is adequate to pass safely the peak runoff of a 2-year, 6-hour precipitation event for a temporary diversion and a 10-year, 6-hour precipitation event for a permanent diversion.

§ 817.45
Hydrologic balance: Sediment control measures.
(a) Appropriate sediment control measures shall be designed, constructed, and maintained using the best technology currently available to:
(1) Prevent, to the extent possible, additional contributions of sediment to stream flow or to runoff outside the permit area,
(2) Meet the more stringent of applicable State or Federal effluent limitations,
(3) Minimize erosion to the extent possible.
(b) Sediment control measures include practices carried out within and adjacent to the disturbed area. The sedimentation storage capacity of practices in and downstream from the disturbed areas shall reflect the degree to which successful mining and reclamation techniques are applied to reduce erosion and control sediment. Sediment control measures consist of the utilization of proper mining and reclamation methods and sediment control practices, singly or in combination. Sediment control methods include but are not limited to—
(1) Disturbing the smallest practicable area at any one time during the mining operation through progressive backfilling, grading, and prompt revegetation as required in § 817.111(b);
(2) Stabilizing the backfilled material to promote a reduction of the rate and volume of runoff in accordance with the requirements of § 817.102;
(3) Retaining sediment within disturbed areas;
(4) Diverting runoff away from disturbed areas;
(5) Diverting runoff using protected channels or pipes through disturbed areas so as not to cause additional erosion;
(6) Using straw dikes, riprap, check dams, mulches, vegetative sediment filters, dugout ponds, and other measures that reduce overland flow velocity, reduce runoff volume, or trap sediment;
(7) Treating with chemicals; and
(8) Treating mine drainage in underground sumps.

A rock-core chimney drain may be used in a valley fill if the fill does not exceed 250,000 cubic yards of material and upstream drainage is diverted around the fill. The alternative rock-core chimney drain system shall be incorporated into the design and construction of the fill as follows:
(1) The fill shall have, along the vertical projection of the main buried stream channel or rill, a vertical core of durable rock at least 16 feet thick which shall extend from the toe of the fill to the head of the fill, and from the base of the fill to the surface of the fill. A system of lateral rock underdrains shall connect this rock core to each area of potential drainage or seepage in the disposal area. The underdrain system and rock core shall be designed to carry the anticipated seepage of water due to rainfall away from the excess spoil fill and from seeps and springs in the foundation of the disposal area. Rocks used in the rock core and underdrains shall meet the requirements of § 817.71(f).
(2) A filter system to ensure the proper long-term functioning of the rock core shall be designed and constructed using current, prudent engineering practices.
(3) Grading may drain surface water away from the outslope of the fill and toward the rock core. In no case, however, may intermittent or perennial streams be diverted into the rock core. The maximum slope of the top of the fill shall be 33h:lv (3 percent). A drainage pocket may be maintained at the head of the fill during and after construction, to intercept surface runoff and discharge the runoff through or over the rock drain, if stability of the fill is not impaired. In no case shall this pocket or sump have a potential capacity for impounding more than 10,000 cubic feet of water. Terraces on the fill shall be graded with a 3 to 5 percent grade toward the fill and a 1 percent slope toward the rock core.

No underground mining activity shall be conducted in a manner which would result in the unlawful taking of a bald or golden eagle, its nest, or any of its eggs. The operator shall promptly report to the regulatory authority any golden or bald eagle nest within the permit area of which the operator becomes aware. Upon notification, the regulatory authority shall consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and also, where appropriate, the State fish and wildlife agency and, after consultation, shall identify whether, and under what conditions, the operator may proceed.
(d) Nothing in this chapter shall authorize the taking of an endangered or threatened species or a bald or golden eagle, its nest, or any of its eggs in violation of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 1531
et seq.,
or the Bald Eagle Protection Act, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 668
et seq.
(e) Each operator shall, to the extent possible using the best technology currently available—
(1) Ensure that electric powerlines and other transmission facilities used for, or incidental to, underground mining activities on the permit area are designed and constructed to minimize electrocution hazards to raptors, except where the regulatory authority
determines that such requirements are unnecessary;
(2) Locate and operate haul and access roads so as to avoid or minimize impacts on important fish and wildlife species or other species protected by State or Federal law;
(3) Design fences, overland conveyors, and other potential barriers to permit passage for large mammals except where the regulatory authority determines that such requirements are unnecessary; and
(4) Fence, cover, or use other appropriate methods to exclude wildlife from ponds which contain hazardous concentrations of toxic-forming materials.
(f)
Wetlands and habitats of unusually high value for fish and wildlife.
The operator conducting underground mining activities shall avoid disturbances to, enhance where practicable, restore, or replace, wetlands, and riparian vegetation along rivers and streams and bordering ponds and lakes. Underground mining activities shall avoid disturbances to, enhance where practicable, or restore, habitats of unusually high value for fish and wildlife.
(g) Where fish and wildlife habitat is to be a postmining land use, the plant species to be used on reclaimed areas shall be selected on the basis of the following criteria:
(1) Their proven nutritional value for fish or wildlife.
(2) Their use as cover for fish or wildlife.
(3) Their ability to support and enhance fish or wildlife habitat after the release of performance bonds. The selected plants shall be grouped and distributed in a manner which optimizes edge effect, cover, and other benefits to fish and wildlife.
(h) Where cropland is to be the postmining land use, and where appropriate for wildlife- and crop-management practices, the operator shall intersperse the fields with trees, hedges, or fence rows throughout the harvested area to break up large blocks of monoculture and to diversify habitat types for birds and other animals.
(i) Where residential, public service, or industrial uses are to be the postmining land use, and where consistent with the approved postmining land use, the operator shall intersperse reclaimed lands with greenbelts utilizing species of grass, shrubs, and trees useful as food and cover for wildlife.

§ 817.111
Revegetation: General requirements.
(a) The permittee shall establish on regraded areas and on all other disturbed areas except water areas and surface areas of roads that are approved as part of the postmining land use, as vegetative cover that is in accordance with the approved permit and reclamation plan and that is—
(1) Diverse, effective, and permanent;
(2) Comprised of species native to the area, or of introduced species where desirable and necessary to achieve the approved postmining land use and approved by the regulatory authority;
(3) At least equal in extent of cover to the natural vegetation of the area; and
(4) Capable of stabilizing the soil surface from erosion.
(b) The reestablished plant species shall—
(1) Be compatible with the approved postmining land use;
(2) Have the same seasonal characteristics of growth as the original vegetation;
(3) Be capable of self-regeneration and plant succession;
(4) Be compatible with the plant and animal species of the area; and
(5) Meet the requirements of applicable State and Federal seed, poisonous and noxious plant, and introduced species laws or regulations.
(c) The regulatory authority may grant exception to the requirements of paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of this section when the species are necessary to achieve a quick-growing, temporary, stabilizing cover, and measures to establish permanent vegetation are included in the approved permit and reclamation plan.
(d) When the regulatory authority approves a cropland postmining land use, the regulatory authority may grant exceptions to the requirements of paragraphs (a) (1), (3), (b) (2), and (3) of this section. The requirements of part 823 of this chapter apply to areas identified as prime farmland.

§ 817.114
Revegetation: Mulching and other soil stabilizing practices.
Suitable mulch and other soil stabilizing practices shall be used on all areas that have been regraded and covered by topsoil or topsoil substitutes. The regulatory authority may waive this requirement if seasonal, soil, or slope factors result in a condition where mulch and other soil stabilizing practices are not necessary to control erosion and to promptly establish an effective vegetative cover.
[48 FR 40161, Sept. 2, 1983, as amended at 81 FR 93418, Dec. 20, 2016; 82 FR 54999, Nov. 17, 2017]
§ 817.116
Revegetation: Standards for success.
(a) Success of revegetation shall be judged on the effectiveness of the vegetation for the approved postmining land use, the extent of cover compared to the cover occurring in natural vegetation of the area, and the general requirements of § 817.111.
(1) Standards for success and statistically valid sampling techniques for measuring success shall be selected by the regulatory authority, described in writing, and made available to the public.
(2) Standards for success shall include criteria representative of unmined lands in the area being reclaimed to evaluate the appropriate vegetation parameters of ground cover, production, or stocking. Ground cover, production, or stocking shall be considered equal to the approved success standard when they are not less than 90 percent of the success standard. The sampling techniques for measuring success shall use a 90-percent statistical confidence interval (
i.e.,
a one-sided test with a 0.10 alpha error).
(b) Standards for success shall be applied in accordance with the approved postmining land use and, at a minimum, the following conditions:
(1) For areas developed for use as grazing land or pasture land, the ground cover and production of living plants on the revegetated area shall be at least equal to that of a reference area or such other success standards approved by the regulatory authority.
(2) For areas developed for use as cropland, crop production on the revegetated area shall be at least equal to that of a reference area or such other success standards approved by the regulatory authority.
(3) For areas to be developed for fish and wildlife habitat, recreation, undeveloped land, or forest products, success of vegetation shall be determined on the basis of tree and shrub stocking and vegetative ground cover. Such parameters are described as follows:
(i) Minimum stocking and planting arrangements shall be specified by the regulatory authority on the basis of local and regional conditions and after consultation with and approval by the State agencies responsible for the administration of forestry and wildlife programs. Consultation and approval may occur on either a programwide or a permit-specific basis.
(ii) Trees and shrubs that will be used in determining the success of stocking and the adequacy of the plant arrangement shall have utility for the approved postmining land use. Trees and shrubs counted in determining such success shall be healthy and have been in place for not less than two growing seasons. At the time of bond release, at least 80 percent of the trees and shrubs used to determine such success shall have been in place for 60 percent of the applicable minimum period of responsibility. The requirements of this section apply to trees and shrubs that have been seeded or transplanted and can be met when records of woody vegetation planted show that no woody plants were planted during the last two growing seasons of the responsibility period and, if any replanting of woody plants took place during the responsibility period, the total number planted during the last 60 percent of that period is less than 20 percent of the total number of woody plants required. Any replanting must be by means of transplants to allow for adequate accounting of plant stocking. This final accounting may include volunteer trees and shrubs of approved species. Volunteer trees and shrubs of approved species shall be deemed equivalent to planted specimens two years of age or older and can be counted towards success. Suckers on shrubby vegetation can be counted as volunteer plants when it is evident the shrub community is vigorous and expanding.
(iii) Vegetative ground cover shall not be less than that required to achieve the approved postmining land use.
(4) For areas to be developed for industrial, commercial, or residential use less than 2 years after regrading is completed, the vegetative ground cover shall not be less than that required to control erosion.
(5) For areas previously disturbed by mining that were not reclaimed to the requirements of this subchapter and that are remined or otherwise redisturbed by surface coal mining operations, as a minimum, the vegetative ground cover shall be not less than the ground cover existing before redisturbance and shall be adequate to control erosion.
(c)(1) The period of extended responsibility for successful revegetation shall begin after the last year of augmented seeding, fertilizing, irrigation, or other work, excluding husbandry practices that are approved by the regulatory authority in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(2) In areas of more than 26.0 inches of annual average precipitation, the period of responsibility shall continue for a period of not less than:
(i) Five full years, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. The vegetation parameters identified in paragraph (b) of this section for grazing land, pasture land, or cropland shall equal or exceed the approved success standard during the growing season of any 2 years of the responsibility period, except the first year. Areas approved for the other uses identified in paragraph (b) of this section shall equal or exceed the applicable success standard during the growing season of the last year of the responsibility period.
(ii) Two full years for lands eligible for remining included in a permit for which a finding has been made under § 773.15(m) of this chapter. To the extent that the success standards are established by paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the lands must equal or exceed
the standards during the growing season of the last year of the responsibility period.
(3) In areas of 26.0 inches or less average annual precipitation, the period of responsibility shall continue for a period of not less than:
(i) Ten full years, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) in this section. The vegetation parameters identified in paragraph (b) of this section for grazing land, pasture land, or cropland shall equal or exceed the approved success standard during the growing season of any two years after year six of the responsibility period. Areas approved for the other uses identified in paragraph (b) of this section shall equal or exceed the applicable success standard during the growing season of the last year of the responsibility period.
(ii) Five full years for lands eligible for remining included in a permit for which a finding has been made under § 773.15(m) of this chapter. To the extent that the success standards are established by paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the lands must equal or exceed the standards during the growing seasons of the last two consecutive years of the responsibility period.
(4) The regulatory authority may approve selective husbandry practices, excluding augmented seeding, fertilization, or irrigation, provided it obtains prior approval from the Director in accordance with § 732.17 of this chapter that the practices are normal husbandry practices, without extending the period of responsibility for revegetation success and bond liability, if such practices can be expected to continue as part of the postmining land use or if discontinuance of the practices after the liability period expires will not reduce the probability of permanent revegetation success. Approved practices shall be normal husbandry practices within the region for unmined lands having land uses similar to the approved postmining land use of the disturbed area, including such practices as disease, pest, and vermin control; and any pruning, reseeding, and transplanting specifically necessitated by such actions.

§ 817.121
Subsidence control.
(a)
Measures to prevent or minimize damage.
(1) The permittee must either adopt measures consistent with known technology that prevent subsidence from causing material damage to the extent technologically and economically feasible, maximize mine stability, and maintain the value and reasonably foreseeable use of surface lands or adopt mining technology that provides for planned subsidence in a predictable and controlled manner.
(2) If a permittee employs mining technology that provides for planned subsidence in a predictable and controlled manner, the permittee must take necessary and prudent measures, consistent with the mining method employed, to minimize material damage to the extent technologically and economically feasible to non-commercial buildings and occupied residential dwellings and structures related thereto except that measures required to minimize material damage to such structures are not required if:
(i) The permittee has the written consent of their owners or
(ii) Unless the anticipated damage would constitute a threat to health or safety, the costs of such measures exceed the anticipated costs of repair.
(3) Nothing in this part prohibits the standard method of room-and-pillar mining.
(b) The operator shall comply with all provisions of the approved subsidence control plan prepared pursuant to § 784.20 of this chapter.
(c)
Repair of damage
—(1)
Repair of damage to surface lands.
The permittee must correct any material damage resulting from subsidence caused to surface lands, to the extent technologically and economically feasible, by restoring the land to a condition capable of maintaining the value and reasonably foreseeable uses that it was capable of supporting before subsidence damage.
(2)
Repair or compensation for damage to non-commercial buildings and dwellings and related structures.
The permittee must promptly repair, or compensate the owner for, material damage resulting from subsidence caused to any non-commercial building or occupied residential dwelling or structure related thereto that existed at the time of mining. If repair option is selected, the permittee must fully rehabilitate, restore or replace the damaged structure. If compensation is selected, the permittee must compensate the owner of the damaged structure for the full amount of the decrease in value resulting from the subsidence-related damage. The permittee may provide compensation by the purchase, before mining, of a non-cancelable premium-prepaid insurance policy. The requirements of this paragraph apply only to subsidence-related damage caused by underground mining activities conducted after October 24, 1992.
(3)
Repair or compensation for damage to other structures.
The permittee must, to the extent required under applicable provisions of State law, either correct material damage resulting from subsidence caused to any structures or facilities not protected by paragraph (c)(2) of this section by repairing the damage or compensate the owner of the structures or facilities for the full amount of the decrease in value resulting from the subsidence. Repair of damage includes rehabilitation, restoration, or replacement of damaged structures or facilities. Compensation may be accomplished by the purchase before mining of a non-cancelable premium-prepaid insurance policy.
(4)
Rebuttable presumption of causation by subsidence
—(i)
Rebuttable presumption of causation for damage within angle of draw.
If damage to any non-commercial building or occupied residential dwelling or structure related thereto occurs as a result of earth movement within an area determined by projecting a specified angle of draw from the outermost boundary of any underground mine workings to the surface of the land, a rebuttable presumption exists that the permittee caused the damage. The presumption will normally apply to a 30-degree angle of draw. A State regulatory authority may amend its program to apply the presumption to a different angle of draw if the regulatory authority shows in writing that the angle has a more reasonable basis than the 30-degree angle of draw, based on geotechnical analysis of the factors affecting potential surface impacts of underground coal mining operations in the State.
(ii)
Approval of site-specific angle of draw.
A permittee or permit applicant may request that the presumption apply to an angle of draw different from that established in the regulatory program. The regulatory authority may approve application of the presumption to a site-specific angle of draw different than that contained in the State or Federal program based on a site-specific analysis submitted by an applicant. To establish a site-specific angle of draw, an applicant must demonstrate and the regulatory authority must determine in writing that the proposed angle of draw has a more reasonable basis than the standard set forth in the State or Federal program, based on a site-specific geotechnical analysis of the potential surface impacts of the mining operation.
(iii)
No presumption where access for pre-subsidence survey is denied.
If the permittee was denied access to the land or property for the purpose of conducting the pre-subsidence survey in accordance with § 784.20(a) of this chapter, no rebuttable presumption will exist.
(iv)
Rebuttal of presumption.
The presumption will be rebutted if, for example, the evidence establishes that: The damage predated the mining in question; the damage was proximately caused by some other factor or factors and was not proximately caused by subsidence; or the damage occurred outside the surface area within which subsidence was actually caused by the mining in question.
(v)
Information to be considered in determination of causation.
In any determination whether damage to protected structures was caused by subsidence from underground mining, all relevant and reasonably available information will be considered by the regulatory authority.
(5)
Adjustment of bond amount for subsidence damage.
When subsidence-related material damage to land, structures or facilities protected under paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section occurs, or when contamination, diminution, or interruption to a water supply protected under § 817.41 (j) occurs, the regulatory authority must require the permittee to obtain additional performance bond in the amount of the estimated cost of the repairs if the permittee will be repairing, or in the amount of the decrease in value if the permittee will be compensating the owner, or in the amount of the estimated cost to replace the protected water supply if the permittee will be replacing the water supply, until the repair, compensation, or replacement is completed. If repair, compensation, or replacement is completed within 90 days of the occurrence of damage, no additional bond is required. The regulatory authority may extend the 90-day time frame, but not to exceed one year, if the permittee demonstrates and the regulatory authority finds in writing that subsidence is not complete, that not all probable subsidence-related material damage has occurred to lands or protected structures, or that not all reasonably anticipated changes have occurred affecting the protected water supply, and that therefore it would be unreasonable to complete within 90 days the repair of the subsidence-related material damage to lands or protected structures, or the replacement of protected water supply.
(d) Underground mining activities shall not be conducted beneath or adjacent to (1) public buildings and facilities; (2) churches, schools, and hospitals; or (3) impoundments with a storage capacity of 20 acre-feet or more or bodies of water with a volume of 20 acre-feet or more, unless the subsidence control plan demonstrates that subsidence will not cause material damage to, or reduce the reasonably foreseeable use of, such features or facilities. If the regulatory authority determines that it is necessary in order to minimize the potential for material damage to the features or facilities described above or to any aquifer or body of water that serves as a significant water source for any public water supply system, it may limit the percentage of coal extracted under or adjacent thereto.
(e) If subsidence causes material damage to any of the features or facilities covered by paragraph (d) of this section, the regulatory authority may suspend mining under or adjacent to such features or facilities until the subsidence control plan is modified to ensure prevention of further material damage to such features or facilities.
(f) The regulatory authority shall suspend underground mining activities under urbanized areas, cities, towns, and communities, and adjacent to industrial or commercial buildings, major impoundments, or perennial streams, if imminent danger is found to inhabitants of the urbanized areas, cities, towns, or communities.
(g) Within a schedule approved by the regulatory authority, the operator shall submit a detailed plan of the underground workings. The detailed plan shall include maps and descriptions, as appropriate, of significant features of the underground mine, including the size, configuration, and approximate location of pillars and entries, extraction ratios, measure taken to prevent or minimize subsidence and related damage, areas of full extraction, and other information required by the regulatory authority. Upon request of the operator, information submitted with the detailed plan may be held as confidential, in accordance with the requirements of § 773.6(d) of this chapter.

§ 817.133
Postmining land use.
(a)
General.
All disturbed areas shall be restored in a timely manner to conditions that are capable of supporting—
(1) The uses they were capable of supporting before any mining; or
(2) Higher or better uses.
(b)
Determining premining uses of land.
The premining uses of land to which the postmining land use is compared shall be those uses which the land previously supported, if the land has not been previously mined and has been properly managed. The postmining land use for land that has been previously mined and not reclaimed shall be judged on the basis of the land use that existed prior to any mining:
Provided that,
if the land cannot be reclaimed to the land use that existed prior to any mining because of the previously mined condition, the postmining land use shall be judged on the basis of the highest and best use that can be achieved which is compatible with surrounding areas and does not require the disturbance of areas previously unaffected by mining.
(c)
Criteria for alternative postmining land uses.
Higher or better uses may be approved by the regulatory authority as alternative postmining land uses after consultation with the landowner or the land management agency having jurisdiction over the lands, if the proposed uses meet the following criteria:
(1) There is a reasonable likelihood for achievement of the use.
(2) The use does not present any actual or probable hazard to public health and safety, or threat of water diminution or pollution.
(3) The use will not—
(i) Be impractical or unreasonable;
(ii) Be inconsistent with applicable land use policies or plans;
(iii) Involve unreasonable delay in implementation; or
(iv) Cause or contribute to violation of Federal, State, or local law.
(d)
Approximate original contour: Criteria for variance.
Surface coal mining operations that meet the requirements of this paragraph may be conducted under a variance from the requirement to restore disturbed areas to their approximate original contour, if the following requirements are satisfied:
(1) The regulatory authority grants the variance under a permit issued in accordance with § 785.16 of this chapter.
(2) The alternative postmining land use requirements of paragraph (c) of this section are met.
(3) All applicable requirements of the Act and the regulatory program, other than the requirement to restore disturbed areas to their approximate original contour, are met.
(4) After consultation with the appropriate land use planning agencies, if any, the potential use is shown to constitute an equal or better economic or public use.
(5) The proposed use is designed and certified by a qualified registered professional engineer in conformance with professional standards established to assure the stability, drainage, and configuration necessary for the intended use of the site.
(6) After approval, where required, of the appropriate State environmental agencies, the watershed of the permit and adjacent areas is shown to be improved.
(7) The highwall is completely backfilled with spoil material, in a manner which results in a static factor of safety of at least 1.3, using standard geotechnical analysis.
(8) Only the amount of spoil as is necessary to achieve the postmining land use, ensure the stability of spoil retained on the bench, and meet all other requirements of the Act and this chapter is placed off the mine bench. All spoil not retained on the bench shall be placed in accordance with §§ 817.71 through 817.74 of this chapter.
(9) The surface landowner of the permit area has knowingly requested, in writing, that a variance be granted, so as to render the land, after reclamation, suitable for an industrial, commercial, residential, or public use (including recreational facilities).
(10) Federal, State, and local government agencies with an interest in the proposed land use have an adequate period in which to review and comment on the proposed use.

At 50 FR 7278, Feb. 21, 1985, § 823.11, paragraph (a) was suspended “insofar as it excludes from the requirements of part 823 those coal preparation plants, support facilities, and roads that are surface mining activities”.
§ 823.12
Soil removal and stockpiling.
(a) Prime farmland soils shall be removed from the areas to be disturbed before drilling, blasting, or mining.
(b) The minimum depth of soil and soil materials to be removed and stored for use in the reconstruction of prime farmland shall be sufficient to meet the requirements of § 823.14(b).
(c) Soil removal and stockpiling operations on prime farmland shall be conducted to—
(1) Separately remove the topsoil, or remove other suitable soil materials where such other soil materials will create a final soil having a greater productive capacity than that which exist prior to mining. If not utilized immediately, this material shall be placed in stockpiles separate from the spoil and all other excavated materials; and
(2) Separately remove the B or C soil horizon or other suitable soil material to provide the thickness of suitable soil required by § 823.14(b), except as approved by the regulatory authority where the B or C soil horizons would not otherwise be removed and where soil capabilities can be retained. If not utilized immediately, each horizon or other material shall be stockpiled separately from the spoil and all other excavated materials. Where combinations of such soil materials created by mixing have been shown to be equally or more favorable for plant growth than the B horizon, separate handling is not necessary.
(d) Stockpiles shall be placed within the permit area where they will not be disturbed or be subject to excessive erosion. If left in place for more than 30 days, stockpiles shall meet the requirements of § 816.22 or § 817.22 of this chapter.

§ 823.14
Soil replacement.
(a) Soil reconstruction specifications established by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service shall be based upon the standards of the National Cooperative Soil Survey and shall include, as a minimum, physical and chemical characteristics of reconstructed soils and soil descriptions containing soil-horizon depths, soil densities, soil pH, and other specifications such that reconstructed soils will have the capability of achieving levels of yield equal to, or higher than, those of nomined prime farmland in the surrounding area.
(b) The minimum depth of soil and substitute soil material to be reconstructed shall be 48 inches, or a lesser depth equal to the depth to a subsurface horizon in the natural soil that inhibits or prevents root penetration, or a greater depth if determined necessary to restore the original soil productive capacity. Soil horizons shall be considered as inhibiting or preventing root penetration if their physical or chemical properties or water-supplying capacities cause them to restrict or prevent penetration by roots of plants common to the vicinity of the permit area and if these properties or capacities have little or no beneficial effect on soil productive capacity.
(c) The operator shall replace and regrade the soil horizons or other root-zone material with proper compaction and uniform depth.
(d) The operator shall replace the B horizon, C horizon, or other suitable material specified in § 823.12(c)(2) to the
thickness needed to meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. In those areas where the B or C horizons were not removed but may have been compacted or otherwise damaged during the mining operation, the operator shall engage in deep tilling or other appropriate means to restore pre-mining capabilities.
(e) The operator shall replace the topsoil or other suitable soil materials specified in § 823.12(c)(1) as the final surface soil layer. This surface soil layer shall equal or exceed the thickness of the original surface soil layer, as determined by the soil survey.

§ 823.15
Revegetation and restoration of soil productivity.
(a) Following prime farmland soil replacement, the soil surface shall be stabilized with a vegetative cover or other means that effectively controls soil loss by wind and water erosion.
(b) Prime farmland soil productivity shall be restored in accordance with the following provisions:
(1) Measurement of soil productivity shall be initiated within 10 years after completion of soil replacement.
(2) Soil productivity shall be measured on a representative sample or on all of the mined and reclaimed prime farmland area using the reference crop determined under paragraph (b)(6) of this section. A statistically valid sampling technique at a 90-percent or greater statistical confidence level shall be used as approved by the regulatory authority in consultation with the U.S. Soil Conservation Service.
(3) The measurement period for determining average annual crop production (yield) shall be a minimum of 3 crop years prior to release of the operator's performance bond.
(4) The level of management applied during the measurement period shall be the same as the level of management used on nonmined prime farmland in the surrounding area.
(5) Restoration of soil productivity shall be considered achieved when the average yield during the measurement period equals or exceeds the average yield of the reference crop established for the same period for nonmined soils of the same or similar texture or slope phase of the soil series in the surrounding area under equivalent management practices.
(6) The reference crop on which restoration of soil productivity is proven shall be selected from the crops most commonly produced on the surrounding prime farmland. Where row crops are the dominant crops grown on prime farmland in the area, the row crop requiring the greatest rooting depth shall be chosen as one of the reference crops.
(7) Reference crop yields for a given crop season are to be determined from—
(i) The current yield records of representative local farms in the surrounding area, with concurrence by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service; or
(ii) The average county yields recognized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which have been adjusted by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service for local yield variation within the county that is associated with differences between nonmined prime farmland soil and all other soils that produce the reference crop.
(8) Under either procedure in paragraph (b)(7) of this section, the average reference crop yield may be adjusted, with the concurrence of the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, for—
(i) Disease, pest, and weather-induced seasonal variations; or
(ii) Differences in specific management practices where the overall management practices of the crops being compared are equivalent.

§ 840.11
Inspections by State regulatory authority.
(a) The State regulatory authority shall conduct an average of at least one partial inspection per month of each active surface coal mining and reclamation operation under its jurisdiction, and shall conduct such partial inspections of each inactive surface coal mining and reclamation operation under its jurisdiction as are necessary to ensure effective enforcement of the approved State program. A partial inspection is an on-site or aerial review of a person's compliance with some of the permit conditions and requirements imposed under an approved State program.
(b) The State regulatory authority shall conduct an average of at least one complete inspection per calendar quarter of each active or inactive surface coal mining and reclamation operation under its jurisdiction. A complete inspection is an on-site review of a person's compliance with all permit conditions and requirements imposed under the State program, within the entire area disturbed or affected by the surface coal mining and reclamation operations.
(c) The State regulatory authority shall conduct such inspections of coal explorations as are necessary to ensure compliance with the approved State program.
(d)(1) Aerial inspections shall be conducted in a manner which reasonably ensures the identification and documentation of conditions at each surface coal mining and reclamation site inspected.
(2) Any potential violation observed during an aerial inspection shall be investigated on site within three days:
provided, that any indication of a condition, practice or violation constituting cause for the issuance of a cessation order under section 521(a)(2) of the Act shall be investigated on site immediately,
And provided further,
That an on-site investigation of a potential violation observed during an aerial inspection shall not be considered to be an additional partial or complete inspection for the purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(e) The inspections required under paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this section shall:
(1) Be carried out on an irregular basis, so as to monitor compliance at all operations, including those which operate nights, weekends, or holidays;
(2) Occur without prior notice to the permittee or any agent or employee of such permittee, except for necessary on-site meetings; and
(3) Include the prompt filing of inspection reports adequate to enforce the requirements of the approved State program.
(f) For the purposes of this section, an inactive surface coal mining and reclamation operation is one for which:
(1) The State regulatory authority has secured from the permittee the written notice provided for under § 816.131(b) or § 817.131(b) of this chapter; or
(2) Reclamation Phase II as defined at § 800.40 of this chapter has been completed and the liability of the permittee has been reduced by the State regulatory authority in accordance with the State program.
(g) Abandoned site means a surface coal mining and reclamation operation for which the regulatory authority has found in writing that:
(1) All surface and underground coal mining and reclamation activities at the site have ceased;
(2) The regulatory authority or the Office has issued at least one notice of violation or the initial program equivalent, and either:
(i) Is unable to serve the notice despite diligent efforts to do so; or
(ii) The notice was served and has progressed to a failure-to-abate cessation order or the initial program equivalent;
(3) The regulatory authority:
(i) Is taking action to ensure that the permittee and operator, and owners and controllers of the permittee and operator, will be precluded from receiving future permits while violations continue at the site; and
(ii) Is taking action pursuant to section 518(e), 518(f), 521(a)(4) or 521(c) of the Act or their regulatory program counterparts to ensure that abatement occurs or that there will not be a recurrence of the failure-to-abate, except where after evaluating the circumstances it concludes that further enforcement offers little or no likelihood of successfully compelling abatement or recovering any reclamation costs; and
(4) Where the site is, or was, permitted and bonded:
(i) The permit has either expired or been revoked; and
(ii) The regulatory authority has initiated and is diligently pursuing forfeiture of, or has forfeited, any available performance bond.
(h) In lieu of the inspection frequency established in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the regulatory authority shall inspect each abandoned site on a set frequency commensurate with the public health and safety and environmental considerations present at each specific site, but in no case shall the inspection frequency be set at less than one complete inspection per calendar year.
(1) In selecting an alternate inspection frequency authorized under the paragraph above, the regulatory authority shall first conduct a complete inspection of the abandoned site and provide public notice under paragraph (h)(2) of this section. Following the inspection and public notice, the regulatory authority shall prepare and maintain for public review a written finding justifying the alternative inspection frequency selected. This written finding shall justify the new inspection frequency by affirmatively addressing in detail all of the following criteria:
(i) How the site meets each of the criteria under the definition of an abandoned site under paragraph (g) of this section and thereby qualifies for a reduction in inspection frequency;
(ii) Whether, and to what extent, there exist on the site impoundments, earthen structures or other conditions that pose, or may reasonably be expected to ripen into, imminent dangers to the health or safety of the public or significant environmental harms to land, air, or water resources;
(iii) The extent to which existing impoundments or earthen structures were constructed and certified in accordance with prudent engineering designs approved in the permit;
(iv) The degree to which erosion and sediment control is present and functioning;
(v) The extent to which the site is located near or above urbanized areas, communities, occupied dwellings, schools and other public or commercial buildings and facilities;
(vi) The extent of reclamation completed prior to abandonment and the degree of stability of unreclaimed areas, taking into consideration the physical characteristics of the land mined and the extent of settlement or revegetation that has occurred naturally with them; and
(vii) Based on a review of the complete and partial inspection report record for the site during at least the last two consecutive years, the rate at which adverse environmental or public health and safety conditions have and can be expected to progressively deteriorate.
(2) The public notice and opportunity to comment required under paragraph (h)(1) of this section shall be provided as follows:
(i) The regulatory authority shall place a notice in the newspaper with the broadest circulation in the locality of the abandoned site providing the public with a 30-day period in which to submit written comments.
(ii) The public notice shall contain the permittee's name, the permit number, the precise location of the land affected, the inspection frequency proposed, the general reasons for reducing the inspection frequency, the bond status of the permit, the telephone number and address of the regulatory authority where written comments on the reduced inspection frequency may be submitted, and the closing date of the comment period.

parts 843 and 845 and subchapters G and J of this chapter.
(d) Nothing in the Act or this part shall be construed as eliminating any additional enforcement rights or procedures which are available under State law to a State regulatory authority, but which are not specifically enumerated in sections 518 and 521 of the Act.

§ 842.1
Scope.
This part sets forth general procedures governing Federal inspections under the permanent regulatory program.
§ 842.5
Definitions.
As used in this part, the following terms have the specified meanings:
Citizen complaint
means any information received from any person notifying the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) of a possible violation of the Act, this chapter, the applicable State regulatory program, or any condition of a permit or an exploration approval. This information must be provided in writing (or orally, followed up in writing).
Ten-day notice
means a communication mechanism that OSMRE uses, in non-imminent harm situations, to notify a State regulatory authority under § 842.11(b)(l)(ii)(B)(
1
) and § 843.12(a)(2) of this chapter when an OSMRE authorized representative has reason to believe that any permittee and/or operator is in violation of the Act, this chapter, the applicable State regulatory program, or any condition of a permit or an exploration approval or when, on the basis of a Federal inspection, OSMRE determines that a person is in violation of the Act, this chapter, the applicable State regulatory program, or any condition of a permit or an exploration approval and OSMRE has not issued a previous ten-day notice for the same violation.
[89 FR 24735, Apr. 9, 2024]
§ 842.11
Federal inspections and monitoring.
(a) Authorized representatives of the Secretary shall conduct inspections of surface coal mining and reclamation operations as necessary—
(1) To monitor and evaluate the administration of approved State programs. Such monitoring and evaluation inspections shall be conducted jointly with the State regulatory authority where practical and where the State so requests;
(2) To develop or enforce Federal programs and Federal lands programs;
(3) To enforce those requirements and permit conditions imposed under a State program not being enforced by a State, under section 504(b) or section 521(b) of the Act, part 733 of this chapter, or as provided in this section; and
(4) To determine whether any notice of violation or cessation order issued during an inspection authorized under this section has been complied with.
(b)(1) An authorized representative of the Secretary must immediately conduct a Federal inspection:
(i) When the authorized representative has reason to believe on the basis of information received from a citizen complainant, information available in OSMRE files at the time that OSMRE is notified of the possible violation (other than information resulting from a previous Federal inspection), and publicly available electronic information, that there exists a violation of the Act, this chapter, the applicable State regulatory program, or any condition of a permit or an exploration approval, or that there exists any condition, practice, or violation that creates
an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public or is causing or could reasonably be expected to cause a significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources; and
(ii)(A) There is no State regulatory authority or the Office is enforcing the State regulatory program under section 504(b) or 521(b) of the Act and part 733 of this chapter; or
(B)(
1
) The authorized representative has notified the State regulatory authority of the possible violation and more than ten days have passed since notification, and the State regulatory authority has not taken appropriate action to cause the violation to be corrected or to show good cause for not doing so, or the State regulatory authority has not provided the authorized representative with a response. After receiving a response from the State regulatory authority, but before a Federal inspection, the authorized representative will determine in writing whether the standards for appropriate action or good cause have been satisfied. A State regulatory authority's failure to respond within ten days does not prevent the authorized representative from making a determination, and will constitute a waiver of the State regulatory authority's right to request review under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. Where appropriate, OSMRE may issue a single ten-day notice for substantively similar possible violations found on two or more permits, including two or more substantively similar possible violations identified in one or more citizen complaints.
(
2
) For purposes of this subchapter, an action or response by a State regulatory authority that is not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion under the state program shall be considered “appropriate action” to cause a violation to be corrected or “good cause” for failure to do so.
(
3
) Appropriate action includes enforcement or other action authorized under the approved State regulatory program to cause the violation to be corrected.
(
4
) Good cause includes:
(
i
) The possible violation does not exist under the State regulatory program;
(
ii
) The State regulatory authority has initiated an investigation into a possible violation and has determined that it requires an additional amount of time to determine whether a violation exists. The State regulatory authority may request up to 30 additional days to complete its investigation of the issue; in complex situations, the State regulatory authority may request up to an additional 60 days to complete the investigation. In all circumstances, an extension request must be supported by an explanation of the need for, and the measures being undertaken that justify, an extension, along with any relevant documentation. The authorized representative has discretion to approve the requested time extension or establish the length of time that the State regulatory authority has to complete its investigation. The sum total of additional time for any one possible violation must not exceed 90 days. At the conclusion of the specified additional time, the authorized representative will re-evaluate the State regulatory authority's response, including any additional information provided;
(
iii
) OSMRE has identified substantively similar possible violations on separate permits and considers the possible violations as a single State regulatory program issue addressed through § 733.12 of this chapter. Previously identified possible violations that were the subject of ten-day notices or subsequent, substantively similar violations may be included in the same State regulatory program issue;
(
iv
) The State regulatory authority demonstrates that it lacks jurisdiction over the possible violation under the State regulatory program;
(
v
) The State regulatory authority demonstrates that it is precluded from taking action on the possible violation because an administrative review body or court of competent jurisdiction has issued an order concluding that the possible violation does not exist or that the temporary relief standards of
the State regulatory program counterparts to section 525(c) or 526(c) of the Act have been satisfied; or
(
vi
) Regarding abandoned sites, as defined in 30 CFR 840.11(g), the State regulatory authority is diligently pursuing or has exhausted all appropriate enforcement provisions of the State regulatory program.
(C) The person supplying the information supplies adequate proof that an imminent danger to the public health and safety or a significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air or water resources exists and that the State regulatory authority has failed to take appropriate action.
(iii)(A) The authorized representative shall immediately notify the state regulatory authority in writing when in response to a ten-day notice the state regulatory authority fails to take appropriate action to cause a violation to be corrected or to show good cause for such failure. If the State regulatory authority disagrees with the authorized representative's written determination, it may file a request, in writing, for informal review of that written determination by the Deputy Director. Such a request for informal review may be submitted to the appropriate OSMRE field office or to the office of the Deputy Director in Washington, DC. The request must be received by OSMRE within 5 days from receipt of OSMRE's written determination.
(B) Unless a cessation order is required under § 843.11, or unless the state regulatory authority has failed to respond to the ten-day notice, no Federal inspection action shall be taken or notice of violation issued regarding the ten-day notice until the time to request informal review as provided in § 842.11(b)(1)(iii)(A) has expired or, if informal review has been requested, until the Deputy Director has completed such review.
(C) After reviewing the written determination of the authorized representative and the request for informal review submitted by the State regulatory authority, the Deputy Director shall, within 15 days, render a decision on the request for informal review. He shall affirm, reverse, or modify the written determination of the authorized representative. Should the Deputy Director decide that the State regulatory authority did not take appropriate action or show good cause, he shall immediately order a Federal inspection or reinspection. The Deputy Director shall provide to the State regulatory authority and to the permittee a written explanation of his decision, and if the ten-day notice resulted from a request for a Federal inspection under § 842.12 of this part, he shall send written notification of his decision to the person who made the request.
(2) An authorized representative will have reason to believe that a violation, condition, or practice referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section exists if the facts that a complainant alleges, or facts that are otherwise known to the authorized representative, support the existence of a possible violation, condition, or practice. In making this determination, the authorized representative will consider information from a citizen complainant, information available in OSMRE files at the time that OSMRE is notified of the possible violation, and publicly available electronic information. All citizen complaints will be considered as requests for a Federal inspection under § 842.12. If the information supplied by the complainant results in a Federal inspection, the complainant will be offered the opportunity to accompany OSMRE on the Federal inspection.
(c) The Office, when acting as the regulatory authority under a Federal program or a Federal lands program and when enforcing a State program, in whole or in part, pursuant to section 504(b) of section 521(b) of the Act and part 733 of this chapter, shall conduct inspections of all coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations under its jurisdiction. The Office shall—
(1) With respect to active surface coal mining and reclamation operations:
(i) Conduct an average of at least one partial inspection per month of each active surface coal mining and reclamation operation. A partial inspection is an on-site or aerial review of a person's compliance with some of the permit requirements and conditions imposed under an applicable program.
(A) Aerial inspections shall be conducted in a manner which reasonably
ensures the identification and documentation of conditions at each surface coal mining and reclamation site inspected.
(B) Any potential violation observed during an aerial inspection shall be investigated on site within three calendar days:
Provided,
That any indication of a condition, practice or violation constituting cause for issuance of a cessation order under section 521(a)(2) shall be investigated on site immediately,
And provided further,
That an on-site investigation of a potential violation observed during an aerial inspection shall not be considered to be an additional partial or complete inspection for the purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(ii) Conduct an average of at least one complete inspection per calendar quarter of each active surface coal mining and reclamation operation. A complete inspection is an on-site review of a person's compliance with all permit conditions and requirements imposed under the applicable program within the entire area disturbed or affected by surface coal mining and reclamation operations.
(2) With respect to inactive surface coal mining and reclamation operations:
(i) Conduct an average of at least one complete inspection per calendar quarter of each inactive surface coal mining and reclamation operation; and
(ii) Conduct such partial inspections of each inactive surface coal mining and reclamation operation as are necessary to ensure effective enforcement of the regulatory program and the Act.
(iii) For purposes of this section, an inactive surface coal mining and reclamation operation is one for which—
(A) The Office has secured from the permittee the written notice provided for under §§ 816.131(b) or 817.131(b) of this chapter; or,
(B) Reclamation Phase II as defined at § 800.40 of this chapter has been completed.
(3) With respect to coal exploration operations, conduct such inspections as are necessary to ensure compliance with the Act by those coal explorations which substantially disturb the natural land surface.
(d) The inspections required under paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section shall:
(1) Be carried out on an irregular basis, so as to monitor compliance at all operations, including those which operate nights, weekends, or holidays;
(2) Occur without prior notice to the permittee or any agent or employee of such permittee, except for necessary on-site meetings; and
(3) Include the prompt filing of inspection reports adequate to enforce the requirements of the applicable program.
(e) Abandoned site means a surface coal mining and reclamation operation for which the Office has found in writing that:
(1) All surface and underground coal mining and reclamation activities at the site have ceased;
(2) The Office has issued at least one notice of violation or the initial program equivalent, and either:
(i) Is unable to serve the notice despite diligent efforts to do so; or
(ii) The notice was served and has progressed to a failure-to-abate cessation order or the initial program equivalent;
(3) The Office:
(i) Is taking action to ensure that the permittee and operator, and owners and controllers of the permittee and operator, will be precluded from receiving future permits while violations continue at the site; and
(ii) Is taking action pursuant to sections 518(e), 518(f), 521(a)(4) or 521(c) of the Act or their regulatory program counterparts to ensure that abatement occurs or that there will not be a recurrence of the failure-to-abate, except where after evaluating the circumstances it concludes that further enforcement offers little or no likelihood of successfully compelling abatement or recovering any reclamation costs; and
(4) Where the site is, or was, permitted or bonded:
(i) The permit has either expired or been revoked; and
(ii) The Office has initiated and is diligently pursuing forfeiture of, or has forfeited, any available performance bond.
(f) In lieu of the inspection frequency established in paragraph (c) of this section, the office shall inspect each abandoned site on a set frequency commensurate with the public health and safety and environmental considerations present at each specific site, but in no case shall the inspection frequency be set at less than one complete inspection per calendar-year.
(1) In selecting an alternate inspection frequency authorized under the paragraph above, the office shall first conduct a complete inspection of the abandoned site and provide public notice under paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Following the inspection and public notice, the office shall prepare and maintain for public review a written finding justifying the alternative inspection frequency selected. This written finding shall justify the new inspection frequency by affirmatively addressing in detail all of the following criteria:
(i) How the site meets each of the criteria under the definition of an abandoned site under paragraph (e) of this section and thereby qualifies for a reduction inspection frequency;
(ii) Whether, and to what extent, there exist on the site impoundments, earthen structures or other conditions that pose, or may reasonably be expected to ripen into, imminent dangers to the health or safety of the public or significant environmental harms to land, air or water resources;
(iii) The extent to which existing impoundments or earthen structures were constructed and certified in accordance with prudent engineering designs approved in the permit;
(iv) The degree to which erosion and sediment control is present and functioning;
(v) The extent to which the site is located near or above urbanized areas, communities, occupied dwellings, schools and other public or commercial buildings and facilities;
(vi) The extent of reclamation completed prior to abandonment and the degree of stability of unreclaimed areas, taking into consideration the physical characteristics of the land mined and the extent of settlement or revegetation that has occurred naturally with time; and
(vii) Based on a review of the complete and partial inspection report record for the site during at least the last two consecutive years, the rate at which adverse environmental or public health and safety conditions have and can be expected to progressively deteriorate.
(2) The public notice and opportunity to comment required under paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall be provided as follows:
(i) The office shall place a notice in the newspaper with the broadest circulation in the locality of the abandoned site providing the public with a 30-day period in which to submit written comments.
(ii) The public notice shall contain the permittee's name, the permit number, the precise location of the land affected, the inspection frequency proposed, the general reasons for reducing the inspection frequency, the bond status of the permit, the telephone number and address of the office where written comments on the reduced inspection frequency may be submitted, and the closing date of the comment period.

§ 842.12
Requests for Federal inspections.
(a) Any person may request a Federal inspection under § 842.11(b) by providing to an authorized representative a signed, written statement (or an oral report followed by a signed, written statement) setting forth information that, along with any other information the complainant chooses to provide, may give the authorized representative reason to believe that a violation, condition, or practice referred to in § 842.11(b)(1)(i) exists. In making this determination, the authorized representative will consider information from a citizen complainant, information available in OSMRE files at the time that OSMRE receives the request for a Federal inspection, and publicly available electronic information. The statement must also set forth a phone
number, address, and, if available, an email address where the person can be contacted. All citizen complaints under § 842.11(b) will be considered as requests for a Federal inspection. If the information supplied by the complainant results in a Federal inspection, the complainant will be offered the opportunity to accompany OSMRE on the Federal inspection.
(b) The identity of any person supplying information to the Office relating to a possible violation or imminent danger or harm shall remain confidential with the Office, if requested by that person, unless that person elects to accompany the inspector on the inspection, or unless disclosure is required under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or other Federal law.
(c) If a Federal inspection is conducted as a result of information provided to the Office by a person as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the person shall be notified as far in advance as practicable when the inspection is to occur and shall be allowed to accompany the authorized representative of the Secretary during the inspection. Such person has a right of entry to, upon and through the coal exploration or surface coal mining and reclamation operation about which he or she supplied information, but only if he or she is in the presence of and is under the control, direction and supervision of the authorized representative while on the mine property. Such right of entry does not include a right to enter buildings without consent of the person in control of the building or without a search warrant.
(d) Within ten days of the Federal inspection or, if there is no Federal inspection, within 15 days of receipt of the person's written statement, the Office shall send the person the following.
(1) If a Federal inspection was made, a description of the enforcement action taken, which may consist of copies of the Federal inspection report and all notices of violation and cessation orders issued as a result of the inspection, or an explanation of why no enforcement action was taken;
(2) If no Federal inspection was conducted, an explanation of the reason why; and
(3) An explanation of the person's right, if any, to informal review of the action or inaction of the Office under § 842.15.
(e) The Office shall give copies of all materials in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section within the time limits specified in those paragraphs to the person alleged to be in violation, except that the name of the person supplying information shall be removed unless disclosure of his or her identity is permitted under paragraph (b) of this section.

§ 842.13
Right of entry.
(a) Each authorized representative of the Secretary conducting a Federal inspection under § 842.11:
(1) Shall have a right of entry to, upon, and through any coal exploration or surface coal mining and reclamation operation without advance notice or a search warrant, upon presentation of appropriate credentials;
(2) May, at reasonable times and without delay, have access to and copy any records, and inspect any monitoring equipment or method of exploration or operation required under the applicable program; and,
(3) Shall have a right to gather physical and photographic evidence to document conditions, practices or violations at the site.
(b) No search warrant shall be required with respect to any activity under paragraph (a) of this section, except that a search warrant may be required for entry into a building.
§ 842.14
Review of adequacy and completeness of inspections.
Any person who is or may be adversely affected by a surface coal mining and reclamation operation or a coal exploration operation may notify the Director or his or her designee in writing of any alleged failure on the part of the Office to make adequate and complete or periodic Federal inspections. The notification shall include sufficient information to create a reasonable belief that the regulations of this part are not being complied with and to demonstrate that the person is or
may be adversely affected. The Director or his or her designee shall within 15 days of receipt of the notification determine whether adequate and complete or periodic inspections have been made. The Director or his or her designee shall furnish the complainant with a written statement of the reasons for such determination and the actions, if any, taken to remedy the noncompliance.
§ 842.15
Review of decision not to inspect or enforce.
(a) Any person who is or may be adversely affected by a coal exploration or surface coal mining and reclamation operation may ask the Director or his or her designee to review informally an authorized representative's decision not to inspect or take appropriate enforcement action with respect to any violation alleged by that person in a request for Federal inspection under § 842.12. The request for review shall be in writing and include a statement of how the person is or may be adversely affected and why the decision merits review.
(b) The Director or his or her designee shall conduct the review and inform the person, in writing, of the results of the review within 30 days of his or her receipt of the request. The person alleged to be in violation shall also be given a copy of the results of the review, except that the name of the person who is or may be adversely affected shall not be disclosed unless confidentiality has been waived or disclosure is required under the Freedom of Information Act or other Federal law.
(c) Informal review under this section shall not affect any right to formal review under section 525 of the Act or to a citizen's suit under section 520 of the Act.
(d) Any determination made under paragraph (b) of this section shall constitute a decision of OSM within the meaning of 43 CFR 4.1281 and shall contain a right of appeal to the Office of Hearings and Appeals in accordance with 43 CFR part 4.
§ 842.16
Availability of records.
(a) Copies of all records, reports, inspection materials, or information obtained by the Office under Title V of the Act, this chapter, a Federal program or Federal lands program, and a State program being enforced by the Office under section 504(b) or 521(b) of the Act and part 733 of this chapter or §§ 842.11 or 842.12 shall be made immediately available to the public in the area of mining until at least five years after expiration of the period during which the subject operation is active or is covered by any portion of a reclamation bond so that they are conveniently available to residents of that area, except—
(1) As otherwise provided by Federal law; and
(2) For information not required to be made available under § 772.15, § 773.6(d), or § 840.14(d) of this chapter.
(b) The Office shall ensure compliance with paragraph (a) of this section by either:
(1) Making copies of all such records, reports, inspection materials, and other information available for public inspection at a Federal, State or local government office in the county where the mining is occurring or is proposed to occur; or
(2) At the Office's option and expense, providing copies of such information promptly by mail at the request of any resident of the area where the mining is occurring or is proposed to occur, provided that the Office shall maintain for public inspection at a Federal, State, or local government office in the county where the mining is occurring or is proposed to occur a description of the information available for mailing and the procedure for obtaining such information.
(c) Copies of documents and information required to be made available under paragraph (a) of this section shall be provided to the State regulatory authority, if any.

§ 843.11
Cessation orders.
(a)(1) An authorized representative of the Secretary shall immediately order a cessation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations or of the relevant portion thereof, if he or she finds, on the basis of any Federal inspection, any condition or practice, or any violation of the Act, this chapter, any applicable program, or any condition of an exploration approval or permit imposed under any such program, the Act, or this chapter which:
(i) Creates an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public; or
(ii) Is causing or can reasonably be expected to cause significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources.
(2) Surface coal mining operations conducted by any person without a valid surface coal mining permit constitute a condition or practice which causes or can reasonably be expected to cause significant imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources unless such operations:
(i) Are an integral, uninterrupted extension of previously permitted operations, and the person conducting such operations has filed a timely and complete application for a permit to conduct such operations; or
(ii) Were conducted lawfully without a permit under the interim regulatory program because no permit has been required for such operations by the State in which the operations were conducted.
(3) If the cessation ordered under paragraph (a)(1) of this section will not completely abate the imminent danger or harm in the most expeditious manner physically possible, the authorized representative of the Secretary shall impose affirmative obligations on the permittee to abate the imminent danger or significant environmental harm. The order shall specify the time by which abatement shall be accomplished.
(b)(1) When a notice of violation has been issued under § 843.12(a) and the permittee fails to abate the violation within the abatement period fixed or subsequently extended by the authorized representative, the authorized representative of the Secretary shall immediately order a cessation of coal exploration or surface coal mining and reclamation operations, or of the portion relevant to the violation.
(2) A cessation order issued under this paragraph (b) shall require the permittee to take all steps the authorized representative of the Secretary deems necessary to abate the violations covered by the order in the most expeditious manner physically possible.
(c) A cessation order issued under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be in writing, signed by the authorized representative who issues it, and shall set forth with reasonable specificity: (1) The nature of the condition, practice or violation; (2) the remedial action or affirmative obligation required, if any, including interim steps, if appropriate; (3) the time established for abatement, if appropriate; and (4) a reasonable description of the portion of the coal exploration or surface coal mining and reclamation operation to which it applies. The order shall remain in effect until the condition, practice or violation resulting in the issuance of the cessation order has been abated or until vacated, modified or terminated in writing by an authorized representative of the Secretary, or until the order expires pursuant to section 521(a)(5) of the Act and § 843.15.
(d) Reclamation operations and other activities intended to protect public health and safety and the environment shall continue during the period of any order unless otherwise provided in the order.
(e) An authorized representative of the Secretary may modify, terminate or vacate a cessation order for good cause, and may extend the time for abatement if the failure to abate within the time previously set was not caused by lack of diligence on the part of the permittee.
(f) An authorized representative of the Secretary shall terminate a cessation order by written notice to the permittee when he or she determines that all conditions, practices or violations listed in the order have been abated. Termination shall not affect the right of the Office to assess civil penalties for those violations under part 845 of this chapter.
(g) Within 60 days after issuing a cessation order, OSM will notify in writing the permittee, the operator, and any person who has been listed or identified by the applicant, permittee, or OSM as an owner or controller of the operation, as defined in § 701.5 of this chapter.
[47 FR 35637, Aug. 16, 1982, as amended at 54 FR 8992, Mar. 2, 1989; 54 FR 13823, Apr. 5, 1989; 62 FR 19461, Apr. 21, 1997; 65 FR 79670, Dec. 19, 2000]
§ 843.12
Notices of violation.
(a)(1) An authorized representative of the Secretary shall issue a notice of violation if, on the basis of a Federal inspection carried out during the enforcement of a Federal program or Federal lands program or during Federal enforcement of a State program under section 504(b) or 521(b) of the Act and part 733 of this chapter, he finds a violation of the Act, this chapter, the applicable program or any condition of a permit or an exploration approval imposed under such program, the Act, or this Chapter, which does not create an imminent danger or harm for which a cessation order must be issued under § 843.11.
(2) When, on the basis of any Federal inspection other than one described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an authorized representative of the Secretary determines that there exists a violation of the Act, the State program, or any condition of a permit or exploration approval required by the Act which does not create an imminent danger or harm for which a cessation order must be issued under § 843.11, the authorized representative shall give a written report of the violation to the State and to the permittee so that appropriate action can be taken by the State. Where the State fails within ten days after notification to take appropriate action to cause the violation to be corrected, or to show good cause for such failure, subject to the procedures of § 842.11(b)(1)(iii) of this chapter, the authorized representative shall reinspect and, if the violation continues to exist, shall issue a notice of violation or cessation order, as appropriate. No additional notification to the State by the Office is required before the issuance of a notice of violation if previous notification was given under § 842.11(b)(1)(ii)(B) of this chapter.
(b) A notice of violation issued under this section shall be in writing signed by the authorized representative who issues it, and shall set forth with reasonable specificity:
(1) The nature of the violation;
(2) The remedial action required, which may include interim steps;
(3) A reasonable time for abatement, which may include time for accomplishment of interim steps; and
(4) A reasonable description of the portion of the coal exploration or surface coal mining and reclamation operation to which it applies.
(c) An authorized representative of the Secretary may extend the time set for abatement or for accomplishment of an interim step, if the failure to meet the time previously set was not caused by lack of diligence on the part of the permittee. The total time for abatement under a notice of violation, including all extensions, shall not exceed 90 days from the date of issuance, except upon a showing by the permittee that it is not feasible to abate the violation within 90 calendar days due to one or more of the circumstances in paragraph (f) of this section. An extended abatement date pursuant to this section shall not be granted when the permittee's failure to abate within 90 days has been caused by a lack of diligence or intentional delay by the permittee in completing the remedial action required.
(d)(1) If the permittee fails to meet the time set for abatement the authorized representative shall issue a cessation order under § 843.11(b).
(2) If the permittee fails to meet the time set for accomplishment of any interim step the authorized representative may issue a cessation order under § 843.11(b).
(e) An authorized representative of the Secretary shall terminate a notice of violation by written notice to the permittee when he determines that all violations listed in the notice of violation have been abated. Termination shall not affect the right of the Office to assess civil penalties for those violations under 30 CFR part 845.
(f) Circumstances which may qualify a surface coal mining operation for an abatement period of more than 90 days are:
(1) Where the permittee of an ongoing permitted operation has timely applied for and diligently pursued a permit renewal or other necessary approval of designs or plans but such permit or approval has not been or will not be issued within 90 days after a valid permit expires or is required, for reasons not within the control of the permittee;
(2) Where there is a valid judicial order precluding abatement within 90 days as to which the permittee has diligently pursued all rights of appeal and as to which he or she has no other effective legal remedy;
(3) Where the permittee cannot abate within 90 days due to a labor strike;
(4) Where climatic conditions preclude abatement within 90 days, or where, due to climatic conditions, abatement within 90 days clearly would cause more environmental harm than it would prevent; or
(5) Where abatement within 90 days requires action that would violate safety standards established by statute or regulation under the Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.
(g) Whenever an abatement time in excess of 90 days is permitted, interim abatement measures shall be imposed to the extent necessary to minimize harm to the public or the environment.
(h) If any of the conditions in paragraph (f) of this section exists, the permittee may request the authorized representative to grant an abatement period exceeding 90 days. The authorized representative shall not grant such an abatement period without the concurrence of the Director or his or her designee and the abatement period granted shall not exceed the shortest possible time necessary to abate the violation. The permittee shall have the burden of establishing by clear and convincing proof that he or she is entitled to an extension under the provisions of § 843.12(c) and (f). In determining whether or not to grant an abatement period exceeding 90 days the authorized representative may consider any relevant written or oral information from the permittee or any other source. The authorized representative shall promptly and fully document in the file his or her reasons for granting or denying the request. The authorized representative's immediate supervisor shall review this document before concurring in or disapproving the extended abatement date and shall promptly and fully document the reasons for his or her concurrence or disapproval in the file.
(i) Any determination made under paragraph (h) of this section shall contain a right of appeal to the Office of
Hearings and Appeals in accordance with 43 CFR 4.1281 and the regulations at 43 CFR part 4.
(j) No extension granted under paragraph (h) of this section may exceed 90 days in length. Where the condition or circumstance which prevented abatement within 90 days exists at the expiration of any such extension, the permittee may request a further extension in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (h) of this section.
[47 FR 35637, Aug. 16, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 26744, July 14, 1988]
§ 843.13
Suspension or revocation of permits: Pattern of violations.
(a)(1) The Director shall issue an order to a permittee requiring him or her to show cause why his or her permit and right to mine under the Act should not be suspended or revoked, if the Director determines that a pattern of violations of any requirements of the Act, this chapter, the applicable program, or any permit condition required by the Act exists or has existed, and that the violations were caused by the permittee willfully or through unwarranted failure to comply with those requirements or conditions. Violations by any person conducting surface coal mining operations on behalf of the permittee shall be attributed to the permittee, unless the permittee establishes that they were acts of deliberate sabotage. The Director shall promptly file a copy of any order to show cause with the Office of Hearings and Appeals and the State regulatory authority, if any.
(2) The Director may determine that a pattern of violations exists or has existed, based upon two or more Federal inspections of the permit area within any 12-month period, after considering the circumstances, including:
(i) The number of violations, cited on more than one occasion, of the same or related requirements of the Act, this chapter, the applicable program, or the permit;
(ii) The number of violations, cited on more than one occasion, of different requirements of the Act, this chapter, the applicable program, or the permit; and
(iii) The extent to which the violations were isolated departures from lawful conduct.
(3) The Director shall promptly review the history of violations of any permittee who has been cited for violations of the same or related requirements of the Act, this chapter, the applicable program, or the permit during three or more Federal inspections of the permit area within any 12-month period. If, after such review, the Director determines that a pattern of violations exists or has existed, he or she shall issue an order to show cause as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(4)(i) In determining the number of violations within any 12-month period, the Director shall consider only violations issued as a result of a Federal inspection carried out—
(A) During enforcement of a Federal program or a Federal lands program;
(B) During the interim program and before the applicable State program was approved pursuant to section 502 or 504 of the Act; or
(C) During Federal enforcement of a State program in accordance with section 504(b) or 521(b) of the Act.
(ii) The Director may not consider violations issued as a result of inspections other than those mentioned in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section in determining whether to exercise his or her discretion under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, except as evidence of the willful or unwarranted nature of the permittee's failure to comply.
(b) If the permittee files an answer to the show cause order and requests a hearing under 43 CFR part 4, a public hearing shall be provided as set forth in that part. The Office of Hearings and Appeals shall give thirty days written notice of the date, time and place of the hearing to the Director, the permittee, the State regulatory authority, if any, and any intervenor. Upon receipt of the notice, the Director shall publish it, if practicable, in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of the surface coal mining and reclamation operations, and shall post it at the State or field office closest to those operations.
(c) Within sixty days after the hearing, and within the time limits set
forth in 43 CFR part 4, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall issue a written determination as to whether a pattern of violations exists and, if appropriate, an order. If the Office of Hearings and Appeals revokes or suspends the permit and the permittee's right to mine under the Act, the permittee shall immediately cease surface coal mining operations on the permit area and shall:
(1) If the permit and the right to mine under the Act are revoked, complete reclamation within the time specified in the order; or
(2) If the permit and the right to mine under the Act are suspended, complete all affirmative obligations to abate all conditions, practices, or violations as specified in the order.
(d) Whenever a permittee fails to abate a violation contained in a notice of violation or cessation order within the abatement period set in the notice or order or as subsequently extended, the Director shall review the permittee's history of violations to determine whether a pattern of violations exists pursuant to this section, and shall issue an order to show cause as appropriate pursuant to § 845.15(b)(2) of this chapter.
§ 843.14
Service of notices of violation, cessation orders, and show cause orders.
(a) A notice of violation, cessation order, or show cause order shall be served on the person to whom it is directed or his or her designated agent promptly after issuance, as follows:
(1) By tendering a copy at the coal exploration or surface coal mining and reclamation operation to the designated agent or to the individual who, based upon reasonable inquiry, appears to be in charge. If no such individual can be located at the site, a copy may be tendered to any individual at the site who appears to be an employee or agent of the person to whom the notice or order is issued. Service shall be complete upon tender of the notice or order and shall not be deemed incomplete because of refusal to accept.
(2) As an alternative to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, service may be made by sending a copy of the notice or order by certified mail or by hand to the permittee or his or her designated agent, or by any means consistent with the rules governing service of a summons and complaint under rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Service shall be complete upon tender of the notice or order or of the certified mail and shall not be deemed incomplete because of refusal to accept.
(b) Designation by any person of an agent for service of notices and orders shall be made in writing to the appropriate State or field office of the Office.
(c) The Office shall furnish copies of notices and orders to the State regulatory authority, if any, promptly after their issuance. The Office may furnish copies to any person having an interest in the coal exploration, surface coal mining and reclamation operation, or the permit area.
[47 FR 35637, Aug. 16, 1982, as amended at 56 FR 28445, June 20, 1991]
§ 843.15
Informal public hearing.
(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a notice of violation or cessation order which requires cessation of mining, expressly or by necessary implication, shall expire within 30 days after it is served unless an informal public hearing has been held within that time. The hearing shall be held at or reasonably close to the mine site so that it may be viewed during the hearing or at any other location acceptable to the Office and the person to whom the notice or order was issued. The Office of Surface Mining office nearest to the mine site shall be deemed to be reasonably close to the mine site unless a closer location is requested and agreed to by the Office. Expiration of a notice or order shall not affect the Office's right to assess civil penalties with respect to the period during which the notice or order was in effect. No hearing will be required where the condition, practice, or violation in question has been abated or the hearing has been waived. For purposes of this section only, “mining” includes (1) extracting coal from the earth or from coal waste piles and transporting it within or from the permit area, and (2) the processing, cleaning, concentrating, preparing or loading of coal where such operations occur at a place other than at a mine site.
(b) A notice of violation or cessation order shall not expire as provided in paragraph (a) of this section if the informal public hearing has been waived, or if, with the consent of the person to whom the notice or order was issued, the informal public hearing is held later than 30 days after the notice or order was served. For purposes of this subsection:
(1) The informal public hearing will be deemed waived if the person to whom the notice or order was issued:
(i) Is informed, by written notice served in the manner provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, that he or she will be deemed to have waived an informal public hearing unless he or she requests one within 30 days after service of the notice; and
(ii) Fails to request an informal public hearing within that time.
(2) The written notice referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section shall be delivered to such person by an authorized representative or sent by certified mail to such person no later than 5 days after the notice or order is served on such person.
(3) The person to whom the notice or order is issued shall be deemed to have consented to an extension of the time for holding the informal public hearing if his or her request is received on or after the 21st day after service of the notice or order. The extension of time shall be equal to the number of days elapsed after the 21st day.
(c) The Office shall give as much advance notice as is practicable of the time, place, and subject matter of the informal public hearing to:
(1) The person to whom the notice or order was issued;
(2) Any person who filed a report which led to that notice or order; and
(3) The State regulatory authority, if any.
(d) The Office shall also post notice of the hearing at the State or field office closest to the mine site and, where practicable, publish it in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of the mine.
(e) Section 554 of Title 5 of the United States Code, regarding requirements for formal adjudicatory hearings, shall not govern informal public hearings. An informal public hearing shall be conducted by a representative of the Office, who may accept oral or written arguments and any other relevant information from any person attending.
(f) Within five days after the close of the informal public hearing, the Office shall affirm, modify, or vacate the notice or order in writing. The decision shall be sent to—
(1) The person to whom the notice or order was issued;
(2) Any person who filed a report which led to the notice or order; and
(3) The State regulatory authority, if any.
(g) The granting or waiver of an informal public hearing shall not affect the right of any person to formal review under section 518(b), 521(a)(4), or 525 of the Act.
(h) The person conducting the hearing for the Office shall determine whether or not the mine site should be viewed during the hearing. In making this determination the only consideration shall be whether a view of the mine site will assist the person conducting the hearing in reviewing the appropriateness of the enforcement action or of the required remedial action.
§ 843.16
Formal review of citations.
(a) A person issued a notice of violation or cessation order under § 843.11 or § 843.12, or a person having an interest which is or may be adversely affected by the issuance, modification, vacation or termination of a notice or order, may request review of that action by filing an application for review and request for hearing under 43 CFR part 4, within 30 days after receiving notice of the action.
(b) The filing of an application for review and request for a hearing under this section shall not operate as a stay of any notice or order, or of any modification, termination or vacation of either.
§ 843.17
Failure to give notice and lack of information.
No notice of violation, cessation order, show cause order, or order revoking or suspending a permit may be vacated for failure to give the notice to the State regulatory authority required under § 842.11(b)(1)(ii)(B) of this chapter or because it is subsequently
determined that the Office did not have information sufficient, under §§ 842.11(b)(1) and 842.11(b)(2) of this chapter, to justify an inspection.
§ 843.18
Inability to comply.
(a) No cessation order or notice of violation issued under this part may be vacated because of inability to comply.
(b) Inability to comply may not be considered in determining whether a pattern of violations exists.
(c) Unless caused by lack of diligence, inability to comply may be considered only in mitigation of the amount of civil penalty under part 845 of this chapter and of the duration of the suspension of a permit under § 843.13(c).
§ 843.20
Compliance conference.
(a) A permittee may request an on-site compliance conference with an authorized representative to review the compliance status of any condition or practice proposed at any coal exploration or surface coal mining and reclamation operation. Any such conference shall not constitute an inspection within the meaning of section 517 of the Act and § 842.11.
(b) The Office may accept or refuse any request to conduct a compliance conference under paragraph (a). Where the Office accepts such a request, reasonable notice of the scheduled date and time of the compliance conference shall be given to the permittee.
(c) The authorized representative at any compliance conference shall review such proposed conditions and practices as the permittee may request in order to determine whether any such condition or practice may become a violation of any requirement of the Act of any applicable permit or exploration approval.
(d) Neither the holding of a compliance conference under this section nor any opinion given by the authorized representative at such a conference shall affect:
(1) Any rights or obligations of the Office or of the permittee with respect to any inspection, notice of violation or cessation order, whether prior or subsequent to such conference; or
(2) The validity of any notice of violation or cessation order issued with respect to any condition or practice reviewed at the compliance conference.
§ 843.22
Enforcement actions at abandoned sites.
The Office may refrain from issuing a notice of violation or cessation order for a violation at an abandoned site, as defined in § 842.11(e) of this chapter, if abatement of the violation is required under any previously issued notice or order.
[53 FR 24882, June 30, 1988]
§ 843.25
Energy Policy Act enforcement in States with approved State programs.
(a)
State-by-State determinations.
By July 31, 1995, OSM will determine for each State with an approved State regulatory program whether:
(1) Direct Federal enforcement of the Energy Policy Act and implementing Federal regulations will occur under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to some or all surface coal mining operations in each State, or
(2) The procedures of §§ 843.11 and 843.12(a)(2) will apply to State enforcement of the Energy Policy Act, or
(3) A combination of direct Federal enforcement and State enforcement will occur.
(4) Before making this determination, OSM will consult with each affected State and provide an opportunity for public comment. OSM will publish its determination in the
Federal Register.
(b)
Interim Federal enforcement.
(1) If OSM determines under paragraph (a) that direct Federal enforcement is necessary, §§ 817.41(j), 817.121(c)(2), and 817.121(c)(4) of this chapter will apply to each underground mining operation subject to that determination that is conducted in a State with an approved State regulatory program.
(2) If OSM determines under paragraph (a) of this section that direct Federal enforcement is necessary, the provisions of § 843.12(a)(2) will not apply to direct Federal enforcement actions under this paragraph (b). When, on the basis of any Federal inspection under this paragraph, an authorized representative determines that a violation of § 817.41(j) or § 817.121(c)(2) exists, the authorized representative must issue a
notice of violation or cessation order, as appropriate.
(3) This paragraph (b) will remain effective in a State with an approved State regulatory program until the State adopts, and OSM approves, under part 732 of this chapter, provisions consistent with §§ 817.41(j) and 817.121(c)(2) of this chapter. After these provisions are approved, this paragraph will remain effective only for violations of §§ 817.41(j) and 817.121(c)(2) that are not regulated by the State regulatory authority.

§ 845.1
Scope.
This part covers the assessment of civil penalties under section 518 of the Act with respect to cessation orders and notices of violation issued under part 843 (Federal Enforcement), except for the assessment of individual civil penalties under section 518(f), which is covered in part 846.
[53 FR 3675, Feb. 8, 1988]
§ 845.2
Objective.
Civil penalties are assessed under section 518 of the Act and this part to deter violations and to ensure maximum compliance with the terms and purposes of the Act on the part of the coal mining industry.
§ 845.11
How assessments are made.
The Office shall review each notice of violation and cessation order in accordance with the assessment procedures described in 30 CFR 845.12, 845.13, 845.14, 845.15, and 845.16 to determine whether a civil penalty will be assessed, the amount of the penalty, and whether each day of a continuing violation will be deemed a separate violation for purposes of the total penalty assessed.
§ 845.12
When penalty will be assessed.
(a) The Office shall assess a penalty for each cessation order.
(b) The Office shall assess a penalty for each notice of violation, if the violation is assigned 31 points or more under the point system described in 30 CFR 845.13.
(c) The Office may assess a penalty for each notice of violation assigned 30 points or less under the point system described in 30 CFR 845.13. In determining whether to assess a penalty, the Office shall consider the factors listed in 30 CFR 845.13(b).
§ 845.13
Point system for penalties.
(a) The Office shall use the point system described in this section to determine the amount of the penalty and, in the case of notices of violation, whether a mandatory penalty should be assessed as provided in 30 CFR 845.12(b).
(b) Points shall be assigned as follows:
(1)
History of previous violations.
The Office shall assign up to 30 points based on the history of previous violations. One point shall be assigned for each past violation contained in a notice of violation. Five points shall be assigned for each violation (but not a condition or practice) contained in a cessation order. The history of previous violations, for the purpose of assigning points, shall be determined and the points assigned with respect to a particular coal exploration or surface coal mining operation. Points shall be assigned as follows:
(i) A violation shall not be counted, if the notice or order is the subject of
pending administrative or judicial review or if the time to request such review or to appeal any administrative or judicial decision has not expired, and thereafter it shall be counted for only one year.
(ii) No violation for which the notice or order has been vacated shall be counted; and
(iii) Each violation shall be counted without regard to whether it led to a civil penalty assessment.
(2)
Seriousness.
The Office shall assign up to 30 points based on the seriousness of the violation, as follows:
(i)
Probability of occurrence.
The Office shall assign up to 15 points based on the probability of the occurrence of the event which a violated standard is designed to prevent. Points shall be assessed according to the following schedule:
Probability of Occurrence
Points
None
0
Insignificant
1-4
Unlikely
5-9
Likely
10-14
Occurred
15
(ii)
Extent of potential or actual damage.
The Office shall assign up to 15 points, based on the extent of the potential or actual damage, in terms of area and impact on the public or environment, as follows:
(A) If the damage or impact which the violated standard is designed to prevent would remain within the coal exploration or permit area, the Office shall assign zero to seven points, depending on the duration and extent of the damage or impact.
(B) If the damage or impact which the violated standard is designed to prevent would extend outside the coal exploration or permit area, the Office shall assign eight to fifteen points, depending on the duration and extent of the damage or impact
(iii)
Alternative.
In the case of a violation of an administrative requirement, such as a requirement to keep records, the Office shall, in lieu of paragraphs (b)(2) (i) and (ii), assign up to 15 points for seriousness, based upon the extent to which enforcement is obstructed by the violation.
(3)
Negligence.
(i) The Office shall assign up to 25 points based on the degree of fault of the person to whom the notice or order was issued in causing or failing to correct the violation, condition, or practice which led to the notice or order, either through act or omission. Points shall be assessed as follows:
(A) A violation which occurs through no negligence shall be assigned no penalty points for negligence;
(B) A violation which is caused by negligence shall be assigned 12 points or less, depending on the degree of negligence;
(C) A violation which occurs through a greater degree of fault than negligence shall be assigned 13 to 25 points, depending on the degree of fault.
(ii) In determining the degree of negligence involved in a violation and the number of points to be assigned, the following definitions apply:
(A)
No negligence
means an inadvertent violation which was unavoidable by the exercise of reasonable care.
(B)
Negligence
means the failure of a permittee to prevent the occurrence of any violation of his or her permit or any requirement of the Act or this Chapter due to indifference, lack or diligence, or lack of reasonable care, or the failure to abate any violation of such permit or the Act due to indifference, lack of diligence, or lack of reasonable care.
(C)
A greater degree of fault than negligence
means reckless, knowing, or intentional conduct.
(iii) In calculating points to be assigned for negligence, the acts of all persons working on the coal exploration or surface coal mining and reclamation site shall be attributed to the person to whom the notice or order was issued, unless that person establishes that they were acts of deliberate sabotage.
(4) Good faith in attempting to achieve compliance.
(i) The Office shall add points based on the degree of good faith of the person to whom the notice or order was issued in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notification of the violation. Points shall be assigned as follows:
Degree of good faith
Points
Rapid compliance
−1 to −10.
Normal compliance
0.
(ii) The following definitions shall apply under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section:
(A) Rapid compliance means that the person to whom the notice or order was issued took extraordinary measures to abate the violation in the shortest possible time and that abatement was achieved before the time set for abatement.
(B) Normal compliance means the person to whom the notice or order was issued abated the violation within the time given for abatement.
(iii) If the consideration of this criterion is impractical because of the length of the abatement period, the assessment may be made without considering this criterion and may be reassessed after the violation has been abated.
§ 845.14
Determination of amount of penalty.
The Office shall determine the amount of any civil penalty by converting the total number of points assigned under 30 CFR 845.13 to a dollar amount, according to the following schedule:

§ 845.15
Assessment of separate violations for each day.
(a) The Office may assess separately a civil penalty for each day from the date of issuance of the notice of violation or cessation order to the date set for abatement of the violation. In determining whether to make such an assessment, the Office shall consider the factors listed in 30 CFR 845.13 and may consider the extent to which the person
to whom the notice or order was issued gained any economic benefit as a result of a failure to comply. For any violation which continues for two or more days and which is assigned more than 70 points under § 845.13(b), the Office shall assess a penalty for a minimum of two separate days.
(b) In addition to the civil penalty provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, whenever a violation contained in a notice of violation or cessation order has not been abated within the abatement period set in the notice or order or as subsequently extended pursuant to section 521(a) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1271(a), a civil penalty of not less than $3,148 will be assessed for each day during which such failure to abate continues, except that:
(1)(i) If suspension of the abatement requirements of the notice or order is ordered in a temporary relief proceeding under section 525(c) of the Act, after a determination that the person to whom the notice or order was issued will suffer irreparable loss or damage from the application of the requirements, the period permitted for abatement shall not end until the date on which the Office of Hearings and Appeals issues a final order with respect to the violation in question; and
(ii) If the person to whom the notice or order was issued initiates review proceedings under section 526 of the Act with respect to the violation, in which the obligations to abate are suspended by the court pursuant to section 526(c) of the Act, the daily assessment of a penalty shall not be made for any period before entry of a final order by the court;
(2) Such penalty for the failure to abate the violation shall not be assessed for more than 30 days for each such violation. If the permittee has not abated the violation within the 30-day period, the Office shall take appropriate action pursuant to section 518(e), 518(f), 521(a)(4), or 521(c) of the Act within 30 days to ensure that abatement occurs or to ensure that there will not be a reoccurrence of the failure to abate.
[47 FR 35640, Aug. 16, 1982, as amended at 62 FR 63277, Nov. 28, 1997; 66 FR 58647, Nov. 21, 2001; 70 FR 70701, Nov. 22, 2005; 81 FR 44541, July 8, 2016; 82 FR 9354, Feb. 6, 2017; 83 FR 10616, Mar. 12, 2018; 84 FR 10676, Mar. 22, 2019; 85 FR 20836, Apr. 15, 2020; 86 FR 29515, June 2, 2021; 87 FR 15886, Mar. 21, 2022; 88 FR 24336, Apr. 20, 2023; 89 FR 23911, Apr. 5, 2024; 90 FR 23442, June 3, 2025]
§ 845.16
Waiver of use of formula to determine civil penalty.
(a) The Director, upon his own initiative or upon written request received within 15 days of issuance of a notice of violation or a cessation order, may waive the use of the formula contained in 30 CFR 845.13 to set the civil penalty, if he or she determines that, taking into account exceptional factors present in the particular case, the penalty is demonstrably unjust. However, the Director shall not waive the use of the formula or reduce the proposed assessment on the basis of an argument that a reduction in the proposed penalty could be used to abate violations of the Act, this chapter, any applicable program, or any condition of any permit or exploration approval. The basis for every waiver shall be fully explained and documented in the records of the case.
(b) If the Director waives the use of the formula, he or she shall use the criteria set forth in 30 CFR 845.13(b) to determine the appropriate penalty. When the Director has elected to waive the use of the formula, he or she shall give a written explanation of the basis for the assessment made to the person to whom the notice or order was issued.
§ 845.17
Procedures for assessment of civil penalties.
(a) Within 15 days of service of a notice or order, the person to whom it was issued may submit written information about the violation to the Office and to the inspector who issued the notice of violation or cessation order. The Office shall consider any information so submitted in determining the facts surrounding the violation and the amount of the penalty.
(b) The Office shall serve a copy of the proposed assessment and of the work sheet showing the computation of
the proposed assessment on the person to whom the notice or order was issued, by certified mail, or by any alternative means consistent with the rules governing service of a summons or complaint under rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, within 30 days of the issuance of the notice or order.
(1) If a copy of the proposed assessment and work sheet or the certified mail is tendered at the address of that person required under 30 CFR 816.11, or at any address at which that person is in fact located, and he or she refuses to accept delivery of or to collect such documents, the requirements of this paragraph shall be deemed to have been complied with upon such tender.
(2) Failure by the Office to serve any proposed assessment within 30 days shall not be grounds for dismissal of all or part of such assessment unless the person against whom the proposed penalty has been assessed—
(i) Proves actual prejudice as a result of the delay; and,
(ii) Makes a timely objection to the delay. An objection shall be timely only if made in the normal course of administrative review.
(c) Unless a conference has been requested, the Office shall review and reassess any penalty if necessary to consider facts which were not reasonably available on the date of issuance of the proposed assessment because of the length of the abatement period. The Office shall serve a copy of any such reassessment and of the worksheet showing the computation of the reassessment in the manner provided in paragraph (b), within 30 days after the date the violation is abated.
[47 FR 35640, Aug. 16, 1982, as amended at 56 FR 28446, June 20, 1991]
§ 845.18
Procedures for assessment conference.
(a) The Office shall arrange for a conference to review the proposed assessment or reassessment, upon written request of the person to whom the notice or order was issued, if the request is received within 30 days from the date the proposed assessment or reassessment is received.
(b)(1) The Office shall assign a conference officer to hold the assessment conference. The assessment conference shall not be governed by section 554 of title 5 of the United States Code, regarding requirements for formal adjudicatory hearings. The assessment conference shall be held within 60 days from the date the conference request is received or the end of the abatement period, whichever is later:
Provided,
That a failure by the Office to hold such conference within 60 days shall not be grounds for dismissal of all or part of an assessment unless the person against whom the proposed penalty has been assessed proves actual prejudice as a result of the delay.
(2) The Office shall post notice of the time and place of the conference at the State or field office closest to the mine at least 5 days before the conference. Any person shall have a right to attend and participate in the conference.
(3) The conference officer shall consider all relevant information on the violation. Within 30 days after the conference is held, the conference officer shall either:
(i) Settle the issues, in which case a settlement agreement shall be prepared and signed by the conference officer on behalf of the Office and by the person assessed; or
(ii) Affirm, raise, lower, or vacate the penalty.
(4) An increase or reduction of a proposed civil penalty assessment of more than 25 percent and more than $500 shall not be final and binding on the Secretary, until approved by the Director or his or her designee.
(c) The conference officer shall promptly serve the person assessed with a notice of his or her action in the manner provided in 30 CFR 845.17(b) and shall include a worksheet if the penalty has been raised or lowered. The reasons for the conference officer's action shall be fully documented in the file.
(d)(1) If a settlement agreement is entered into, the person assessed will be deemed to have waived all rights to further review of the violation or penalty in question, except as otherwise expressly provided for in the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement shall contain a clause to this effect.
(2) If full payment of the amount specified in the settlement agreement is not received by the Office within 30 days after the date of signing, the Office may enforce the agreement or rescind it and proceed according to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) within 30 days from the date of the rescission.
(e) The conference officer may terminate the conference when he or she determines that the issues cannot be resolved or that the person assessed is not diligently working toward resolution of the issues.
(f) At formal review proceedings under sections 518, 521(a)(4), and 525 of the Act, no evidence as to statements made or evidence produced by one party at a conference shall be introduced as evidence by another party or to impeach a witness.
[47 FR 35640, Aug. 16, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 3675, Feb. 8, 1988; 56 FR 10063, Mar. 8, 1991]
§ 845.19
Request for hearing.
(a) The person charged with the violation may contest the proposed penalty or the fact of the violation by submitting a petition and an amount equal to the proposed penalty or, if a conference has been held, the reassessed or affirmed penalty to the Office of Hearings and Appeals (to be held in escrow as provided in paragraph (b) of this section) within 30 days from receipt of the proposed assessment or reassessment or 30 days from the date of service of the conference officer's action, whichever is later. The fact of the violation may not be contested if it has been decided in a review proceeding commenced under 30 CFR 843.16.
(b) The Office of Hearings and Appeals shall transfer all funds submitted under paragraph (a) of this section to the Office, which shall hold them in escrow pending completion of the administrative and judicial review process, at which time it shall disburse them as provided in 30 CFR 845.20.
[47 FR 35640, Aug. 16, 1982, as amended at 56 FR 10063, Mar. 8, 1991]
§ 845.20
Final assessment and payment of penalty.
(a) If the person to whom a notice of violation or cessation order is issued fails to request a hearing as provided in § 845.19, the proposed assessment shall become a final order of the Secretary and the penalty assessed shall become due and payable upon expiration of the time allowed to request a hearing.
(b) If any party requests judicial review of a final order of the Secretary, the proposed penalty shall continue to be held in escrow until completion of the review. Otherwise, subject to paragraph (c) of this section, the escrowed funds shall be transferred to the Office in payment of the penalty, and the escrow shall end.
(c) If the final decision in the administrative and judicial review results in an order reducing or eliminating the proposed penalty assessed under this part, the Office shall within 30 days of receipt of the order refund to the person assessed all or part of the escrowed amount, with interest from the date of payment into escrow to the date of the refund at the rate of 6 percent or at the prevailing Department of the Treasury rate, whichever is greater.
(d) If the review results in an order increasing the penalty, the person to whom the notice or order was issued shall pay the difference to the Office within 15 days after the order is mailed to such person.
§ 845.21
Use of civil penalties for reclamation.
(a) To the extent authorized in the applicable annual appropriations act or other relevant statute, the Director of OSMRE may utilize money collected by the United States pursuant to the assessment of civil penalties under section 518 of the Act for reclamation of lands adversely affected by coal mining practices after August 3, 1977, until such funds are expended.
(b) The Director may allocate funds at his discretion for reclamation projects on lands within any State or on Federal lands or Indian lands based on the following priorities:
(1) Emergency projects as defined in § 700.5 of this chapter;
(2) Reclamation projects which qualify as priority 1 under section 403 of the Act;
(3) Reclamation Projects which qualify as priority 2 under section 403 of the Act; and

§ 846.1
Scope.
This part covers the assessment of individual civil penalties under section 518(f) of the Act.
§ 846.12
When an individual civil penalty may be assessed.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the Office may assess an individual civil penalty against any corporate director, officer or agent of a corporate permittee who knowingly and willfully authorized, ordered or carried out a violation, failure or refusal.
(b) The Office shall not assess an individual civil penalty in situations resulting from a permit violation by a corporate permittee until a cessation order has been issued by the Office to the corporate permittee for the violation, and the cessation order has remained unabated for 30 days.
§ 846.14
Amount of individual civil penalty.
(a) In determining the amount of an individual civil penalty assessed under § 846.12, the Office shall consider the criteria specified in section 518(a) of the Act, including:
(1) The individual's history of authorizing, ordering or carrying out previous violations, failures or refusals at the particular surface coal mining operation;
(2) The seriousness of the violation, failure or refusal (as indicated by the extent of damage and/or the cost of reclamation), including any irreparable harm to the environment and any hazard to the health or safety of the public; and
(3) The demonstrated good faith of the individual charged in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notice of the violation, failure or refusal.
(b) The penalty will not exceed $20,988 for each violation. Each day of a continuing violation may be deemed a separate violation and the Office may assess a separate individual civil penalty for each day the violation, failure or refusal continues, from the date of service of the underlying notice of violation, cessation order or other order incorporated in a final decision issued by the Secretary, until abatement or compliance is achieved.
[53 FR 3675, Feb. 8, 1988, as amended at 62 FR 63277, Nov. 28, 1997; 70 FR 70701, Nov. 22, 2005; 74 FR 34493, July 15, 2009; 79 FR 18448, Apr. 2, 2014; 81 FR 44541, July 8, 2016; 82 FR 9354, Feb. 6, 2017; 83 FR 10616, Mar. 12, 2018; 84 FR 10676, Mar. 22, 2019; 85 FR 20836, Apr. 15, 2020; 86 FR 29515, June 2, 2021; 87 FR 15887, Mar. 21, 2022; 88 FR 24336, Apr. 20, 2023; 89 FR 23911, Apr. 5, 2024; 90 FR 23443, June 3, 2025]
§ 846.17
Procedure for assessment of individual civil penalty.
(a)
Notice.
The Office shall serve on each individual to be assessed an individual civil penalty a notice of proposed individual civil penalty assessment, including a narrative explanation of the reasons for the penalty, the amount to be assessed, and a copy of any underlying notice of violation and cessation order.
(b)
Final order and opportunity for review.
The notice of proposed individual civil penalty assessment shall become a final order of the Secretary 30 days after service upon the individual unless:
(1) The individual files within 30 days of service of the notice of proposed individual civil penalty assessment a petition for review with the Hearings Division, Office of Hearings and Appeals,
U.S. Department of the Interior, 801 North Quincy Street, Arlington, Virginia 22203 (Phone: 703-235-3800), in accordance with 43 CFR 4.1300
et seq.;
or
(2) The Office and the individual or responsible corporate permittee agree within 30 days of service of the notice of proposed individual civil penalty assessment to a schedule or plan for the abatement or correction of the violation, failure or refusal.
(c)
Service.
For purposes of this section, service shall be performed on the individual to be assessed an individual civil penalty, by certified mail, or by any alternative means consistent with the rules governing service of a summons and complaint under rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Service shall be complete upon tender of the notice of proposed assessment and included information or of the certified mail and shall not be deemed incomplete because of refusal to accept.
[53 FR 3675, Feb. 8, 1988, as amended at 56 FR 28446, June 20, 1991; 67 FR 5204, Feb. 5, 2002]
§ 846.18
Payment of penalty.
(a)
No abatement or appeal.
If a notice of proposed individual civil penalty assessment becomes a final order in the absence of a petition for review or abatement agreement, the penalty shall be due upon issuance of the final order.
(b)
Appeal.
If an individual named in a notice of proposed individual civil penalty assessment files a petition for review in accordance with 43 CFR 4.1300
et seq.,
the penalty shall be due upon issuance of a final administrative order affirming, increasing or decreasing the proposed penalty.
(c)
Abatement agreement.
Where the Office and the corporate permittee or individual have agreed in writing on a plan for the abatement of or compliance with the unabated order, an individual named in a notice of proposed individual civil penalty assessment may postpone payment until receiving either a final order from the Office stating that the penalty is due on the date of such final order, or written notice that abatement or compliance is satisfactory and the penalty has been withdrawn.
(d)
Delinquent payment.
Following the expiration of 30 days after the issuance of a final order assessing an individual civil penalty, any delinquent penalty shall be subject to interest at the rate established by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for late charges on late payments to the Federal Government. The Treasury current value of funds rate is published by the Fiscal Service in the notices section of the
Federal Register
and on Treasury's Web site. Interest on unpaid penalties will run from the date payment first was due until the date of payment. Failure to pay overdue penalties may result in one or more of the actions specified in § 870.23(a) through (f) of this chapter. Delinquent penalties are subject to late payment penalties specified in § 870.21(c) of this chapter and processing and handling charges specified in § 870.21(d) of this chapter.

Scope.
This part sets out our procedures to collect fees for the Fund and to report coal production.
[73 FR 67631, Nov. 14, 2008]
§ 870.5
Definitions.
As used in this Part—
Anthracite, bituminous and subbituminous coal
means all coals other than lignite coal.
Calendar quarter
means a 3-month period within a calendar year. The first calendar quarter begins on January 1 of the calendar year and ends on the last day of March. The second calendar quarter begins on the first day of April and ends on the last day of June. The third calendar quarter begins on the first day of July and ends on the last day of September. The fourth calendar quarter begins on the first day of October and ends on the last day of December.
Excess moisture
means the difference between total moisture and inherent moisture, calculated according to § 870.19 for high-rank coals or the difference between total moisture and inherent moisture calculated according to § 870.20 for low-rank coals.
Expended
means that moneys have been obligated, encumbered, or committed for reclamation by contract by the OSM, State, or Tribe for work to be accomplished or services to be rendered.
Fee compliance officer
means any person authorized by the Secretary to exercise authority in matters relating to this part.
In situ coal mining
means activities conducted on the surface or underground in connection with in-place distillation, retorting, leaching or other chemical or physical processing of coal. The term includes, but is not limited to, in situ gasification, in situ leaching, slurry mining, solution mining, bore hole mining, and fluid recovery mining. At this time, part 870 considers only in situ gasification.
Inherent moisture
means moisture that exists as an integral part of the coal seam in its natural state, including water in pores, but excluding that present in macroscopically visible fractures, as determined according to § 870.19(a) or § 870.20(a).
Lignite coal
means consolidated lignite coal having less than 8,300 British thermal units per pound, moist and mineral-matter-free. Moist, mineral-matter free British thermal units per pound are determined by Parr's formula, equation 3, on page 222 of “Standard Specification for Classification of Coals by Rank,” in American Society for Testing and Materials ASTM D 388-77 (Philadelphia, 1977). Parr's formula follows:
Moist, Mn-Free Btu=
(Bu−50S)/[100−(1.08A + 0.55S)] × 100
where:
Mn = Mineral matter
Btu = British thermal units per pound (calorific value)
A = percentage of ash, and
S = percentage of sulfur
“Moist” refers to coal containing its natural inherent or bed moisture, but not including water adhering to the surface of the coal.
Mineral owner
means any person or entity owning 10 percent or more of the mineral estate for a permit. If no single mineral owner meets the 10 percent rule, then the largest single mineral owner shall be considered to be the mineral owner. If there are several persons who have successively transferred the mineral rights, information shall be provided on the last owner(s) in the chain prior to the permittee, i.e. the person or persons who have granted the permittee the right to extract the coal.
Reclaimed coal
means coal recovered from a deposit that is not in its original geological location, such as refuse piles or culm banks or retaining dams and ponds that are or have been used during the mining or preparation process, and stream coal deposits. Reclaimed coal operations are considered to be surface coal mining operations for fee liability and calculation purposes.
Surface coal mining
means the extraction of coal from the earth by removing the materials over the coal seam before recovering the coal and includes auger coal mining. For purposes of subchapter R, reclaiming coal operations are considered surface coal mining.
Ton
means 2,000 pounds avoirdupois (0.90718 metric ton).
Total moisture
means the measure of weight loss in an air atmosphere under rigidly controlled conditions of temperature, time and air flow, as determined according to either § 870.19(a) or § 870.20(a).
Underground coal mining
means the extraction of coal from the earth by developing entries from the surface to the coal seam before recovering the coal by underground extraction methods, and includes in situ mining.
Value
means gross value at the time of initial bona fide sale, transfer of ownership, or use by the operator, but does not include the reclamation fee required by this part.

§ 870.10
Information collection.
In accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3501
et seq.,
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements of part 870 and the OSM-1 Form and assigned control number 1029-0063. The information is used to maintain a record of coal produced nationwide each calendar quarter, the method of coal removal, the type of coal, and the basis for coal tonnage reporting. Persons must respond to meet the requirements of SMCRA. A Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
[73 FR 67631, Nov. 14, 2008]
§ 870.11
Applicability.
The regulations in this part apply to all surface and underground coal mining operations except—
(a) The extraction of coal by a landowner for his own noncommercial use from land owned or leased by him;
(b) The extraction of coal as an incidental part of Federal, State, or local government-financed highway or other construction;
(c) The extraction of coal incidental to the extraction of other minerals where coal does not exceed 16
2/3
percent of the total tonnage of coal and other minerals removed for commercial use or sale
(1) In accordance with part 702 of this chapter for Federal program States and on Indian lands or
(2) In any twelve consecutive months in a State with an approved State program until counterpart regulations pursuant to part 702 of this chapter have been incorporated into the State program and in accordance with such counterpart regulations, thereafter; and
(d) The extraction of less than 250 tons of coal within twelve consecutive months.

§ 870.12
Reclamation fee.
(a) The operator shall pay a reclamation fee on each ton of coal produced
for sale, transfer, or use, including the products of in situ mining.
(b) The fee shall be determined by the weight and value at the time of initial bona fide sale, transfer of ownership, or use by the operator.
(1) The initial bona fide sale, transfer of ownership, or use shall be determined by the first transaction or use of the coal by the operator immediately after it is severed, or removed from a reclaimed coal refuse deposit.
(2) The value of the coal shall be determined F.O.B. mine.
(3) The weight of each ton shall be determined by the actual gross weight of the coal.
(i) Impurities that have not been removed prior to the time of initial bona fide sale, transfer of ownership, or use by the operator, excluding excess moisture for which a reduction has been taken pursuant to § 870.18, shall not be deducted from the gross weight.
(ii) Operators selling coal on a clean coal basis shall retain records that show run-of-mine tonnage, and the basis for the clean coal transaction.
(iii) Insufficient records shall subject the operator to fees based on raw tonnage data.
(c) If the operator combines surface mined coal, including reclaimed coal, with underground mined coal before the coal is weighed for fee purposes, the higher reclamation fee shall apply, unless the operator can substantiate the amount of coal produced by surface mining by acceptable engineering calculations or other reports which the Director may require.
(d) The reclamation fee shall be paid after the end of each calendar quarter beginning with the calendar quarter starting October 1, 1977.

§ 870.18
General rules for calculating excess moisture.
If you are an operator who mined coal after June 1988, you may deduct the weight of excess moisture in the coal to determine reclamation fees you owe under 30 CFR 870.12(b)(3)(i). Excess moisture is the difference between total moisture and inherent moisture. To calculate excess moisture in HIGH-rank coal, follow § 870.19. To calculate excess moisture in LOW-rank coal, follow § 870.20. Report your calculations on the OSM-1 form, Coal Reclamation Fee Report, for every calendar quarter in which you claim a deduction. Some cautions:
(a) You or your customer may do any test required by §§ 870.19 and 870.20. But whoever does a test, you are to keep test results and all related records for at least six years after the test date.
(b) If OSM disallows any or all of an allowance for excess moisture, you must submit an additional fee plus interest computed according to § 870.21(a) and penalties computed according to § 870.21(c).
(c) The following definitions are applicable to §§ 870.19 and 870.20. ASTM standards D4596-93,

In accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3501
et seq.,
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements of part 872 and assigned it control number 1029-0054. The information is used to determine whether States and Indian tribes will be granted funds for reclamation activities. States and Indian tribes must respond to obtain a benefit in accordance with SMCRA. A Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
§ 872.11
Where do moneys in the Fund come from?
Revenue to the Fund includes—
(a) Reclamation fees we collect under section 402 of SMCRA and part 870 of this chapter;

Your distribution of State or Tribal share funds under § 872.14 or § 872.17 plus your distribution of historic coal funds along with unused funds from prior allocations could be more than you need to reclaim your remaining high priority problems. If that occurs, we will reduce the historic coal funds we distribute to you to the amount that you need to fully fund reclamation of all your remaining Priority 1 or 2 coal problems.
(e) We award these funds to you in grants according to the provisions of part 886 of this chapter.
[73 FR 67634, Nov. 14, 2008, as amended at 87 FR 2346, Jan. 14, 2022]
§ 872.23
Are there any restrictions on how you may use historic coal funds?
Yes. You may only use historic coal funds for:
(a) Coal reclamation under § 874.12 of this chapter;
(b) Water supply restoration under § 874.14 of this chapter;
(c) Noncoal reclamation under § 875.12 of this chapter that is requested under section 409(c) of SMCRA;
(d) Deposit into an acid mine drainage abatement and treatment fund under part 876 of this chapter;
(e) Land acquisition under § 879.11 of this chapter; and
(f) Maintenance of the AML inventory under section 403(c) of SMCRA.
§ 872.24
What are Federal expense funds?
“Federal expense funds” are moneys available in the Fund that are not allocated or distributed as State share funds (§ 872.14), Tribal share funds (§ 872.17), historic coal funds (§ 872.21), or minimum program make up funds (§ 872.26). Congress must appropriate Federal expense funds before we may expend them.
§ 872.25
Are there any restrictions on how OSM may use Federal expense funds?
(a) We may use Federal expense funds only for the purposes in sections 402(g)(3)(A) through (D) and 402(g)(4) of SMCRA, which include the following:
(1) The Small Operator Assistance Program under section 507(c) of SMCRA (not more than $10 million annually);
(2) Emergency projects under State, Tribal, and Federal programs under section 410 of SMCRA;
(3) Nonemergency projects in States and on lands within the jurisdiction of Indian tribes that do not have an approved abandoned mine reclamation program under section 405 of SMCRA;
(4) The Secretary's administration of Title IV of SMCRA and this subchapter; and
(5) Projects authorized under section 402(g)(4) in States and on lands within the jurisdiction of Indian tribes that do not have an approved abandoned mine
reclamation program under section 405 of SMCRA.
(b) We will not deduct moneys that we have annually allocated or distributed as Federal expense funds under sections 402(g)(3)(A) through (D) or (4) of SMCRA for any State or Indian tribe from moneys we annually allocate or distribute to a State or Indian tribe under the authority of sections 402(g)(1) or (5) of SMCRA.
(c) We expend moneys under the authority in section 402(g)(3)(C) of SMCRA only in States or on Indian lands where the State or Indian tribe does not have an abandoned mine reclamation program approved under section 405 of SMCRA.
§ 872.26
What are minimum program make up funds?
(a) “Minimum program make up funds” are additional moneys we distribute each Federal fiscal year to eligible States and Indian tribes to make up the difference between their total distribution of other funds and $3 million. The source of these funds is moneys in the Secretary's 20 percent share of the Fund that are authorized for mandatory distribution.
(b) To be eligible to receive funds under this section, you must meet the following criteria:
(1) You must have and maintain an approved reclamation plan under part 884 of this chapter;
(2) You cannot have certified under section 411(a) of SMCRA;
(3) The total amount you receive annually from State share funds (§ 872.14) or Tribal share funds (§ 872.17), historic coal funds (§ 872.21), and prior balance replacement funds (§ 872.29) must be less than $3 million; and
(4) You must need more than the total of funds you will receive from State or Tribal share, historic coal, and prior balance replacement funds to reclaim Priority 1 and 2 coal problems under sections 403(a)(1) and (2) of SMCRA in your State or on Indian lands within your jurisdiction.
(c) We will make funds available to the States of Missouri and Tennessee under this section to reclaim Priority 1 and 2 coal problems included in the AML inventory, provided each State has a reclamation plan approved under part 884 of this chapter.
§ 872.27
How does OSM distribute and award minimum program make up funds?
(a) If you meet the eligibility requirements in § 872.26(b), we will distribute these minimum program make up funds to you as follows:
(1) We calculate your total distribution under this part by first adding, in order, your prior balance replacement funds distribution (§ 872.29), your applicable State or Tribal share funds distribution (§ 872.14 or § 872.17), and your historic coal funds distribution (§ 872.21). If the sum of these funds is less than $3 million, we calculate the amount of minimum program make up funds to add to your distribution under this section to increase it to that level.
(2) For each Federal fiscal year, we add minimum program make up funds to your combined distribution of prior balance replacement, State or Tribal share, and historic coal funds as shown in the following table:
For each of the Federal fiscal years beginning . . .
The amount of minimum program make up funds we add to your distribution will be . . .
(i) October 1, 2007 and October 1, 2008
50 percent of the amount that we calculated should be added under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(ii) October 1, 2009 and October 1, 2010
75 percent of the amount that we calculated should be added under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(iii) October 1, 2011 and continuing through September 30, 2035
100 percent of the amount that we calculated should be added under paragraph (a)(1) of this section as long as you have at least $3 million of Priority 1 and 2 coal problems remaining.
(iv) October 1, 2035 and thereafter
to the extent funds are available, 100 percent of the amount that we calculated should be added under paragraph (a)(1) until you have less than $3 million of Priority 1 and 2 coal problems remaining.
(b) We award these funds to you in grants according to the provisions of part 886 of this chapter.
[73 FR 67634, Nov. 14, 2008, as amended at 87 FR 2346, Jan. 14, 2022]
§ 872.28
Are there any restrictions on how you may use minimum program make up funds?
Yes. You may only use minimum program make up funds for:
(a) Priority 1 and 2 coal reclamation under sections 403(a)(1) and (2) of SMCRA;
(b) Priority 3 reclamation that is part of Priority 1 or 2 coal reclamation under sections 403(a)(1) or (2) of SMCRA and § 874.13 of this chapter;
§ 872.29
What are prior balance replacement funds?
“Prior balance replacement funds” are moneys we must distribute to you instead of the moneys we allocated to your State or Tribal share of the Fund before October 1, 2007, but did not distribute to you because Congress did not appropriate them. They come from general funds of the United States Treasury that are otherwise unappropriated. Under section 411(h)(1) of SMCRA, we distribute prior balance replacement funds to you, the State or Indian tribe, for seven years starting in the Federal fiscal year beginning October 1, 2008.
§ 872.30
How does OSM distribute and award prior balance replacement funds?
(a) We distribute prior balance replacement funds to you as follows:
(1) In an amount equal to the aggregate, unappropriated amount allocated to you before October 1, 2007, under sections 402(g)(1)(A) or (B) of SMCRA;
(2) If you are, or are not, certified under section 411(a) of SMCRA; and
(3) Subject to § 872.35, in seven equal annual installments beginning with the 2008 Federal fiscal year which starts on October 1, 2007.
(b) We award these funds to you in grants according to the provisions of part 885 of this chapter for certified States and Indian tribes or part 886 of this chapter for uncertified States and Indian tribes.
(c) At the same time we distribute prior balance replacement funds to you under this section, we transfer the same amount to historic coal funds from moneys in your State or Tribal share of the Fund that were allocated to you before October 1, 2007. The transferred funds will be available for annual grants under § 872.21 for the Federal fiscal year beginning October 1, 2035, and annually thereafter. We will allocate, distribute, and award the transferred funds according to the provisions of §§ 872.21, 872.22, and 872.23.
[73 FR 67634, Nov. 14, 2008, as amended at 87 FR 2346, Jan. 14, 2022]
§ 872.31
Are there any restrictions on how you may use prior balance replacement funds?
(a) Yes. If you are certified under section 411(a) of SMCRA, you may only use prior balance replacement funds for those purposes your State legislature or Tribal council establishes, giving priority to addressing the impacts of mineral development.
(b) Yes. If you are not certified under section 411(a) of SMCRA, you may only use prior balance replacement funds for the purposes in section 403 of SMCRA, which include:
(1) Reclamation of coal problems under § 874.12 of this chapter;
(2) Water supply restoration under § 874.14 of this chapter; and
(3) Maintenance of the AML inventory.
§ 872.32
What are certified in lieu funds?
“Certified in lieu funds” are moneys that we distribute to you, the certified State or Indian tribe, in lieu of moneys allocated to your State or Tribal share of the Fund after October 1, 2007. Certified in lieu funds come from general funds of the United States Treasury that are otherwise unappropriated. Beginning with the 2009 Federal fiscal year which starts on October 1, 2008, we distribute certified in lieu funds to you under section 411(h)(2) of SMCRA.
§ 872.33
How does OSM distribute and award certified in lieu funds?
(a) You must be certified under section 411(a) of SMCRA to receive certified in lieu funds.
(b) If you meet the eligibility requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, we distribute these certified in lieu funds to you as follows:
(1) Starting in the Federal fiscal year that begins on October 1, 2008, we annually distribute funds to you based on 50
percent of reclamation fees received for coal produced during the previous Federal fiscal year in your State or on Indian lands within your jurisdiction;
(2) The funds we annually distribute to you are in lieu of moneys we otherwise would distribute to you from State share funds under § 872.14 or Tribal share funds under § 872.17 had you not been excluded from receiving those funds under section 401(f)(3)(B) of SMCRA; and
(3) Subject to § 872.35, we annually distribute certified in lieu funds to you as shown in the following table:
In the Federal fiscal year(s) beginning on . . .
The amount of certified in lieu funds we annually distribute to you will be equal to . . .
(i) October 1, 2008
25 percent of your 50 percent share of annual reclamation fee collections.
(ii) October 1, 2009
50 percent of your 50 percent share of annual reclamation fee collections.
(iii) October 1, 2010
75 percent of your 50 percent share of annual reclamation fee collections.
(iv) October 1, 2011, and thereafter
100 percent of your 50 percent share of annual reclamation fee collections.
(c) We award these funds to you in grants according to the provisions of part 885 of this chapter.
(d) At the same time we distribute certified in lieu funds to you under this section, we transfer the same amount to historic coal funds and make those funds available for annual grants under § 872.21 that same Federal fiscal year. We allocate, distribute, and award the transferred funds according to the provisions of §§ 872.21, 872.22, and 872.23.
(e) We will distribute to you the amounts we withhold under paragraph (b) of this section in two equal annual installments. We will do this in Federal fiscal years 2018 and 2019.
§ 872.34
Are there any restrictions on how you may use certified in lieu funds?
There are no limitations or restrictions on the use of certified in lieu funds in the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act Amendments of 2006 which were enacted as Division C, Title II, Subtitle A of P.L. 109-432.
§ 872.35
When will OSM reduce the amount of prior balance replacement funds or certified in lieu funds distributed to you?
(a) In any fiscal year in which the amount of Treasury funds required to be transferred under §§ 872.30 and 872.33 of this chapter and under section 402(i)(1) of SMCRA exceeds the maximum annual limit of $490 million, we will adjust the amount of these payments to reduce them to the level of the cap. Each distribution or transfer for the FY will be reduced by the same percentage.
(b) We will not include amounts under section 402(h)(5)(A) as part of this calculation.

(c) Coal reclamation projects by certified States and Indian tribes required to maintain certification under section 411(a) of SMCRA and the agreement required by §§ 875.13(a)(3) and 875.14(b) of this chapter to maintain that certification.
[73 FR 67639, Nov. 14, 2008]
§ 874.12
Eligible coal lands and water.
Coal lands and water are eligible for reclamation activities if—
(a) They were mined for coal or affected by coal mining processes;
(b) They were mined prior to August 3, 1977, and left or abandoned in either an unreclaimed or inadequately reclaimed condition; and
(c) There is no continuing responsibility for reclamation by the operator, permittee, or agent of the permittee under statutes of the State or Federal government, or as a result of bond forfeiture. Bond forfeiture will render lands or water ineligible only if the amount forfeited is sufficient to pay the total cost of the necessary reclamation. In cases where the forfeited bond is insufficient to pay the total cost of reclamation, additional moneys
from the Fund or any prior balance replacement funds provided under § 872.29 of this chapter may be used.
(d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, coal lands and waters in a State or on Indian lands damaged and abandoned after August 3, 1977, by coal mining processes are also eligible for funding if the Secretary finds in writing that:
(1) They were mined for coal or affected by coal mining processes; and
(2) The mining occurred and the site was left in either an unreclaimed or inadequately reclaimed condition between August 4, 1977, and:
(i) The date on which the Secretary approved a State regulatory program pursuant to section 503 of the Act (30 U.S.C. 1253) for a State or September 28, 1994, for an Indian tribe, and that any funds for reclamation or abatement that are available pursuant to a bond or other form of financial guarantee or from any other source are not sufficient to provide for adequate reclamation or abatement at the site; or
(ii) November 5, 1990, that the surety of the mining operator became insolvent during such period and that, as of November 5, 1990, funds immediately available from proceedings relating to such insolvency or from any financial guarantee or other source are not sufficient to provide for adequate reclamation or abatement at the site; and
(3) The site qualifies as a priority 1 or 2 site pursuant to section 403(a)(1) and (2) of the Act. Priority will be given to those sites that are in the immediate vicinity of a residential area or that have an adverse economic impact upon a community.
(e) An uncertified State or Indian tribe may expend funds made available under paragraphs 402(g)(1) and (5) of SMCRA and prior balance replacement funds under section 411(h)(1) of SMCRA for the reclamation and abatement of any site eligible under paragraph (d) of this section, if the State or Indian tribe, with the concurrence of the Secretary, makes the findings required in paragraph (d) of this section and the State or Indian tribe determines that the reclamation priority of the site is the same or more urgent than the reclamation priority for the lands and water eligible under paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section that qualify as a Priority 1 or 2 site under section 403(a) of SMCRA.
(f) With respect to lands eligible under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, moneys available from sources outside the Fund or that are ultimately recovered from responsible parties must either be used to offset the cost of the reclamation or transferred to the Fund if not required for further reclamation activities at the permitted site.
(g) If reclamation of a site covered by an interim or permanent program permit is carried out under the Abandoned Mine Land Program, the permittee of the site shall reimburse the Abandoned Mine Land Fund for the cost of reclamation that is in excess of any bond forfeited to ensure reclamation. Neither the Secretary nor a State or Indian tribe performing reclamation under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section shall be held liable for any violations of any performance standards or reclamation requirements specified in Title V of the Act nor shall a reclamation activity undertaken on such lands or waters be held to any standards set forth in Title V of the Act.
(h) Surface coal mining operations on lands eligible for remining pursuant to section 404 of the Act shall not affect the eligibility of such lands for reclamation activities after the release of the bonds or deposits posted by any such operation as provided by § 800.40 of this chapter. If the bond or deposit for a surface coal mining operation on lands eligible for remining is forfeited, funds available under this title may be used if the amount of such bond or deposit is not sufficient to provide for adequate reclamation or abatement, except that if conditions warrant the Secretary shall immediately exercise his/her authority under section 410 of the Act.

§ 874.13
Reclamation objectives and priorities.
(a) When you conduct reclamation projects under this part you may follow OSM's “Final Guidelines for Reclamation Programs and Projects” (66
FR 31250, June 11, 2001) and the expenditures must reflect the following priorities in the order stated:
(1)
Priority 1:
The protection of public health, safety, and property from extreme danger of adverse effects of coal mining practices, including the restoration of land and water resources and the environment that:
(i) Have been degraded by the adverse effects of coal mining practices; and
(ii) Are adjacent to a site that has been or will be addressed to protect the public health, safety, and property from extreme danger of adverse effects of coal mining practices.
(2)
Priority 2:
The protection of public health and safety from adverse effects of coal mining practices, including the restoration of land and water resources and the environment that:
(i) Have been degraded by the adverse effects of coal mining practices; and
(ii) Are adjacent to a site that has been or will be addressed to protect the public health and safety from adverse effects of coal mining practices.
(3)
Priority 3:
The restoration of land and water resources and the environment previously degraded by adverse effects of coal mining practices, including measures for the conservation and development of soil, water (excluding channelization), woodland, fish and wildlife, recreation resources, and agricultural productivity. Priority 3 land and water resources that are geographically contiguous with existing or remediated Priority 1 or 2 problems will be considered adjacent under paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
(b) This paragraph applies to State or Tribal share funds available under §§ 872.14 and 872.17 of this chapter and historic coal funds available under § 872.21 of this chapter. You may expend these funds to reclaim Priority 3 lands and waters, if either of the following conditions applies:
(1) You have completed all of the Priority 1 and Priority 2 reclamation in the jurisdiction of your State or Indian tribe; or
(2) The expenditure for Priority 3 reclamation is made in conjunction with the expenditure of funds for Priority 1 or Priority 2 reclamation projects including past, current, and future Priority 1 or Priority 2 reclamation projects. Expenditures under this paragraph must either:
(i) Facilitate the Priority 1 or Priority 2 reclamation; or
(ii) Provide reasonable savings towards the objective of reclaiming all Priority 3 land and water problems within the jurisdiction of your State or Indian tribe.
[73 FR 67639, Nov. 14, 2008]
§ 874.14
Water supply restoration.
(a) Any State or Indian tribe that has not certified completion of all coal-related reclamation under section 411(a) of SMCRA may expend funds under §§ 872.16, 872.19, 872.23, and 872.31 of this chapter for water supply restoration projects. For purposes of this section, “water supply restoration projects” are those that protect, repair, replace, construct, or enhance facilities related to water supplies, including water distribution facilities and treatment plants that have been adversely affected by coal mining practices. For funds awarded before December 20, 2006, any uncertified State or Indian tribe may expend up to 30 percent of the funds distributed to it for water supply restoration projects.
(b) If the adverse effect on water supplies referred to in this section occurred both prior to and after August 3, 1977, the project shall remain eligible, notwithstanding the criteria specified in 30 CFR 874.12(b), if the State or Indian tribe finds in writing, as part of its eligibility opinion, that such adverse affects are due predominately to effects of mining processes undertaken and abandoned prior to August 3, 1977.
(c) If the adverse effect on water supplies referred to in this section occurred both prior to and after the dates (and under the criteria) set forth under section 402(g)(4)(B) of the Act, the project shall remain eligible, notwithstanding the criteria specified in 30 CFR 874.12(b), if the State or Indian tribe finds in writing, as part of its eligibility opinion, that such adverse effects are due predominately to the effects of mining processes undertaken and abandoned prior to those dates.
(d) Enhancement of facilities or utilities under this section shall include upgrading necessary to meet any local,
State, or Federal public health or safety requirement. Enhancement shall not include, however, any service area expansion of a utility or facility not necessary to address a specific abandoned mine land problem.

§ 874.15
Limited liability.
No State or Indian tribe shall be liable under any provision of Federal law for any costs or damages as a result of action taken or omitted in the course of carrying out an approved State or Indian tribe abandoned mine reclamation plan. This section shall not preclude liability for costs or damages as a result of gross negligence or intentional misconduct by the State or Indian tribe. For purposes of this section, reckless, willful, or wanton misconduct shall constitute gross negligence or intentional misconduct.

§ 874.17
AML agency procedures for reclamation projects receiving less than 50 percent government funding.
This section tells you, the AML agency, what to do when considering an abandoned mine land reclamation project as government-financed construction under part 707 of this chapter. This section only applies if the level of funding for the construction will be less than 50 percent of the total cost because of planned coal extraction.
(a)
Consultation with the Title V regulatory authority.
In consultation with the Title V regulatory authority, you must make the following determinations:
(1) You must determine the likelihood of the coal being mined under a Title V permit. This determination must take into account available information such as:
(i) Coal reserves from existing mine maps or other sources;
(ii) Existing environmental conditions;
(iii) All prior mining activity on or adjacent to the site;
(iv) Current and historic coal production in the area; and
(v) Any known or anticipated interest in mining the site.
(2) You must determine the likelihood that nearby or adjacent mining activities might create new environmental problems or adversely affect existing environmental problems at the site.
(3) You must determine the likelihood that reclamation activities at the site might adversely affect nearby or adjacent mining activities.
(b)
Concurrence with the Title V regulatory authority.
If, after consulting with the Title V regulatory authority, you decide to proceed with the reclamation project, then you and the Title V regulatory authority must concur in the following determinations:
(1) You must concur in a determination of the limits on any coal refuse, coal waste, or other coal deposits which can be extracted under the part 707 exemption or counterpart State/Indian Tribe laws and regulations.
(2) You must concur in the delineation of the boundaries of the AML project.
(c)
Documentation.
You must include in the AML case file:
(1) The determinations made under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section;
(2) The information taken into account in making the determinations; and
(3) The names of the parties making the determinations.
(d)
Special requirements.
For each project, you must:
(1) Characterize the site in terms of mine drainage, active slides and slide-
prone areas, erosion and sedimentation, vegetation, toxic materials, and hydrologic balance;
(2) Ensure that the reclamation project is conducted in accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR subchapter R;
(3) Develop specific-site reclamation requirements, including performance bonds when appropriate in accordance with State procedures; and

§ 875.10
Information collection.
In accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3501
et seq.,
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements of part 875 and assigned it control number 1029-0103. This information establishes procedures and requirements for State and Indian tribes to conduct noncoal reclamation under abandoned mine land funding. The information is needed to assure compliance with SMCRA and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. Persons must respond to obtain a benefit. A Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
[73 FR 67640, Nov. 14, 2008]
§ 875.11
Applicability.
(a) If you are a State or Indian tribe that has not certified under section 411(a) of SMCRA, you must follow these noncoal reclamation requirements when you use State share funds under § 872.16, Tribal share funds under § 872.19, or historic coal funds under § 872.23 to conduct reclamation projects on lands or water affected by mining of minerals and materials other than coal.
(b) If you are a State or Indian tribe that has certified under section 411(a) of the Act—
(1) You must use State share or Tribal share funds distributed to you under section 402(g)(1) of the Act before October 1, 2007, in accordance with this part; and
(2) You may use prior balance replacement funds distributed to you under section 411(h)(1) of the Act, certified in lieu funds distributed to you under section 411(h)(2) of the Act, or both, to—
(i) Maintain certification as required by §§ 875.13 and 875.14 of this part; or
(ii) Conduct a noncoal reclamation project in accordance with the requirements of this part.
[73 FR 67640, Nov. 14, 2008, as amended at 80 FR 6446, Feb. 5, 2015]
§ 875.12
Eligible lands and water prior to certification.
Noncoal lands and water are eligible for reclamation if:
(a) They were mined or affected by mining processes;
(b) They were mined and left or abandoned in either an unreclaimed or inadequately reclaimed condition prior to August 3, 1977;
(c) There is no continuing responsibility for reclamation by the operator, permittee, or agent of the permittee under statutes of the State or Federal Government or by the State as a result of bond forfeiture. Bond forfeiture will render lands or water ineligible only if the amount forfeited is sufficient to pay the total cost of the necessary reclamation. In cases where the forfeited bond is insufficient to pay the total cost of reclamation, moneys sufficient to complete the reclamation may be sought under part 886 of this chapter;
(d) The reclamation has been requested by the Governor of the State or equivalent head of the Indian tribe; and
(e) The reclamation is necessary to protect the public health, safety, general welfare, and property from extreme danger of adverse effects of noncoal mining practices.
[59 FR 28172, May 31, 1994, as amended at 73 FR 67640, Nov. 14, 2008]
§ 875.13
Certification of completion of coal sites.
(a) The Governor of a State, or the equivalent head of an Indian tribe, may submit to the Secretary a certification of completion of coal sites. The certification must express the finding that the State or Indian tribe has achieved all existing known coal-related reclamation objectives for eligible lands and waters under section 404 of SMCRA or has instituted the necessary processes to reclaim any remaining coal related problems. In addition to the above finding, the certification of completion must contain:
(1) A description of both the rationale and the process used to arrive at the above finding for the completion of all coal-related reclamation under section 403(a)(1) through (3).
(2) A brief summary and resolution of all relevant public comments concerning coal-related impacts, problems, and reclamation projects received by the State or Indian tribe prior to preparation of the certification of completion.
(3) A State or Indian tribe agreement to acknowledge and give top priority to any coal-related problem(s) that may be found or occur after submission of the certification of completion and during the life of the approved abandoned mine reclamation program.
(b) After review and verification of the information contained in the certification of completion, the Director shall provide notice in the
Federal Register
and opportunity for public comment. After receipt and evaluation of all public comments and a determination by the Director that the certification is correct, the Director shall concur with the certification and provide final notice of such concurrence in the
Federal Register.
This concurrence shall be based upon the State's or Indian tribes commitment to give top priority to any coal problem which may thereafter be found or occur.
(c) Following concurrence by the Director, a State or Indian tribe may implement a noncoal reclamation program pursuant to provisions in section 411 of SMCRA.
(d) The Director may, on his or her own initiative, make the certification referred to in paragraph (a) of this section on behalf of your State or Indian tribe if:
(1) Based upon information contained in the AML inventory, the Director determines that all coal reclamation projects meeting the priorities described in § 874.13(a) of this chapter in the jurisdiction of your State or Indian tribe have been completed; and
(2) Before making any determination, the Director provides the public an opportunity to comment through a notice in the
Federal Register.

§ 875.14
Eligible lands and water after certification.
(a) Following certification, eligible noncoal lands, waters, and facilities are those—
(1) Which were mined or processed for minerals or which were affected by
such mining or processing, and abandoned or left in an inadequate reclamation status before August 3, 1977. However, for Federal lands, waters, and facilities under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service, the eligibility date is August 28, 1974. For Federal lands, waters and facilities under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management, the eligibility date is November 26, 1980; and
(2) For which there is no continuing reclamation responsibility under State or other Federal laws.
(b) If eligible coal problems are found or occur after certification, you must submit to us a plan that describes the approach and funds that will be used to address those problems in a timely manner. You may address any eligible coal problems with the certified in lieu funds that you have already received or will receive from § 872.32 of this chapter. You may also use the prior balance replacement funds received from § 872.29 of this chapter to address coal problems subsequent to certification. Any coal reclamation projects that you do must conform to sections 401 through 410 of SMCRA and part 874 of this chapter.

Enhancement shall not include, however, any service area expansion of a utility or facility not necessary to address a specific abandoned mine land problem.
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section, where the Governor of a State or the equivalent head of an Indian tribe, after determining that there is a need for activities or construction of specific public facilities related to the coal or minerals industry in States or on Tribal lands impacted by coal or minerals development, submits a grant application as required by paragraph (e) of this section and the Director concurs in such need, as set forth in paragraph (f) of this section, the Director may grant funds made available under section 402(g)(1) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1232, to carry out such activities or construction.
(e) To qualify for funding pursuant to the authority in paragraph (d) of this section, a State or Indian tribe must submit a grant application that specifically sets forth:
(1) The need or urgency for the activity or the construction of the public facility;
(2) The expected impact the project will have on the coal or minerals industry in the State or Indian tribe;
(3) The availability of funding from other sources and, if other funding is provided, its percentage of the total costs involved;
(4) Documentation from other local, State, and Federal agencies with oversight for such utilities or facilities regarding what funding resources they have available and why this specific project is not being fully funded by their agency;
(5) The impact on the State or Indian tribe, the public, and the minerals industry if the activity or facility is not funded;
(6) The reason why this project should be selected before a priority project relating to the protection of the public health and safety or the environment from the damages caused by past mining activities; and
(7) An analysis and review of the procedures used by the State or Indian tribe to notify and involve the public in this funding request and a copy of all comments received and their resolution by the State or Indian tribe.
(f) After review of the information contained in the application, the Director will, if necessary to ensure adequate public notification, prepare a
Federal Register
notice regarding the State's or Indian Tribe's submission and provide for public comment. The Director will then:
(1) Evaluate any comments received;
(2) Determine whether the funding meets the requirements of this part;
(3) Determine whether the funding is in the best interest of the State or Indian tribe AML program;
(4) If the determinations under paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section are positive, approve the request for funding the activity or construction; and
(5) Approve funding under paragraph (f)(4) of this section only at a cost commensurate with its benefits towards achieving the purposes of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.

[73 FR 67641, Nov. 14, 2008]
§ 879.11
Land eligible for acquisition.
(a)(1) We may acquire land adversely affected by past coal mining practices with moneys from the Fund.
(2) You, an uncertified State or Indian tribe or a certified State or Indian tribe conducting noncoal reclamation projects under part 875 of this chapter, may acquire land adversely affected by past coal mining practices with moneys from the Fund or with prior balance replacement funds and certified in lieu funds provided under §§ 872.29 and 872.32 of this chapter, provided that we first approve the acquisition in writing.
(3) Before acquiring land under paragraph (a)(1) of this section or approving land acquisition under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, we must make a finding
that the land acquisition is necessary for successful reclamation and that—
(i) The acquired land will serve recreation, historic, conservation, and reclamation purposes or provide open space benefits after restoration, reclamation, abatement, control, or prevention of the adverse effects of past coal mining practices; and
(ii) Permanent facilities will be constructed on the land for the restoration, reclamation, abatement, control, or prevention of the adverse effects of past coal mining practices. For the purposes of this paragraph, “permanent facility” means any structure that is built, installed, or established to serve a particular purpose or any manipulation or modification of the site that is designed to remain after the reclamation activity is completed, such as a relocated stream channel or diversion ditch.
(b) You, an uncertified State or Indian tribe or a certified State or Indian tribe conducting noncoal reclamation projects under part 875 of this chapter, if approved in advance by us, may acquire coal refuse disposal sites, including the coal refuse, with moneys from the Fund and with prior balance replacement funds and certified in lieu funds provided under §§ 872.29 and 872.32 of this chapter. We, OSMRE, also may use moneys from the Fund to acquire coal refuse disposal sites, including the coal refuse.
(1) Before the approval of the acquisition, the reclamation program seeking to acquire the site will make a finding in writing that the acquisition is necessary for successful reclamation and will serve the purposes of the reclamation program.
(2) Where an emergency situation exists and a written finding as set forth in § 877.14 of this chapter has been made, we may acquire lands where public ownership is necessary and will prevent recurrence of the adverse effects of past coal mining practices.
(c) Land adversely affected by past coal mining practices may be acquired by us if the acquisition is an integral and necessary element of an economically feasible plan or project to construct or rehabilitate housing which meets the specific requirements in section 407(h) of SMCRA.
(d) Land or interests in land needed to fill voids, seal abandoned tunnels, shafts, and entryways or reclaim surface impacts of underground or surface mines may be acquired by the OSM, State, or Indian tribe if OSM finds that acquisition is necessary under part 875 of this chapter.
(e) The OSM, State, or Indian tribe which acquires land under this part shall acquire only such interests in the land as are necessary for the reclamation work planned or the postreclamation use of the land. Interests in improvements on the land, mineral rights, or associated water rights may be acquired if—
(1) The customary practices and laws of the State in which the land is located will not allow severance of such interests from the surface estate; or
(2) Such interests are necessary for the reclamation work planned or for the postreclamation use of the land; and
(3) Adequate written assurances cannot be obtained from the owner of the severed interest that future use will not be in conflict with the reclamation to be accomplished.

(2) A department, agency, or instrumentality of a State; or
(3) Any public body or nonprofit organization designated by a State.
(g)(1) OSM may sell or authorize the States or Indian tribes to sell land acquired under this part by public sale if—
(i) Such land is suitable for industrial, commercial, residential, or recreational development;
(ii) Such development is consistent with local, State, of Federal land use plans for the area in which the land is located; and
(iii) Retention by OSM, State, or Indian tribe, or disposal under other
paragraphs of this section is not in the public interest.
(2) Disposal procedures will be in accordance with section 407(g) of the Act and applicable State or Indian tribal requirements.
(3) States may transfer title or administrative responsibility for land to cities, municipalities, or quasi-governmental bodies, provided that the State provide for the reverter of the title or administrative responsibility if the land is no longer used for the purposes originally proposed.
(h) You must return all moneys received from disposal of land under this part to us. We will handle all moneys received under this paragraph as unused funds in accordance with §§ 885.19 and 886.20 of this chapter.

§ 882.1
Scope.
This part authorizes reclamation on private land and establishes procedures for recovery of the cost of reclamation activities conducted on privately owned land by the OSM, State, or Indian tribe.
§ 882.10
Information collection.
In accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3501
et seq.,
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements of part 882 and assigned it control number 1029-0057. This information is being collected to meet the mandate of section 408 of SMCRA, which allows the State or Indian tribe to file liens on private property that has been reclaimed under certain conditions. This information will be used by the regulatory authority to ensure that the State or Indian tribe has sufficient programmatic capability to file liens to recover costs for reclaiming private lands. States and Indian tribes are required to respond to obtain a benefit in accordance with SMCRA. A Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
[73 FR 67642, Nov. 14, 2008]
§ 882.12
Appraisals.
(a) A notarized appraisal of private land to be reclaimed which may be subject to a lien under § 882.13 shall be obtained from an independent appraiser. The appraisal shall state—
(1) The estimated market value of the property in its unreclaimed condition; and
(2) The estimated market value of the property as reclaimed.
(b) This appraisal shall be made prior to start of reclamation activities. The agency shall furnish to the appraiser information of sufficient detail in the form of plans, factual data, specifications, etc., to make such appraisals. When reclamation requires more than 6 months to complete, an updated appraisal under paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall be made to determine if the increase in value as originally appraised has actually occurred. Such updated appraisal shall not include any increase in value of the land as unreclaimed. If the updated appraised value results in lower increase in value, such increase shall be used as a basis for the lien. However, an increase in value resulting from the updated appraisal shall not be considered in determining a lien. OSM shall provide appraisal standards for Federal projects, and the State or Indian tribes shall provide appraisal standards for State or Indian tribal projects consistent with generally acceptable appraisal practice.
§ 882.13
Liens.
(a) OSM, State, or Indian tribe has the discretionary authority to place or waive a lien against land reclaimed if the reclamation results in a significant increase in the fair market value; except that—
(1) A lien must not be placed against the property of a surface owner who did not consent to, participate in or exercise control over the mining operation which necessitated the reclamation work.
(2) The basis for making a determination of what constitutes a significant increase in market value or what factual situation constitutes a waiver of lien will be made by OSM, State, or Indian tribe pursuant to the Congressional intent expressed in section 408 of the Act and consistent with State or Indian tribal laws governing liens.
(3) A lien may be waived if findings made prior to construction indicate that the reclamation work to be performed on private land shall primarily benefit the health, safety, or environmental values of the greater community or area in which the land is located; or if the reclamation is necessitated by an unforeseen occurrence, and the work performed to restore that land will not result in a significant increase in the market value of the land as it existed immediately before the unforeseen occurrence; and
(4) OSM, State, or Indian tribe may waive the lien if the cost of filing it, including indirect costs to OSM, State, or Indian tribe, exceeds the increase in fair market value as a result of reclamation activities.
(b) If a lien is to be filed, the OSM, State, or Indian tribe shall, within 6 months after the completion of the reclamation work, file a statement in the office having responsibility under applicable law for recording judgments and placing liens against land. Such statement shall consist of notarized copies of the appraisals obtained under § 882.12 and may include an account of moneys expended for the reclamation work. The amount reported to be the increase in value of the property shall constitute the lien to be recorded in compliance with existing Federal, State or Indian tribal laws:
Provided, however,
That prior to the time of the actual filing of the proposed lien, the landowner shall be notified of the amount of the proposed lien and shall be allowed a reasonable time to prepay that amount instead of allowing the lien to be filed against the property involved.
(c) Within 60 days after the lien is filed the landowner may petition under local law to determine the increase in market value of the land as a result of reclamation work. Any aggrieved party may appeal in the manner provided by local law.
[47 FR 28599, June 30, 1982, as amended at 73 FR 67642, Nov. 14, 2008]
§ 882.14
Satisfaction of liens.
(a) A lien placed on private property shall be satisfied, to the extent of the value of the consideration received, at the time of transfer of ownership. Any unsatisfied portion shall remain as a lien on the property.
(b) The OSM, State, or Indian tribe which files a lien on private property shall maintain or renew it from time to time as may be required under State or local law.
(c) Moneys derived from the satisfaction of liens established under this part shall be deposited in the appropriate abandoned mine reclamation fund account.

(b) We will not award an amount greater than the total funds distributed to your State or Indian tribe in the current annual fund distribution, less any previous awards of current year funds, plus any funds distributed to you in previous years but not awarded, plus any unexpended funds recovered from previous grants and made available to you under § 886.20 of this chapter.
(c) Funds for the current fiscal year are available for award after the annual fund distribution described in § 872.13 of this chapter.
(d) Whenever you request it, we will give you information on the amounts and types of funds that are currently available to you.
§ 886.14
How long will my grant be?
(a) We approve a grant period on the basis of the information contained in the grant application showing that projects to be funded will fulfill the objectives of SMCRA and the approved reclamation plan.
(b) The grant period is normally for 3 years.
(c) We may extend the grant period at your request. We normally approve one extension for up to one additional year.
(d) The grant period for funding your administrative costs does not normally exceed the first year of the grant.
(e) We award grants containing State or Tribal share funds distributed to you in Fiscal Years 2008, 2009, or 2010 for a budget period of five or three years at your request.
§ 886.15
How do I apply for a grant?
(a) You must use application forms and procedures specified by OSM.
(b) We approve or disapprove your grant application within 60 days of receipt.
(c) If we do not approve your application, we inform you in writing of the reasons for disapproval. We may propose modifications if appropriate. You may resubmit the application or appropriate revised portions of the application. We process the revised application as an original application.
(d) You must agree to carry out activities funded by the grant in accordance with SMCRA, applicable Federal laws and regulations, and applicable OMB and Treasury Circulars.
(e) We do not require complete copies of plans and specifications for projects either before the grant is approved or at the start of the project. However, after the start of the project, we may review your plans and specifications at your office, the project site, or any other appropriate site.
§ 886.16
After OSM approves my grant, what responsibilities do I have?
(a) When we award your grant, we send you a written grant agreement stating the terms of the grant.
(b) After you are awarded a grant, you may assign functions and funds to other Federal, State, or local agencies. However, we will hold you responsible for the overall administration of that grant, including the proper use of funds and reporting.
(c) The grant award constitutes an obligation of Federal funds. You accept the grant and its conditions once you
initiate work under the agreement or draw down awarded funds.
(d) Although we have approved the grant agreement, you must not expend any construction funds until you receive a written authorization to proceed with reclamation on the individual project. Our Authorization to Proceed ensures that both you and we have taken all actions necessary to ensure compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321
et seq.
) and any other applicable laws, clearances, permits, or requirements.
(e) You must enter coal problems in the AML inventory before you expend funds on design or construction activities for a site. We must approve any amendments to the AML inventory made after December 20, 2006. For purposes of this section, we define “amendment” as any coal problem added to the AML inventory in a new or existing problem area and any Priority 3 coal problem in the AML inventory that is elevated to either Priority 1 or Priority 2 status.
(1) For emergency projects conducted under section 410 of SMCRA, our finding that an emergency condition exists constitutes our approval for the abandoned mine lands problem to be entered into the AML inventory.
(2) We must approve amendments to the AML inventory for non-emergency coal problems before you, the State or Indian tribe, begin project development or design or use funds for construction activities. In projects where development and design is minimal, this approval may occur during the Authorization to Proceed process.
(f) To the extent technologically and economically feasible, you must use fuel other than petroleum or natural gas for all public facilities that are planned, constructed, or modified in whole or in part with abandoned mine land grant funds.
(g) You must not expend more funds than we have awarded. Our award of any grant does not commit or obligate the United States to award any continuation grant or to enter into any grant revision, including grant increases to cover cost overruns.
§ 886.17
How can my grant be amended?
(a) A grant amendment is a change of the terms or conditions of the grant agreement. An amendment may be initiated by you or by us.
(b) You must promptly notify us in writing, or we must promptly notify you in writing, of events or proposed changes that may require a grant amendment.
(c) All procedures for grant amendments follow 43 CFR part 12.
(d) We must approve or disapprove the amendment within 30 days of receiving your request.
§ 886.18
What audit and administrative requirements must I meet?
(a) You must comply with the audit requirements of the OMB Circular A-133.
(b) You must follow administrative procedures governing grant payments, property, and related requirements contained in 43 CFR part 12.
§ 886.19
How must I account for grant funds?
You must do all of the following in accordance with the requirements of 43 CFR part 12:
(a) Accurately and timely account for grant funds;
(b) Adequately safeguard all funds, property, and other assets and assure that they are used solely for authorized purposes;
(c) Provide a comparison of actual amounts spent with budgeted amounts for each grant;
(d) Request any cash advances as closely as possible to the actual time of the disbursement; and
(e) Design a systematic method to assure timely and appropriate resolution of audit findings and recommendations.
§ 886.20
What happens to unused funds from my grant?
(a) If there are any unexpended funds after your grant is completed, we deobligate the funds when we close your grant. We treat unused funds as follows:
(1) We transfer any State share funds under § 872.14 of this chapter or Tribal share funds under § 872.17 that were not expended within three years of the date
they were awarded in a grant, except five years for funds awarded in Fiscal Years 2008, 2009, and 2010, to historic coal funds, § 872.21 of this chapter. We distribute any funds transferred to historic coal in the next annual distribution in the same way as historic coal funds from fee collections during that fiscal year.
(2) We hold any unused Federal expense funds under § 872.24 of this chapter for distribution to any State or Indian tribe as needed for the activity for which the funds were appropriated.
(3) We make unused funds of all other types available for re-award to the same State or Indian tribe to which they were originally distributed. This includes historic coal funds under § 872.21 of this chapter, minimum program make up funds under § 872.26 of this chapter, and prior balance replacement funds under § 872.29 of this chapter.
(b) If you have any State share funds or Tribal share funds that were distributed to you in an annual distribution under § 872.15 or § 872.18 of this chapter but that were not awarded to you in grant within 3 years of the date they were distributed, or 5 years for funds distributed in Fiscal Years 2008, 2009, and 2010, we transfer the unawarded funds to the historic coal fund under § 872.21 of this chapter and distribute them in the next annual distribution.
§ 886.21
What must I report?
(a) For each grant, you must annually report to us the performance and financial information that we specify.
(b) Upon completion of each grant, you must submit to us final performance, financial, and property reports, and any other information that we specify.
(c) When you complete each reclamation project, you must update the AML inventory.
§ 886.22
What records must I maintain?
You must maintain complete records in accordance with 43 CFR part 12. Your records must support the information you reported to us. This includes, but is not limited to, books, documents, maps, and other evidence. Accounting records must document procedures and practices sufficient to verify:
(a) The amount and use of all Title IV funds received; and
(b) The total direct and indirect costs of the reclamation program for which you received the grant.
§ 886.23
What actions can OSM take if I do not comply with the terms of my grant?
(a) If you, or your subgrantee, fail to comply with the terms of your grant, we may take one or more of the following remedial actions, as appropriate in the circumstances:
(1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending your correction of the deficiency;
(2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of Federal funds and matching credit for non-Federal funds) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance;
(3) Wholly or partly reduce, suspend or terminate the current award for your program;
(4) Withhold further grant awards for the program; or
(5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.
(b) If we terminate your State regulatory administration and enforcement grant, provided under part 735 of this chapter, for failure to implement, enforce, or maintain an approved State regulatory program or any part thereof, we will terminate the grant awarded under this part. This paragraph does not apply to the States of Missouri or Tennessee under section 402(g)(8)(B) of SMCRA, or to the Navajo, Hopi and Crow Indian tribes under section 405(k) of SMCRA.
(c) If you fail to enforce the financial interest provisions of part 705 of this chapter, we will terminate the grant.
(d) If you fail to submit reports required by this part or part 705 of this chapter, we take appropriate remedial actions. We may terminate the grant.
(e) If you fail to submit a reclamation plan amendment as required by § 884.15 of this chapter, we may reduce, suspend, or terminate all existing AML grants in whole or in part or may refuse to process all future grant applications.
(f) If you are not in compliance with all Federal statutes relating to nondiscrimination, including but not limited to the following, we will terminate the grant:
(1) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Public Law 88-352, 78 Stat. 252 (42 U.S.C. 2000d
et seq.
). “Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs,” which provides that no person in the United States shall on the grounds of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, and the implementing regulations in 43 CFR part 17.
(2) Executive Order 11246, as amended by Executive Order 11375, “Equal Employment Opportunity,” requiring that employees or applicants for employment not be discriminated against because of race, creed, color, sex, or national origin, and the implementing regulations in 40 CFR part 60.
(3) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Public Law 93-112, 87 Stat. 355 (29 U.S.C. 794), as amended by Executive Order 11914, “Nondiscrimination with Respect to the Handicapped in Federally Assisted Programs.”
§ 886.24
What procedures will OSM follow to reduce, suspend, or terminate my grant?
We will use the following procedures to reduce, suspend, or terminate your grant:
(a) We must give you at least 30 days written notice of intent to reduce, suspend, or terminate a grant. An OSM official authorized to approve your grant must sign our notice of intent. We must send this notice by certified mail, return receipt requested. Our notice must include the reasons for the proposed action and the proposed effective date of the action.
(b) We must give you opportunity for consultation and remedial action before we reduce or terminate a grant.
(c) We must notify you in writing of the termination, suspension, or reduction of the grant. The notice must be signed by the authorized approving official and sent by certified mail, return receipt requested.
(d) Upon termination, you must refund to us that remaining portion of the grant money not encumbered. However, you may retain any portion of the grant that is required to meet contractual commitments made before the effective date of termination.
(e) You must not make any new commitments of grant funds after receiving notification of our intent to terminate the grant without our approval.
(f) We may allow termination costs as determined by applicable Federal cost principles listed in OMB Circular A-87.

§ 887.1
Scope.
This part sets forth the procedures for grants to you, a State or Indian tribe with an approved reclamation plan to establish, administer, and operate a self-sustaining individual State or Indian tribe administered program to insure private property against damages caused by land subsidence resulting from underground coal mining.
[73 FR 67647, Nov. 14, 2008]
§ 887.5
Definitions.
As used in this part—
Establishment
—means either the development of a subsidence insurance program or the administration or operation of a subsidence insurance program.
Private property
—means any or all of the following: dwellings and improvements, commercial and industrial structures, utilities, underground structures such as sewers, pipes, wells and septic systems, sidewalks and driveways, and land.
Reclamation plan
or
State reclamation plan
means a plan that a State or Indian tribe submitted and that we approved under section 405 of SMCRA and part 884 of this chapter.
Self-sustaining
means maintaining an insurance rate structure which is designed to be actuarially sound. Self-sustaining requires that State or Indian tribal subsidence insurance programs provide for recovery of payments made in settlement for damages from any party responsible for the damages under the law of the State or Indian tribe. Actuarial soundness implies that funds are sufficient to cover expected losses and expenses including a reasonable allowance for underwriting services and contingencies. Self-sustaining must not preclude the use of funds from other non-Federal sources.
State or Indian tribe administered
means administered either directly by a State or Indian tribe or for a State or Indian tribe through a State or Indian tribal authorized commission, board, contractor such as an insurance company, or other entity subject to State or Indian tribal direction.

§ 900.1
Scope.
This part sets forth the purpose and organization of parts 901-955 of this subchapter.
[51 FR 19461, May 29, 1986]
§ 900.2
Objectives.
The objective of this part is to provide an introduction to the synopsis of the approved State programs, the Abandoned Mined Lands Reclamation programs, the cross referencing provisions of Federal programs and the full texts of State and Federal cooperative agreements for regulation of mining on Federal lands. The introduction explains the content and authority of the permanent regulatory programs.
§ 900.4
Responsibilities.
(a) Each State that has surface coal mining and reclamation operations or coal exploration activities on non-Federal, non-Indian lands must have either an approved State program or a promulgated Federal program as required by Title V of the Act and 30 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. Approval of a State program and promulgation of a Federal program are described in the paragraphs below.
(b) Under section 503 of the Act and 30 CFR parts 730, 731 and 732 a State in which there are coal exploration activities or surface mining and reclamation operations must submit a State program to the Secretary for approval if it wishes to assume exclusive regulatory jurisdiction on non-Federal and non-Indian lands within its borders. The State programs must meet the requirements of the Act and 30 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C.
(c) Pursuant to section 504 of SMCRA and 30 CFR 736.11, OSM must promulgate and implement a Federal program in each State in which the Director reasonably expects coal exploration or surface coal mining and reclamation operations to exist on non-Federal and non-Indian lands at any time before June, 1985, and either: (1) The State does not submit a State program, (2) the Secretary of the Interior finally disapproves the program submitted by the State, or (3) the Secretary of the Interior withdraws approval of the State program.
(d) Under section 405 of SMCRA and 30 CFR part 884, each State having within its borders coal mined lands eligible for reclamation under Title IV of SMCRA, may submit to the Secretary a State Reclamation Plan, demonstrating its capability for administering an abandoned mine reclamation program. Title IV provides that the Secretary may approve the plan once the State has an approved regulatory program under Title V of SMCRA. If the Secretary determines that a State has developed and submitted a program for reclamation and has the necessary State legislation to implement the provisions of Title IV, the Secretary shall grant the State exclusive responsibility and authority to implement the provisions of the approved plan. Section 405 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1235) contains the requirements for State reclamation plans.
(e) States with approved programs may enter into cooperative agreements with OSM in order to become the regulatory authority for coal mining on Federal lands, in accordance with 30 CFR chapter VII, subchapter D.
§ 900.11
Organization of this subchapter.
Parts 901 through 950 are reserved for each State alphabetically. The program applicable within each State is codified in the part for that State. In addition, part 955 establishes rules pursuant to part 850 of this chapter for the training, examination and certification of blasters by OSM for surface coal mining operations in States with Federal programs and on Indian lands.
[51 FR 19461, May 29, 1986]
§ 900.12
State regulatory programs.
(a) Upon approval of a State regulatory program the Secretary will publish a final rule to be codified under the applicable part number assigned to the State. The full text will not appear below. Notification of the approval of the program and the dates on which any amendments were submitted will appear. Also included below are the addresses of OSM Headquarters, field and State Regulatory Authority offices where copies of the State programs are available for inspection and copying.
(b) Provisions of approved State regulatory programs or permits issued pursuant to an approved State regulatory program may be enforced by the Secretary or his authorized agents pursuant to sections 504(b) and 521 of the Act and part 842 of this chapter.
§ 900.13
Federal programs and Federal coal exploration programs.
The rules for each Federal program and Federal coal exploration program are codified below under the assigned part for the particular State. Rules governing the training, examination and certification of blasters for surface coal mining operations in States with Federal programs are codified in part 955, and referenced by each Federal program.

§ 901.30
State-Federal cooperative agreement.
The Governor of the State of Alabama and the Secretary of the Department of the Interior (Secretary) enter into a Cooperative Agreement (Agreement) to read as follows:

# Article I: Introduction, Purpose and Responsible Agencies
A.
Authority:
This agreement is authorized by section 523(c) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (the Act), 30 U.S.C. 1273(c), which allows a State with a permanent regulatory program approved by the Secretary under 30 U.S.C. 1253, to elect to enter into an Agreement for State regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands. This Agreement provides for State regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations in Alabama subject to the Federal lands program (30 CFR parts 740-746), consistent with State and Federal Acts governing such activities, and the Alabama State Program (Program).
B.
Purpose:
The purposes of this Agreement are to (a) foster Federal-State cooperation in the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations; (b) minimize intergovernmental overlap and duplication; and (c) provide uniform and effective application of the Program on all lands in Alabama in
accordance with the Act, the Program, and this Agreement.
C.
Responsible Administrative Agencies:
The Alabama Surface Mining Commission (ASMC) shall be responsible for administering this Agreement on behalf of the Governor. The Office of Surface Mining (OSM) shall administer this Agreement on behalf of the Secretary.

# Article II: Effective Date
After it has been signed by the Secretary and the Governor, this Agreement shall be effective 30 days after publication in the
Federal Register
as a final rule. This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated as provided in Article XI.

# Article III: Definitions
The terms and phrases used in this Agreement which are defined in the Act, 30 CFR 700, 701, and 740, the approved State Program and the State Act, and in the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to those Acts, shall be given the meanings set forth in said definitions. Where there is a conflict between the above referenced State and Federal definitions, the definitions used in the approved State Program will apply, except in the case of a term which defines the Secretary's continuing responsibilities under the Act and other laws.

# Article IV: Applicability
In accordance with the Federal lands program in 30 CFR part 745, the laws, regulations, terms and conditions of the Program are applicable to lands in Alabama subject to the Federal lands program except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, the Act, 30 CFR 745.13, or other applicable laws or regulations.

# Article V: General Requirements
The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with all the provisions of this Agreement.
A.
Authority of State Agency:
ASMC has and shall continue to have the authority under State law to carry out this Agreement.
B.
Funds:
Upon application by ASMC and subject to appropriations, OSM shall provide the State with the funds to defray the costs associated with carrying out responsibilities under this Agreement as provided in section 705(c) of the Act and 30 CFR 735.16. Such funds shall cover the full cost of carrying out these responsibilities provided that such cost does not exceed the estimated cost the Federal government would have expended in regulating surface coal mining operations on Federal lands in Alabama in the absence of an agreement. If the State requests funds and sufficient funds have not been appropriated to OSM, OSM and the ASMC shall promptly meet to decide on appropriate measures that will insure that mining operations are regulated in accordance with the Program. If agreement cannot be reached, then either party may terminate the Agreement in accordance with 30 CFR 745.15. Funds provided to the State under this Agreement shall be adjusted in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-102, Attachment E.
C.
Reports and Records:
ASMC shall make annual reports to OSM containing information with respect to compliance with the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to 30 CFR 745.12(d). Upon request, ASMC and OSM shall exchange information developed under this Agreement, except where prohibited by Federal law.
OSM shall provide ASMC with a copy of any final evaluation report prepared concerning State administration and enforcement of this Agreement.
D.
Personnel:
ASMC shall have the necessary personnel to fully implement this agreement in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the approved State Program.
E.
Equipment and Laboratories:
ASMC will assure itself access to equipment, laboratories, and facilities with which all inspections, investigations, studies, tests, and analyses can be performed which are necessary to carry out the requirements of the Agreement.
F.
Permit Application Fees and Civil Penalties:
The amount of the fee accompanying an application for a permit shall be determined in accordance with section 15 of the Alabama Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1981, Section 880-X-8B-.07 of the State regulations, and the applicable provisions of the State Program and Federal law. All permit fees and civil penalties collected from operations on Federal lands will be retained by the State and shall be deposited with the State Treasurer in the Alabama Surface Mining Fund. The financial status report submitted pursuant to 30 CFR 735.26 shall include the amount of fees collected during the prior State fiscal year.

# Article VI: Review of Permit Application Package
A.
Submission of Permit Application Package:
ASMC and the Secretary shall require an operator proposing to conduct surface coal mining operations on Federal lands covered by this Agreement to submit a permit application package (PAP) in an appropriate number of copies to ASMC. ASMC shall furnish OSM with an appropriate number of copies of the PAP. The PAP shall be in the form required by ASMC and include any supplemental information required by OSM or the Federal land management agency. At a minimum, the PAP shall include the information necessary for ASMC to make a determination of compliance with the State Program and for the appropriate Federal agency
to make a determination of compliance with applicable requirements of Federal laws and regulations for which it is responsible.
B.
Review Procedures Where Leased Federally-Owned Coal Is Not Involved:
1. ASMC shall assume primary responsibility for the analysis, review and approval or disapproval of the permit application component of the PAP required by 30 CFR 740.13 for surface coal mining and reclamation operations under the Federal lands program in Alabama not requiring a mining plan under 30 CFR 746.11. ASMC shall be the primary point of contact for operators regarding decisions on the PAP and will be responsible for informing the applicant of determinations.
2. Upon receipt of a PAP that involves surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands not containing leased Federal coal, ASMC shall (1) transmit a copy of the complete PAP to the Federal land management agency with a request for review pursuant to 30 CFR 740.13(c)(4), and (2) provide OSM with a complete copy of the PAP and any additional information necessary to allow OSM to determine whether the operations are prohibited or limited by the requirements of section 522(e) (1) or (2) of the Federal Act (30 U.S.C. 1272(e)) and 30 CFR part 761 with respect to areas designated therein by Congress as unsuitable for mining. Except as specified by paragraph 5 of this article, ASMC shall be responsible for obtaining, in a timely manner, the views and determinations of any other Federal agencies with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands affected by a PAP in Alabama.
3. OSM will provide technical assistance to ASMC when requested if available resources allow and will process requests for determinations of compatibility and valid existing rights under 30 CFR part 761 relating to areas designated by Congress under section 522(e)(1) or (2) as unsuitable for mining. OSM will be responsible for ensuring that any information OSM receives from an applicant is promptly sent to ASMC. OSM shall have access to ASMC files concerning mines on Federal lands. The Secretary reserves the right to act independently of ASMC to carry out his responsibilities under laws other than the Federal Act. A copy of all resulting correspondence with the applicant that may have a bearing on decisions regarding the PAP shall be sent to the State.
4. ASMC shall review the PAP for compliance with the Program.
5. Prior to making a decision on a PAP for proposed surface coal mining and reclamation operations for which there is no other concurrent Secretarial action that would trigger compliance with section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1536, ASMC shall obtain the written concurrence of OSM regarding the effect the proposed operations would have on threatened and endangered species and critical habitat in the area affected by the proposed operations, and shall include in any permit that is issued for such operations any terms or conditions which OSM may require to avoid the likelihood of actions which would jeopardize the continued existence of any such species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of its critical habitat.
6. The permit issued by ASMC shall incorporate any terms or conditions imposed by the Federal land management agency, including conditions relating to post-mining land use, and shall condition the initiation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on compliance with the requirements of the Federal land management agency. After issuing the decision on the PAP, ASMC shall send a notice to the applicant, the Federal land management agency, and OSM with a copy of the permit and written findings.
C.
Review Procedures Where Leased Federally-Owned Coal is Involved:
1. ASMC shall assume primary responsibility for the analysis, review and approval or disapproval of the permit application component of the PAP for surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands in Alabama where a mining plan is required by 30 CFR 746.11. OSM, as requested, shall assist the State in this analysis and review. The Department of the Interior (Department) shall concurrently carry out its responsibilities under the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA), the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and other applicable Federal laws that cannot be delegated to the State. The Department shall carry out these responsibilities in accordance with the Federal lands program and this Agreement in a timely manner so as to avoid, to the extent possible, duplication of the responsibilities of the State as set forth in this Agreement and the Program. Responsibilities and decisions which can be delegated to the State under other applicable Federal laws may be specified in working agreements between OSM and the State without amendment to this Agreement. The Secretary will consider the information in the PAP and, where appropriate, make decisions required by the Federal Act, MLA, NEPA, and other Federal laws.
2. ASMC will be the primary point of contact for operators regarding the review of the PAP, except on matters concerned exclusively with 43 CFR parts 3480-3487, administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). ASMC will be responsible for informing the applicant of all joint State-Federal determinations. The Secretary may act independently of the State to carry out responsibilities under laws other than the Federal Act or provisions of the Act not covered by the Program, and in instances of disagreement over the Act and the Federal lands program. ASMC shall send to OSM, copies of
any correspondence with the applicant and any information received from the applicant regarding the mining plan including the operation and reclamation plan portion of the permit application. OSM shall send to ASMC copies of all independent correspondence with the applicant which may have a bearing on the PAP. As a matter of practice, OSM will not independently initiate contacts with applicants regarding completeness or deficiencies of the PAP with respect to matters covered by the Program.
3. ASMC shall assume the responsibilities listed in 30 CFR 740.4(c) (1), (2), (4), (5), and (6). OSM shall retain the responsibilities listed in 30 CFR 740.4(c)(3) and the exceptions specified in (c)(7) (i) through (vii). OSM shall assist the State in carrying out its responsibilities by:
(a) Distributing copies of the PAP to, and coordinating the review of the PAP among, all Federal agencies which have responsibilities relating to decisions on the PAP. This shall be done in a manner which ensures timely identification, communication and resolution of issues relating to those Federal agencies' statutory requirements. OSM shall request that such other Federal agencies furnish their findings and any requests for additional data to OSM within 45 calendar days of their receipt of the PAP.
(b) Providing ASMC with the analyses and conclusions of other Federal agencies.
(c) Addressing conflicts and difficulties of the other Federal agencies in a timely manner.
(d) Assisting in scheduling joint meetings as necessary between State and Federal agencies.
(e) Where OSM is assisting ASMC in reviewing the permit application, furnish the State with the work product within 45 calendar days of receipt of the State's request for such assistance, or earlier if mutually agreed upon by OSM and the State.
(f) Exercising its responsibilities in a timely manner as set forth in a mutually agreed upon schedule, governed to the extent possible by the deadlines established in the Program.
(g) Assuming all responsibility for ensuring compliance with any Federal lessee protection bond requirement.
4. Review of the PAP:
(a) OSM and ASMC shall coordinate with each other during the review process as needed. ASMC shall keep OSM informed of findings during the review process which bear on the responsibilities of other Federal agencies. OSM shall ensure that any information OSM receives which has a bearing on decisions regarding the PAP is promptly sent to ASMC.
(b) The State shall review the PAP for compliance with the Program.
(c) OSM shall review the PAP for compliance with the Act and the requirements of other Federal laws and regulations. OSM and ASMC shall develop a work plan and schedule for PAP review and each shall identify a person as the project leader. The OSM project leader shall serve as the primary point of contact between OSM and ASMC throughout the review process. Not later than 50 days after receipt of the PAP, OSM shall furnish ASMC with its preliminary findings on the PAP and specify any requirements for additional data. To the extent practicable, the State shall provide OSM all available information that may aid OSM in preparing any findings.
(d) ASMC shall provide to OSM written findings indicating whether the PAP is in compliance with the Program, and a technical analysis of the PAP.
(e) ASMC may proceed to issue a permit in accordance with the Program prior to the necessary Secretarial decision on the mining plan, provided that ASMC advises the operator in the permit that Secretarial approval of a mining plan must be obtained before the operator may conduct surface coal mining operations on Federal lands. ASMC shall reserve the right to amend or rescind any requirements of the approved permit to conform with any terms or conditions imposed by the Secretary in his approval of the mining plan.
5. Prior to acting on a permit revision or renewal, ASMC shall consult with OSM on whether such revision or renewal constitutes a mining plan modification under 30 CFR 746.18. OSM shall inform the State within 30 days of receiving notice of a proposed revision or renewal, whether any permit revision or renewal constitutes a mining plan modification. Permit revisions which do not constitute mining plan modifications shall be approved solely by the State.
OSM may establish criteria consistent with 30 CFR 746.18 to determine which permit revisions and renewals clearly do not constitute mining plan modifications. If such criteria are promulgated, revisions or renewals which do not constitute mining plan modifications in accordance with the criteria may be approved by ASMC before it submits copies of the revision or renewal to OSM.

# Article VII: Inspections
A. ASMC shall conduct inspections on Federal lands and prepare and file inspection reports in accordance with the Program.
B. ASMC shall, subsequent to conducting any inspection, and on a timely basis, file with OSM a legible copy of the completed State inspection report.
C. ASMC shall be the point of contact and primary inspection authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations and compliance with the requirements covered by the Agreement, except as described hereinafter.
Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent inspections by authorized Federal or State agencies for purposes other than those covered by this Agreement. The Department may conduct any inspections necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 842 and 843 and its obligations under laws other than the Act.
D. OSM shall ordinarily give the ASMC reasonable notice of its intent to conduct an inspection under 30 CFR 842.11 in order to provide State inspectors with an opportunity to join in the inspection. When OSM is responding to a citizen complaint of an imminent danger to the public health and safety, or of significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air or water resources, pursuant to 30 CFR 842.11(b)(1)(ii)(C), it will contact ASMC no less than 24 hours prior to the Federal inspection, if practicable, to facilitate a joint Federal/State inspection. All citizen complaints which do not involve an imminent danger or significant imminent environmental harm shall be referred to ASMC for action. The Secretary reserves the right to conduct inspections without prior notice to ASMC to carry out his responsibilities under the Federal Act.

# Article VIII: Enforcement
A. ASMC shall have primary enforcement authority under the Act concerning compliance with the requirements of this Agreement and the Program. Enforcement authority given to the Secretary under other laws and orders, including but not limited to those listed in appendix A, is reserved to the Secretary.
B. During any joint inspection by OSM and ASMC, ASMC shall have primary responsibility for enforcement procedures, including issuance of orders of cessation, notices of violation, and assessment of penalties. The ASMC shall inform OSM prior to issuance of any decision to suspend or revoke a permit.
C. During any inspection made solely by OSM or any joint inspection where the ASMC and OSM fail to agree regarding the propriety of any particular enforcement action, OSM may take any enforcement action necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843 and 845. Such enforcement actions shall be based on the standards in the approved Program, the Act, or both, and shall be taken using the procedures and penalty system contained in 30 CFR parts 843 and 845.
D. The ASMC and the Department shall promptly notify each other of all violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, or approved mining permits subject to this Agreement, and of all actions taken with respect to such violations.
E. Personnel of the State and representatives of the Department shall be mutually available to serve as witnesses in enforcement actions taken by either party.
F. This Agreement does not limit the Department's authority to enforce violations of Federal law which establish standards and requirements which are authorized by laws other than the Act.

# Article IX: Bonds
A. ASMC and the Secretary shall require each operator covered by the Federal lands program to submit a single performance bond payable to Alabama and the United States to cover the operator's responsibilities under the Federal Act and the Program. Such performance bond shall be conditioned upon compliance with all requirements of the Federal Act, the Program and any other requirements imposed by the Department or the Federal land management agency. Such bond shall provide that if this Agreement is terminated, the bond shall be payable only to the United States to the extent that lands covered by the Federal lands program are involved.
B. Prior to releasing the operator from any obligation under such bond, the ASMC shall obtain the concurrence of OSM. The ASMC shall also advise OSM of annual adjustment to the performance bond, pursuant to the Program. Departmental concurrence shall include coordination with other Federal agencies having authority over the lands involved.
Such bond shall be subject to forfeiture with the consent of OSM, in accordance with the procedures and requirements of the Program.
C. Submission of a performance bond does not satisfy the requirements for a Federal lease bond required by 30 CFR subpart3474 or lessee protection bond required in addition to a performance bond, in certain circumstances, by section 715 of the Act.

(1) At 11 AAC 90.023(f)(3) by providing ownership and control regulations to meet the requirements of OSM's May 11, 1989, 30 CFR 732 notification.
(2)-(17) [Reserved]
(b) [Reserved]
(c) By February 3, 2020, Alaska must amend its program as follows:
(1) At 11 AAC 90.101(e), in accordance with the requirements at 30 CFR 784.20(b)(7), Alaska must submit a program amendment (or description of the amendment with a timetable for submission) to adopt subsidence control plan requirements at 11 AAC 90.101(e) for planned subsidence scenarios. Such plans must describe the methods to be employed to minimize damage to non-commercial buildings and occupied residential dwellings and related structures or written consent from the owner of the structure or facility that minimization measures not be taken, or unless the damage would constitute a threat to health or safety, a demonstration that the costs of minimizing damage exceed anticipated costs of repair.
(2) At 11 AAC 90.321(e)(1), in accordance with 30 CFR 816.41(h), Alaska must submit a program amendment (or description of the amendment with a timetable for submission) to revise 11 AAC 90.321(e)(1) to ensure protection of water supplies affected by surface coal mining activities conducted on or before October 24, 1992.
(3) At 11 AAC 90.652(g)(1) and 11 AAC 90.664(c), in accordance with the requirements at 30 CFR 702.11(f)(1) and 702.17(c)(2), Alaska must submit a program amendment (or description of the amendment with a timetable for submission) to restore the 30-day time frames under 11 AAC 90.652(g)(1) and 11 AAC 90.664(c) for an adversely affected person to request administrative review of the agency's decisions regarding incidental mining exemptions.
(4) At 11 AAC 90.656, in accordance with the requirements at 30 CFR 702.13(a), Alaska must submit a program amendment (or description of the amendment with a timetable for submission) to revise 11 AAC 90.656, concerning public availability of information in an application for an exemption of coal incidental to the extraction of other minerals. The amendment or its description must include the requirement that the information, unless approved as confidential, will be made available for public inspection and copying until at least three years after expiration of the period during which the subject mining area is active.
(5) At AS 27.21.220, in accordance with the October 24, 1992, Energy Policy Act, Alaska must submit a statutory revision requiring prompt repair or compensation for material damage resulting from subsidence, and prompt replacement of water supplies affected by underground mining operations.
(6) At 11 AAC 90.457(d), in accordance with the requirements at 30 CFR 816.116(a)(1) and 817.116(a)(1), Alaska must submit a program amendment (or description of the amendment with a timetable for submission) to clarify its program by revising 11 AAC 90.457 to indicate that all selected revegetation success standards and sampling techniques which may be incorporated into individual permits will be put in writing and made available to the public. If Alaska will allow for any normal husbandry practices to be used during the period required for demonstration of revegetation success, in accordance with 30 CFR 816.116(c)(4), Alaska must submit an amendment of its program to demonstrate that each practice is one that is customarily performed on
similar un-mined lands and list, at 11 AAC 90.457(d), the acceptable practices.

§ 903.700
Arizona Federal program.
(a) This part establishes a Federal program under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) and applies to all coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations in Arizona conducted on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. To the extent required by 30 CFR part 740, this part also applies to surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands in Arizona.
(b) Some rules in this part cross-reference pertinent parts of the permanent program rules in this chapter. The full text of a cross-referenced rule is in the permanent program rule cited under the relevant section of the Arizona Federal program.
(c) The following provisions of Arizona law generally provide for more stringent environmental control and regulation of some aspects of surface coal mining and reclamation operations than do the provisions of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, and the regulations in this chapter. Therefore, pursuant to section 505(b) of the Act, OSM will not generally construe such laws to be inconsistent with the Act, unless in a particular instance OSM determines that the rules in this chapter establish more stringent environmental or land use controls:
(1) The Arizona Department of Agriculture has authority to abate public nuisances, including noxious weeds and noxious weed seeds, under A.R.S. section 3-231 to 3-242. Violation of this statute is a misdemeanor.
(2) It is unlawful to injure any bird or harass any bird upon its nest or remove the nests or eggs of any bird without prior authorization of the Arizona Game and Fish Commission. A.R.S. section 17-236.
(3) A bridge, dam, dike or causeway may not be constructed over or in a navigable river or other navigable water without the authorization of the Governor. A.R.S. Section 18-301.
(4) The Department of Mineral Resources has jurisdiction over the mining of minerals, and oil and gas under Title 27 of the Arizona Revised Statutes. One of the functions of that Department is the prevention and elimination of hazardous dust conditions. A.R.S. Section 27-128. Violation of orders of State mine inspectors respecting dust prevention and control is a misdemeanor.
(5) Roads leading into waste dump areas and tailing areas from inhabited or public areas are required to be blocked off and warning signs posted on the perimeter of such areas. A.R.S. Section 27-317.
(6) The primary responsibility for the control and abatement of air pollution rests with the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality and its Hearing Board. The Department is responsible for the establishment and enforcement of air pollution emission standards and ambient air quality standards as a part of a comprehensive air quality plan for Arizona. A.R.S. Title 49.
(7) The Arizona Department of Water Resources has jurisdiction over State water, including “surface waters.” “Surface waters” means “the waters of all sources, flowing in streams, canyons, ravines or other natural channels, or in definite underground channels, whether perennial or intermittent, flood, waste or surplus water, and of lakes, ponds and springs on the surface. For the purposes of administering this title, surface water is deemed to include Central Arizona Project Water.” A.R.S. Section 45-101. It is a misdemeanor to knowingly use the water of another, or divert water from a stream, waste water or obstruct water flowing into a water work. A.R.S. Section 45-112. Possession of water lawfully denied to the possessor is prima facie evidence of one's guilt. A.R.S. Section 45-112. If water is to be used for mining purposes the water rights may be severed from the land rights and transferred separately. The
separation and transference of water rights is subject to numerous limitations, under A.R.S. Section 45-172.
(8) Dams are defined as “any artificial barrier, including appurtenant works for the impounding or diversion of water except those barriers for the purpose of controlling liquid borne material, twenty-five feet or more in height or the storage capacity of which will be more than fifty acre feet, but does not include any such barrier which is or will be less than six feet in height, regardless of storage capacity, or which has or will have a storage capacity not in excess of fifteen acre feet, regardless of height.” A.R.S. Section 45-701. The construction, operation, repair or alteration of any dam without the prior approval of the Director of Water Resources is a misdemeanor. A.R.S. Section 45-702 to Section 45-716.
(d) Any Arizona law or regulation which may be found to interfere with the purposes and achievements of the Act, shall be preempted and superseded to the extent that the State law or regulation is inconsistent with, or precludes implementation of, requirements of the Act or this chapter under the Federal program for Arizona. The Director shall publish a notice to that effect in the
Federal Register
following the procedures set forth in § 730.11(a) of this chapter.
(e) The information collection requirements contained in this part have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 in its approval of the information collection requirements contained in the permanent regulatory program.
§ 903.701

§ 905.700
California Federal Program.
(a) This part contains all rules that are applicable to surface coal mining operations in California which have been adopted under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
(b) Certain of the rules in this part cross-reference pertinent parts of the permanent program regulations in this Chapter. The full text of a cross-referenced rule is in the permanent program rule cited under the relevant section of the California Federal program.
(c) This part applies to all coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations in California conducted on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. To the extent required by 30 CFR part 740, this part also applies to operations on Federal lands in California.
(d) The information collection requirements contained in this part have already been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 in its approval of the information collection requirements contained in the permanent regulatory program.
(e) The following provisions of California law generally provide for more stringent land use and environmental control and regulation of some aspects of surface coal mining operations than do the provisions of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, and the regulations in this chapter. Therefore, pursuant to section 505(b) of SMCRA, these provisions shall not generally be considered to be inconsistent with SMCRA unless, in a particular instance, the Federal program regulations establish more stringent environmental or land use controls:
(1) The California Environmental Quality Act, Cal. Pub. Res. Code section 21000
et seq.
(West 1986).
(2) The Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, Cal. Water Code section 13000
et seq.
(West 1971).
(3) California Hazardous Waste Control Law, Cal. Health
Safety Code section 25100
et seq.
(West 1984).
(4) The State Underground Storage of Hazardous Substances Law, Cal. Health
Safety Code section 25280

et seq.
(West 1984).
(7) Cal. Pub. Res. Code section 4656 (West 1984), requiring a permit for mining in State forests.
(f) The following are the California laws that generally interfere with the achievement of the purposes and requirements of SMCRA and are, in accordance with section 504(g) of SMCRA, preempted and superseded. Other California laws may in an individual situation interfere with the purposes and achievements of SMCRA and may be preempted and superseded with respect to the performance standards of §§ 905.815 through 905.828 as they affect a particular coal exploration or surface mining operation by publication of a notice to that effect in the
Federal Register.
(1) The California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975, Cal. Pub. Res. Code section 2710
et seq.
(West 1984), as it relates to coal mining, except to the
extent that it regulates other activities that are not regulated by SMCRA.

# Article VI: Policies and Procedures: Review of a Permit Application To Conduct Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations or an Application for a Permit Revision or Permit Renewal
7. The MLRD and the Director shall require an operator on Federal lands to submit a permit application package or an application for a permit revision or renewal in an appropriate number of copies to the MLRD and OSM. Any documentation or information prepared by the operator for the sole purpose of complying with the 3-year requirement of section 7(c) of the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA) will be submitted directly to the Minerals Management Service (MMS). If such documentation is submitted as part of a permit application, a copy of the entire package will be forwarded to the MMS by OSM.
The permit application package or application for a permit revision or renewal shall be
in the format required by the MLRD and include any supplemental information required by the Department. The permit application package or application for a permit revision or renewal shall satisfy the requirements of 30 CFR 741.12(b) and 30 CFR 741.13, and include the information required by, or necessary for, the MLRD and the Department to make a determination of compliance with:
(a) Section 34-33-101,
et seq.,
CRS 1973, as amended;
(b) Regulations of the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Board for Coal Mining;
(c) Applicable terms and conditions of the Federal coal lease;
(d) Applicable requirements of the MMS's 30 CFR part 211 regulations pertaining to the Mineral Leasing Act requirements unless previously submitted to the MMS; and
(e) Applicable requirements of the approved Program and other Federal laws including, but not limited to, those identified in 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter D, and appendix A of this Agreement.
8. The MLRD shall assume primary responsibility pursuant to sections 510(a) and 523(c) of the Act for the analysis, review, and approval of the permit application or application for a permit revision or renewal according to the standards of the approved Program. The Director shall assist the MLRD in the analysis of the permit application or application for a permit revision or renewal and coordinate with the other appropriate Federal agencies as specified by the Secretary according to the procedures set forth in appendix B. The Department shall concurrently carry out its responsibilities which cannot be delegated to the State under the MLA, National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and other public laws (including, but not limited to, those in appendix A) according to the procedures set forth in appendix B so as, to the maximum extent possible, not to duplicate the responsibilities of the State as set forth in this Agreement and the Program. The Secretary shall consider the information submitted in the permit application package and, when appropriate, make the decisions required by the Act, MLA, NEPA and other public laws as described above.
9. As a matter of practice the Department will not independently initiate contacts with the applicant regarding permit application packages or applications for permit revisions or renewals. However, the Department reserves the right to act independently of the MLRD to carry out its statutory responsibilities under the Act, MLA, NEPA and other public laws provided, however, that the Department shall send copies of all relevant correspondence to the MLRD.
10. The MLRD shall maintain a file of all original correspondence with the applicant and any information received from the applicant which may have a bearing on decisions regarding the permit application or application for a permit revision or renewal.
11. OSM shall have access to MLRD files for mines on Federal lands. MLRD will provide OSM copies of information OSM deems necessary.
12. To the fullest extent allowed by State and Federal law, the Director and MLRD shall cooperate so that duplication will be eliminated in conducting the review and analysis of the permit application package or application for a permit revision or renewal.

# Article VII: Inspections
13. The MLRD shall conduct inspections on Federal lands and prepare and file inspection reports in accordance with the Program.
14. The MLRD shall, subsequent to conducting any inspection, and on a timely basis, file with the Director a copy of each inspection report. Such report shall adequately describe (1) the general conditions of the lands under the permit; (2) the manner in which the operations are being conducted; and (3) whether the operator is complying with applicable performance and reclamation requirements.
15. The MLRD will be the point of contact and primary inspection authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations and compliance with the requirements covered by this Agreement, except as described hereinafter. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Federal inspections by authorized Federal or State agencies for purposes other than those covered by this Agreement. The Department may conduct any inspections necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 842 and 743, as part 743 relates to obligations under laws other than the Act.
16. OSM shall ordinarily give the MLRD reasonable notice of its intent to conduct an inspection under 30 CFR 842.11 in order to provide State inspectors with an opportunity to join in the inspection. When OSM is responding to a citizen complaint of an imminent danger to the public health and safety or significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air or water resources, pursuant to 30 CFR 842.11(b)(1(ii)(C), it will contact MLRD no less than 24 hours prior to the Federal inspection, if practicable, to facilitate a joint Federal/State inspection. All citizen complaints which do not involve an imminent danger shall be referred to MLRD for action. The Secretary reserves the right to conduct inspections without prior notice to MLRD to carry out his responsibilities under the Federal Act.

# Article VIII: Enforcement
17. MLRD shall be the primary enforcement authority under the Act concerning compliance with the requirements of this Agreement and the Program. Enforcement
authority given to the Secretary under other laws and orders including, but not limited to, those listed in appendix A is reserved to the Secretary.
18. During any joint inspection by OSM and MLRD, MLRD shall have primary responsibility for enforcement procedures, including issuance of orders of cessation, notices of violation, and assessment of penalties. The MLRD shall consult OSM prior to issuance of any decision to suspend or revoke a permit.
19. During any inspection made solely by OSM or any joint inspection where the MLRD and OSM fail to agree regarding the propriety of any particular enforcement action, OSM may take any enforcement action necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843 and 845. Such enforcement action shall be based on the performance standards included in the regulations of the approved Program, and shall be taken using the procedures and penalty system contained in 30 CFR parts 843 and 845.
20. The MLRD and the Department shall promptly notify each other of all violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, or approved mining permits subject to this Agreement and of all actions taken with respect to such violations.
21. Personnel of the State and representatives of the Department shall be mutually available to serve as witnesses in enforcement actions taken by either party.
22. This Agreement does not limit the Department's authority to enforce violations of Federal law which establish standards and requirements which are authorized by laws other than the Act.

# Article IX: Bonds
23. For all surface coal mining operations on Federal lands, the MLRD and the Secretary shall require each operator to submit a single performance bond payable to the State and to the United States, if required by Federal regulations, to cover the operator's responsibilities under the Act and the Program. Such performance bond shall be conditioned upon compliance with all requirements of the Act, the Program and any other requirements imposed by the Department under the MLA, as amended. If the Agreement is terminated, all bonds will revert to being payable only to the United States to the extent that Federal lands are involved. Submission of a performance bond does not satisfy the requirements for a Federal lease bond required by 30 CFR subpart3473 or a lessee protection bond required in addition to a performance bond, in certain circumstances, by section 715 of the Act.
24. Prior to releasing the operator from an obligation under a performance bond required by the Program, the MLRD shall obtain the concurrence of OSM. the MLRD shall also advise OSM of annual adjustments to the performance bond, pursuant to the Program. Departmental concurrence shall include coordination with other Federal agencies having authority over the lands involved.
25. The operator's performance bond shall be subject to forfeiture with the consent of OSM, in accordance with the procedures and requirements of the Program.

# Article X: Designating Land Areas Unsuitable for All or Certain Types of Surface Coal Mining Operations
26. The MLRD and the Director shall cooperate with each other in the review and processing of petitions to designate lands as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations. When either agency receives a petition that could impact adjacent Federal and non-Federal lands, respectively, the agency receiving the petition shall (1) notify the other of receipt and of the anticipated schedule for reaching a decision; and (2) request and fully consider data, information and views of the other.
The authority to designate State and private lands as unsuitable for mining is reserved to the State. The authority to designate Federal lands as unsuitable for mining is reserved to the Secretary or his designated representative.

# Article XI: Termination of Cooperative Agreement
27. This Agreement may be terminated by the Governor or the Secretary under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.15.

# Article XII: Reinstatement of Cooperative Agreement
28. If this Agreement has been terminated in whole or in part it may be reinstated under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.16.

# Article XIII: Amendment of Cooperative Agreement
29. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Governor and the Secretary in accordance with 30 CFR 745.14.

# Article XIV: Changes in State or Federal Standards
30. The Department or the State may from time to time promulgate new or revised performance or reclamation requirements or enforcement and administration procedures. Each party shall, if it determines it to be necessary to keep this Agreement in force, change or revise its regulations and request necessary legislative action. Such changes shall be made under the procedures of 30 CFR part 732 for changes to the State Program and under the procedures of section 501 of the Act for changes to the Federal lands program.
31. The MLRD and the Department shall provide each other with copies of any changes to their respective laws, rules, regulations and standards pertaining to the enforcement and administration of this Agreement.

# Article XV: Changes in Personnel and Organization
32. Each party to this Agreement shall notify the other, when necessary, of any changes in personnel, organization and funding or other changes that will affect the implementation of this Agreement to ensure coordination of responsibilities and facilitate cooperation.

# Article XVI: Reservation of Rights
33. In accordance with 30 CFR 745.13, this Agreement shall not be construed as waiving or preventing the assertion of any rights that have not been expressly addressed in this Agreement that the State or the Secretary may have under other laws or regulations, including but not limited to those listed in appendix A.

§ 912.700
Idaho Federal program.
(a) This part contains all rules that are applicable to surface coal mining operations in Idaho which have been adopted under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
(b) The rules in this part cross-reference pertinent parts of the permanent program regulations in this chapter. The full text of a rule is in the permanent program rule cited under the relevant section of the Idaho Federal program.
(c) The rules in this part apply to all surface coal mining operations in Idaho conducted on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. The rules in subchapter D of this chapter apply to operations on Federal lands in Idaho.
(d) The recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this part are the same as those of the permanent program regulations which have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507.
(e) The following provisions of Idaho laws provide, where applicable, for more stringent environmental control and regulation of surface coal mining operations than do the provisions of the Act and the regulations in this chapter. Therefore, pursuant to Section 505(b) of the Act, they shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Act.
(1) Idaho Code Section 47-1503(20) pertaining to the definition of “operator.”
(2) Idaho Code Section 47-1509(c) regarding reclamation of disturbed land of less than 2 acres.
(3) Idaho Code Section 47-1513(c) providing for assessment of anticipated costs of reclamation against an operator.
(4) Idaho Code Sections 47-1513 (f) and (g) providing for assessment of civil penalties in addition to bond forfeiture.
(5) Idaho Code Sections 47-1301
et seq.
and Rules 1 through 20 promulgated thereunder pertaining to regulation of dredge mining.
(6) Idaho Code Sections 18-4301 and 18-7019 providing for punishment for interference with water sources used in mining operations.
(7) Idaho Code Section 42-1713 requiring a fee to be paid by each owner of a dam, reservoir or mine tailing impoundment structure.
(8) Idaho Code Section 42-1718 (Supp.) providing for assessment against an operator for costs incurred in correction deficiencies in dams and impoundment structures.
(f) The following Idaho statute and regulations interfere with the achievement of the purposes and goals of the Act. Therefore, in accordance with section 504(g) of the Act, they are preempted and superseded with respect to surface coal mining and reclamation, except as they apply to surface coal mining operations affecting two acres or less, or which otherwise are not regulated by the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act:
The Idaho Surface Mining Act, Idaho Code Sections 47-1501—47-1524, as amended, and all regulations issued thereunder (with the exception of Sections 47-1503(20), 47-1509(c), 47-1513(c), and 47-1513 (f) and (g), and all regulations issued thereunder).

§ 913.30
State-Federal cooperative agreement.
The Governor of the State of Illinois (Governor) and the Secretary of the Department of the Interior (Secretary) enter into a Cooperative Agreement (Agreement) to read as follows:

# Article I: Introduction, Purposes and Responsible Agencies
A.
Authority:
This Agreement is authorized by section 523(c) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA), 30 U.S.C. 1273(c), which allows a State with a permanent regulatory program approved by the Secretary under section 503 of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1253, to elect to enter into an agreement for State regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations (including surface operations and surface impacts incident to underground mining operations) on Federal lands. This Agreement provides for State regulation of coal exploration operations not subject to 43 CFR part 3480, subpart3480 through 3487, and surface coal mining and reclamation operations in Illinois on Federal lands (30 CFR Chapter VII Subchapter D), consistent with SMCRA and State and Federal laws governing such activities and the Illinois State Program (Program).
B.
Purposes:
The purposes of this Agreement are to (a) foster Federal-State cooperation in the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations and coal exploration operations not subject to 43 CFR part 3480, subparts 3480 through 3487; (b) minimize intergovernmental overlap and duplication; and (c) provide uniform and effective application of the Program on all lands in Illinois in accordance with SMCRA, the Program, and this Agreement.
C.
Responsible Administrative Agencies:
The Land Reclamation Division (LRD) of the Illinois Department of Mines and Minerals will be responsible for administering this Agreement on behalf of the Governor. The Office of Surface and Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) will administer this Agreement on behalf of the Secretary.

# Article II: Effective Date
After being signed by the Secretary and the Governor, this Agreement will take effect 30 days after publication in the
Federal Register
as a final rule. This Agreement will remain in effect until terminated as provided in Article XI.

# Article III: Definitions
The terms and phrases used in this Agreement which are defined in SMCRA, 30 CFR parts 700, 701 and 740, the Program, and this Agreement including the State Act [Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch 96
1/2
, Section 7901
et seq.
(1985)], and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to those Acts, will be given the meanings set forth in said definitions. Where there is a conflict between the above reference State and Federal definitions, the definitions used in the Program will apply.

# Article IV: Applicability
In accordance with the Federal lands program, the laws, regulations, terms and conditions of the Program and this Agreement are applicable to Federal lands in Illinois except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, SMCRA, 30 CFR 740.4, 740.11(a) and 745.13, and other applicable laws, Executive Orders, or regulations.

# Article V: General Requirements
The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with all the provisions of this Agreement.
A.
Authority of State Agency:
IRD has and will continue to have the authority under State law to carry out this Agreement.
B.
Funds:
1. Upon application by LRD and subject to appropriations, OSMRE will provide the State with the funds to defray the costs associated with carrying out its responsibilities under this Agreement as provided in section 705(c) of SMCRA, the grant agreement, and 30 CFR 735.16. Such funds will cover the full cost incurred by LRD in carrying out these responsibilities, provided that such cost does not exceed the estimated cost the Federal government would have expended on such responsibilities in the absence of this Agreement.
2. OSMRE's Springfield Field Office and OSMRE's Eastern Field Operations office will work with LRD to estimate the amount the Federal government would have expended for regulation of Federal lands in Illinois in the absence of this Agreement.
3. OSMRE and the State will discuss the OSMRE Federal lands cost estimate. After resolution of any issues, LRD will include the Federal lands cost estimate in the State's annual regulatory grant application submitted to OSMRE's Springfield Field Office.
The State may use the existing year's budget totals, adjusted for inflation and workload considerations in estimating regulatory costs for the following grant year. OSMRE will notify LRD as soon as possible if such projections are unrealistic.
4. If LRD applies for a grant but sufficient funds have not been appropriated to OSMRE, OSMRE and LRD will promptly meet to decide on appropriate measures that will insure that surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands in Illinois are regulated in accordance with the Program. If agreement cannot be reached, either party may terminate the Agreement in accordance with Article XI of this Agreement.
5. Funds provided to the LRD under this Agreement will be adjusted in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-102, Attachment E.
C.
Reports and Records:
LRD will make annual reports to OSMRE containing information with respect to compliance with the terms of this Agreement pursuant to 30 CFR 745.12(d). Upon request, LRD and OSMRE will exchange information developed under this Agreement, except where prohibited by Federal or State law.
OSMRE will provide LRD with a copy of any final evaluation report prepared concerning State administration and enforcement of this Agreement. LRD comments on the report will be appended before transmission to the Congress, unless necessary to respond to a request by a date certain, or to other interested parties.
D.
Personnel:
Subject to adequate appropriations and grant awards, the LRD will maintain the necessary personnel to fully implement this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of SMCRA, the Federal lands program, and the Program.
E.
Equipment and Laboratories:
Subject to adequate appropriations and grant awards, the LRD will assure itself access to equipment, laboratories, and facilities with which all inspections, investigations, studies, tests, and analyses can be performed which are necessary to carry out the requirements of the Agreement.
F.
Permit Application Fees and Civil Penalties:
The amount of the fee accompanying an application for a permit for surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands in Illinois will be determined in accordance with section 2.05 of the Illinois State Act, 62 Ill. Adm. Code 1771.25, and the applicable provisions of the Program and Federal law. All permit fees, civil penalties and fines collected from operations on Federal lands will be retained by the State and will be deposited with the State Treasurer. Permit fees will be considered program income. Civil penalties and fines will not be considered program income. The financial status report submitted pursuant to 30 CFR 735.26 will include a report of the amount of fees, penalties, and fines collected during the State's prior fiscal year.

# Article VI: Review of Permit Application Package

# A. Submission of Permit Application Package
1. LRD and the Secretary require an applicant proposing to conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands covered by this Agreement to submit a permit application package (PAP) in an appropriate number of copies to LRD. LRD will furnish OSMRE and other Federal agencies with an appropriate number of copies of the PAP. The PAP will be in the form required by LRD and will include any supplemental information required by OSMRE, the Federal land management agency, and other agencies with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands affected by the operations proposed in the PAP.
At a minimum, the PAP will satisfy the requirements of 30 CFR 740.13(b) and include the information necessary for LRD to make a determination of compliance with the Program and for OSMRE and the appropriate Federal agencies to make determinations of compliance with applicable requirements of SMCRA, the Federal lands program, and other Federal laws, Executive Orders, and regulations for which they are responsible.
2. For any outstanding or pending permit applications on Federal lands being processed by OSMRE prior to the effective date of this Agreement, OSMRE will maintain sole permit decision responsibility. After the final decision, all additional responsibilities shall pass to LRD pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

# B. Review Procedures Where There is No Leased Federal Coal Involved
1. LRD will assume the responsibilities for review of permit applications where there is no leased Federal coal to the extent authorized in 30 CFR 740.4(c) (1), (2), (4), (6) and (7). In addition to consultation with the Federal Land Management Agency pursuant to 30 CFR 740.4(c)(2), LRD will be responsible for obtaining, except for non-significant revisions, the comments and determinations of other Federal agencies with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands affected by the operations proposed in the PAP. LRD will request such Federal agencies to furnish their findings or any requests for additional information to LRD within 45 calendar days of the date of receipt of the PAP. OSMRE will assist LRD in obtaining this information, upon request.

(c) OSMRE will review the operation and reclamation plan portion of the permit application, and any other appropriate portions of the PAP for compliance with the non-delegable responsibilities of SMCRA and for compliance with the requirements of other Federal laws and regulations.
(d) OSMRE and LRD will develop a work plan and schedule for PAP review and each will identify a person as the project leader. The project leaders will serve as the primary points of contact between OSMRE and LRD throughout the review process. Not later than 50 days after receipt of the PAP, unless a different time is agreed upon, OSMRE will furnish LRD with its review comments on the PAP and specify any requirements for additional data. To the extent practicable, LRD will provide OSMRE all available information that may aid OSMRE in preparing any findings.
(e) LRD will prepare a State decision package, including written findings and supporting documentation, indicating whether the PAP is in compliance with the Program. The review and finalization of the State decision package will be conducted in accordance with procedures for processing PAPs agreed upon by LRD and OSMRE.
(f) LRD may make a decision on approval or disapproval of the permit on Federal lands in accordance with the Program prior to the necessary Secretarial decision on the mining plan, provided that LRD advises the operator in the permit that Secretarial approval of the mining plan must be obtained before the operator may conduct coal development or mining operations on the Federal lease. LRD will reserve the right to amend or rescind any requirements of the permit to conform
with any terms or conditions imposed by the Secretary in his approval of the mining plan.
(g) The permit will include, as applicable, terms and conditions required by the lease issued pursuant to the MLA and by any other applicable Federal laws and regulations, including conditions imposed by the Federal land management agency relating to post-mining land use, and those of other affected agencies, and will be conditioned on compliance with the requirements of the Federal land management agency with jurisdiction.
(h) After making its decision on the PAP, LRD will send a notice to the applicant, OSMRE, the Federal land management agency, and any agency with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal land affected by operations proposed in the PAP.

C. LRD will be the point of contact and primary inspection authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations and compliance with the requirements covered by the agreement, except as described hereinafter. Nothing in this Agreement will prevent inspections by authorized Federal or State agencies for purposes other than those covered by this Agreement. The Department may conduct any inspections necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 842 and 843 and its obligations under laws other than SMCRA.
D. OSMRE will ordinarily give LRD reasonable notice of its intent to conduct an inspection under 30 CFR 842.11 in order to provide State inspectors with an opportunity to join in the inspection.
When OSMRE is responding to a citizen complaint of an imminent danger to the public health and safety, or of significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air or water resources, pursuant to 30 CFR 842.11(b)(1)(ii)(C), it will contact LRD no less than 24 hours prior to the Federal inspection, if practicable, to facilitate a joint Federal/State inspection. All citizen complaints which do not involve an imminent danger or significant, imminent environmental harm will be referred to LRD for action. The Secretary reserves the right to conduct inspections without prior notice to LRD to carry out his responsibilities under SMCRA.

# Article VIII: Enforcement
A. LRD will have primary enforcement authority under SMCRA concerning compliance with the requirements of this Agreement and the Program in accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5). Enforcement authority given to the Secretary under other Federal laws and Executive orders including, but not limited to, those listed in appendix A (attached) is reserved to the Secretary.
B. During any joint inspection by OSMRE and LRD, LRD will have primary responsibility for enforcement procedures, including issuance of orders of cessation, notices of violation, and assessment of penalties. LRD will inform OSMRE prior to issuance of any decision to suspend or revoke a permit on Federal lands.
C. During any inspection made solely by OSMRE or any joint inspection where LRD and OSMRE fail to agree regarding the propriety of any particular enforcement action, OSMRE may take any enforcement action necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843 and 845. Such enforcement action will be based on the standards in the Program, SMCRA, or both, and will be taken using the
procedures and penalty system contained in 30 CFR parts 843 and 845.
D. LRD and OSMRE will promptly notify each other of all violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, or approved mining permits subject to this Agreement, and of all actions taken with respect to such violations.
E. Personnel of LRD and the Department of the Interior, including OSMRE, will be mutually available to serve as witness in enforcement actions taken by either party.
F. This Agreement does not affect or limit the Secretary's authority to enforce violations of Federal laws other than SMCRA.

# Article IX: Bonds
A. LRD and the Secretary will require each operator who conducts operations on Federal lands to submit a performance bond payable to the State of Illinois and the United States to cover the operator's responsibilities under SMCRA and the Program. Such performance bond will be conditioned upon compliance with all requirements of the SMCRA, the Program, State rules and regulations, and any other requirements imposed by the Secretary or the Federal land management agency. Such bond will provide that if this Agreement is terminated, the portion of the bond covering the Federal lands will be payable only to the United States. LRD will advise OSMRE of annual adjustments to the performance bond pursuant to the program.
B. Performance bonds will be subject to release and forfeiture in accordance with the procedures and requirements of the Program. Where surface coal mining and reclamation operations are subject to an approved mining plan, a performance bond shall be released by the State after the release is concurred in by OSMRE.

§ 914.30
State-Federal Cooperative Agreement.

# State-Federal Cooperative Agreement
The Governor of the State of Indiana (Governor) and the Secretary of the Department of the Interior (Secretary) enter into a Cooperative Agreement (Agreement) to read as follows:

# Article I: Introduction, Purposes and Responsible Agencies

# A. Authority
This Agreement is authorized by section 523(c) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA), 30 U.S.C. 1273(c), which allows a State with a permanent regulatory program approved by the Secretary under section 503 of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1253, to elect to enter into an Agreement for the State regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations (including surface operations and surface impacts incident to underground mining operations) on Federal lands. This Agreement provides for State regulation of coal exploration operations not subject to 43 CFR part 3400 and surface coal mining and reclamation operations in Indiana on Federal lands (30 CFR Chapter VII Subchapter D), consistent with SMCRA and State and Federal laws governing such activities and the Indiana State Program (Program).

# B. Purposes
The purposes of this Agreement are to (a) foster Federal-State cooperation in the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations and coal exploration operations not subject to 43 CFR part 3400; (b) minimize intergovernmental overlap and duplication; and (c) provide uniform and effective application of the Program on all lands in Indiana in accordance with SMCRA, the Program, and this Agreement.

# C. Responsible Administrative Agencies
The Natural Resource Commission (NRC) and the Division of Reclamation (DOR) of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources will be responsible for administering this Agreement on behalf of the Governor under the approved Indiana Regulatory Program. The Office of Surface and Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) will administer this Agreement on behalf of the Secretary.

# Article II: Effective Date
After being signed by the Secretary and the Governor, this Agreement will take effect 30 days after publication in the
Federal Register
as a final rule. This Agreement will remain in effect until terminated as provided in Article XI.

# Article III: Definitions
The terms and phrases used in this Agreement which are defined in SMCRA, 30 CFR Parts 700, 701 and 740, the Program, including the OSM approved State Act (I.C. 14-34), and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to those Acts, will be given the meanings set forth in said definitions. Where there is a conflict between the above referenced State and Federal definitions, the definitions used in the Program will apply.

# Article IV: Applicability
In accordance with the Federal lands program, the laws, regulations, terms and conditions of the Program are applicable to Federal lands in Indiana except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, SMCRA, 30 CFR 740.4, 740.11(a) and 745.13, and other applicable laws, Executive Orders, or regulations.

# Article V: General Requirements
The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with all the provisions of this Agreement.
A.
Authority of State Agency:
DOR and NRC have and will continue to have the authority under State law to carry out this Agreement.
B.
Funds:
1. Upon application by DOR and subject to appropriations, OSM will provide the State with the funds to defray the costs associated with carrying out its responsibilities under this Agreement as provided in section 705(c) of SMCRA, the grant agreement, and 30 CFR 735.16. Such funds will cover the full cost incurred by DOR and NRC in carrying out these responsibilities, provided that such cost does not exceed the estimated cost the Federal government would have expended on such responsibilities in the absence of this Agreement.
2. OSM's Indianapolis Field Office and OSM's Mid-Continent Region Coordinating Center office will work with DOR to estimate the amount the Federal government would have expended for regulation of Federal lands in Indiana in the absence of this Agreement.
3. OSM and the State will discuss the OSM Federal lands cost estimate. After resolution of any issues, DOR will include the Federal lands cost estimate in the State's annual regulatory grant application submitted to OSM's Indianapolis Field Office.
The State may use the existing year's budget totals, adjusted for inflation and workload considerations in estimated regulatory costs for the following grant year. OSM will notify DOR as soon as possible if such projections are not acceptable.
4. If DOR applies for a grant but sufficient funds have not been appropriated to OSM, OSM and DOR will promptly meet to decide on appropriate measures that will insure that surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands in Indiana are regulated in accordance with the Program. If agreement cannot be reached, either party may terminate the Agreement in accordance with Article XI of this Agreement.
5. Funds provided to the DOR under this Agreement will be adjusted in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Common Rule for Uniform Administration Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments.
C.
Reports and Records:
DOR will make annual reports to OSM containing information with respect to compliance with the terms of this Agreement pursuant to 30 CFR 745.12(d). Upon request, DOR and OSM will exchange information developed under this Agreement, except where prohibited by Federal or State law.
OSM will provide DOR with a copy of any final evaluation report prepared concerning State administration and enforcement of this Agreement. DOR comments on the report will be appended before transmission to the Congress, unless necessary to respond to a request by a date certain, or to other interested parties.
