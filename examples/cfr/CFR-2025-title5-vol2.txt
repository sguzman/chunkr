# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

# Subpart A—Principal Statutory Requirements
§ 720.101
Federal Equal Opportunity Recruitment Program.
This section incorporates the statutory requirements for establishing and conducting an equal opportunity recruitment program consistent with law within the Federal civil service. The policy in 5 U.S.C. 7201(b) reads as follows: “It is the policy of the United States to insure equal employment opportunities for employees without discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The President shall use his existing authority to carry out this policy.” 5 U.S.C. 7201(c) requires under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management:
“(1) That each Executive agency conduct a continuing program for the recruitment of members of minorities for positions in the agency to carry out the [anti-discrimination] policy set forth in subsection (b) in a manner designed to eliminate underrepresentation of minorities in the various categories of civil service employment within the Federal service, with special efforts directed at recruiting in minority communities, in educational institutions, and from other sources from which minorities can be recruited; and
“(2) That the Office conduct a continuing program of—
“(A) Assistance to agencies in carrying out programs under paragraph (1) of this subsection; and
“(B) Evaluation and oversight of such recruitment programs to determine their effectiveness in eliminating such minority underrepresentation.”
This section and all implementing guidance shall be interpreted consistent with title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2000c
et seq.
[44 FR 22031, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 48 FR 193, Jan. 4, 1983]

# Subpart B—Federal Equal Opportunity Recruitment Program
§ 720.201
Regulatory requirements.
This subpart contains the regulations of the Office of Personnel Management which implement the above provisions of title 5, United States Code, and are prescribed by the Office under authority of 5 U.S.C. 7201.
§ 720.202
Definitions.
For the purposes of this subpart:
(a)
Underrepresentation
means a situation in which the number of women or members of a minority group within a category of civil service employment constitutes a lower percentage of the total number of employees within the employment category than the percentage women or the minority constitutes within the civilian labor force of the United States, in accordance with § 720.205 (c) and (d).
(b)
Category of civil service employment
means such groupings of Federal jobs by grades and/or occupations as the Office of Personnel Management deems appropriate within the General Schedule and the prevailing wage systems.
(c)
Minority
refers only to those groups classified as “minority” for the purpose of data collection by the Office of Personnel Management and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in furtherance of Federal equal employment opportunity policies. The term, “women,” includes nonminority as well as minority women.
(d)
Civilian labor force
(CLF) includes all persons 16 years of age and over, except those in the armed forces, who are employed or who are unemployed and seeking work. CLF data are defined by the Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics and are reported in the most recent decennial or mid-decade census, or current population survey, under title 13 of the United States Code or any other reliable statistical study.
(e)
Recruitment
means the total process by which the Federal Government and the Federal agencies locate, identify and assist in the employment of qualified applicants from underrepresented groups for job openings in categories of employment where underrepresentation has been determined. It includes both innovative internal and external recruitment actions. It is also intended to cover processes designed to prepare qualifiable applicants (those who have the potential but do not presently meet valid qualification requirements) for such job openings through
programs of training, work experience or both.
(f)
Applicant pool
means all types of listings from which selections may be made, including (but not limited to) promotion lists, competitive certificates and inventories of eligibles, applicant supply files, and lists of eligibles for certain noncompetitive appointments.
§ 720.203
Responsibilities of the Office of Personnel Management.
(a) The Office of Personnel Management will provide appropriate data to assist Federal agencies in making determinations of underrepresentation. The process for making such determinations is described in sections II and III (c) of the “Guidelines for the Development of a Federal Recruitment Program to Implement 5 U.S.C. 7201, as amended” (See appendix to this part). The Office will develop and publish more specific criteria for statistical measurements to be used by individual agencies, and will develop further guidance on—
(1) Agency employment statistics and civilian labor force statistics to be used in making determinations of underrepresentation, on a national, regional or other geographic basis as appropriate;
(2) Groupings of grades and/or other occupational categories to be used in implementing agency programs;
(3) Occupational categories and job series for which expanded external recruitment efforts are most appropriate, and those for which expanded and innovative internal recruitment is appropriate; and
(4) Other factors which may be considered by the agency, in consultation with Office of Personnel Management, to make determinations of underrepresentation and to develop recruitment programs focused on specific occupational categories.
(b) The Office will assist agencies in carrying out their programs by—
(1) Identifying major recruitment sources of women and members of minority groups and providing guidance on internal and external recruitment activities directed toward the solution of specific underrepresentation problem;
(2) Supplementing agency recruitment efforts, utilizing existing networks for dissemination of job information, and involving the participation of minority group and women's organizations where practicable;
(3) Examining existing Federal personnel procedures to identify those which (i) may serve as impediments to innovative internal and external recruitment and (ii) are within the administrative control of the Office or the Federal agencies;
(4) Determining whether applicant pools used in filling jobs in a category of employment where underrepresentation exists include sufficient candidates from any underrepresentated groups, except where the agency controls such pools (see § 720.204(c));
(5) Providing such other support, as the Office deems appropriate.
(c) The Office will monitor and, in conjunction with the personnel management evaluation program of the Office, evaluate agency programs to determine their effectiveness in eliminating underrepresentation.
(d) The Office will work with agencies to develop effective mechanisms for providing information on Federal job opportunities targeted to reach candidates from underrepresented groups.
(e) The Office will conduct a continuing program of guidance and instruction to supplement these regulations.
(f) The Office will coordinate further activities to implement equal opportunity recruitment programs under this subpart with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission consistent with law, Executive Order 12067, and Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978.
§ 720.204
Agency programs.
(a) Each Executive agency having positions in the pay systems covered by this program must conduct a continuing program for the recruitment of minorities and women for positions in the agency and its components to carry out the policy of the United States to insure equal employment opportunities without discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. The head of each agency must specifically assign responsibility for program
implementation to an appropriate agency official. All agency officials who have responsibility for the program will be evaluated on their effectiveness in carrying it out as part of their periodic performance appraisals.
(b) Programs established under this subpart must be designed to cover recruitment for all positions in pay plans covered by this program including part-time and temporary positions.
(c) Where an agency or the Office of Personnel Management has determined that an applicant pool does not adequately provide for consideration of candidates from any underrepresented group, the agency or agency component must take one or more of the following actions:
(1) Expand or otherwise redirect their recruitment activities in ways designed to increase the number of candidates from underrepresented groups in that applicant pool;
(2) Use selection methods involving other applicant pools which include sufficient numbers of members of underrepresented groups;
(3) Notify the office responsible for administering that applicant pool, and request its reopening of application receipt in support of expanded recruitment activities or certifying from equivalent registers existing in other geographic areas; and/or
(4) Take such other action consistent with law which will contribute to the elimination of underrepresentation in the category of employment involved.
(d) Agencies must notify and seek advice and assistance from the Office of Personnel Management in cases where their equal opportunity recruitment programs are not making measurable progress in eliminating identified underrepresentation in the agency work force.
§ 720.205
Agency plans.
(a) Each agency must have an up-to-date equal opportunity recruitment program plan covering recruitment for positions at various organizational levels and geographic locations within the agency. Such plans must be available for review in appropriate offices of the agency and must be submitted to the Office of Personnel Management on request. In accordance with agreement reached between the Office and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, such plans must be incorporated in the agency's equal employment opportunity plans required under section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, pursuant to regulations and instructions of the Commission, provided they are separable parts of those plans for purposes of review by and submission to the Office of Personnel Management. Agency organizational and geographical components which are required to develop and submit Equal Employment Opportunity plans, under instructions issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, must also have up-to-date special recruitment program plans. On a determination by the Office of Personnel Management, in consultation with EEOC, that additional component plans are needed to implement an agency's program effectively, the Office will instruct the agency to develop additional plans. Agencies must comply with such instructions.
(b) Agency plans must include annual specific determinations of underrepresentation for each group and must be accompanied by quantifiable indices by which progress toward eliminating underrepresentation can be measured.
(c) Where an agency or agency component is located in a geographical area where the percentage of underrepresented groups in the area civilian labor force is higher than their percentage in the national labor force, the agency or component must base its plans on the higher level of representation in the relevant civilian labor force.
(d) Where an agency or agency component is located in a geographical area where participation of a particular underrepresented group is significantly lower than its participation in the national labor force, the agency or component may, in consultation with the Office of Personnel Management, use the lower percentage in determining underrepresentation. An agency may not use a figure lower than the relevant regional or nationwide labor force percentage where recruitment on a regional or nationwide basis is feasible for particular categories of employment. Factors such as size of
the agency or unit, nature of jobs and their wage or pay scale may be considered in focusing recruitment for various job categories.
(e) In addition to the underrepresentation determinations described in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section, agency plans must, at a minimum, include:
(1) An assessment of grades or job categories and numbers of jobs in such categories expected to be filled in the current year, and on a longer term basis (based on anticipated turnover, expansion, hiring limits and other relevant factors) identification of those occupational categories and positions suitable for external recruitment, and description of special targeted recruitment programs for such jobs and positions;
(2) A similar assessment for job categories and positions likely to be filled by recruitment from within the agency and/or the Federal civil service system and a description of recruitment programs developed to increase minority and female candidates from internal sources for such positions;
(3) A further assessment of internal availability of candidates from underrepresentated groups for higher job progressions by identifying job-related skills, knowledges and abilities which may be obtained at lower levels in the same or similar occupational series, or through other experience;
(4) A description of methods the agency intends to use to locate and develop minority and female candidates for each category of underrepresentation and an indication of how such methods differ from and expand upon the recruitment activities of the agency prior to establishment of the special recruitment program or the last revision to the agency's plans;
(5) A description of specific, special efforts planned by the agency (or agency component) to recruit in communities, educational institutions, and other likely sources of qualified minority and female candidates;
(6) A description of efforts which will be undertaken by the agency to identify jobs which can be redesigned so as to improve opportunities for minorities and women, including jobs requiring bilingual or bicultural capabilities or not requiring English fluency.
(7) A list of priorities for special recruitment program activities based on agency identification of:
(i) Immediate and longer range job openings for each occupational/grade-level grouping for which underrepresentation has been determined;
(ii) Hiring authorities which may be used to fill such jobs;
(iii) The possible impact of its actions on underrepresentation.
(8) Identification of training and job development programs the agency will use to provide skills, knowledge and abilities to qualify increased numbers of minorities and women for occupational series and grade levels where they are significantly underrepresented.
(9) Identification of problems for which the assistance of the Office of Personnel Management is needed and will be requested.

# Appendix to Part 720—Guidelines for the Development of a Federal Recruitment Program To Implement 5 U.S.C. Section 7201, as Amended
1
1
This section originally was section 701(b) (2nd Proviso) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Pub. L. 88-352, July 2, 1964), codified as 5 U.S.C. 7151. Section 7151 was further amended by section 310 of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. This Act also redesignated section 7151 as section 7201, effective January 11, 1979. (Sec. 703(a)(1) of the Act.)
I.
Background Information.
A. In 1964 the Congress adopted a basic anti-discrimination policy for Federal employment, stating:
It is the policy of the United States to insure equal employment opportunities for employees without discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. [5 U.S.C. 7151]
2
2
Ibid.
In 1978, Congress reaffirmed and amended this policy as part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 [Sec. 310 of Pub. L. 95-454], requiring immediate development of a recruitment program designed to eliminate underrepresentation of minority groups in specific Federal job categories. Section 310 directs the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission:
1. To establish Guidelines proposed to be used for a program designed to eliminate such underrepresentation;
2. To make, in consultation with OPM, initial determinations of underrepresentation which are proposed to be used in this program; and
3. To transmit the determinations made under (2) above to the Executive Agencies, the Office of Personnel Management and the Congress, within 60 days of enactment.
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
3
is directed by this amendment:
3
This Office was created by Reorganization Plan No. 2, issued pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 901
et seq.
It will assume personnel management functions of the present Office of Personnel Management on January 1, 1979.
1. To issue regulations to implement a program under EEOC Guidelines within 180 days after enactment, which shall provide that Executive agencies conduct continuing recruitment programs to carry out the anti-discrimination policy in a manner designed
to eliminate underrepresentation in identified categories of civil service;
2. To provide continuing assistance to Federal agencies in carrying out such programs;
3. To conduct a continuing program of evaluation and oversight to determine the effectiveness of such programs;
4. To establish occupational, professional and other groupings within which appropriate recruitment will occur, based upon the determinations of underrepresentation pursuant to these Guidelines; and
5. To report annually to the Congress on this program, not later than January 31 of each year.
Congress further directed that the recruitment program must be administered consistent with provisions of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978.
4
4
Conference Report on Civil Service Reform Act of 1978,
No. 95-1272, p. 145.
B. In framing these Guidelines and making its initial determinations of underrepresentation, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (Commission) is acting pursuant to its obligations and authority under 5 U.S.C. 7201, as amended; Section 717 of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978 (issued pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 901
et seq.
) and Executive Order 12067, issued under this Plan (43 FR 28967, June 30, 1978). This Commission must develop and/or ensure the development of uniform, coherent and effective standards for administration and enforcement of all Federal anti-discrimination and equal employment opportunity laws, policies and programs, and to ensure the elimination of duplication and inconsistency in such programs.
C. A review of the legislative history of Federal equal employment opportunity policy provides further guidance on the scope and nature of determinations and guidelines to be issued for this program.
The basic policy statement on Federal equal employment policy enacted by the Congress in 1964 (5 U.S.C. 7151, redesignated as section 7201) gave the President authority for implementation. Executive Order 11246 (1966), expanded and superseded by Executive Order 11478 (1969) with respect to Federal employment, required Federal agencies to develop affirmative action programs designed to eliminate discrimination and assure equal employment opportunity.
In 1972, Congress found that serious discrimination persisted in Federal employment. It found that minorities and women were significantly absent at higher levels in Federal employment, and severely underrepresented in some Federal agencies and in some geographic areas where they constituted significant proportions of the population. After a detailed review of Federal employment practices and statistics, the Congress concluded that:
The disproportionate distribution of minorities and women throughout the Federal bureaucracy and their exclusion from higher level policy-making and supervisory positions indicates the government's failure to pursue its policy of equal employment opportunity.
5
5
Legislative History of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972,
p. 83. See pp. 82-86 and 421-425 for Congressional Findings.
Congress found that this exclusion resulted from overt and “systemic” discriminatory practices.
These findings, among others, led Congress to extend title VII coverage to Federal employment in Section 717 of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972.
The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 clearly states, for the first time, that “it is the policy of the United States * * * to provide * * * a Federal workforce reflective of the Nation's diversity * * *”
6
The Act establishes in law as the first merit principle that recruitment should be designed to achieve a Federal workforce from “all segments of society.” Among the personnel practices prohibited by the Act is discrimination prohibited under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.
7
Therefore, the Civil Service Reform Act and its directive for a special recruitment program clearly unite requirements for basic Federal personnel policy with requirements for Federal equal employment policy.
6
Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Section 3.
7
Section 101(a) of the Act, 5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(1) and 2302(b)(1)(A), as amended.
It is clear from the legislative history of Federal equal employment policy that the legal standards of title VII must be applied to Federal employment. Thus, guidelines for a recruitment program designed to eliminate underrepresentation in Federal agency employment must be developed consistent with the framework of affirmative action programs.
D. Guided by the review of the legislative history, and the responsibilities and authorities cited in I(B) of this appendix, the Commission is issuing these Guidelines to provide a framework for development of recruitment program regulations by OPM. The Commission may later provide more detailed guidance, through consultation with OPM, designed to achieve an overall Federal equal employment program which is consistent with, and which effectively implements title VII requirements.
II.
Initial Determinations of Underrepresentation.
A. Pursuant to Section 7201, underrepresentation exists when the percentages of minority and female Federal employees in
specific grades are less than their percentages in the civilian labor force. “Minority” refers only to those groups classified as “minority” for the purpose of data collection by the Commission and OPM in furtherance of Federal equal employment opportunity policies. The civilian labor force includes all persons 16 years of age and over except the armed forces, who are employed or seeking employment. Such a determination of underrepresentation is designated in these Guidelines as “below the Section 7201 level”.
B. The Commission has examined existing data on Federal employment and the civilian labor force and has made initial determinations of underrepresentation of groups by race, national origin and sex in specific grades of the major Federal pay systems, under the legal authorities cited in I(B), of this appendix.
C. The Table which follows shows the grades at which the percentage of each group in the Federal workforce falls below its percentage in the civilian labor force. The table covers four major Federal pay systems which account for more than 95 percent of Federal employees, excluding the Postal Service.
8
8
The initial determinations are based on data for only those agencies covered by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. The Commission will make subsequent determinations on other agencies covered by title VII, e.g. the U.S. Postal Service, TVA, Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Reserve Board.

Sources: Civilian Labor Force information based on data from the Current Population Survey, Bureau of Labor Statistics,
Employment and Earnings,
Vol. 25, No. 1, January 1978.
Information on grades below 7201 level based on Office of Personnel Management data from
Equal Employment Opportunity Statistics,
November 20, 1977 (publication in process).
D. The initial determinations of underrepresentation were based upon average 1977 labor force data from the Current Population Survey published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (
Employment and Earnings,
January 1978), and 1977 Federal workforce statistics from
Equal Employment Opportunity Statistics
(publication in process).
The labor force figures are published annually; the Federal employment statistics semiannually. These measures, and any modifications agreed upon by the Commission and OPM, will be updated annually.
Regional and area Federal employment statistics are available from the Office of Personnel Management. The latest reliable local labor force data by race, national origin, and sex is from the 1970 Census. The Commission and OPM will consult on appropriate labor force measures to be used for local analyses.
E. These initial determinations are based upon a preliminary analysis of the data, and may be further refined by the Commission, in consultation with OPM, to include geographic and occupational underrepresentation. It is further recognized that for the purpose of developing regulations, the OPM, in consultation with the Commission, will undertake more specific analyses of data use and applicability necessary to develop programs for the Federal agencies pursuant to Section 7201(a)(2)(C). The OPM may establish criteria for grouping agencies, for treating
agency components separately and for grouping grades and pay systems. In addition, OPM may study other available data sources and use other techniques to assure statistically significant findings of underrepresentation. Based upon these studies, OPM may make recommendations to the Commission for future determinations of underrepresentation.
III.
Procedures for Developing Recruitment Programs.
A. The program developed and implemented by OPM under Section 7201 should be designed to result in applicant pools with sufficient qualified members of underrepresented groups. Where the supply of such groups initially appears to be low for specific occupational, professional and other groupings, the program should be designed so that recruitment efforts stimulate interest of underrepresented groups in those occupations where there are realistic projections of Federal employment opportunities.
B. In establishing groupings for determining underrepresentation, OPM should utilize broad occupational categories to the extent possible.
C. The Commission recognizes that OPM's regulations should allow flexibility in development and design of each Federal agency's recruitment program. However, all statistical comparisons must be computed in a manner consistent with the method utilized in II C of this appendix.
The Commission recommends that each agency program meet several minimum requirements. The program should be based on a determination of underrepresentation in the agency's total workforce, in appropriate geographic components; by grade; by broad occupational, professional and other groupings in comparison to the national civilian labor force, according to the criteria developed by OPM under these guidelines.
Where an agency or major component thereof (such as Headquarters and Regional Offices) is located in a geographic area where the percentage of underrepresented groups in the area civilian labor force is
higher
than their percentage in the national labor force, the agency or appropriate component should conduct its recruitment program for that component on the basis of the higher level of representation in the relevant civilian labor force.
Where an agency or major component thereof is located in a geographic area where participation of a particular underrepresented group in the area labor force is significantly
lower
than their participation in the national labor force, such agency or component may, in consultation with OPM, utilize the lower applicable civilian labor force percentage in determining underrepresentation for the component. In no event, however, may the agency utilize a figure lower than the regional or nationwide Section 7201 level for positions where recruitment on a regional or nationwide basis is feasible. Factors such as size of the agency or unit, nature of jobs and their wage or pay scale may be considered to set goals and to justify a recruitment program focused on various job categories.
IV.
Scope of Actions Covered by This Program.
A. “Recruitment” under this program is defined as the total process by which the Federal Government and the Federal agencies locate, identify and assist in the employment of qualified or qualifiable applicants from underrepresented groups for job openings in grades and in occupational categories where underrepresentation has been determined. This process should include innovative internal, as well as targeted external, recruitment actions.
B. Prior to developing regulations, the Office should review data on personnel actions and other information, to identify those job categories for which internal recruitment and external recruitment is most appropriate and feasible, and to provide guidance to the Federal agencies for targeting their recruitment programs, based on this information. OPM should advise all agencies that all job qualifications, personnel procedures and criteria must be consistent with the
Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures
(43 FR 38290 August 25, 1978) OPM should consider the following in providing guidance to agencies:
1.
External Recruitment Programs.
a. Such programs should focus on grade levels and/or job categories where underrepresentation has been identified and where external recruitment realistically will result in hiring opportunities.
Recruitment programs also should include a review of job functions to determine those jobs that may be better performed by persons who are bicultural and who have bilingual capabilities, and those jobs that can be performed by persons not fluent in English.
b. Where eligibility lists are used for filling jobs, it is recommended that the regulations require, an analysis by race, national origin and sex, to determine whether the list contains sufficient candidates from groups underrepresented in those jobs. OPM should require that where the list does not have such representation, expanded recruitment procedures be designed to assure that members of underrepresented groups qualified to perform the job(s) are included in the pool of applicants from which the selecting official makes the selection. Such expanded recruitment procedures may include additional external recruitment or various actions (such as described in 2. below) to reach members of these groups within the Federal workforce who are qualified or qualifiable for these jobs.
2.
Internal Recruitment Programs.
a. Internal recruitment programs should be designed by agencies to identify currently qualified or
qualifiable persons for job categories and series where underrepresentation prevails, according to the national determinations and the determinations made by each agency under these guidelines.
b. Further, OPM should work with Federal agencies to develop effective mechanisms for providing information on Federal job opportunities, targeted to reach Federal employees from underrepresented groups in all agencies in order to broaden the applicant pool.
V.
Consistency with Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978.
A. The Office shall develop regulations and implement this program in consultation with the Commission and with other affected agencies in such manner that their recruitment programs may be incorporated as a consistent and effective element of the agencies' national and regional equal employment opportunity plans. Each agency is required to implement such plans under the direction and guidance of the Commission in accordance with Section 717 of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, and Executive Order 12067.
B. Procedures shall be established by OPM and the Commission to assure appropriate consultation in development of the regulations.
C. Pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 1 and to Executive Order 12067 issued thereunder, the Commission will establish procedures to provide appropriate consultation and review of the program on a continuing basis, to maximize its effectiveness and eliminate any duplication, conflict or inconsistency in requirements for equal opportunity programs in the Federal agencies.
D. In preparing its annual report to the Congress pursuant to the Act, OPM should do so in consultation with the Commission.

The definitions, requirements, and procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or activities.
§§ 723.141-723.148
[Reserved]
§ 723.149
Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.
Except as otherwise provided in § 723.150, no qualified individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.
§ 723.150
Program accessibility: Existing facilities.
(a)
General.
The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—
(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant
historic features of an historic property; or
(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 723.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
(b)
Methods
—(1)
General.
The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
(2)
Historic preservation programs.
In meeting the requirements of § 723.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 723.150(a) (2) or (3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—
(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;
(ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or
(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
(c)
Time period for compliance.
The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.
(d)
Transition plan.
In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—
(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;
(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;
(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and
(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.
§ 723.151
Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.
Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.
§§ 723.152-723.159
[Reserved]
§ 723.160
Communications.
(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.
(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.
(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.
(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.
(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.
(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.
(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.
(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 723.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
§§ 723.161-723.169
[Reserved]
§ 723.170
Compliance procedures.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this section applies to all allegations of discrimination on the basis of handicap in programs and activities conducted by the agency.

(e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate Government entity.
(f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps.
(g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which it has jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the complainant of the results of the investigation in a letter containing—
(1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;
(2) A description of a remedy for each violation found; and
(3) A notice of the right to appeal.
(h) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or remedies must be filed by the complainant within 90 days of receipt from the agency of the letter required by § 723.170(g). The agency may extend this time for good cause.

# Model Paragraphs

# No Fear Act Notice
On May 15, 2002, Congress enacted the “Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002,” which is now known as the No FEAR Act. One purpose of the Act is to “require that Federal agencies be accountable for violations of antidiscrimination and whistleblower protection laws.” Public Law 107-174, Summary. In support of this purpose, Congress found that “agencies cannot be run effectively if those agencies practice or tolerate discrimination.” Public Law 107-174, Title I, General Provisions, section 101(1).
The Act also requires this agency to provide this notice to Federal employees, former Federal employees and applicants for Federal employment to inform you of the rights and protections available to you under
Federal antidiscrimination and whistleblower protection laws.

# Antidiscrimination Laws
A Federal agency cannot discriminate against an employee or applicant with respect to the terms, conditions or privileges of employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, marital status or political affiliation. Discrimination on these bases is prohibited by one or more of the following statutes: 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1), 29 U.S.C. 206(d), 29 U.S.C. 631, 29 U.S.C. 633a, 29 U.S.C. 791 and 42 U.S.C. 2000e-16.
If you believe that you have been the victim of unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin or disability, you must contact an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) counselor within 45 calendar days of the alleged discriminatory action, or, in the case of a personnel action, within 45 calendar days of the effective date of the action, before you can file a formal complaint of discrimination with your agency.
See, e.g.
29 CFR 1614. If you believe that you have been the victim of unlawful discrimination on the basis of age, you must either contact an EEO counselor as noted above or give notice of intent to sue to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) within 180 calendar days of the alleged discriminatory action. If you are alleging discrimination based on marital status or political affiliation, you may file a written complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) (
see
contact information below). In the alternative (or in some cases, in addition), you may pursue a discrimination complaint by filing a grievance through your agency's administrative or negotiated grievance procedures, if such procedures apply and are available.

# Whistleblower Protection Laws
A Federal employee with authority to take, direct others to take, recommend or approve any personnel action must not use that authority to take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a personnel action against an employee or applicant because of disclosure of information by that individual that is reasonably believed to evidence violations of law, rule or regulation; gross mismanagement; gross waste of funds; an abuse of authority; or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, unless disclosure of such information is specifically prohibited by law and such information is specifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.
Retaliation against an employee or applicant for making a protected disclosure is prohibited by 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(8). If you believe that you have been the victim of whistleblower retaliation, you may file a written complaint (Form OSC-11) with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel at 1730 M Street NW., Suite 218, Washington, DC 20036-4505 or online through the OSC Web site—
http://www.osc.gov.

# Retaliation for Engaging in Protected Activity
A Federal agency cannot retaliate against an employee or applicant because that individual exercises his or her rights under any of the Federal antidiscrimination or whistleblower protection laws listed above. If you believe that you are the victim of retaliation for engaging in protected activity, you must follow, as appropriate, the procedures described in the Antidiscrimination Laws and Whistleblower Protection Laws sections or, if applicable, the administrative or negotiated grievance procedures in order to pursue any legal remedy.

# Disciplinary Actions
Under the existing laws, each agency retains the right, where appropriate, to discipline a Federal employee for conduct that is inconsistent with Federal Antidiscrimination and Whistleblower Protection Laws up to and including removal. If OSC has initiated an investigation under 5 U.S.C. 1214, however, according to 5 U.S.C. 1214(f), agencies must seek approval from the Special Counsel to discipline employees for, among other activities, engaging in prohibited retaliation.

# Effective Date Note:
At 89 FR 102691, Dec. 18, 2024, subpart A of part 731 was revised, effective Jan. 17, 2025. For the convenience of the user, the new subpart A of part 731 follows the text of this subpart.
§ 731.101
Purpose.
(a) The purpose of this part is to establish criteria and procedures for making determinations of suitability
and for taking suitability actions regarding employment in covered positions (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3301, E.O. 10577 (3 CFR, 1954-1958 Comp., p. 218), as amended, and 5 CFR 1.1, 2.1(a) and 5.2. Section 3301 of title 5, United States Code, directs consideration of “age, health, character, knowledge, and ability for the employment sought.” E.O. 10577 (codified in relevant part at 5 CFR 1.1, 2.1(a) and 5.2) directs OPM to examine “suitability” for competitive Federal employment. This part concerns only determinations of “suitability,” that is, those determinations based on a person's character or conduct that may have an impact on the integrity or efficiency of the service. Determinations made and actions taken under this part are distinct from objections to eligibles or pass overs of preference eligibles, and OPM's and agencies' decisions on such requests, made under 5 U.S.C. 3318 and 5 CFR 332.406, as well as determinations of eligibility for assignment to, or retention in, sensitive national security positions made under E.O. 10450 (3 CFR, 1949-1953 Comp., p. 936), E.O. 12968, or similar authorities.
(b)

Covered position
means a position in the competitive service, a position in the excepted service where the incumbent can be noncompetitively converted to the competitive service, and a career appointment to a position in the Senior Executive Service.
Days

Employee
means a person who has completed the first year of a subject-to-investigation appointment.
Material
means, in reference to a statement, one that is capable of influencing, affects, or has a natural tendency to affect, an official decision even if OPM or an agency does not rely upon it.
Suitability action
means an outcome described in § 731.203 and may be taken only by OPM or an agency with delegated authority under the procedures in subparts C and D of this part.
Suitability determination

[73 FR 20154, Apr. 15, 2008, as amended at 73 FR 66492, Nov. 10, 2008]
§ 731.102
Implementation.
(a) An investigation conducted for the purpose of determining suitability under this part may not be used for any other purpose except as provided in a Privacy Act system of records notice published by the agency conducting the investigation.
(b) Under OMB Circular No. A-130 Revised, issued November 20, 2000, agencies are to implement and maintain a program to ensure that adequate protection is provided for all automated information systems. Agency personnel screening programs may be based on procedures developed by OPM. The Computer Security Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-235) provides additional requirements for Federal automated information systems.
(c) OPM may set forth policies, procedures, criteria, standards, quality control procedures, and supplementary guidance for the implementation of this part in OPM issuances.
§ 731.103
Delegation to agencies.
(a) Subject to the limitations and requirements of paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, OPM delegates to the heads of agencies authority for making suitability determinations and taking suitability actions (including limited, agency-specific debarments under § 731.205) in cases involving
applicants
for and
appointees
to covered positions in the agency.
(b) When an agency, acting under delegated authority from OPM, determines that a Governmentwide debarment by OPM under § 731.204(a) may be
an appropriate action, it must refer the case to OPM for debarment consideration. Agencies must make these referrals prior to any proposed suitability action, but only after sufficient resolution of the suitability issue(s), through subject contact or investigation, to determine if a Governmentwide debarment appears warranted.
(c) Agencies exercising authority under this part by delegation from OPM must adhere to OPM requirements as stated in this part and OPM's issuances described in § 731.102(c). Agencies must also implement policies and maintain records demonstrating that they employ reasonable methods to ensure adherence to these OPM issuances.
(d)(1) A hiring agency may not make specific inquiries concerning an applicant's criminal or credit background in oral or written form (including through the OF-306 or other forms used to conduct suitability investigations for Federal employment, USAJOBS, or any other electronic means) unless the hiring agency has made a conditional offer of employment to the applicant. Agencies may request an exception to the provision for making credit inquiries in advance of a conditional offer in accordance with the provisions in 5 CFR part 330, subpart M. For criminal inquiries prior to a conditional offer, this prohibition does not apply to applicants for positions excepted under 5 CFR 920.201(b). Agencies may make inquiries into an applicant's Selective Service registration, military service, citizenship status, where applicable, or previous work history, prior to making a conditional offer of employment to an applicant.
(2) OPM reserves the right to undertake a determination of suitability based upon evidence of falsification or fraud relating to an examination or appointment at any point when information giving rise to such a charge is discovered. OPM must be informed in all cases where there is evidence of material, intentional false statements, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment, and OPM will take a suitability action where warranted.
(e) When an agency, exercising authority under this part by delegation from OPM, makes a suitability determination or changes a tentative favorable placement decision to an unfavorable decision, based on an OPM report of investigation or upon an investigation conducted pursuant to OPM-delegated authority, the agency must:
(1) Ensure that the records used in making the determination are accurate, relevant, timely, and complete to the extent reasonably necessary to ensure fairness to the person in any determination;
(2) Ensure that all applicable administrative procedural requirements provided by law, the regulations in this part, and OPM issuances as described in § 731.102(c) have been observed;
(3) Consider all available information in reaching its final decision on a suitability determination or suitability action, except information furnished by a non-corroborated confidential source, which may be used only for limited purposes, such as information used to develop a lead or in interrogatories to a subject, if the identity of the source is not compromised in any way; and
(4) Keep any record of the agency suitability determination or action as required by OPM issuances as described in § 731.102(c).
(f) OPM may revoke an agency's delegation to make suitability determinations and take suitability actions under this part if an agency fails to conform to this part or OPM issuances as described in § 731.102(c).
(g) OPM retains jurisdiction to make final determinations and take actions in all suitability cases where there is evidence that there has been a material, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment. OPM also retains jurisdiction over all suitability cases involving a refusal to furnish testimony as required by § 5.4 of this chapter. Agencies must refer these cases to OPM for suitability determinations and suitability actions under this authority. Although no prior approval is needed, notification to OPM is required if the agency wants to take, or has taken, action under its own authority (5 CFR part 315, 5 CFR part 359, or 5 CFR part 752) in cases involving material, intentional false statement in examination or appointment, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment; or refusal to furnish testimony as required
by § 5.4 of this title. In addition, paragraph (a) of this section notwithstanding, OPM may, in its discretion, exercise its jurisdiction under this part in any case it deems necessary.
[73 FR 20154, Apr. 15, 2008, as amended at 81 FR 86561, Dec. 1, 2016; 88 FR 60330, Sept. 1, 2023]
§ 731.104
Appointments subject to investigation.
(a) To establish a person's suitability for employment, appointments to covered positions identified in § 731.101 require the person to undergo an investigation by OPM or by an agency with delegated authority from OPM to conduct investigations. However, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2), an appointment will not be subject to investigation when the person being appointed has undergone a background investigation and the appointment involves:
(1) Appointment or conversion to an appointment in a covered position if the person has been serving continuously with the agency for at least 1 year in one or more covered positions subject to investigation;
(2) Transfer to a covered position, provided the person has been serving continuously for at least 1 year in a covered position subject to investigation;
(3) Transfer or appointment from an excepted service position that is not a covered position to a covered position, provided the person has been serving continuously for at least 1 year in a position where the person has been determined fit for appointment based on criteria equivalent to the factors provided at 5 CFR 731.202;
(4) Appointment to a covered position from a position as an employee working as a Federal Government contract employee, provided the person has been serving continuously for at least 1 year in a job where a Federal agency determined the contract employee was fit to perform work on the contract based on criteria equivalent to the factors provided at 5 CFR 731.202; or
(5) Appointment to a covered position where there has been a break in service of less than 24 months, and the service immediately preceding the break was in a covered position, an excepted service position, or a contract employee position described in paragraphs (a)(1) to (a)(4) of this section.
(b)(1) Either OPM or an agency with delegated suitability authority may investigate and take a suitability action against an applicant, appointee, or employee in accordance with § 731.105. There is no time limit on the authority of OPM or an agency with delegated suitability authority to conduct the required investigation of an applicant who has been appointed to a position. An employee does not have to serve a new probationary or trial period merely because his or her appointment is subject to investigation under this section. An employee's probationary or trial period is not extended because his or her appointment is subject to investigation under this section.
(2) An appointment to a covered position also will be subject to investigation when:
(i) The covered position requires a higher level of investigation than previously conducted for the person being appointed; or
(ii) An agency obtains new information in connection with the person's appointment that calls into question the person's suitability under § 731.202;
(3) Suitability determinations must be made for all appointments that are subject to investigation.
(c) Positions that are intermittent, seasonal, per diem, or temporary, not to exceed an aggregate of 180 days per year in either a single continuous appointment or series of appointments, do not require a background investigation as described in § 731.106(c)(1). The employing agency, however, must conduct such checks as it deems appropriate to ensure the suitability of the person.
(d) Reinvestigation requirements under § 731.106 for public trust positions are not affected by this section.
(e) For purposes of this section, “criteria equivalent to the factors provided at 5 CFR 731.202” are criteria that provide adequate assurance that the person to be appointed, converted to an appointment, or transferred is suitable to be employed in a covered position, as determined by OPM, in issuances under this regulation. A decision by
OPM, or by an agency applying guidance from OPM, that a prior fitness determination was not based on criteria equivalent to the factors provided at 5 CFR 731.202, and that a new investigation or adjudication is necessary is not subject to review under section 731.501 of this part.
[73 FR 20154, Apr. 15, 2008, as amended at 73 FR 66492, Nov. 11, 2008; 76 FR 69608, Nov. 9, 2011]
§ 731.105
Authority to take suitability actions.
(a) Neither OPM nor an agency acting under delegated authority may take a suitability action in connection with any application for, or appointment to, a position that is not subject to investigation or check under § 731.104.
(b) OPM may take a suitability action under this part against an
applicant
or
appointee
based on any of the criteria of § 731.202;
(c) Except as limited by § 731.103(g), an agency, exercising delegated authority, may take a suitability action under this part against an
applicant
or
appointee
based on the criteria of § 731.202;
(d) OPM may take a suitability action under this part against an
employee
based on the criteria of § 731.202(b)(3), (4), or (8).
(e) An agency may not take a suitability action against an
employee.
Nothing in this part precludes an agency from taking an adverse action against an employee under the procedures and standards of part 752 of this chapter or terminating a probationary employee under the procedures of part 315 or part 359 of this chapter. An agency must notify OPM to the extent required in § 731.103(g) if it wants to take, or has taken, action under these authorities.
§ 731.106
Designation of public trust positions and investigative requirements.
(a)
Risk designation.
Agency heads must designate every covered position within the agency at a high, moderate, or low risk level as determined by the position's potential for adverse impact to the efficiency or integrity of the service. OPM will provide an example of a risk designation system for agency use in an OPM issuance as described in § 731.102(c).
(b)
Public Trust positions.
Positions at the high or moderate risk levels would normally be designated as “Public Trust” positions. Such positions may involve policy making, major program responsibility, public safety and health, law enforcement duties, fiduciary responsibilities or other duties demanding a significant degree of public trust, and positions involving access to or operation or control of financial records, with a significant risk for causing damage or realizing personal gain.
(c)
Investigative requirements.
(1) Persons receiving an appointment made subject to investigation under this part must undergo a background investigation. OPM is authorized to establish minimum investigative requirements correlating to risk levels. Investigations should be initiated before appointment but no later than 14 calendar days after placement in the position.
(2) All positions subject to investigation under this part must also receive a sensitivity designation of Special-Sensitive, Critical-Sensitive, or Noncritical-Sensitive, when appropriate. This designation is complementary to the risk designation, and may have an effect on the position's investigative requirement. Sections 732.201 and 732.202 of this chapter detail the various sensitivity levels and investigative requirements. Procedures for determining investigative requirements for all positions based upon risk and sensitivity will be published in OPM issuances, as described in §§ 731.102(c) and 732.201(b).
(3) If suitability issues develop prior to the required investigation, OPM or the agency may conduct an investigation sufficient to resolve the issues and support a suitability determination or action, if warranted. If the person is appointed, the minimum level of investigation must be conducted as required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(d)
Reinvestigation requirements.
(1) Agencies must ensure that reinvestigations are conducted and a determination made regarding continued employment of persons occupying public trust
positions at least once every 5 years. The nature of these reinvestigations and any additional requirements and parameters will be established in supplemental guidance issued by OPM.
(2) If, prior to the next required reinvestigation, a separate investigation is conducted to determine a person's eligibility (or continued eligibility) for access to classified information or to hold a sensitive position, or as a result of a change in risk level as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, and that investigation meets or exceeds the requirements for a public trust reinvestigation, a new public trust reinvestigation is not required. Such a completed investigation restarts the cycle for a public trust reinvestigation for that person.
(3) Agencies must notify all employees covered by this section of the reinvestigation requirements under this paragraph.
(e)
Risk level changes.
If an employee or appointee experiences a change to a higher position risk level due to promotion, demotion, or reassignment, or the risk level of the employee's or appointee's position is changed to a higher level, the employee or appointee may remain in or encumber the position. Any upgrade in the investigation required for the new risk level should be initiated within 14 calendar days after the promotion, demotion, reassignment or new designation of risk level is final.
(f)
Completed investigations.
Any suitability investigation (or reinvestigation) completed by an agency under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section must result in a determination by the employing agency of whether the findings of the investigation would justify an action under this part or under another applicable authority, such as part 315, 359, or 752 of this chapter. Section 731.103 addresses whether an agency may take an action under this part, and whether the matter must be referred to OPM for debarment consideration.

Applicant
means an individual who is being considered or has been considered for employment in the competitive service or career Senior Executive Service.
Appointee
means an individual who has entered on duty and is in the first year of employment in a competitive service or career Senior Executive Service position when it is employment subject to investigation. When the individual is serving a probationary or trial period, the individual's status as an appointee will extend through the end of the initial probationary/trial period, if longer than one year.
Competitive service or career Senior Executive Service,

Contractor employee
means an individual who performs work for or on behalf of any agency under a contract and who, to perform the work specified under the contract, will require access to space, information, information technology systems, staff, or other assets of the Federal Government, and who could, by the nature of their access or duties, adversely affect the integrity or efficiency of the Government. Such contracts include but are not limited to: personal service contracts; contracts between any non-Federal entity and any agency; and subcontracts between any non-Federal entity and another non-Federal entity to perform work related to the primary contract with the agency. The term contractor employee includes employees of a grantee of any agency or any other category of person who performs work for or on behalf of an agency but does not include a Federal employee.
Core duty
means a continuing responsibility that is of particular importance to the relevant covered position or the achievement of an agency's mission.
Days
means calendar days unless otherwise noted in this part.
Employee
means an individual who has completed the first year of an appointment in the competitive service or career Senior Executive Service when it is employment subject to investigation and is no longer serving the initial probation or trial period, if applicable. In the case of an appointee whose initial probation or trial period is for more than one year, the individual will be
considered an employee at the completion of the initial probation or trial period.
Employment subject to investigation,
except as described elsewhere in this part, includes an appointment to the competitive service or career Senior Executive Service, an appointment to the excepted service, employment as a contractor employee, or employment as a nonappropriated fund employee.
Excepted service
means any position of the executive branch either excepted from the competitive service or which is not in the Senior Executive Service.
(1) For the purposes of this part, excepted service does not include:
(i) Any position in an element of the intelligence community as defined in the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, to the extent that the individual is not otherwise subject to OPM appointing authorities;
(ii) Any position where OPM is statutorily precluded from prescribing such standards; and
(iii) Any position when filled by political appointment.
(2) Senior Executive Service noncareer, limited term, and limited emergency appointments are not subject to suitability actions under this part.
(3) Excepted service does not mean any position excepted from the competitive service of the executive branch that could be noncompetitively converted to the competitive service.
Fitness
is the level of character or conduct determined necessary for an individual to perform work for a Federal agency as an employee in the excepted service, as a contractor employee, or as a nonappropriated fund employee.
Fitness determination
means a decision by an agency that an individual has or does not have the required level of character and conduct necessary to perform work for a Federal agency as an excepted service employee. These determinations are based on whether an individual's character or conduct may have an adverse impact on the integrity or efficiency of the service.
Material
means, in reference to a statement, one that affects, or has a natural tendency to affect, or is capable of influencing, an official decision even if OPM or an agency does not rely upon it.
Nonappropriated fund employee
means an employee paid from nonappropriated funds of an instrumentality of the United States under the jurisdiction of the Armed Forces conducted for the comfort, pleasure, contentment, and mental and physical improvement of personnel of the Armed Forces as described in 5 U.S.C. 2105.
Political appointment
means an appointment by Presidential nomination for confirmation by the Senate, an appointment by the President without Senate confirmation (except those appointed under 5 CFR 213.3102(c)); an appointment to a position compensated under the Executive Schedule (5 U.S.C. 5312 through 5316); an appointment of a White House Fellow to be assigned as an assistant to a top-level Federal officer (5 CFR 213.3102(z)); a Schedule C appointment (5 CFR 213.3301 and 213.3302); a noncareer, limited term, or limited emergency Senior Executive Service appointment (5 CFR part 317, subpart F); an appointee to serve in a political capacity under agency-specific authority; and a provisional political appointment.
Suitability action
means one or more of the following outcomes:
(1) Cancellation of eligibility;
(2) Removal;
(3) Cancellation of reinstatement eligibility; and
(4) Debarment.
Suitability determination
means a decision by OPM or an agency with delegated authority that an individual is suitable or is not suitable for employment in the competitive service or career Senior Executive Service in the Federal Government or a specific Federal agency. A suitability determination is based on whether an individual's character or conduct may have an adverse impact on the integrity or efficiency of the service.
(b) The purpose of this part is as follows:
(1) To establish investigation, continuous vetting, and reciprocity requirements for an appointment to a position in the competitive service and excepted service and for career appointment in the Senior Executive Service. Contractor employee fitness and nonappropriated fund employee fitness, as addressed in sections 3(b) and 3(c) of Executive Order 13488, are also subject to the position designation requirements, investigative standards, and reciprocity-requirements in this part.
(2) To establish the criteria for making determinations of suitability for the competitive service or career Senior Executive Service and to establish a minimum standard of fitness for the excepted service.
(3) To establish the procedures for taking suitability actions in the case of the competitive service or career Senior Executive Service.
(c) An Agency shall exercise due regard to this part and supplemental guidance if determining fitness for employment as a contractor employee or as a nonappropriated fund employee.
(d) Any determination made and action taken under this part are distinct from: an objection to an eligible or pass over of a preference eligible; OPM's or an agency's decision on a request, made under 5 U.S.C. 3318 and 5 CFR 332.406; and any determination of eligibility for access to classified information or for assignment to, or retention in, sensitive national security positions made under E.O. 12968, E.O. 10865, or E.O. 13467, as amended, or similar authorities.
§ 731.102
Implementation.
(a) An investigation conducted under this part may not be used for any other purpose except as provided in a Privacy Act system of records notice published by the agency conducting the investigation and section 1.1(e) of Executive Order 13467, as amended.
(b) OPM may set forth any policy, procedure, criteria, standard, quality control procedure, and supplementary guidance to implement this part in an OPM or joint Executive Agent issuance.
§ 731.103
Delegation to agencies for the competitive service and career Senior Executive Service.
(a) Subject to the limitations and requirements of paragraphs (b), (d), and (f) of this section, OPM delegates to the head of an agency authority for making a suitability determination and taking a suitability action (including limited, agency-specific debarments under § 731.205) in a case involving an
applicant
or
appointee.
(b) When an agency, acting under delegated authority from OPM, determines that a government-wide debarment by OPM under § 731.204(a) may be an appropriate action, it must refer the case to OPM for debarment consideration. An agency must make a referral prior to any proposed suitability action, but only after sufficient resolution of the suitability issue(s) to determine if a Government-wide debarment appears warranted.
(c) An agency exercising authority under this part by delegation from OPM must adhere to OPM requirements as stated in this part and issuances described in § 731.102(b). An Agency must also implement policies and maintain records demonstrating that they employ reasonable methods to ensure adherence to these issuances.
(d) OPM reserves the right to undertake a determination of suitability based upon evidence of falsification or fraud relating to an examination or appointment at any point when information giving rise to such a charge is discovered. OPM must be informed in all cases where there is evidence of material, intentional false statements, or deception or fraud, in examination or appointment, and OPM will take a suitability action where warranted.
(e) OPM may revoke an agency's delegation to make suitability determinations and take suitability actions under this part if an agency fails to conform to this part or OPM issuances as described in § 731.102(b).
(f) OPM retains sole jurisdiction to make a final suitability determination and take an action under this part in any case where there is evidence that there has been a material, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud, in examination or appointment. OPM also retains sole jurisdiction to make a final suitability determination and take an action under this part in any case when there is evidence that there has been knowing and willful engagement in acts or activities designed to overthrow the U.S. Government by force. An Agency must refer these cases to OPM for suitability determinations and suitability actions under this authority. Although no prior approval is needed, notification to OPM is required if the agency wants to take, or has taken, action under its own authority (such as 5 CFR part 315, 359, or 752) in cases involving conduct fitting within any of these factors. In addition, paragraph (a) of this section notwithstanding, OPM may, in its discretion, exercise its jurisdiction under this part in any case it deems necessary regardless of whether the agency may adjudicate under another authority.
§ 731.104
Investigation and reciprocity requirements.
(a) To establish an individual's suitability or fitness, employment subject to investigation (see definitions § 731.101(a)) requires the individual to undergo investigation by an agency with authority to conduct investigations except as described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) An agency must reciprocally accept a prior background investigation in the event of promotion, demotion, reassignment, or transfer from employment subject to investigation to other employment subject to investigation without a break in service, unless the new employment is at a higher risk level.
(2) An agency must reciprocally accept a prior background investigation when the person entering employment subject to investigation has undergone a background investigation that is at or above the level required for the position as determined by position designation and has a qualifying break in service specified in supplemental guidance, unless the agency obtains new information in connection with the person's employment that calls into question the person's suitability or fitness under § 731.202. Agencies must request such checks as may be specified in implementing guidance and must enroll individuals re-entering service after a break in service into continuous vetting, consistent with the requirements in § 731.106(d).
(3) Positions that are intermittent, per diem, or temporary in nature, not to exceed an aggregate of 180 days per year in either a single continuous appointment or series of appointments, do not require a background investigation for suitability or fitness. The employing agency, however, must conduct such checks as it deems appropriate to ensure the suitability or fitness of the person. The employing agency must conduct such vetting as required under OPM issuances.
(b) An individual does not have to serve a new probationary or trial period in the Civil
Service merely because the individual's employment is subject to investigation under this section. An individual's probationary or trial period in the Civil Service is not extended because the individual's employment is subject to investigation under this section.
(c) A suitability determination must be made for each appointment in the competitive service or career Senior Executive Service and a fitness determination must be made for each appointment in the excepted service, except as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(1) In the case of a prior investigation that is reciprocally accepted, if the record in the Central Verification System or its successor system does not reflect a prior favorable suitability or fitness determination, the agency must review the prior investigation for the purpose of making a suitability or fitness determination.
(2) In the case of a prior investigation that is reciprocally accepted, if the prior investigation was favorably adjudicated for suitability or fitness, the agency must accept the prior determination except that the agency must make a new determination where:
(i) The investigative record on file for the individual shows conduct that is incompatible with the core duties of the relevant covered position; or
(ii) The agency has prescribed additional factors as permitted under § 731.202(b) that were not addressed in the prior favorable adjudication, in which case the agency must conduct an adjudication using only those additional factors.
(d) Continuous vetting requirements under § 731.106 are not affected by this section.
§ 731.105
Authority to take suitability actions in cases involving the competitive service or career Senior Executive Service.
(a) OPM or an agency acting under delegated authority may take a suitability action in connection with any application for, or appointment to, the competitive service or career Senior Executive Service.
(1) OPM's or an agency's authority to complete a suitability action continues when an application is withdrawn, when an offer of employment is withdrawn, or when an individual appointed separates from employment.
(2) OPM's or an agency's authority to take a suitability action includes the case of an application for or appointment to the competitive service or career Senior Executive Service from another type of position when a prior investigation is being reciprocally accepted as described in § 731.104(a).
(b) OPM may take a suitability action under this part against an
applicant
or
appointee
based on the criteria in § 731.202.
(c) Except as limited by § 731.103(b), (d), and (f), an agency, exercising delegated authority, may take a suitability action under this part against an
applicant
or
appointee
based on the criteria of § 731.202.
(d) Only OPM may take a suitability action under this part against an
employee
in the competitive service or career Senior Executive Service based on the criteria of § 731.202(b)(3), (7), or (8).
(e) An agency may not take a suitability action against an
employee
in the competitive service or career Senior Executive Service. Nothing in this part precludes an agency from taking an adverse action against an employee under the procedures and standards of 5 CFR part 752 or terminating a probationary employee under the procedures of 5 CFR part 315 or 359 or under agency specific authorities. An agency must notify OPM to the extent required in § 731.103(d) and (f) if it wants to take, or has taken, action under these authorities. OPM retains the right to take a suitability action even in those cases where the agency makes an adjudicative determination under another authority.
§ 731.106
Designation of public trust positions and investigative requirements.
(a)
Risk designation.
For every position in the competitive service; in the excepted service; to be filled with a career appointment in the Senior Executive Service; or in which the occupant performs a service as a contractor employee or as a nonappropriated fund employee, an agency head must designate the position at high, moderate, or low risk level (in accordance with the risk designation system issued jointly by the Executive Agents; see § 731.102(b)), as determined by the position's potential for adverse impact to the efficiency or integrity of the service.
(b)
Public trust position.
A position at the high or moderate risk level is designated as a “public trust” position. Such positions may involve policy making, major program responsibility, public safety and health, law enforcement duties, fiduciary responsibilities, or other duties demanding a significant degree of public trust such as positions involving access to or control of financial records or with significant risk for causing damage or realizing personal gain.
(c)
Investigative requirements.
(1) An individual entering employment subject to investigation under this part must undergo a background investigation as described in § 731.104. OPM establishes minimum investigative requirements correlating to the risk level. An investigation should be initiated before the individual is appointed or otherwise becomes employed by or on behalf of the agency; however, where an agency does not timely initiate the investigation, it must do so as soon as possible, even if the appointment has already occurred.
(2) Any position subject to risk designation under this section must also receive a sensitivity designation of Special-Sensitive, Critical-Sensitive, Noncritical-Sensitive, or Non-sensitive, as appropriate. This designation is complementary to the risk designation and may have an effect on the position's investigative requirement. Part 1400 of this title details the various sensitivity levels and investigative requirements for positions designated as sensitive. Procedures for determining investigative requirements for a position based upon risk and sensitivity will be published in issuances, as described in § 731.102(b) and 5 CFR part 1400.
(3) If a suitability or fitness issue develops prior to the required investigation, OPM or the agency may request investigation from an authorized investigative service provider sufficient to resolve the issue and support an unfavorable suitability or fitness determination. However, inquiries into criminal or credit history cannot occur until a conditional offer has been made, as specified in § 731.106(g). If warranted for positions in the competitive service or career Senior Executive Service, an agency may also take suitability action, in accordance with the authorities described in this part. If the individual is then appointed or otherwise becomes employed by or on behalf of the agency, the minimum level of investigation must be conducted as required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(d)
Continuous vetting requirements.
(1) Individuals occupying positions of employment subject to investigation are also subject to continuous vetting through periodic checks of their background at any time in accordance with standards issued by OPM. Checks must be conducted at regular intervals, based on the type of check and with consideration of position risk and sensitivity. The nature of a continuous vetting check, and any additional requirements and parameters, are specified in supplemental issuances as described in § 731.102(b). An individual may be subjected to continuous vetting only if they have signed an authorization for release of information permitting a disclosure for continuous vetting purposes. Continuous vetting for an individual in a public trust position satisfies the requirement for a periodic reinvestigation of an individual in a public trust position as directed in E.O. 13488, as amended. An agency must ensure that each continuous vetting check is conducted and a determination made regarding continued employment.
(2) An individual in a sensitive position who is continually vetted to standards established by the Security Executive Agent for satisfying periodic reinvestigation and/or continuous vetting requirements meets the continuous vetting requirements for a public trust position.
(3) An agency must notify each employee covered by this section of the continuous vetting requirements under this paragraph (d).
(e)
Risk level changes.
If an individual in employment subject to investigation experiences a change to a higher position risk level due to promotion, demotion, reassignment, or transfer, or the risk level of the individual's position is changed to a higher level, the individual may remain in or encumber the position. Any upgrade in the investigation required for the new risk level should be initiated within 14 days after the promotion, demotion, reassignment, transfer or new designation of risk level is final or as otherwise required by 5 CFR part 1400.
(f)
Completed investigations.
An investigation or continuous vetting check under paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section supports a determination by the employing agency of whether the findings of the investigation would justify an action under this part or under another applicable authority, such as 5 CFR part 315, 359, or 752. Section 731.103 addresses whether an agency may take an action under this part, and whether the matter must be referred to OPM for debarment consideration.
(g)
Criminal or credit history inquiries.
A hiring agency may not make specific inquiries concerning an applicant's criminal background in oral or written form (including through the OF-306 or other forms used to conduct vetting for Federal employment, USAJOBS, or any other electronic means) unless the hiring agency has made a conditional offer of employment to the applicant. For criminal inquiries prior to a conditional offer, this prohibition does not apply to applicants for positions excepted under 5 CFR 920.201(b). For competitive service or career Senior Executive Service, a hiring agency may not make specific inquiries concerning an applicant's credit background in oral or written form (including through the OF-306 or other forms used to conduct vetting for Federal employment, USAJOBS, or any other electronic means) unless the hiring agency has made a conditional offer of employment to the applicant. Agencies may request an exception to the provision for making credit inquiries in advance of a conditional offer in accordance with the provisions in 5 CFR part 330, subpart M. Agencies may make an inquiry into an applicant's Selective Service registration, military service, citizenship status, where applicable, or previous work history, prior to making a conditional offer of employment to an applicant.
(h)
Recordkeeping and use of information.
When an agency makes a suitability or fitness determination based on an investigation, the agency must:
(1) Ensure that any record used in making the determination is accurate, relevant,
timely, and complete to the extent reasonably necessary to ensure fairness to the individual in any determination;
(2) Ensure that all applicable administrative procedural requirements provided by law, including the regulations in this part and issuances as described in § 731.102(b) have been observed;
(3) Consider all available information in reaching its final decision on a suitability or fitness determination or suitability action, except information furnished by a non-corroborated confidential source, which may be used only for limited purposes, such as information used to develop a lead or in interrogatories to a subject, if the identity of the source is not compromised in any way; and
(4) Keep any record of the agency determination or action as required by issuances as described in § 731.102(b).

# Subpart B—Suitability Determinations and Actions

# Effective Date Note:
At 89 FR 102695, Dec. 18, 2024, subpart B of part 731 was revised, effective Jan. 17, 2025. For the convenience of the user, the new subpart B of part 731 follows the text of this subpart.
§ 731.201
Standard.
The standard for a suitability action defined in § 731.203 and taken against an applicant, appointee, or employee is that the action will protect the integrity or promote the efficiency of the service.
§ 731.202
Criteria for making suitability determinations.
(a)
General.
OPM, or an agency to which OPM has delegated authority, must base its suitability determination on the presence or absence of one or more of the specific factors (charges) in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Specific factors.
In determining whether a person is suitable for Federal employment, only the following factors will be considered a basis for finding a person unsuitable and taking a suitability action:
(1) Misconduct or negligence in employment;
(2) Criminal or dishonest conduct;
(3) Material, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment;
(4) Refusal to furnish testimony as required by § 5.4 of this chapter;
(5) Alcohol abuse, without evidence of substantial rehabilitation, of a nature and duration that suggests that the applicant or appointee would be prevented from performing the duties of the position in question, or would constitute a direct threat to the property or safety of the applicant or appointee or others;
(6) Illegal use of narcotics, drugs, or other controlled substances without evidence of substantial rehabilitation;
(7) Knowing and willful engagement in acts or activities designed to overthrow the U.S. Government by force; and
(8) Any statutory or regulatory bar which prevents the lawful employment of the person involved in the position in question.
(c)
Additional considerations.
OPM and agencies must consider any of the following additional considerations to the extent OPM or the relevant agency, in its sole discretion, deems any of them pertinent to the individual case:
(1) The nature of the position for which the person is applying or in which the person is employed;
(2) The nature and seriousness of the conduct;
(3) The circumstances surrounding the conduct;
(4) The recency of the conduct;
(5) The age of the person involved at the time of the conduct;
(6) Contributing societal conditions; and
(7) The absence or presence of rehabilitation or efforts toward rehabilitation.
(d)
Reciprocity.
An agency cannot make a new determination under this section for a person who has already been determined suitable or fit based on character or conduct unless a new investigation is required under § 731.104 or § 731.106, or no new investigation is required but the investigative record on file for the person shows conduct that is incompatible with the core duties of the relevant covered position.
[73 FR 20154, Apr. 15, 2008, as amended at 73 FR 66493, Nov. 11, 2008]
§ 731.203
Suitability actions by OPM and other agencies.
(a) For purposes of this part, a suitability action is one or more of the following:
(1) Cancellation of eligibility;
(2) Removal;
(3) Cancellation of reinstatement eligibility; and
(4) Debarment.
(b) A non-selection, or cancellation of eligibility for a specific position based on an objection to an eligible or pass over of a preference eligible under 5 CFR 332.406, is
not
a suitability action even if it is based on reasons set forth in § 731.202.
(c) A suitability action may be taken against an applicant or an appointee when OPM or an agency exercising delegated authority under this part finds that the applicant or appointee is unsuitable for the reasons cited in § 731.202, subject to the agency limitations of § 731.103(g).
(d) OPM may require that an appointee or an employee be removed on the basis of a material, intentional false statement, deception or fraud in examination or appointment; refusal to furnish testimony as required by § 5.4 of this chapter; or a statutory or regulatory bar which prevents the person's lawful employment.
(e) OPM may cancel any reinstatement eligibility obtained as a result of a material, intentional false statement, deception or fraud in examination or appointment.
(f) An action to remove an appointee or employee
for suitability reasons
under this part is not an action under part 315, 359, or 752 of this chapter. Where behavior covered by this part may also form the basis for an action under parts 315, 359, or 752 of this chapter, an agency may take the action under part 315, 359, or 752 of this chapter, as appropriate, instead of under this part. An agency must notify OPM to the extent required in § 731.103(g) if it wants to take, or has taken, action under these authorities.
(g) Agencies do not need approval from OPM before taking unfavorable suitability actions. However, they are required to report to OPM all unfavorable suitability actions taken under this part within 30 days after they take the action. Also, all actions based on an OPM investigation must be reported to OPM as soon as possible and in no event later than 90 days after receipt of the final report of investigation.
§ 731.204
Debarment by OPM.
(a) When OPM finds a person unsuitable for any reason listed in § 731.202, OPM, in its discretion, may, for a period of not more than 3 years from the date of the unfavorable suitability determination, deny that person examination for, and appointment to, covered positions.
(b) OPM may impose an additional period of debarment following the expiration of a period of OPM or agency debarment, but only after the person again becomes an applicant, appointee, or employee subject to OPM's suitability jurisdiction, and his or her suitability is determined in accordance with the procedures of this part. An additional debarment period may be based in whole or in part on the same conduct on which the previous suitability action was based, when warranted, or new conduct.
(c) OPM, in its sole discretion, determines the duration of any period of debarment imposed under this section.
§ 731.205
Debarment by agencies.
(a) Subject to the provisions of § 731.103, when an agency finds an applicant or appointee unsuitable based upon reasons listed in § 731.202, the agency may, for a period of not more than 3 years from the date of the unfavorable suitability determination, deny that person examination for, and appointment to, either all, or specific covered, positions within that agency.
(b) The agency may impose an additional period of debarment following the expiration of a period of OPM or agency debarment, but only after the person again becomes an applicant or appointee subject to the agency's suitability jurisdiction, and his or her suitability is determined in accordance with the procedures of this part.

At 89 FR 102695, Dec. 18, 2024, subpart B of part 731 was revised, effective Jan. 17, 2025. For the convenience of the user, the revised text is set forth as follows:

# Subpart B—Determinations of Suitability or Fitness; Suitability Actions in Cases Involving the Competitive Service or Career Senior Executive Service
§ 731.201
Standard.
The standard for a suitability and fitness determination and for a suitability action defined in § 731.203 is that the action will protect the integrity or promote the efficiency of the service.
§ 731.202
Criteria for making suitability and fitness determinations.
(a)
General.
OPM, or an agency to which OPM has delegated suitability authority, must base its suitability determination on the presence or absence of one or more of the specific factors in paragraph (b) of this section. An agency is responsible for making a fitness determination for an excepted service position covered by this part but must apply the specific factors in paragraph (b) as the minimum standards for making the determination. When applying these criteria, an agency must also apply guidance in supplemental issuances, as described in § 731.102(b). If using these factors to also make a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Credential determination as outlined in OPM issuances regarding PIV credentialing eligibility, an agency must also ensure they have verified the individual's identity.
(b)
Specific factors.
Only OPM may take a suitability action considering the factors in paragraph (b)(3) or (7) of this section. Agencies may use the factor in paragraph (b)(8) of this section in applicant and appointee suitability cases but not employee cases; however, OPM may use this factor in employee cases. When making a suitability determination, OPM or an agency will consider only the following factors to determine if one is suitable. When making fitness determinations, an agency must consider these factors as a minimum standard, but it may prescribe additional factors to protect the integrity and promote the efficiency of the service, when job-related and consistent with business necessity.
(1) Misconduct or negligence in employment;
(2) Criminal conduct;
(3) Material, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud, in examination or appointment;
(4) Dishonest conduct;
(5) Excessive alcohol use, without evidence of rehabilitation, of a nature and duration that suggests the applicant or appointee would be prevented from performing the duties of the position in question, or would constitute a direct threat to the property or safety of the applicant, appointee, or others;
(6) Illegal use of narcotics, drugs, or other controlled substances, without evidence of rehabilitation;
(7) Knowing and willful engagement in acts or activities designed to overthrow the U.S. Government by force;
(8) Any statutory or regulatory bar that prevents the lawful employment of the individual in the position in question; and
(9) Violent conduct.
(c)
Additional considerations.
OPM and an agency must consider any of the following additional considerations to the extent OPM or the relevant agency, in its sole discretion, deems any of them pertinent to the individual case:
(1) The nature of the position for which the individual is applying or in which the individual is employed;
(2) The nature and seriousness of the conduct;
(3) The circumstances surrounding the conduct;
(4) The recency of the conduct;
(5) The age of the individual involved at the time of the conduct;
(6) Contributing societal conditions; and
(7) The absence or presence of rehabilitation or efforts toward rehabilitation.
§ 731.203
Suitability actions by OPM and other agencies for the competitive service or career Senior Executive Service.
(a) This section pertains only to the competitive service or career Senior Executive Service as defined in § 731.101.
(b) A suitability action may be taken only by OPM or an agency with delegated authority under the procedures in subparts C and D of this part.
(c) A non-selection, or cancellation of eligibility for the competitive service based on an objection to an eligible or pass over of a preference eligible under 5 CFR 332.406, is
not
a suitability action even if it is based on reasons set forth in § 731.202.
(d) A suitability action may be taken against an applicant or an appointee to the competitive service or career Senior Executive Service when OPM or an agency exercising delegated authority under this part finds that the applicant or appointee is unsuitable for the reasons cited in § 731.202, subject to the agency limitations of § 731.103(b), (d), and (f).
(e) OPM may require that an employee in the competitive service or career Senior Executive Service be removed on the basis of one or more of the following:
(1) A material, intentional false statement, deception, or fraud in examination or appointment;
(2) Knowing and willful engagement in acts or activities designed to overthrow the U.S. Government by illegal or unconstitutional means; and/or
(3) Statutory or regulatory bar that prevents the individual's lawful employment.
(f) OPM may cancel any reinstatement eligibility obtained as a result of a material, intentional false statement, deception, or fraud in examination or appointment.
(g) An action to remove an appointee or employee
for suitability reasons
under this part is not an action under 5 CFR part 315, 359, or 752. Where conduct covered by this part may also form the basis for an action under 5 CFR part 315, 359, or 752, an agency may take the action under 5 CFR part 315, 359, or 752, as appropriate, instead of under this part. An agency must notify OPM to the extent required in § 731.103(f) if it wants to take, or has taken, action under these authorities. OPM reserves the right to also take an action under this part.
(h) An agency does not need approval from OPM before taking an unfavorable suitability action. However, it is required to report to the Central Verification System or its successor, each unfavorable suitability action taken under this part within 30 days after it takes the action. Also, each suitability determination based on an investigation must be reported to the Central Verification System or its successor as soon as possible and in no event later than 90 days after receipt of the final report of investigation.

(b) OPM may impose an additional period of debarment following the expiration of a period of OPM or agency debarment or when new conduct arises while under debarment, but only after the individual again becomes an applicant, appointee, or employee subject to OPM's suitability jurisdiction, and the individual's suitability is determined in accordance with the procedures of this part. An additional debarment period may be based in whole or in part on the same conduct on which the previous suitability action was based, when warranted, or new conduct.
(c) OPM, in its sole discretion, determines the duration of any period of debarment imposed under this section.
§ 731.205
Debarment by agencies in cases involving the competitive service and career Senior Executive Service.
(a) Subject to the provisions of § 731.103, when an agency finds an applicant or appointee unsuitable based upon reasons listed in § 731.202, the agency may, for a period of not more than 3 years from the date of the unfavorable suitability determination, deny that individual examination for, and appointment to, either all, or specific competitive service positions and career appointment to all, or specific Senior Executive Service positions within that agency.
(b) The agency may impose an additional period of debarment following the expiration of a period of OPM or agency debarment, but only after the individual again becomes an applicant or appointee subject to the agency's suitability jurisdiction, and his or her suitability is determined in accordance with the procedures of this part. An additional debarment period may be based in whole or in part on the same conduct on which the previous suitability action was based, when warranted, or new conduct.
(c) The agency, in its sole discretion, determines the duration of any period of debarment imposed under this section.
(d) The agency is responsible for enforcing the period of debarment and taking appropriate action if an individual applies for a position at that agency during the debarment period or is examined for or appointed
to a position at that agency during the debarment period. This responsibility does not limit OPM's authority to exercise jurisdiction itself and take any action OPM deems appropriate.
§ 731.206
Reporting requirements for investigations and suitability and fitness determinations.
An agency must report to the Central Verification System or its successor the level or nature, result, and completion date of each background investigation, reinvestigation, or enrollment in Continuous Vetting; each agency decision based on such investigation, reinvestigation, or Continuous Vetting; and any personnel action taken based on such investigation or reinvestigation, as required in supplemental guidance.

# Subpart E—Special Provisions for Certain Presidential Appointees and Employees Paid from the Appropriation for the Executive Office of the President
§ 734.501
Permitted and prohibited activities.
Except as otherwise specified in this part 734, employees who are appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate are subject to the provisions of subparts B and C of this part.
§ 734.502
Participation in political activity while on duty, in uniform, in any room or building occupied in the discharge of official duties, or using a Federal vehicle.
(a) This section applies to an employee:
(1) The duties and responsibilities of whose position continue outside normal duty hours and while away from the normal duty post; and
(2) Who is—
(i) An employee paid from an appropriation for the Executive Office of President; or
(ii) An employee appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate whose position is located within the United States, who determines policies to be pursued by the United States in relations with foreign powers or in the nationwide administration of Federal laws;
(b) For the purposes of this subpart, normal duty hours and normal duty post will be determined by the head of each agency or instrumentality of the United States.
(c) An employee described in paragraph (a) of this section may participate, subject to any restrictions that may be imposed in accordance with § 734.104, in political activities:
(1) While he or she is on duty;
(2) While he or she is wearing a uniform, badge, or insignia that identifies the agency or instrumentality of the United States Government or the position of the employee;
(3) While he or she is in any room or building occupied in the discharge of
official duties by an individual employed or holding office in the Government of the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof; or
(4) While using a Government-owned or leased vehicle or while using a privately-owned vehicle in the discharge of official duties.
(d) An employee, to whom subpart E of this part does not apply, who is not on duty may participate in political activities in rooms of the White House or the Residence of the Vice President which are part of the Residence area or which are not regularly used solely in the discharge of official duties.

# Example 1:
An Inspector General is appointed under the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended. According to section 3(c) of that Act, he or she does not qualify as an employee who determines policies to be pursued by the United States in the nationwide administration of Federal laws. therefore, he or she may not participate in political activities while on duty, while wearing a uniform, badge, or insignia that identifies his or her office or position, while in any room or building occupied in the discharge of official duties, or while using a Government-owned or leased vehicle or while using a privately-owned vehicle in the discharge of official duties.

# Example 2:
An employee who is covered by this subpart and wears a uniform as an incident of her office may wear the uniform while she is giving a speech at a political fundraiser.

# Example 3:
The head of an executive department may hold a partisan political meeting or host a reception which is not a fundraiser in his conference room during normal business hours.

# Example 4:
An employee accompanies the Secretary of Transportation to a political party convention as part of the Secretary's security or administrative detail. The employee is considered to be on duty while protecting or performing official duties for the Secretary regardless of the nature of the function that the Secretary is attending.

# Example 5:
An American Ambassador overseas obtains authorization from the Department of State to depart post in order to take a vacation away from post. During the period she is authorized to be on vacation away from post, she is not considered to be on duty for the purpose of the Hatch Act Reform Amendments and may engage in any political activity permitted under the Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993.
[59 FR 48769, Sept. 23, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 35102, July 5, 1996; 79 FR 25486, May 5, 2014]
§ 734.503
Allocation and reimbursement of costs associated with political activities.
(a) The costs associated with the political activities described in § 733.502(c) of this chapter may not be paid for by money derived from the Treasury of the United States. Costs associated with a political activity are deemed not to be paid for by money derived from the Treasury of the United States if the Treasury is reimbursed for the costs within a reasonable period of time.
(b) For the purposes of this section, costs associated with a political activity do not include any costs that the Government would have or have incurred regardless of whether the activity was political. Examples of such costs are:
(1) The compensation of the employee described in § 734.502(a);
(2) The value of any office or other real property owned or leased by the Government;
(3) The compensation and expenses of any Government employee that is required in the performance of his or her duties to accompany or assist the person engaging in the political activity; and
(4) The cost of special security arrangements for the person engaging in the political activity, including special transportation vehicles or methods.
(c)(1) An employee covered under this subpart must apportion the costs of mixed travel based on the time spent on political activities and the time spent performing official duties. Prorating the cost of travel involves determining the “total activity time” which is the amount of time actually spent by the employee in meetings, receptions, rallies, and similar activities. Time spent in actual travel, private study, or rest and recreation is not included in the computation of the “total activity time”. The proration of the cost then is determined based on how the “total activity time” was spent. The formula is as follows:
Time spent in official meetings, receptions, etc. + Time spent in political meetings, receptions, rallies = Total activity time
Time spent in official activity ÷ Total activity time = Percentage of trip that is official
Time spent in political activity ÷ Total activity time = Percentage of trip that is political
The percentage figure that represents the political portion of the trip is then multiplied by the amount that would be reimbursed to the Government if all of the travel was political. The product of that calculation represents the amount to be paid by the political entity or organization.
(2) The allocation method must be applied to all of the relevant costs of mixed travel.
(3) Expenses that are associated specifically with a political activity and not with any official activity must be treated as political, and expenses associated specifically with an official activity and not with any political activity must be treated as official.
(4) In allocating the costs of travel other than air travel, the allocation formula should be applied to any Government maximum for that type of expenditure.
(5) The determination of the proper amount of allocation must be based on the facts and circumstances involved.
(6) In the event that a minor, clearly incidental percentage of the activity of a mixed trip is devoted to either official or political activity, e.g. less than 3%, the entire trip should be treated as if it was wholly of the type represented by the substantial figure. The balance should be treated as
de minimis
and need not be reimbursed as political or charged as official.
(d) For any cost of a political activity of an employee that is required to be reported to the Federal Election Commission under the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) or the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act (PECFA), the employee shall use the same method of allocation as used under the FECA or PECFA and regulations thereunder in lieu of the allocation method in paragraph (c) of this section.

# Example 1:
The Secretary, an employee described by section 7324(b)(2) of title 5 of the United States Code, holds a catered political activity (other than a fundraiser) in her office. Her security detail attends the reception as part of their duty to provide security for her. The Secretary will not be in violation of the Hatch Act Reform Amendments if the costs of her office, her compensation, and her security detail are not reimbursed to the Treasury. A violation of the Hatch Act Amendments occurs if Government funds, including reception or discretionary funds, are used to cater the political activity, unless the Treasury is reimbursed for the cost of the catering within a reasonable time.

# Example 2:
There should be no allocation between official and political funds for a sound system rented for a single event.

# Example 3:
If on a mixed trip a Government employee is only entitled to $26 per diem for food on a wholly official trip and the trip is 50% political and 50% official, the Government share would be 50% of $26, not 50% of the actual amount spent.

# Example 4:
The President is transported by special motorcade to and from the site of the political event. The expense of the motorcade is for special security arrangements. Thus, it would not be a violation of the Hatch Act Reform Amendments if the costs of the security arrangements, including the cost of the motorcade, are not reimbursed to the Treasury.
§ 734.504
Contributions to political action committees through voluntary payroll allotments prohibited.
An employee described in § 734.502(a) may not financially contribute to a political action committee through a voluntary allotment made under § 550.311(b) of this title.
[61 FR 35102, July 5, 1996]

# Subpart F—Employees Who Work on An Irregular or Occasional Basis

An employee who works on an irregular or occasional basis or is a special Government employee as defined in 18 U.S.C. 202(a) is subject to the provisions of the applicable subpart of this part when he or she is on duty.

§ 752.404
Procedures.
(a)
Statutory entitlements.
An employee against whom action is proposed under this subpart is entitled to the procedures provided in 5 U.S.C. 7513(b).
(b)
Notice of proposed action.
(1) An employee against whom an action is proposed is entitled to at least 30 days' advance written notice unless there is an exception pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. The notice must state the specific reason(s) for the proposed action and inform the employee of his or her right to review the material which is relied on to support the reasons for action given in the notice. The notice must further include detailed information with respect to any right to appeal the action pursuant to section 1097(b)(2)(A) of Public Law 115-91, the forums in which the employee may file an appeal, and any limitations on the rights of the employee that would apply because of the forum in which the employee decides to file.
(2) When some but not all employees in a given competitive level are being furloughed, the notice of proposed action must state the basis for selecting a particular employee for furlough, as well as the reasons for the furlough.
(3) Under ordinary circumstances, an employee whose removal or suspension, including indefinite suspension, has been proposed will remain in a duty status in his or her regular position during the advance notice period. In those rare circumstances where the agency determines that the employee's continued presence in the workplace during the notice period may pose a threat to the employee or others, result in loss of or damage to Government property, or otherwise jeopardize legitimate Government interests, the agency may elect one or a combination of the following alternatives:
(i) Assigning the employee to duties where he or she is no longer a threat to safety, the agency mission, or to Government property;
(ii) Allowing the employee to take leave, or carrying him or her in an appropriate leave status (annual, sick, leave without pay, or absence without leave) if the employee has absented himself or herself from the worksite without requesting leave;
(iii) Curtailing the notice period when the agency can invoke the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or
(iv) Placing the employee in a paid, nonduty status for such time as is necessary to effect the action. After publication of regulations for 5 U.S.C. 6329b, and the subsequent agency implementation period in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6329b, an agency may place the employee in a notice leave status when applicable.
(c)
Employee's answer.
(1) An employee may answer orally and in writing except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The agency must give the employee a reasonable amount of official time to review the material relied on to support its proposed action, to prepare an answer orally and in writing, and to secure affidavits, if the employee is in an active duty status. The agency may require the employee to furnish any answer to the proposed action, and affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of the answer, within such time as would be reasonable, but not less than 7 days.
(2) The agency will designate an official to hear the employee's oral answer who has authority either to make or recommend a final decision on the proposed adverse action. The right to answer orally in person does not include the right to a formal hearing with examination of witnesses unless the agency provides for such hearing in its regulations. Under 5 U.S.C. 7513(c), the agency may, in its regulations, provide a hearing in place of or in addition to the opportunity for written and oral answer.
(3) If the employee wishes the agency to consider any medical condition which may contribute to a conduct, performance, or leave problem, the employee must be given a reasonable time to furnish medical documentation (as defined in § 339.104 of this chapter) of the condition. Whenever possible, the employee will supply such documentation within the time limits allowed for an answer.
(d)
Exceptions.
(1) Section 7513(b) of title 5, U.S. Code, authorizes an exception to the 30 days' advance written notice when the agency has reasonable cause to believe that the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed and is proposing a removal or suspension, including indefinite suspension. This notice exception is commonly referred to as the “crime provision.” This provision may be invoked even in the absence of judicial action.
(2) The advance written notice and opportunity to answer are not required for furlough without pay due to unforeseeable circumstances, such as sudden breakdowns in equipment, acts of God, or sudden emergencies requiring immediate curtailment of activities.
(e)
Representation.
Section 7513(b)(3) of title 5, U.S. Code, provides that an employee covered by this part is entitled to be represented by an attorney or other representative. An agency may disallow as an employee's representative an individual whose activities as representative would cause a conflict of interest or position, or an employee of the agency whose release from his or her official position would give rise to unreasonable costs or whose priority work assignments preclude his or her release.
(f)
Agency review of medical information.
When medical information is supplied by the employee pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the agency may, if authorized, require a medical examination under the criteria of § 339.301 of this chapter, or otherwise, at its option, offer a medical examination in accordance with the criteria of § 339.302 of this chapter. If the employee has the requisite years of service under the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees' Retirement System, the agency must provide information concerning disability retirement. The agency must be aware of the affirmative obligations of the provisions of 29 CFR 1614.203, which require reasonable accommodation of a qualified individual with a disability.
(g)
Agency decision.
(1) In arriving at its decision, the agency will consider only the reasons specified in the notice of proposed action and any answer of the employee or his or her representative, or both, made to a designated official and any medical documentation reviewed under paragraph (f) of this section.
(2) The notice must specify in writing the reasons for the decision and advise the employee of any appeal or grievance rights under § 752.405 of this part.
The agency must deliver the notice of decision to the employee on or before the effective date of the action.
(h)
Applications for disability retirement.
Section 831.1204(e) of this chapter provides that an employee's application for disability retirement need not delay any other appropriate personnel action. Section 831.1205 and § 844.202 of this chapter set forth the basis under which an agency must file an application for disability retirement on behalf of an employee.

§ 752.604
Procedures.
(a)
Statutory entitlements.
An appointee against whom action is proposed under this subpart is entitled to the procedures provided in 5 U.S.C. 7543(b).
(b)
Notice of proposed action.
(1) An appointee against whom an action is proposed is entitled to at least 30 days' advance written notice unless there is an exception pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. The notice must state the specific reason(s) for the proposed action and inform the appointee of his or her right to review the material that is relied on to support the reasons for action given in the notice. The notice must further include detailed information with respect to any right to appeal the action pursuant to section 1097(b)(2)(A) of Public Law 115-91, the forums in which the employee may file an appeal, and any limitations on the rights of the employee that would apply because of the forum in which the employee decides to file.
(2) Under ordinary circumstances, an appointee whose removal has been proposed will remain in a duty status in his or her regular position during the advance notice period. In those rare circumstances where the agency determines that the appointee's continued presence in the work place during the notice period may pose a threat to the appointee or others, result in loss of or damage to Government property, or otherwise jeopardize legitimate Government interests, the agency may elect one or a combination of the following alternatives:
(i) Assigning the appointee to duties where he or she is no longer a threat to safety, the agency mission, or Government property;
(ii) Allowing the appointee to take leave, or carrying him or her in an appropriate leave status (annual, sick, leave without pay, or absence without leave) if the appointee has absented himself or herself from the worksite without requesting leave;
(iii) Curtailing the notice period when the agency can invoke the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section; or
(iv) Placing the appointee in a paid, no duty status for such time as is necessary to effect the action. After publication of regulations for 5 U.S.C. 6329b, and the subsequent agency implementation period in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6329b, an agency may place the employee in a notice leave status when applicable.
(c)
Appointee's answer.
(1) The appointee may answer orally and in writing except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The agency must give the appointee a reasonable amount of official time to review the material relied on to support its proposed action, to prepare an answer orally and in writing, and to secure affidavits, if the appointee is in an active duty status. The agency may require the appointee to furnish any answer to the proposed action, and affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of the answer, within such time as
would be reasonable, but not less than 7 days.
(2) The agency will designate an official to hear the appointee's oral answer who has authority either to make or to recommend a final decision on the proposed adverse action. The right to answer orally in person does not include the right to a formal hearing with examination of witnesses unless the agency provides for such hearing in its regulations. Under 5 U.S.C. 7543(c), the agency may in its regulations provide a hearing in place of or in addition to the opportunity for written and oral answer.
(3) If the appointee wishes the agency to consider any medical condition that may have affected the basis for the adverse action, the appointee must be given reasonable time to furnish medical documentation (as defined in § 339.104 of this chapter) of the condition. Whenever possible, the appointee will supply such documentation within the time limits allowed for an answer.
(d)
Exception.
Section 7543(b)(1) of title 5, U.S. Code, authorizes an exception to the 30 days' advance written notice when the agency has reasonable cause to believe that the appointee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed and is proposing a removal or suspension. This notice exception is commonly referred to as the “crime provision.” This provision may be invoked even in the absence of judicial action.
(e)
Representation.
Section 7543(b)(3) of title 5, U.S. Code, provides that an appointee covered by this part is entitled to be represented by an attorney or other representative. An agency may disallow as an appointee's representative an individual whose activities as representative would cause a conflict of interest or position, or an employee of the agency whose release from his or her official position would give rise to unreasonable costs or whose priority work assignments preclude his or her release.
(f)
Agency review of medical information.
When medical information is supplied by the appointee pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the agency may, if authorized, require a medical examination under the criteria of § 339.301 of this chapter, or otherwise, at its option, offer a medical examination in accordance with the criteria of § 339.302 of this chapter. If the appointee has the requisite years of service under the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees' Retirement System, the agency must provide information concerning disability retirement. The agency must be aware of the affirmative obligations of the provisions of 29 CFR 1614.203, which require reasonable accommodation of a qualified individual with a disability.
(g)
Agency decision.
(1) In arriving at its decision, the agency will consider only the reasons specified in the notice of proposed action and any answer of the appointee or the appointee's representative, or both, made to a designated official and any medical documentation reviewed under paragraph (f) of this section.
(2) The notice must specify in writing the reasons for the decision and advise the appointee of any appeal rights under § 752.605 of this part. The agency must deliver the notice of decision to the appointee on or before the effective date of the action.
(h)
Applications for disability retirement.
Section 831.1204(e) of this chapter provides that an appointee's application for disability retirement need not delay any other appropriate personnel action. Section 831.1205 and § 844.202 of this chapter set forth the basis under which an agency must file an application for disability retirement on behalf of an appointee.

A complaint, or any other information, submitted by an applicant for an appointment to a civil service position relating to compliance with section 9202 of title 5, United States Code.
(b)
Definitions.
In this subpart,
Agency, applicant, appointing authority,
conditional offer, criminal history record information,
and
employee
have the meanings set forth in 5 CFR 920.101.
§ 754.102
Agency complaint process.
(a)
Complaint intake.
(1) Within 90 days of the effective date of this part, each agency must establish and publicize an accessible program for the agency to receive a complaint, or any other information, from an applicant, and any applicable supporting material, relating to the agency's compliance with section 9202 of title 5, United States Code and part 920 of this chapter, in accordance with the guidelines and standards established in this section and the issuances described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(2) An applicant may submit a complaint, or any other information, to an agency within 30 calendar days of the date of the alleged non-compliance by an employee of an agency with section 9202 of title 5, United States Code and part 920 of this chapter.
(3) The agency shall extend the 30-calendar-day time limit in paragraph (a)(2) of this section when the applicant shows that the applicant was not notified of the time limits and was not otherwise aware of them, that the applicant did not know and reasonably should not have known that the non-compliance with 5 U.S.C. 9202 and part 920 of this chapter occurred, to consider a reasonable accommodation of a disability, or for other proper and adequate reasons considered by the agency.
(4) The agency must conduct outreach to inform an applicant of the procedure for submitting a complaint when it has reasonable cause to believe that the applicant is attempting to file a complaint.
(b)
Agency investigation.
(1) Acting under delegated authority from OPM
and subject to the limitations and requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, the agency employing the employee against whom the complaint has been filed shall investigate the complaint, unless the employee is an administrative law judge appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3105. To carry out this function in an impartial manner, the same agency official(s) responsible for executing and advising on the recruitment action may not also be responsible for managing, advising, or overseeing the agency complaint process established in this section.
(2) In carrying out its delegated responsibilities under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the agency shall develop an impartial and appropriate factual record adequate for OPM to make findings on the claims raised by any written complaint. An appropriate factual record is one that allows a reasonable fact finder to draw conclusions as to whether non-compliance with 5 U.S.C. 9202 and part 920 of this chapter occurred. Agencies have discretion to determine the appropriate fact-finding methods that efficiently and thoroughly address the matters at issue.
(3) The agency must delegate to the investigator sufficient authority to secure the production, from agency employees and contractors, of documentary and testimonial evidence needed to investigate and report on the complaint.
(4) The applicant or applicant's representative must be given a reasonable time to respond to a request for documentary and testimonial evidence. This time period will not exceed 10 calendar days under ordinary circumstances. However, in the agency's discretion, an agency may grant an extension under extenuating circumstances.
(5) The agency shall complete its investigation within 60 calendar days of the date of the filing of the complaint. An agency may extend the investigation period when the agency has provided more than 10 calendar days for the applicant to respond to a request for documentary and testimonial evidence pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Notwithstanding an extension, the agency shall complete the investigation as expeditiously as possible.
(6) Within 30 calendar days of completing its investigation, the agency shall provide to OPM an administrative report. This report should include the applicant's complaint, or any other information submitted by the applicant, the agency's factual findings, a complete copy of all information gathered during the investigation, and any other information that the agency believes OPM should consider. The report should be submitted to the Manager, Employee Accountability, Accountability and Workforce Relations, Employee Services, Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street NW, Room 7H28, Washington, DC 20415 or
employeeaccountability@opm.gov.
(c)
OPM adjudication.
(1) At OPM's discretion, OPM may request the agency provide additional information as necessary.
(2) OPM shall notify the agency and the subject(s) of the complaint in writing of its assessment of the complaint, including any decision to initiate adverse action proceedings under subpart B of this part.
(d)
OPM oversight.
(1) OPM may revoke an agency's delegation under this section if an agency fails to conform to this section or OPM issuances as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(2) OPM retains jurisdiction to make final determinations and take actions regarding the receipt and investigation of complaints, or any other information; record-keeping; and reporting related to an allegation of non-compliance with 5 U.S.C. 9202 and part 920 of this chapter. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section notwithstanding, OPM may, in its discretion, exercise its jurisdiction under this section in any case it deems necessary.
(3) OPM may set forth policies, procedures, standards, and supplementary guidance for the implementation of this section in OPM issuances.
§ 754.103
Applicant representatives.
An applicant may select a representative of the applicant's choice to assist the applicant during the complaint process. An agency may disallow as an
applicant's representative an individual whose activities as a representative would cause a conflict of interest or position; an agency employee who cannot be released from official duties because of the priority needs of the Government; or an agency employee whose release would give rise to unreasonable costs to the Government.

(b)
Employee's answer.
(1) An employee may answer orally and in writing. The employee's agency must give the employee a reasonable amount of official time to review the material relied on to support OPM's proposed action, to prepare and present an answer orally and in writing, and to secure affidavits, if the employee is in an active duty status.

# Subpart A—General
§ 772.101
Basic authority.
This part establishes a mechanism for agencies to provide interim relief to employees and applicants for employment who prevail in an initial decision issued by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) as required by the
Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989,
Pub. L. 101-12 (codified at 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A)). The interim relief provisions of the law are applicable whether or not alleged reprisal for whistleblowing is at issue in an appeal to MSPB.
§ 772.102
Interim personnel actions.
When an employee or applicant for employment appeals an action to MSPB and the appeal results in an initial decision by an MSPB administrative judge granting interim relief under 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A) and a petition for review of the initial decision is filed (or will be filed) with the full Board under 5 U.S.C. 7701(e)(1)(A), the agency shall provide the relief ordered in the initial decision by taking an interim personnel action subject to the following terms:
(a) Interim personnel actions shall be made effective upon the date of issuance of the initial decision and must be initiated on or before the date of a petition for review by the agency or within a reasonable period after the date it becomes aware of a petition for review by the appellant;
(b) The relief provided by interim personnel actions shall end:
(1) When the full Board issues a final decision on a petition for review filed by an applicant for employment, employee, and/or agency under 5 U.S.C. 7701(e)(1)(A),
(2) When the initial decision becomes final pursuant to an action of the full Board or pursuant to a decision by an applicant for employment, employee, and/or agency to withdraw (or change intentions to file) any petition for review filed under 5 U.S.C. 7701(e)(1)(A), or
(3) When the applicant for employment or employee requests or reaches agreement with the agency that the interim relief ordered in the initial decision be cancelled;
(c) Interim relief shall entitle the applicant for employment or employee to the same compensation and benefits he or she would receive if the relief effected had not been on an interim basis except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section;
(d) An interim personnel action shall not be taken if the MSPB administrative judge, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A)(i), determines that granting interim relief is not appropriate;
(e) An interim personnel action under this part shall not entitle the applicant for employment or employee to an award of back pay or attorney fees.

# Subpart A—Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Programs and Services for Federal Civilian Employees
§ 792.101
Statutory requirements.
Sections 7361 and 7362 of title 5, United States Code, provide that the Office of Personnel Management is responsible for developing and maintaining, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services and with other agencies, appropriate prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation programs and services for Federal civilian employees with alcohol and drug abuse problems. To the extent feasible, agencies are encouraged to extend services to families (including domestic partners and their children) of alcohol and/or drug abusing employees and to employees who have family members (including domestic partners and their children) who have alcohol and/or drug problems. Such programs and services should make optimal use of existing Government facilities, services, and skills.
[77 FR 42907, July 20, 2012]
§ 792.102
General.
It is the policy of the Federal Government to offer appropriate prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation programs and services for Federal civilian employees with alcohol and drug problems. Short-term counseling or referral, or offers thereof, constitute the appropriate prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation programs and services for alcohol abuse, alcoholism, and drug abuse required under subchapter VI of chapter 73 of title 5, United States Code. Federal agencies must establish programs to assist employees with these problems in accordance with that subchapter.

§ 792.201

Child care subsidy program
means the program established by an agency in using appropriated funds, as provided in this subpart, to assist lower-income employees with child care costs. The program can include such activities as determining which employees receive a subsidy and the size of their subsidies; distributing agency funds to participating providers; and tracking and reporting information to OPM such as total cost and employee use of the program.
Disabled child
means a child who is unable to care for himself or herself because of a physical or mental condition as determined by a physician or licensed or certified psychologist.
Domestic partner
means a person in a domestic partnership with an employee of the same sex.
Domestic partnership
means a committed relationship between two adults of the same sex in which the partners—
(1) Are each other's sole domestic partner and intend to remain so indefinitely;
(2) Maintain a common residence, and intend to continue to do so (or would maintain a common residence but for an assignment abroad or other employment-related, financial, or similar obstacle);

(5) Are not married or joined in a civil union to anyone else;
(6) Are not the domestic partner of anyone else;
(7) Are not related in a way that, if they were of opposite sex, would prohibit legal marriage in the U.S. jurisdiction in which the domestic partnership was formed;
(8) Are willing to certify, if required by the agency, that they understand that willful falsification of any documentation required to establish that an individual is in a domestic partnership may lead to disciplinary action and the recovery of the cost of benefits received related to such falsification, as well as constitute a criminal violation under 18 U.S.C. 1001, and that the method for securing such certification, if required, will be determined by the agency; and
(9) Are willing promptly to disclose, if required by the agency, any dissolution or material change in the status of the domestic partnership.
Employee

OPM
means the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.
§ 792.203
Child care subsidy programs; eligibility.
(a)(1) An Executive agency may establish a child care subsidy program in which the agency uses appropriated funds, in accordance with this subpart, to assist lower-income employees of the agency with their child care costs. The assistance may be provided for both full-time and part-time child care, and may include before-and-after-school programs and daytime summer programs.
(2) Two or more agencies may pool their funds to establish a child care subsidy program for the benefit of employees who are served by a Federally-sponsored child care center in a multi-tenant facility.
(3)(i) Except as provided under paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, an agency may impose restrictions on the use of appropriated funds for its child care subsidy program based on consideration of employees' needs, its own staffing needs, the local availability of child care, and other factors as determined by the agency. For example, an agency may decide to restrict eligibility for subsidies to—
(A) Full-time permanent employees;
(B) Employees using an agency on-site child care center;
(C) Employees using full-time child care; or
(D) Employees using child care in specific locations.
(ii) An agency may not limit the payment of subsidies to accredited child care providers.
(b) Subject to any restrictions applicable under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, an employee who qualifies as a lower-income employee under the agency's child care subsidy program is eligible to receive a child care subsidy for the care of each child under age 13 or, in the case of a disabled child, under age 18.
§ 792.204
Agency responsibilities; reporting requirement.
(a) Before funds may be obligated as provided in this subpart, an agency intending to initiate a child care subsidy program must provide notice to the Subcommittees on Financial Services and General Government of the House
and Senate Appropriations Committees, as well as to OPM.
(b) Agencies must notify the committees referred to in paragraph (a) of this section and OPM annually of their intention to provide child care subsidies. Funds may be obligated immediately after the notifications have been made.
(c) Agencies are responsible for tracking the utilization of their funds and reporting the results to OPM at such time and in such manner as OPM prescribes.
[77 FR 42908, July 20, 2012, as amended at 80 FR 75786, Dec. 4, 2015]
§ 792.205
Administration of child care subsidy programs.
(a) An agency may administer its child care subsidy program directly or by contract with another entity, using procedures prescribed under the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Regardless of what entity administers the program, the Federal agency is responsible for establishing how eligibility and subsidy amounts will be determined.
(b) An agency contract must specify that any unexpended funds will be returned to the agency after the contract is completed.
§ 792.206
Payment of subsidies.
(a) Payment of child care subsidies must be made directly to child care providers, unless one of the following exceptions applies:
(1) In overseas locations, the agency may pay the employee if the provider deals only in foreign currency.
(2) In unique circumstances, an agency may obtain written permission from OPM to pay the employee directly.
(b) An agency may make advance payments to a child care provider in certain circumstances, such as when the provider requires payment up to one month in advance of rendering services. An agency may not make advance payments for more than one month before the employee receives child care services except where an agency has contracted with another entity to administer the child care subsidy program, in which case the agency may advance payments to the entity administering the program as long as the requirements in § 792.205(b) are met.

[48 FR 38783, Aug. 26, 1983]
§ 831.105
Computation of interest.
(a) The computation of interest is on the basis of 30 days to the month. Interest is computed for the actual calendar time involved in each case, but whenever applicable the rule of average applies.
(b) Interest is allowed on current deductions and deposits at the rate of 4 percent per year to December 31, 1947, and 3 percent per year thereafter, compounded annually, to December 31, 1956. After December 31, 1956, except as provided below, interest is allowed at the rate of 3 percent per year, compounded annually, to date of final separation or transfer to a position that is not covered by the retirement system. After December 31, 1956, interest is not allowed:
(1) When an employee has one year or less of covered service,
(2) For any fractional part of a month in the total service, or
(3) For more than five years' civilian service.
(c) Interest at the rate of 3 percent per year through December 31, 1984, and, thereafter, at the yearly rate determined by the Secretary of Treasury, compounded annually, is allowed on voluntary contributions during periods of employment and, after the employee or Member has completed at least 5 years' civilian service, during periods of separation until the beginning date of annuity or death, whichever is earlier. For refund purposes, however, interest on voluntary contributions terminates on the date of the employee's or Member's final separation or on the date of the employee's or Member's last transfer to a position in which he or she is not subject to subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code
(d) For noncontributory service performed before October 1, 1982, and for redeposits of refunds paid on an application received by either the individual's employing agency or OPM before October 1, 1982, interest at the rate of 4 percent per year to December 31, 1947, and at the rate of 3 percent per year thereafter, compounded annually, is charged. Interest is charged on the outstanding balance of a deposit from the midpoint of each service period for which deposit is involved; interest is charged on the outstanding balance of a refund from the date the refund was paid. Interest is charged to the date of deposit or commencing date of annuity, whichever is earlier, except that interest is not charged for any period of separation from the service which began before October 1, 1956.
(e) For noncontributory service performed on or after October 1, 1982, and for redeposits of refunds paid on an application received by the individual's employing agency or OPM on or after October 1, 1982, interest is charged at
the rate of 3 percent per year through December 31, 1984, and, thereafter, at the yearly rate determined by the Secretary of Treasury, compounded annually. Interest is charged on the outstanding balance of a deposit from the midpoint of each service period for which deposit is involved; interest is charged on the outstanding balance of a refund from the date the refund was paid. Interest is charged to the date of deposit.
(f) No interest is charged on a deposit for military service if that deposit is made before October 1, 1984, or within 2 years of the date that an individual first becomes an employee or Member under the civil service retirement system, whichever is later. When interest is charged on a deposit for military service, it is charged on the outstanding balance at the rate of 3 percent per year, compounded annually, from October 1, 1984, or 2 years from the date the individual first becomes an employee or Member, whichever is later, through December 31, 1984, and thereafter at the yearly rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.
(g) For calendar year 1985 and for each subsequent calendar year, OPM will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
to notify the public of the interest rate that will be in effect during that calendar year.
(h) Interest under §§ 831.631, 831.632, 831.682, and 831.684 is compounded annually and accrued monthly.
(1) The initial interest on each monthly difference between the reduced annuity rate and the annuity rate actually paid equals the amount of the monthly difference times the difference between (i) 1.06 raised to the power whose numerator is the number of months between the date when the monthly difference in annuity rates occurred and the date when the initial interest is computed and whose denominator is 12; and (ii) 1.
(2) The total initial interest due is the sum of all of the initial interest on each monthly difference computed in accordance with paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
(3) Additional interest on any uncollected balance will be compounded annually and accrued monthly. The additional interest due each month equals the remaining balance due times the difference between (i) 1.06 raised to the 1/12th power; and (ii) 1.
(i)(1) When an individual's civilian service involves several deposit and/or redeposit periods, OPM will normally use the following order of precedence in applying each installment payment against the full amount due:
(i) Redeposits of refunds paid on applications received by the individual's employing agency or OPM on or after October 1, 1982;
(ii) Redeposits of refunds paid on applications received by the individual's employing agency or OPM before October 1, 1982;
(iii) Deposits for noncontributory civilian service performed on or after October 1, 1982; and
(iv) Deposits for noncontributory service performed before October 1, 1982.
(2) If an individual specifically requests a different order of precedence, that request will be honored.
(j) Interest under § 831.662 is compounded annually and accrued monthly.
(1) The initial interest on each monthly difference between the reduced annuity rate and the annuity rate actually paid equals the amount of the monthly difference times the difference between—
(i) The sum of one plus the interest rate set under § 831.105(g) raised to the power whose numerator is the number of months between the date when the monthly difference in annuity rates occurred and the date when the initial interest is computed and whose denominator is 12; and
(ii) 1.
(2) The total initial interest due is the sum of all of the initial interest on each monthly difference computed in accordance with paragraph (j)(1) of this section.
(k) If OPM determines that additional interest was assessed on a deposit for full-time volunteer service as a volunteer or a volunteer leader with the Peace Corps or Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) due to its own administrative error, OPM may pay, on
behalf of the employee, Member, or annuitant, any additional interest assessed due to the administrative error.

§ 831.111
Employee deductions and agency contributions.
(a)
Agency share.
When an agency fails to withhold some or all of an employee deduction under 5 U.S.C. 8334(a) for any pay period, the agency is still responsible for submitting the correct agency contribution to OPM. The agency must submit as the agency share, a payment equal to the amount that would have been submitted if the error had not been made (or a payment equal to the difference between the amount already submitted as the agency share and the amount that should have been submitted). The payment should be submitted to OPM in the manner currently prescribed for the transmission of withholdings and contributions as soon as possible, but not later than provided by standards established by OPM.
(b)
Employee share.
(1) If, through administrative error, an agency did not withhold any of the employee deductions required by 5 U.S.C. 8334(a) for any pay period, the employee may, at his or her option—
(i) Request the agency that employed him or her when the error was made to correct his or her records and arrange to pay any resulting overpayment of pay to the agency (unless it is waived by the agency); or
(ii) Pay the deposit plus any applicable interest (under certain conditions, the deposit may be made at any time until the final adjudication of his or her application for retirement) directly to OPM by submitting SF 2803; or
(iii) Have the period of service treated like the nondeduction service described in § 831.303.
(2) When the agency withholds part of the required employee deductions for any pay period, the balance must be submitted to OPM in the manner currently prescribed for the transmission of withholdings and contributions as soon as possible, but not later than provided by standards established by OPM. The agency must correct its error. The employee does not have the option to pay a deposit directly to OPM when partial deductions have been withheld.
(3) If the agency waives the employee's repayment of the salary overpayment that resulted from the administrative error, the agency must also submit (in addition to the agency contribution) the employee's share of the unpaid contributions to OPM in the manner currently prescribed for the transmission of withholdings and contributions.
[53 FR 35295, Sept. 13, 1988, as amended at 66 FR 66711, Dec. 27, 2001]
§ 831.112
Definitions of employee.
(a)
Determinations involving an employee's ability to make a deposit or redeposit.
A person may make a deposit or redeposit under section 8334 of title 5, United States Code, if he or she is an “employee.” For purposes of this paragraph, an
employee
is—
(1) A person currently employed in a position subject to the civil service retirement law; or
(2) A former employee (whose annuity has not been finally adjudicated) who retains civil service retirement annuity rights based on a separation from a position in which retirement deductions were properly withheld and remain (or have been redeposited in whole or in part) in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.
(b)
Determinations involving the payment of survivor benefits at an employee's or former employee's death.
To determine entitlement to survivor benefits, OPM establishes whether the deceased individual was an “employee” or a “retiree” on the date of death. If the decedent was an “employee” on the date of death, survivor benefits are paid as though the individual died in service. If the decedent was a “retiree” on the date of death, survivor benefits are only paid as provided in the individual's election, provided it was properly made. However, if a former employee was eligible only for a deferred annuity at age 62, survivor benefits are only paid if the individual was a “retiree” on the date of death. For purposes of this paragraph—
(1)
Employee
is a person—
(i) Who had not been separated from service prior to his or her death, even if he or she had applied for retirement (for example, an applicant for disability annuity) and the application had been approved; or
(ii) Whose death occurs before the commencing date of annuity, even though separation has occurred.
(2)
Retiree
or
annuitant
is a person—
(i) Who has been separated from service and met all the requirements to receive an annuity including having filed an application for the annuity prior to his or her death; and
(ii) Whose death occurs on or after the commencing date of annuity.
(c)
Determinations involving the requirement of spousal consent for elections of alternative annuity and survivor annuity benefits.
Spousal consent is required as specified in §§ 831.614 and 831.2203(c), if the employee/annuitant is married on the commencing date of annuity, regardless of whether that date is before or after the date of separation from service.
[56 FR 45883, Sept. 9, 1991, as amended at 58 FR 52880, Oct. 13, 1993]
§ 831.113
Payments to children.
For purposes of section 8345(e) of title 5, United States Code, persons who have attained age 18 are considered adults regardless of the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which they reside.
[56 FR 45884, Sept. 9, 1991]
§ 831.114
Voluntary early retirement-substantial delayering, reorganization, reduction in force, transfer of function, or other workforce restructuring.
(a) A
specific designee
is defined as a senior official within an agency who has been specifically designated to sign requests for voluntary early retirement authority under a designation from the head of the agency. Examples include a Chief Human Capital Officer, an Assistant Secretary for Administration, a Director of Human Resources Management, or other official.
(b) An agency's request for voluntary early retirement authority must be signed by the head of the agency or by a specific designee.
(c) The request must contain the following information:
(1) Identification of the agency or specified component(s) for which the authority is being requested;
(2) Reasons why the agency needs voluntary early retirement authority. This must include a detailed summary of the agency's personnel and/or budgetary situation that will result in an excess of personnel because of a substantial delayering, reorganization, reduction in force, transfer of function, or other workforce restructuring or reshaping, consistent with agency human capital goals;
(3) The date on which the agency expects to effect the substantial delayering, reorganization, reduction in force, transfer of function, or other workforce restructuring or reshaping;
(4) The time period during which the agency plans to offer voluntary early retirement;
(5) The total number of non-temporary employees in the agency (or specified component(s));
(6) The total number of non-temporary employees in the agency (or specified component(s)) who may be involuntarily separated, downgraded, transferred, or reassigned as a result of the substantial delayering, reorganization, reduction in force, transfer of function, or other workforce restructuring or reshaping;
(7) The total number of employees in the agency (or specified component(s)) who are eligible for voluntary early retirement;
(8) An estimate of the total number of employees in the agency (or specified component(s)) who are expected to retire early during the period covered by the request for voluntary early retirement authority; and
(9) A description of the types of personnel actions anticipated as a result of the agency's need for voluntary early retirement authority. Examples include separations, transfers, reassignments, and downgradings.
(d) OPM will evaluate a request for voluntary early retirement based on:
(1) A specific request to OPM from the agency for voluntary early retirement authority;
(2) A voluntary separation incentive payment implementation plan, as discussed in part 576, subpart A, of this chapter, which must outline the intended use of the incentive payments and voluntary early retirement; or
(3) The agency's human capital plan, which must outline its intended use of
voluntary separation incentive payments and voluntary early retirement authority, and the changes in organizational structure it expects to make as the result of projected separations and early retirements.
(e) Regardless of the method used, the request must include all of the information required by paragraph (c) of this section.
(f) OPM may approve an agency's request for voluntary early retirement authority to cover the entire period of the substantial delayering, reorganization, reduction in force, transfer of function, or other workforce restructuring or reshaping described by the agency, or the initial portion of that period with a requirement for subsequent information and justification if the period covers multiple years.
(g) After OPM approves an agency's request, the agency must immediately notify OPM of any subsequent changes in the conditions that served as the basis for the approval of the voluntary early retirement authority. Depending upon the circumstances involved, OPM will modify the authority as necessary to better suit the agency's needs.
(h) The agency may further limit voluntary early retirement offers based on:
(1) An established opening and closing date for the acceptance of applications that is announced to employees at the time of the offer; or
(2) The acceptance of a specified number of applications for voluntary early retirement, provided that, at the time of the offer, the agency notified employees that it retained the right to limit the number of voluntary early retirements.
(i) Within the timeframe specified for its approved voluntary early retirement authority, the agency may subsequently establish a new or revised closing date, or reduce or increase the number of early retirement applications it will accept, if management's downsizing and/or reshaping needs change. If the agency issues a revised closing date, or a revised number of applications to be accepted, the new date or number of applications must be announced to the same group of employees included in the original announcement. If the agency issues a new window period with a new closing date, or a new instance of a specific number of applications to be accepted, the new window period or number of applications to be accepted may be announced to a different group of employees as long as they are covered by the approved voluntary early retirement authority.
(j) Chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, requires that agencies treat employees on military duty, for all practical purposes, as though they were still on the job. Further, employees are not to be disadvantaged because of their military service. In accordance with these provisions, employees on military duty who would otherwise be eligible for an offer of voluntary early retirement will have 30 days following their return to duty to either accept or reject an offer of voluntary early retirement. This will be true even if the voluntary early retirement authority provided by OPM has expired.
(k) An employee who separates from the service voluntarily after completing 25 years of service, or becoming age 50 and completing 20 years of service, is entitled to an annuity if, on the date of separation, the employee:
(1) Is serving in a position covered by a voluntary early retirement offer; and
(2) Meets the following conditions which are covered in 5 U.S.C. 8336(d)(2):
(i) Has been employed continuously, by the agency in which the employee is serving, for at least the 31-day period ending on the date on which such agency requests the determination referred to in section 831.114(b);
(ii) Is serving under an appointment that is not time limited;
(iii) Has not been duly notified that such employee is to be involuntarily separated for misconduct or unacceptable performance;
(iv) Is separated from the service voluntarily during a period in which, as determined by the Office of Personnel Management (upon request of the agency) under regulations prescribed by the Office:
(A) Such agency (or, if applicable, the component in which the employee is serving) is undergoing substantial delayering, substantial reorganization, substantial reductions in force, substantial transfer of function, or other
substantial workforce restructuring (or shaping);

Effective April 25, 1987, unless a widow(er) or former spouse of an employee or Member who dies—on or after that date—before being separated from service files a written election to the contrary, his or her annuity will include credit for periods of military service (subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section) that would ordinarily be excluded from the computation of the employee's or Member's annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8332(c)(2).
(2)
Reduction by the amount of survivor benefits payable based on the military service.
(i) In paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, “survivor benefits under a retirement system for members of the uniformed services” means survivor benefits before any offsets for benefits payable from another Federal benefit system except for those payable under title II of the Social Security Act. The amount of the survivor benefit to be deducted will be the amount payable to the current or former spouse and attributable to the decedent's retired or retainer pay for the period of military service to be included in the CSRS survivor annuity. However, the survivor benefit will never be reduced below the amount payable based on the civilian service alone.
(ii) OPM will obtain information on the amount of any monthly survivor benefits payable to each applicant for CSRS current or former spouse annuity. OPM will reduce the CSRS survivor annuity by the monthly military survivor benefit on its commencing date. OPM will not make a subsequent adjustment unless it is necessary to increase or decrease the CSRS survivor benefit because of a change in the amount of military survivor benefits attributable to the period of service or a change in the period of military service to be included in the CSRS annuity when the survivor annuitant becomes eligible for benefits under title II of the Social Security Act.
(3)
Widow(er)s or former spouses of employees or Members who die on or after April 25, 1987—election not to be included.
OPM will accept a written election from a widow(er) or former spouse who does not wish to be covered by § 831.301(d) provided it is postmarked within the period ending 30 calendar days after the date of the first regular monthly annuity payment.
(4)
Widow(er)s or former spouses of employees or Members who die before April 25, 1987—application to OPM for credit.
Widow(er)s or former spouses of employees or Members who died before April 25, 1987, must apply to OPM in writing to have credit for military service included in the survivor annuity computation. If the survivor annuity is increased by including credit for the military service, the increase will be effective on the first of the month following the 60th calendar day after the date the written application for inclusion of the military service is received in OPM.

§ 831.302
Unused sick leave.
(a) For annuity computation purposes, the service of an employee who retires on immediate annuity or dies leaving a survivor entitled to annuity is increased by the days of unused sick leave to his credit under a formal leave system.
(b) An immediate annuity is one which begins to accrue not later than 1 month after the employee is separated.
(c) A formal leave system is one which is provided by law or regulation or operates under written rules specifying a group or class of employees to which it applies and the rate at which sick leave is earned.
(d) In general, 8 hours of unused sick leave increases total services by 1 day. In cases where more or less than 8 hours of sick leave would be charged for a day's absence, total service is increased by the number of days in the period between the date of separation and the date that the unused sick leave would have expired had the employee used it (except that holidays falling within the period are treated as work
days, and no additional leave credit is earned for that period).
(e) If an employee's tour of duty changes from part time to full time or full time to part time within 180 days before retirement, the credit for unused sick leave is computed as though no change had occurred.
[34 FR 17617, Oct. 31, 1969]
§ 831.303
Civilian service.
(a)
Periods of civilian service performed before October 1, 1982, for which retirement deductions have not been taken.
Periods of creditable civilian service performed by an employee or Member after July 31, 1920, but before October 1, 1982, for which retirement deductions have not been taken shall be included in determining length of service to compute annuity under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code; however, if the employee, Member, or survivor does not elect either to complete the deposit describes by section 8334(c) of title 5, United States Code, or to eliminate the service from annuity computation, his or her annuity is reduced by 10 percent of the amount which should have been deposited (plus interest) for the period of noncontributory service.
(b)
Periods of service for which refunded deductions have not been redeposited, and periods of civilian service performed on or after October 1, 1982, for which retirement deductions have not been taken.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a period of service for which refunded deductions have not been redeposited, and a period of creditable civilian service performed by an employee or Member on or after October 1, 1982, for which retirement deductions have not been taken, shall be included in determining length of service to compute the annuity under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, only if—
(1) The employee or Member subsequently becomes eligible for an annuity payable under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code; and
(2) The employee, Member, or survivor makes a deposit (or redeposit) for the full period of service. If more than one distinct period of service is covered by a single refund, the periods of service covered by that refund are considered to be single full periods of service. However, in all other instances, a distinct period of nondeduction civilian service (i.e., a period of nondeduction service that is not interrupted by a break in service of more than three days) and a distinct period of redeposit civilian service (i.e., a period of redeposit service that is not interrupted by a break in service of more than three days) are considered as separate full periods of service, even when they are immediately consecutive. A period of nondeduction service which begins before October 1, 1982, and ends on or after that date is also considered two full periods of service: one ending on September 30, 1982, and the other beginning on October 1, 1982.
(c)(1)(i) An employee or Member whose retirement is based on a separation before October 28, 2009, and who has not completed payment of a redeposit for refunded deductions based on a period of service that ended before October 1, 1990, will receive credit for that service in computing the nondisability annuity for which the individual is eligible under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, provided the nondisability annuity commences after December 1, 1990; and
(ii) An employee or Member whose retirement is based on a separation on or after October 28, 2009, and who has not completed payment of a redeposit for refunded deductions based on a period of service that ended before March 1, 1991, will receive credit for that service in computing the nondisability annuity for which the individual is eligible under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code.
(2) The beginning monthly rate of annuity payable to a retiree whose annuity includes service credited in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be reduced by an amount equal to the redeposit owed, or unpaid balance thereof, divided by the present value factor for the retiree's attained age (in full years) at the time of retirement. The reduced monthly rate will then be rounded down to the next lower dollar amount and becomes the rate of annuity payable.
(3) For the purpose of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the term “present value factor” has the same meaning as defined in § 831.603 and “time of retirement” has the same meaning as defined in § 831.2202.
(d)(1)
Civilian and military service of an individual affected by an erroneous retirement coverage determination.
An employee or survivor who owed a deposit under section 8411(c)(1)(B) or 8411(f) of title 5, United States Code (FERS rules) for:
(i) Civilian service that was not subject to retirement deductions, or
(ii) Military service performed after December 31, 1956, will receive credit for the service without payment of the deposit if, because of an erroneous retirement coverage determination, the service is subsequently credited under chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code (CSRS rules).
(2)(i) The beginning monthly rate of annuity payable to a retiree whose annuity includes service credited under paragraph (d)(1) of this section and service creditable under CSRS rules that would not be creditable under FERS rules is reduced by an amount equal to the CSRS deposit owed, or unpaid balance thereof, divided by the present value factor for the retiree's age (in full years) at the time of retirement. The result is rounded to the next highest dollar amount, and is the monthly actuarial reduction amount.
(ii)(A) The beginning monthly rate of annuity payable to a survivor whose annuity includes service credited under paragraph (d)(1) of this section is reduced by an amount equal to the CSRS deposit owed, or unpaid balance thereof, divided by the present value factor for the survivor's age (in full years) at the time of death. The result is rounded to the next highest dollar amount, and is the monthly actuarial reduction amount.
(B) The survivor annuity is not reduced if the employee annuity was reduced under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.
(3) For the purpose of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the term “present value factor” has the same meaning as defined in § 831.603 and “time of retirement” has the same meaning as defined in § 831.2202.

(c)
Processing the application for service credit.
Upon receiving an application requesting credit for service with the Cadet Nurse Corps, OPM will determine whether all conditions for creditability have been met, compute the deposit (including any interest) as specified by sections 8334(e) (2) and (3) of title 5, United States Code, based upon the appropriate percentage of basic pay that
would have been deducted from the individual's pay at the time the service was performed, and advise the agency and the employee of the total amount of the deposit due.
(d)
Agency collection and submission of deposit.
(1) The individual's employing agency must establish a deposit account showing the total amount due and a payment schedule (unless deposit is made in one lump sum), and record the date and amount of each payment.
(2) lf the individual cannot make payment in one lump sum, the employing agency must accept installment payments (by allotments or otherwise). However, the employing agency is not required to accept individual checks in amounts less than $50.
(3) If the employee dies before completing the deposit, the surviving spouse may elect to complete the payment to the employing agency in one lump sum; however, the surviving spouse will not be able to initiate an application for such service credit.
(4) Payments received by the employing agency must be remitted to OPM immediately for deposit to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.
(5) Once the employee's deposit has been paid in full or closed out, the employing agency must submit the documentation pertaining to the deposit to OPM in accordance with published instructions.

Service in a nonappropriated fund instrumentality
is any service performed by an employee that involved conducting arts and crafts, drama, music, library, service (i.e., recreation) club, youth activities, sports or recreation programs (including any outdoor recreation programs) for personnel of the armed forces. Service is not creditable if it was performed in programs other than those specifically named in this subsection.

When an employee elects an alternative annuity and also elects to make the deposit, OPM will deem the deposit to be made for purposes of computing the alternative annuity.
(d)
Crediting other service in a nonappropriated fund instrumentality.
Service not creditable under this section may become creditable for retirement eligibility purposes under the provisions outlined in 5 CFR part 847, subpart H.

§ 831.404
Procedure for making voluntary contributions.
(a) To make voluntary contributions to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, an eligible individual must first apply on a form prescribed by OPM. OPM will establish a voluntary contribution account for each eligible individual who elects to make voluntary contributions and notify the individual that a voluntary contribution account has been established. An eligible individual may not make voluntary contributions until notified by OPM that an account has been so established.
(b) After receiving notice from OPM under paragraph (a) of this section, an eligible individual may forward voluntary contributions to the Office of Personnel Management, at the address designated for that purpose. Voluntary contributions must be in the amount of $25 or multiples thereof, by money order, draft, or check payable to OPM.
(c) The total voluntary contributions made by an employee or Member may not exceed, as of the date any contribution is received, 10 percent of the aggregate basic pay received by the eligible individual.
(1) Employees are responsible for not exceeding the 10 percent limit.
(2) When the employee retires or withdraws the voluntary contributions, OPM will check to determine whether the 10 percent limit has been exceeded.
(3) If the total of voluntary contributions received from the employee exceeds the 10 percent limit, OPM will refund without interest any amount that exceeds the 10 percent limit.
§ 831.405

(2) The date when the employee or Member separates or transfers to a position not subject to CSRS or FERS; or
(3) The date when the employee transfers to a retirement system other than CSRS or FERS.
(d) If an employee separates with entitlement to a deferred annuity and either dies without withdrawing his or her voluntary contributions or uses his or her voluntary contributions to purchase additional annuity, voluntary contributions stop earning interest on the earlier of—
(1) The date the former employee or Member dies; or
(2) The commencing date of the former employee's or Member's deferred annuity.
§ 831.406
Withdrawal of voluntary contributions.
(a) Before receiving additional annuity payments based on the voluntary contributions, a person who has made voluntary contributions may withdraw the balance while still an employee or Member, or after separation.
(b) A person entitled to payment of lump-sum benefits under the CSRS order for precedence set forth in section 8342(c) of title 5, United States Code, is entitled to payment of the balance, if any, on the death of—
(1) An employee or Member;
(2) A separated employee or Member who has not retired;
(3) A retiree, unless a survivor benefit is payable based on an election under § 831.407; or
(4) A person receiving a survivor annuity based on voluntary contributions.
§ 831.407
Purchase of additional annuity.
(a) At the time of retirement CSRS (or under FERS, if transferred from CSRS), a person may use the balance of a voluntary contribution account to purchase one of the following types of additional annuity:
(1) Annuity without survivor benefit; or
(2) Reduced annuity payable during the life of the employee or Member with one-half of the reduced annuity to be payable after his or her death to a person, named at time of retirement, during the life of the named person.
(b) Any natural person may be designated as survivor under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(c) If the applicant for retirement elects an annuity without survivor benefit, each $100 credited to his or her voluntary contribution account, including interest, purchases an additional annuity at the rate of $7 per year, plus 20 cents for each full year, if any, he or she is over age 55 at date of retirement.
(d) If the applicant for retirement elects an annuity with survivor benefit, each $100 credited to his or her voluntary contribution account, including interest, purchases an additional annuity at the rate of $7 per year, plus 20 cents for each full year, if any, he or she is over age 55 at date of retirement, multiplied by the following percentage:
(1) Ninety percent of such amount if the named person is the same age or older than the applicant for retirement, or is less than 5 years younger than the applicant for retirement;
(2) Eighty-five percent if the named person is 5 but less than 10 years younger;
(3) Eighty percent if the named person is 10 but less than 15 years younger;
(4) Seventy-five percent if the named person is 15 but less than 20 years younger;
(5) Seventy percent if the named person is 20 but less than 25 years younger;
(6) Sixty-five percent if the named person is 25 but less than 30 years younger; and

(b) The head of the agency, when in his or her judgment the public interest so requires, may exempt a law enforcement officer, firefighter, nuclear materials courier, or customs and border protection officer from automatic separation until that employee becomes 60 years of age.
(c) The Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of Defense, under such regulations as each may prescribe, may exempt an air traffic controller having exceptional skills and experience as a controller from automatic separation until that controller becomes 61 years of age.
(d) When a department or agency lacks authority and wishes to secure an exemption from automatic separation for one of its employees other than a Presidential appointee, beyond the age(s) provided by statute, i.e., age 60 for a law enforcement officer, firefighter, nuclear materials courier, or customs and border protection officer, and age 61 for an air traffic controller, the department or agency head shall submit a recommendation to that effect to OPM.
(1) The recommendation shall contain:
(i) A statement that the employee is willing to remain in service;
(ii) A statement of facts tending to establish that his/her retention would be in the public interest;
(iii) The period for which the exemption is desired, which period may not exceed 1 year; and,
(iv) The reasons why the simpler method of retiring the employee and immediately reemploying him or her is not being used.
(2) The recommendation shall be accompanied by a medical certificate showing the physical fitness of the employee to perform his or her work.
(e) OPM may approve an exemption only before the automatic separation date applicable to the employee. For this reason, the department or agency shall forward the recommendation to OPM at least 30 days before this separation date.

§ 831.503
Retirement based on involuntary separation.
(a)
General.
An employee who would otherwise be eligible for retirement based on involuntary separation from the service is not entitled to an annuity under section 8336(d)(1) of title 5, United States Code, if the employee has declined a reasonable offer of another position.
(b)
Criteria for reasonable offer.
For the purposes of determining entitlement to annuity based on such involuntary separation, the offer of a position must meet all of the following conditions to be considered a reasonable offer:
(1) The offer must be made in writing;
(2) The employee must meet established qualification requirements; and
(3) The offered position must be—
(i) In the employee's agency, including an agency to which the employee
with his or her function is transferred in a transfer of functions between agencies;
(ii) Within the employee's commuting area as defined in § 831.1202 of this part, unless geographic mobility is a condition of the employee's employment;
(iii) Of the same tenure and work schedule; and
(iv) Not lower than the equivalent of two grades or pay levels below the employee's current grade or pay level, without consideration of the employee's eligibility to retain his or her current grade or pay under part 536 of this chapter or other authority. In movements between pay schedules or pay systems, the comparison rate of the grade or pay level that is two grades below that of the current position will be compared with the comparison rate of the grade or pay level of the offered position. For this purpose, “comparison rate” has the meaning given that term in § 536.103 of this chapter, except paragraph (2) of that definition should be used for the purpose of comparing grade or levels of work in making reasonable offer determinations in all situations not covered by paragraph (1) of that definition.

8334(c) or (d) of title 5, United States Code.
First regular monthly payment
means the first annuity check payable on a recurring basis (other than an estimated payment or an adjustment check) after OPM has initially adjudicated the regular rate of annuity payable under CSRS and has paid the annuity accrued since the time of retirement. The “first regular monthly payment” is generally preceded by estimated payments before the claim can be adjudicated and by an adjustment check (including the difference between the estimated rate and the initially adjudicated rate).
Former spouse
means a living person who was married for at least 9 months to an employee, Member, or retiree who performed at least 18 months of creditable service in a position covered by CSRS and whose marriage to the employee was terminated prior to the death of the employee, Member, or retiree.

former spouse
includes only persons who were married to an employee or Member on or after May 7, 1985, or who were the spouse of a retiree who retired on or after May 7, 1985, regardless of the date of termination of the marriage.
Former spouse annuity
means a recurring benefit under CSRS that is payable to a former spouse after the employee's, Member's, or retiree's death.

Assumed rates of interest, mortality, and cost-of-living adjustments used in computing the present value are those used by the Board of Actuaries of the Civil Service Retirement System for valuation of the System based on dynamic assumptions. The present value factors are unisex factors obtained as a composite of sex-distinct present value factors.

§ 831.613
Election of insurable interest annuity.
(a) At the time of retirement, an employee or Member in good health, who is applying for a non-disability annuity, may elect an insurable interest annuity. Spousal consent is not required, but an election under this section does not exempt a married employee or Member from the provisions of § 831.611(a).
(b) An insurable interest annuity may be elected by an employee or Member electing a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity or a former spouse annuity or annuities.
(c)(1) In the case of a married employee or Member, an election under this section may not be made on behalf of a current spouse unless that current spouse has consented to an election not to provide a current spouse annuity in accordance with § 831.611(a)(1).
(2) A consent (to an election not to provide a current spouse annuity in accordance with § 831.611(a)(1)) required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section to be eligible to be the beneficiary of an insurable interest annuity is cancelled if—
(i) The retiree fails to qualify to receive the insurable interest annuity; or
(ii) The retiree changes his or her election to receive an insurable interest annuity under § 831.621; or
(iii) The retiree elects a fully or partially reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity under § 831.685.
(3) An election of a partially reduced annuity under § 831.622(b) or § 831.685 to provide a current spouse annuity for a current spouse who is the beneficiary of an insurable interest annuity is void unless the spouse consents to the election.
(4) If a retiree who had elected an insurable interest annuity to benefit a current spouse elects a fully reduced
annuity to provide a current spouse annuity (or, with the consent of the current spouse, a partially reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity) under § 831.622(b) or § 831.685, the election of the insurable interest annuity is cancelled.
(5)(i) A retiring employee or Member may not elect a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity and an insurable interest annuity to benefit the same former spouse.
(ii) If a retiring employee or Member who is required by court order to provide a former spouse annuity elects an insurable interest annuity to benefit the former spouse with the court-ordered entitlement—
(A) If the benefit based on the election is greater than or equal to the benefit based on the court order, the election of the insurable interest annuity will satisfy the requirements of the court order as long as the insurable interest annuity continues.
(B) If the benefit based on the election is less than the benefit based on the court order, the election of the insurable interest annuity is void.
(iii) An election under § 831.632 of a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to benefit a former spouse by a retiree who elected and continues to receive an insurable interest annuity to benefit that former spouse is void.
(d) To elect an insurable interest annuity, an employee or Member must indicate the intention to make the election on the application for retirement; submit evidence to demonstrate that he or she is in good health; and arrange and pay for the medical examination that shows that he or she is in good health. A report of the medical examination, signed and dated by a licensed physician, must be furnished to OPM on such forms and at such time and place as OPM may prescribe.
(e) An insurable interest annuity may be elected to provide a survivor benefit only for a person who has an insurable interest in the retiring employee or Member.
(1) An insurable interest is presumed to exist with—
(i) The current spouse;
(ii) The current same-sex domestic partner;
(iii) A blood or adopted relative closer than first cousins;
(iv) A former spouse;
(v) A former same-sex domestic partner;
(vi) A person to whom the employee or Member is engaged to be married, or a person with whom the employee or Member has agreed to enter into a same-sex domestic partnership;
(vii) A person with whom the employee or Member is living in a relationship that would constitute a common-law marriage in jurisdictions recognizing common-law marriages;
(2) For purposes of this section, the term “same-sex domestic partner” means a person in a domestic partnership with an employee or annuitant of the same sex and the term “domestic partnership” is defined as a committed relationship between two adults, of the same sex, in which the partners—
(i) Are each other's sole domestic partner and intend to remain so indefinitely;
(ii) Maintain a common residence, and intend to continue to do so (or would maintain a common residence but for an assignment abroad or other employment-related, financial, or similar obstacle);
(iii) Are at least 18 years of age and mentally competent to consent to contract;
(iv) Share responsibility for a significant measure of each other's financial obligations;
(v) Are not married or joined in a civil union to anyone else;
(vi) Are not the domestic partner of anyone else;
(vii) Are not related in a way that, if they were of opposite sex, would prohibit legal marriage in the U.S. jurisdiction in which the domestic partnership was formed; and
(viii) Are willing to certify, if required by OPM, that they understand that willful falsification of any documentation required to establish that an individual is in a domestic partnership may lead to disciplinary action and the recovery of the cost of benefits received related to such falsification, as well as constitute a criminal violation under 18 U.S.C. 1001.
(3) When an insurable interest is not presumed, the employee or Member must submit affidavits from one or more persons with personal knowledge of the named beneficiary's insurable interest in the employee or Member. The affidavits must set forth the relationship, if any, between the named beneficiary and the employee or Member, the extent to which the named beneficiary is dependent on the employee or Member, and the reasons why the named beneficiary might reasonably expect to derive financial benefit from the continued life of the employee or Member.
(4) The employee or Member may be required to submit documentary evidence to establish the named beneficiary's date of birth.
(f) After receipt of all required evidence to support an election of an insurable interest annuity, OPM will notify the employee or Member of initial monthly annuity rates with and without the election of an insurable interest annuity and the initial rate payable to the named beneficiary. No election of an insurable interest annuity is effective unless the employee or Member confirms the election in writing, dies, or becomes incompetent no later than 60 days after the date of the notice described in this paragraph.
(g) (1) When an employee or Member elects both an insurable interest annuity and a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity and/or a former spouse annuity or annuities, each reduction is computed based on the self-only annuity computation. The combined reduction may exceed the maximum 40 percent reduction in the retired employee's or Member's annuity permitted under section 8339(k)(1) of title 5, United States Code, applicable to insurable interest annuities.
(2) The rate of annuity paid to the beneficiary of an insurable interest election, when the employee or Member also elected a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity, equals 55 (or 50 percent if based on a separation before October 11, 1962) percent of the rate of annuity after the insurable interest reduction. The additional reduction to provide a current spouse annuity or a former spouse annuity is not considered in determining the rate of annuity paid to the beneficiary of the insurable interest election.
(h)(1) Except as provided in § 831.612(d), if a retiree who is receiving a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity has also elected an insurable interest annuity to benefit a current spouse and if the eligible former spouse remarries before age 55, dies, or loses eligibility under the terms of the court order, and no other former spouse is entitled to a survivor annuity based on an election made in accordance with § 831.632 or a qualifying court order, the retiree may elect, within 2 years after the former spouse's remarriage, death, or loss of eligibility under the terms of the court order, to convert the insurable interest annuity to a fully reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity, effective on the first day of the month following the event causing the former spouse to lose eligibility.
(2) An election under paragraph (h)(1) of this section cancels any consent not to receive a current spouse annuity required by paragraph (c) of this section for the current spouse to be eligible for an annuity under this section.
(3) When a former spouse receiving an annuity under section 8341(h) of title 5, United States Code, loses eligibility to that annuity, a beneficiary of an insurable interest annuity who was the current spouse at both the time of the retiree's retirement and death may, within 2 years after the former spouse's death, remarriage, or loss of eligibility under the terms of the court order, elect to receive a current spouse annuity instead of the annuity he or she had been receiving. The election is effective on the first day of the month following the event causing the former spouse to lose eligibility.
(i) Upon the death of the current spouse, a retiree whose annuity is reduced to provide both a current spouse annuity and an insurable interest benefit for a former spouse is not permitted to convert the insurable interest annuity to a reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity.
(j) An employee or Member may name only one natural person as the
named beneficiary of an insurable interest annuity. OPM will not accept the designation of contingent beneficiaries and such a designation is void.
(k)(1) An election under this section is prospectively voided by an election of a reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity under § 831.631 that would benefit the same person.
(2)(i) If the spouse is not the beneficiary of the election under this section, a retiree may prospectively void an election under this section at the time the retiree elects a reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity under § 831.631.
(ii) A retiree's election to void an election under paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section must be filed at the same time as the election under § 831.631.
(3) An annuity reduction under this section terminates on the first day of the month after the beneficiary of the insurable interest annuity dies.

(b) Evidence of spousal consent or a request for waiver of spousal consent must be filed on a form prescribed by OPM.

# Children's Annuities
§ 831.671
Proof of eligibility for a child's annuity.
(a)
Proof of paternity.
(1) A judicial determination of parentage conclusively establishes the paternity of a child.
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a child born to the wife of a married person is presumed to be the child of the wife's husband. This presumption may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence that the husband is not the father of the child.
(3) When paternity is not established under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, paternity is determined by a preponderance of the credible evidence as defined in § 1201.56(c)(2) of this title.
(b)
Proof of adoption.
(1) An adopted child is—
(i) A child adopted by the employee or retiree before the death of the employee or retiree; or
(ii) A child who lived with the employee or retiree and for whom a petition for adoption was filed by the employee or retiree and who is adopted by the current spouse of the employee or retiree after the death of the employee or retiree.
(2) The only acceptable evidence to prove status as an adopted child under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is a copy of the judicial decree of adoption.
(3) The only acceptable evidence to prove status as an adopted child under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section is copies of—
(i) The petition for adoption filed by the employee or retiree (clearly showing the date filed); and
(ii) The judicial decree of adoption.
(c)
Dependency.
To be eligible for survivor annuity benefits, a child must have been dependent on the employee or retiree at the time of the employee's or retiree's death.
(d)
Proof of dependency.
(1) A child is presumed to have been dependent on the deceased employee or retiree if he or she is—
(i) A legitimate child; or
(ii) An adopted child; or
(iii) A stepchild or recognized natural child who lived with the employee or retiree in a regular parent-child relationship at the time of the employee's or retiree's death; or
(iv) A recognized natural child for whom a judicial determination of support was obtained; or
(v) A recognized natural child to whose support the employee or retiree made regular and substantial contributions.
(2) The following are examples of proofs of regular and substantial support. More than one of the following proofs may be required to show support
of a child who did not live with the employee or retiree in a regular parent-child relationship and for whom a judicial determination of support was not obtained.
(i) Evidence of eligibility as a dependent child for benefits under other State or Federal programs;
(ii) Proof of inclusion of the child as a dependent on the decedent's income tax returns for the years immediately before the employee's or retiree's death;
(iii) Cancelled checks, money orders, or receipts for periodic payments received from the employee or retiree for or on behalf of the child;
(iv) Evidence of goods or services that shows regular contributions of considerable value;
(v) Proof of coverage of the child as a family member under the employee's or retiree's Federal Employees Health Benefits enrollment; and
(vi) Other proof of a similar nature that OPM may find to be sufficient to demonstrate support or parentage.
(3) Survivor benefits may be denied—
(i) If evidence shows that the deceased employee or retiree did not recognize the claimant as his or her own despite a willingness to support the child; or
(ii) If evidence casts doubt upon the parentage of the claimant, despite the deceased employee's or retiree's recognition and support of the child.

§ 831.672
Annuity for a child age 18 to 22 during full-time school attendance.
(a)
General requirements for an annuity.
(1) For a child age 18 to 22 to be eligible to receive an annuity as a full-time student, the child must also meet all other requirements applicable to qualify for an annuity by a child who has not attained age 18.
(2) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, OPM must receive certification, in a form prescribed by OPM, that the child is regularly pursuing a full-time course of study in an accredited institution.
(b)
Full-time course of study.
(1) Generally, a full-time course of study is a noncorrespondence course which, if successfully completed, will lead to completion of the education within the period generally accepted as minimum for completion, by a full-time day student, of the academic or training program concerned.
(2) A certification by an accredited institution that the student's workload is sufficient to constitute a full-time course of study for the program in which the student is enrolled is prima facie evidence that the student is pursuing a full-time course of study.
(c)
Certification of school attendance.
(1) OPM may periodically request the recipient of a child's annuity payments to furnish certification of school attendance. The certification must be completed in the form prescribed by OPM.
(2) If OPM requests the recipient of a child's annuity payments to provide a self-certification of school attendance, the recipient must complete and sign the certification form.
(3) If OPM requests the recipient of a child's annuity payments to provide a certification by the school, the certification must be signed by an official who is either in charge of the school or in charge of the school's records. OPM will not accept certification forms signed by instructors, counselors, aides, roommates, or others not in charge of the school or the records.
(i) If the educational institution is above the high school level, the certification must be signed by the president or chancellor, vice president or vice chancellor, dean or assistant dean, registrar or administrator, assistant registrar or assistant administrator, or the equivalent.
(ii) If the educational institution is at the high school level, the certification must be signed by the superintendent of schools, assistant superintendent of schools, principal, vice principal, assistant principal, or the equivalent.
(iii) If the educational institution is a technical or trade school, the certification must be signed by the president, vice president, director, assistant director, or the equivalent.
(4) OPM will accept a facsimile signature of a school official only if it is accompanied by a raised seal of the institution or other evidence clearly demonstrating the authenticity of the certification and making unauthorized use of the signature stamp unlikely.
(d)
Continuation of annuity during interim breaks.
A child's annuity continues during interim breaks between school years if the following conditions are satisfied:
(1) The student must have been a full-time student at the end of the school term immediately before the break.
(2) The break between the end of the last term of full-time attendance and the return to full-time attendance must not exceed 5 months. (See § 831.107, concerning calculation of this time period.)
(3) The recipient of a child's annuity payments must show that the student has a bona fide intent to return to school as a full-time student immediately after the break. The full-time certification for the prior term and the certification (in a form prescribed by OPM) by the recipient of a child's annuity payments that the student intends to return to school (immediately after the break) as a full-time student constitute prima facie evidence of a bona fide intent to return to school.
(e)
Benefits after age 22.
(1) A student's eligibility for a child's annuity terminates based on reaching age 22 on—
(i) June 30 of the calendar year of the child's 22nd birthday if the child's birthday is before July 1; or
(ii) The last day of the month before the child's 22nd birthday if the child's birthday occurs after June 30 but before September 1 of the calendar year; or
(iii) June 30 of the year after the one in which the child attains age 22 if the child's birthday is after August 31 of the calendar year.
(2)(i) An otherwise eligible child who becomes a full-time student after his or her 22nd birthday but before the date the annuity terminates under paragraph (e)(1) of this section is eligible for annuity while he or she is a full-time student until the termination date under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(ii) An otherwise eligible child who is a full-time student, and whose parent dies after the child's 22nd birthday but before the date the annuity terminates under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, is eligible for annuity while he or she is a full-time student after the death of the parent until the termination date under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

§ 831.673
Rates of child annuities.
(a) (1) The rate of annuity payable to a child survivor whose annuity commenced before February 27, 1986, is computed in accordance with the law in effect on the date when the annuity began to accrue, unless the rate of annuity is recomputed under paragraph (e) of this section on or after February 27, 1986.
(2) The rate of annuity payable to a child survivor whose annuity commenced on or after February 27, 1986, or was recomputed under paragraph (e) of this section on or after February 27, 1986, is computed under paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the rate of annuity of a child survivor is computed under section 8341(e)(2) (i) through (iii) of title 5, United States Code, with adjustments in accordance with section 8340 of title 5, United States Code, when the deceased employee, Member or annuitant was never married to a natural or adoptive parent of that surviving child of the former employee or Member.
(c) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the rate of annuity payable to a child survivor is computed under section 8341(e)(2) (A) through (C) of title 5, United States Code, with adjustments in accordance with section 8340 of title 5, United States Code, whenever a deceased employee, Member, or retiree is survived by a natural or adoptive parent of that surviving child of the employee, Member, or retiree.
(d) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the rate of annuity payable to a child survivor is computed under section 8341(e)(2) (i) through (iii)
of title 5, United States Code, with adjustments in accordance with section 8340 of title 5, United States Code, when the deceased employee, Member, or retiree is not survived by a natural or adoptive parent of that surviving child of the former employee or Member.
(e) On the death of a natural or adoptive parent or termination of the annuity of a child, the annuity of any other child or children is recomputed and paid as though the parent or child had not survived the former employee or Member.

# Regulations Pertaining to Noncodified Statutes
§ 831.681
Annual notice required by Public Law 95-317.
At least once every 12 consecutive months, OPM will send a notice to all retirees to inform them about the survivor annuity elections available to them, under sections 8339(j), 8339(k)(2), and 8339(o) of title 5, United States Code.

§ 831.682
Election by a retiree who retired before May 7, 1985, to provide a former spouse annuity.
(a) A retiree who retired before May 7, 1985, including a retiree receiving a fully reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity, may elect a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity.
(b) The election should be made by letter addressed to OPM. The election must—
(1) Be in writing; and
(2) Agree to pay any deposit due under paragraph (c) of this section; and
(3) Be signed by the retiree; and
(4) Be filed with OPM before September 8, 1987.
(c)(1)(i) If a retiree who is receiving an insurable interest annuity elects a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity under this section to benefit the same person, the insurable interest annuity terminates. A retiree who is receiving an insurable interest annuity at the time that an annuity is elected under this section does not owe any further deposit.
(ii) If a retiree who had been receiving an insurable interest annuity, which was terminated to elect a reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity for a spouse acquired after retirement, elects to provide a former spouse annuity for a former spouse who was the beneficiary of the insurable interest annuity, the retiree must deposit an amount equal to the sum of the monthly differences between the self-only annuity and a fully reduced annuity or partially reduced annuity (with the same base as elected to provide the former spouse annuity) from the date the insurable interest annuity terminated, plus 6 percent annual interest, computed under § 831.105, from the date to which each monthly difference is attributable.
(2) A retiree who elects a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity under this section, to provide a former spouse annuity for a former spouse for whom the retiree had elected (during the marriage to that former spouse) a reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity, must deposit an amount equal to the sum of the monthly differences between the self-only annuity and the amount of annuity that would have been in effect had a fully reduced annuity or partially reduced annuity (with the same base as elected to provide the former spouse annuity) been in effect continuously since the time of retirement, plus 6 percent annual interest, computed under § 831.105, from the date to which each monthly difference is attributable, except that the retiree will not be charged for any period during which the survivor reduction was in effect for that former spouse.
(3) A retiree who elects a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity under this section, and is not covered under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, must deposit an amount equal to the sum of the monthly difference between the self-only annuity and a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity (with the same base as elected to provide the former spouse annuity) since the time
of retirement, plus 6 percent annual interest, computed under § 831.105, from the date to which each monthly difference is attributable.
(d) If a retiree who is receiving a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity elects a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity under this section to provide a former spouse annuity, the annuity will be reduced separately to provide for the current and former spouse annuities. Each separate reduction will be computed based on the self-only annuity, and the separate reductions are cumulative.
(e)(1) In response to a retiree's inquiry about providing a former spouse annuity under this section, OPM will send an application form. The application form will include a notice to retirees that filing the application constitutes an official election which cannot be revoked after 30 days after the annuity check in which the annuity reduction first appears.
(2) If the retiree returns the application electing a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity under this section, OPM will notify the retiree of—
(i) The rate of the fully reduced annuity or partially reduced annuity; and
(ii) The rate of the potential former spouse annuity; and
(iii) The amount of the deposit, including interest, that is due as of the date that the annuity reduction is scheduled to begin; and
(iv) The amount and duration of installment payments if no deposit is made.
(3) The notice under paragraph (e)(2) of this section will advise the retiree that the deposit will be collected in installments under § 831.665, unless lump-sum payment is made within 60 days from the date of the notice.
(4) OPM will reduce the annuity and begin collection of the deposit in installments effective with the first check payable more than 60 days after the date on the notice required under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(f)(1) A retiree who made an election under this section prior to September 9, 1986 may modify that election by designating a lesser portion of the retiree's annuity be used as the base for the annuity reduction and the former spouse annuity.
(2) Any modification under paragraph (f)(1) of this section must be in writing and received in OPM no later than the date provided for applications in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(g) The annuity reduction resulting in a fully reduced annuity or partially reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity under this section terminates on the first day of the month after the former spouse remarries before age 55 or dies.
(h) A former spouse is eligible to receive only one survivor annuity based on the service of one employee or Member.
(i) If a former spouse is entitled to a former spouse annuity based on an election under this section, but absent that election would have been entitled to a former spouse annuity under § 831.683 (i.e., filed a timely application as well as meeting all other requirements), the amount of the former spouse annuity payable will equal 55 percent of the annuity of the retiree on whose service the survivor annuity is based.

§ 831.683
Annuities for former spouses of employees or Members retired before May 7, 1985.
(a)(1) The former spouse of a retiree who retired before May 7, 1985 (or of an employee or Member who died before May 7, 1985, was employed in a position covered by CSRS at the time of death, and was eligible to retire at the time of death), is entitled, after the death of the retiree, employee, or Member, to a survivor annuity equal to 55 percent of the self-only annuity of the retiree on whose service the survivor annuity is based if the former spouse, at the time of application, meets all of the following requirements:
(i) The former spouse's marriage to the retiree, employee, or Member was dissolved after September 14, 1978, and before May 8, 1987. The date of dissolution of a marriage is the date when the marriage between the former spouse
and the retiree, employee, or Member ended under the law of the jurisdiction that terminated the marriage, rather than the date when restrictions on remarriage ended. The date of entry of the decree terminating the marriage will be rebuttably presumed to be the date when the marriage was dissolved.
(ii) The former spouse was married to the retiree, employee, or Member for at least 10 years of the retiree's, employee's, or Member's creditable service. Creditability of service is determined in accordance with section 8332 of title 5, United States Code, and subpart C of this part.
(iii) The former spouse has not remarried before reaching age 55.
(iv) The former spouse applies to OPM for a survivor annuity, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section and § 831.643(b), before May 8, 1989.
(v) The former spouse is at least 50 years old on May 7, 1987, and when filing the application.
(2) A former spouse who is not eligible for an annuity under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and who is the former spouse of a retiree who retired before May 7, 1985 (or of an employee or Member who died before May 7, 1985, was employed in a position covered by CSRS at the time of death, and was eligible to retire at the time of death), is entitled, after the death of the retiree, employee, or Member, to a survivor annuity equal to 55 percent of the self-only annuity of the retiree on whose service the survivor annuity is based if the former spouse, at the time of application, meets all of the following requirements:
(i) The former spouse was married to the retiree, employee, or Member for at least 10 years of the retiree's, employee's, or Member's creditable service. Creditability of service is determined in accordance with section 8332 of title 5, United States Code, and subpart C of this part.
(ii) The former spouse has not remarried after September 14, 1978, before reaching age 55.
(iii) The former spouse applies to OPM for a survivor annuity, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section and § 831.643(b), before May 8, 1989.
(iv) The former spouse is at least 50 years old on May 7, 1987, and when filing the application.
(v) No current spouse, other former spouse, or insurable interest designee is receiving or has been designated to receive a survivor annuity based on the service of the employee, Member, or retiree.
(3) If two or more eligible former spouses of a retiree, employee, or Member apply for annuities under paragraph (a)(2) of this section based on the service of the same retiree, employee, or Member, and neither meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the former spouse whose application OPM receives first is entitled to the annuity.
(b)(1) Application must be filed on the form prescribed for that purpose by OPM. The application form will require the former spouse to certify under the penalty provided by section 1001 of title 18, United States Code, that he or she meets the requirements listed in paragraph (a) of this section.
(2) In addition to the application form required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the former spouse must submit proof of his or her age and the date when the marriage to the retiree commenced, and a certified copy of the divorce decree terminating the marriage to the retiree.
(3)(i) Former spouses applying for benefits under this section must meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section at the time of application.
(ii) An annuity under this section terminates on the last day of the month before the former spouse remarries before age 55 or dies, except that a remarriage before September 15, 1978, does not cause termination of a former spouse annuity under this section. A former spouse who is receiving a former spouse annuity under this section must notify OPM within 30 days after he or she remarries before age 55.
(c) Survivor annuities payable under this section commence on the later of the day after the date of death of the retiree or the first day of the second month after the application is filed under § 831.643(b).
(d) Cost-of-living adjustments under section 8340 of title 5, United States
Code, are applicable to annuities payable under this section.
(e) If a former spouse is eligible for a former spouse annuity under this section and another current spouse annuity or former spouse annuity (under the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees Retirement System) resulting from the death of the same retiree, the annuity under this section will be paid instead of the other current spouse annuity or former spouse annuity.

§ 831.684
Second chance elections to provide survivor benefits.
(a) A married retiree who retired before May 7, 1985, and is not currently receiving a fully or partially reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity may elect a fully or partially reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity for a spouse acquired after retirement if the following conditions are met:
(1) (i) The retiree was married at the time of retirement and did not elect a survivor annuity at that time; or
(ii) The retiree failed to elect a fully or partially reduced annuity within 1 year after a post-retirement marriage that occurred before November 8, 1984, and the retiree attempted to elect a fully or partially reduced annuity after the time limit expired and that request was disallowed as untimely.
(2) The retiree applies for a fully or partially reduced annuity under this section before November 9, 1985.
(3) The retiree agrees to pay the amount due under paragraph (d) of this section.
(b) Applications must be filed on the form prescribed by OPM, except filing the form is excused when the retiree dies before filing the required form if:
(1) The retiree made a written request, after November 8, 1984, to elect a fully or partially reduced annuity under this section, and
(2) The retiree was denied the opportunity to file the required form because the retiree, without fault, did not receive the form in sufficient time for the retiree to be reasonably expected to complete the form before death.
(c)(1) In response to a retiree's inquiry about providing a current spouse annuity under this section, OPM will send an application form. This application will include instructions to assist the retiree in estimating the amount of reduction in the annuity to provide the current spouse annuity and the amount of the required deposit. The application form will include a notice to retirees that filing the application constitutes an official election which cannot be revoked after 30 days after the annuity check in which the annuity reduction first appears.
(2) If the retiree returns the application electing a fully or partially reduced annuity under this section, OPM will notify the retiree of—
(i) The rate of the fully reduced annuity; and
(ii) The rate of the potential current spouse annuity; and
(iii) The amount of the deposit, including interest, that is due as of the date that the annuity reduction is scheduled to begin; and
(iv) The amount and duration of installment payments if no deposit is made.
(3) The notice under paragraph (c)(2) of this section will advise the retiree that the deposit will be collected in installments under § 831.665, unless lump-sum payment is made within 60 days from the date of this notice.
(4) OPM will reduce the annuity and begin collection of the deposit in installments effective with the first check payable more than 60 days after the date on the notice required under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(d) The retiree must state on the application form whether the application is made under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section or paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. If the application is made under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the retiree must prove that he or she had attempted to elect a fully reduced annuity and that OPM rejected that application because it was filed too late. The proof must consist of a copy of OPM's letter rejecting the previous election as untimely filed or an affidavit swearing or affirming that he or she made an untimely application
which OPM rejected. The affidavit is sufficient documentation to provide proof of the retiree's attempt to elect a reduced annuity, unless the record contains convincing evidence to rebut the certification.
(e) A retiree who elects to provide a current spouse annuity under this section must agree to pay a deposit equal to the difference between the amount of annuity actually paid to the retiree and the amount of annuity that would have been paid if a fully reduced annuity were being paid continuously since the time of retirement, plus 6 percent annual interest, computed under § 831.105, from the date when each difference occurred.
(f) The rate of a survivor annuity under this section will be computed under the laws in effect at the time of the retiree's separation from the Federal service.

§ 831.685
Changes in elections to provide a current spouse annuity by a retiree who retired before May 28, 1986.
(a) Except as provided in § 831.613 and paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a retiree who retired before May 28, 1986, was married at the time of retirement, and at the time of retirement did not elect a fully reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity may elect a fully reduced annuity or a greater partially reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity.
(b)(1) An election under paragraph (a) of this section may be made only by a retiree who is married to the same spouse to whom the retiree was married at the time of retirement.
(2) A current spouse annuity based on an election under paragraph (a) of this section cannot be paid if it will, when combined with any former spouse annuity or annuities that are required by court order, exceed the maximum survivor annuity permitted under § 831.641.
(3)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, to make an election under paragraph (a) of this section, the retiree must pay the deposit computed under § 831.662, in full, no later than November 28, 1987.
(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, failure to pay the deposit, in full, before November 29, 1987, voids an election made under paragraph (a) of this section.
(4) If a retiree makes an election under paragraph (a) of this section and is prevented from paying the deposit within the 18-month time limit because OPM did not send him or her a notice of the amount of the deposit at least 30 days before the time limit expires, the time limit for making the deposit will be extended to 30 days after OPM sends the notice of the amount of the deposit.
(5) For a retiree whose annuity commenced on or after May 7, 1985, an election under paragraph (a) of this section cancels any spouse consent under § 831.611 to the extent of the election.
(c) If a retiree who had elected a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity makes an election under paragraph (a) of this section that would cause the combined current spouse annuity and former spouse annuity (or annuities) to exceed the maximum allowed under § 831.641, the former spouse annuity (or annuities) must be reduced to conform with that allowed under § 831.641.
(d) An election under paragraph (a) of this section is void unless it is filed with OPM before the retiree dies.

(a)(1) An annuity which includes creditable National Guard technician service performed prior to January 1, 1969, shall be reduced by the portion of any benefits under any State retirement system to which an annuitant is entitled (or on proper application would be entitled) for any month in which the annuitant is eligible for State benefits based on the same pre-1969, service.
(2) Any cost-of-living increases in the State benefit shall require a corresponding deduction in the civil service annuity.
(3) Any cost-of-living increase to a civil service annuity shall apply to the gross annuity before deduction for benefits under any State retirement system.
(b) In the adjudication of claims arising under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, OPM shall take appropriate action to obtain the data that it considers necessary to assure the proper annuity deduction. Upon request by OPM, an annuitant shall promptly submit this data.
[48 FR 38786, Aug. 26, 1983]
§ 831.703
Computation of annuities for part-time service.
(a)
Purpose.
The computational method in this section shall be used to determine the annuity for an employee who has part-time service on or after April 7, 1986.
(b)
Definitions.
In this section—
Full-time service
means service performed by an employee who has—
(1) An officially established recurring basic workweek consisting of 40 hours within the employee's administrative workweek (as established under § 610.111 of this chapter or similar authority);
(2) An officially established recurring basic work requirement of 80 hours per biweekly pay period (as established for employees with a flexible or compressed work schedule under 5 U.S.C. chapter 61, subchapter II, or similar authority);
(3) For a firefighter covered by 5 U.S.C. 5545b(b) who does not have a 40-hour basic workweek, a regular tour of duty averaging at least 106 hours per biweekly pay period; or
(4) A work schedule that is considered to be full-time by express provision of law, including a work schedule established for certain nurses under 38 U.S.C. 7456 or 7456A that is considered by law to be a full-time schedule for all purposes.
Intermittent service
means any actual service performed with no prescheduled regular tour of duty.
Part-time service
means any actual service performed on a less than full-time basis, by an individual whose appointment describes a regularly scheduled tour of duty, and any period of time credited as non pay status time under 5 U.S.C. 8332(f), which follows a period of part-time service without any intervening period of actual service other than part-time service. This definition is not limited to part-time career employment because it includes part-time temporary employment as well.
Post-April 6, 1986 average pay
means the largest annual rate resulting from averaging, over any period of 3 consecutive years of creditable service, the annual rate of basic pay that would be payable for full-time service by an employee during that period, with each rate weighted by the time it was in effect, except that for periods of service before April 7, 1986, the actual rate of basic pay based on the employee's established tour of duty, if different, is used in the computation. The rates of pay included in the computation for intermittent service or temporary service performed on a full-time basis are the actual rates of basic pay during those periods of creditable service.
Pre-April 7, 1986, average pay
means the largest annual rate resulting from averaging, over any period of 3 consecutive years of creditable service, an employee's actual rates of basic pay during that period, with each rate weighted by the time it was in effect.
Proration factor
means a fraction expressed as a percentage rounded to the nearest percent. The numerator is the sum of the number of hours the employee actually worked during part-time service, and the denominator is the sum of the number of hours that a full-time employee would be schedule to work during the same period of service included in the numerator. If an employee has creditable service in addition to part-time service (full-time service, intermittent service, or temporary service performed on a full-time basis), such service must be included in the numerator and denominator of the fraction. In general, this is done by including the number of days of such intermittent service, multiplied by 8, and the number of weeks of such temporary service or full-time service, multiplied by 40 in both the numerator and the denominator. The additional credit for unused sick leave under 5 U.S.C. 8339(m) is not included in the fraction.
Temporary service
means service under an appointment limited to one year or less, exclusive of intermittent service.
(c)
Pre-April 7, 1986, basic annuity.
The partial annuity for pre-April 7, 1986, service is computed in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8339 using the pre-April 7, 1986, average pay and length of service (increased by the unused sick leave credit at time of retirement) prior to April 7, 1986.
(d)
Post-April 6, 1986, basic annuity.
The partial annuity for post-April 6, 1986, service is computed in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8339 using the post-April 6, 1986, average pay and length of service after April 6, 1986. This amount is then multiplied by the proration factor.
(e)
Combined basic annuity.
The combined basic annuity is equal to the sum of the partial annuity amounts computed under paragraphs (c) and (d). This amount is the yearly rate of annuity (on which the monthly rate is based) before reductions for retirement before age 55; pre-October 1, 1982, nondeduction service and survivor benefits; or the reduction for an alternative annuity under section 204 of Pub. L 99-335.
(f)
Limitations.
The use of the post-April 6, 1986, average pay is limited to the purposes stated in this section. It may not be used as the basis for computing:
(1) The 80-percent limit on annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8339(f);
(2) The minimum annuity amount under 5 U.S.C. 8339(e) (concerning air traffic controller annuity) or 5 U.S.C. 8339(g) (concerning disability annuity); or
(3) A supplemental annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8344(a).
[52 FR 22434, June 12, 1987, as amended at 79 FR 46619, Aug. 8, 2014]
§ 831.704
Annuities including credit for service with a nonappropriated fund instrumentality.
(a) An annuity that includes credit for service with a nonappropriated fund instrumentality performed after December 31, 1965, based on an election under 5 CFR part 847, subpart D, is computed under 5 CFR part 847, subpart F.
(b) An annuity that includes credit for service with a nonappropriated fund instrumentality based on an election under 5 CFR part 847, subpart H, is computed under 5 CFR part 847, subpart I.

# Subpart H—Nuclear Materials Couriers

# Source:
65 FR 2522, Jan. 18, 2000, unless otherwise noted.
§ 831.801
Applicability and purpose.
(a) This subpart contains regulations of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to supplement 5 U.S.C. 8336(c), which establishes special retirement eligibility for nuclear materials couriers employed under the Civil Service Retirement System; 5 U.S.C. 8334(a)(1) and (c), pertaining to deductions, contributions, and deposits; 5 U.S.C. 8335(b), pertaining to mandatory retirement; and 5 U.S.C. 8339(d), pertaining to computation of annuity.
(b) The regulations in this subpart are issued pursuant to the authority given to OPM in 5 U.S.C. 8347 to prescribe regulations to carry out 5 U.S.C., chapter 83, subchapter III, and in 5 U.S.C. 1104 to delegate authority for personnel management to the heads of agencies.
§ 831.802
Definitions.
In this subpart—
Agency head
means the Secretary of Energy. For purposes of this subpart,
agency head
is also deemed to include the designated representative of the Secretary of Energy, except that the designated representative must be a department headquarters-level official who reports directly to the Secretary of Energy, or to the Deputy Secretary of Energy, and who is the sole such representative for the entire department.
Nuclear materials courier
means an employee of the Department of Energy, the duties of whose position are primarily to transport, and provide armed escort and protection during transit of, nuclear weapons, nuclear weapon components, strategic quantities of special nuclear materials or other materials related to national security, including an employee engaged in this activity who is transferred directly to a supervisory or administrative position within the same Department of Energy organization, after performing this activity for at least 3 years. (See 5 U.S.C. 8331(27).)
Primary duties
are those duties of a position that—
(1)(i) Are paramount in influence or weight; that is, constitute the basic reasons for the existence of the position;
(ii) Occupy a substantial portion of the individual's working time over a typical work cycle; and
(iii) Are assigned on a regular and recurring basis.
(2) Duties that are of an emergency, incidental, or temporary nature cannot be considered
primary
even if they meet the substantial portion of time criterion. In general, if an employee spends an average of at least 50 percent of his or her time performing a duty or group of duties, they are his or her primary duties.
Primary position
means a position that is in an organization of the Department of Energy and whose primary duties are to transport, and provide armed escort and protection during transit of, nuclear weapons, nuclear weapon components, strategic quantities of special nuclear materials or other materials related to national security.
Secondary position
means a position that:
(1) Is clearly in the nuclear materials transportation field;
(2) Is in an organization of the Department of Energy having a nuclear materials transportation mission; and
(3) Is either—
(i) Supervisory; i.e., a position whose primary duties are as a first-level supervisor of nuclear materials couriers in primary positions; or
(ii) Administrative; i.e., an executive, managerial, technical, semiprofessional, or professional position for which experience in a primary nuclear materials courier position is a prerequisite.
§ 831.803
Conditions for coverage in primary positions.
(a) An employee's service in a position that has been determined by the Secretary of the Department of Energy to be a primary nuclear materials courier position is covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8336(c).
(b) An employee who is not in a primary position, nor covered while in a secondary position, and who is detailed or temporarily promoted to a primary position is not covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8336(c).
§ 831.804
Conditions for coverage in secondary positions.
(a) An employee's service in a position that has been determined by the Secretary of the Department of Energy to be a secondary nuclear materials courier position following 3 years of service in a primary nuclear materials courier position is covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8336(c) if all of the following criteria are met:
(1) The employee is transferred directly (
i.e.,
without a break in service exceeding 3 days) from a primary position to a secondary position; and
(2) If applicable, the employee has been continuously employed in secondary positions since transferring from a primary position without a break in service exceeding 3 days, except that a break in employment in secondary positions which begins with an involuntary separation (not for cause), within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 8336(d)(1), is not considered in determining whether the service in secondary positions is continuous for this purpose.
(b) An employee who is not in a primary position, nor covered while in a secondary position, and who is detailed or temporarily promoted to a secondary position is not covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8336(c).
§ 831.805
Evidence.
(a) The Secretary of Energy's determination under § 831.803 that a position is a primary position must be based solely on the official position description of the position in question, and any other official description of duties and qualifications. The official documentation for the position must establish that it satisfies the requirements defined in § 831.802.
(b) A determination under § 831.804 must be based on the official position description and any other evidence deemed appropriate by the agency head for making the determination.
(c) If an employee is in a position not subject to the one-half percent higher withholding rate of 5 U.S.C. 8334(a)(1), and the employee does not, within 6 months after entering the position or after any significant change in the position, formally and in writing seek a determination from the employing agency that his or her service is properly covered by the higher withholding rate, the agency head's determination that the service was not so covered at the time of the service is presumed to be correct. This presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee was unaware of his or her status or was prevented by cause beyond his or her control from requesting that the official status be changed at the time the service was performed.
§ 831.806
Requests from individuals.
(a) An employee who requests credit for service under 5 U.S.C. 8336(c) bears the burden of proof with respect to that service, and must provide the employing agency with all pertinent information regarding duties performed.
(b) An employee who is currently serving in a position that has not been approved as a primary or secondary position, but who believes that his or her service is creditable as service in a primary or secondary position may request the agency head to determine whether or not the employee's current service should be credited and, if it qualifies, whether it should be credited as service in a primary or secondary
position. A written request for current service must be made within 6 months after entering the position or after any significant change in the position.
(c) A current or former employee (or the survivor of a former employee) who believes that a period of past service in an unapproved position qualifies as service in a primary or secondary position and meets the conditions for credit may request the agency head to determine whether or not the employee's past service should be credited and, if it qualifies, whether it should be credited as service in a primary or secondary position. A written request for past service must be made no later than December 31, 2000.
(d) The agency head may extend the time limit for filing under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section when, in the judgment of such agency head, the individual shows that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit.
§ 831.807
Withholdings and contributions.
(a) During the service covered under the conditions established by § 831.803 and § 831.804, the Department of Energy will deduct and withhold from the employee's base pay the amount required under 5 U.S.C. 8334(a) for such positions and submit that amount, together with agency contributions required by 5 U.S.C. 8334(a), to OPM in accordance with payroll office instructions issued by OPM.
(b) If the correct withholdings and/or Government contributions are not submitted to OPM for any reason whatsoever, including cases in which it is finally determined that past service of a current or former employee was subject to the higher deduction and Government contribution rates, the Department of Energy must correct the error by submitting the correct amounts (including both employee and agency shares) to OPM as soon as possible. Even if the Department of Energy waives collection of the overpayment of pay under any waiver authority that may be available for this purpose, such as 5 U.S.C. 5584, or otherwise fails to collect the debt, the correct amount must still be submitted to OPM without delay as soon as possible.
(c) Upon proper application from an employee, former employee or eligible survivor of a former employee, the Department of Energy will pay a refund of erroneous additional withholdings for service that is found not to have been covered service. If an individual has paid to OPM a deposit or redeposit, including the additional amount required for covered service, and the deposit or redeposit is later determined to be erroneous because the service was not covered service, OPM will pay the refund, upon proper application, to the individual, without interest.
(d) The additional employee withholding and agency contribution for covered or creditable service properly made as required under 5 U.S.C. 8334(a)(1) or deposited under 5 U.S.C. 8334(c) are not separately refundable, even in the event that the employee or his or her survivor does not qualify for a special annuity computation under 5 U.S.C. 8339(d).
(e) While an employee who does not hold a primary or secondary position is detailed or temporarily promoted to a primary or secondary position, the additional withholdings and agency contributions will not be made. While an employee who does hold a primary or secondary position is detailed or temporarily promoted to a position which is not a primary or secondary position, the additional withholdings and agency contributions will continue to be made.
§ 831.808
Mandatory separation.
(a) Effective on and after October 17, 1999, the mandatory separation provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8335(b) apply to all nuclear materials couriers in primary and secondary positions. A mandatory separation under 5 U.S.C. 8335(b) is not an adverse action under part 752 of this chapter or a removal action under part 359 of this chapter. Section 831.502 provides the procedures for requesting an exemption from mandatory separation.
(b) In the event an employee is separated mandatorily under 5 U.S.C. 8335(b), or is separated for optional retirement under 5 U.S.C. 8336(c), and OPM finds that all or part of the minimum service required for entitlement to immediate annuity was in a position
which did not meet the requirements of a primary or secondary position and the conditions set forth in this subpart, such separation will be considered erroneous.
§ 831.809
Reemployment.
An employee who has been mandatorily separated under 5 U.S.C. 8335(b) is not barred from reemployment in any position except a primary position after age 60. Service by a reemployed annuitant is not covered by the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8336(c).
§ 831.810
Review of decisions.
The following decisions may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board:
(a) The final decision of the Department of Energy issued to an employee, former employee, or survivor as the result of a request for determination filed under § 831.806; and
(b) The final decision of the Department of Energy that a break in service referred to in § 831.804(a)(2) did not begin with an involuntary separation within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 8336(d)(1).
§ 831.811
Oversight of coverage determinations.
(a) Upon deciding that a position is a nuclear materials courier position, the agency head must notify OPM (Attention: Associate Director for Retirement and Insurance) stating the title of each position, the number of incumbents, and whether the position is primary or secondary. The Director of OPM retains the authority to revoke the agency head's determination that a position is a primary or secondary position, or that an individual's service in any other position is creditable under 5 U.S.C. 8336(c).
(b) The Department of Energy must establish a file containing each coverage determination made by the agency head under § 831.803 and § 831.804, and all background material used in making the determination.
(c) Upon request by OPM, the Department of Energy will make available the entire coverage determination file for OPM to audit to ensure compliance with the provisions of this subpart.
(d) Upon request by OPM, the Department of Energy must submit to OPM a list of all covered positions and any other pertinent information requested.

(b) An employee who is not in a primary position, nor covered while in a secondary position, and who is detailed or temporarily promoted to a primary position is not covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8336(C)
§ 831.904
Conditions for coverage in secondary positions.
(a) An employee's service in a position that has been determined by the employing agency head to be a secondary law enforcement officer or firefighter position is covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8336(c) if all of the following criteria are met:
(1) The employee is transferred directly (i.e., without a break in service exceeding 3 days) from a primary position to a secondary position; and
(2) If applicable, the employee has been continuously employed in secondary positions since transferring from a primary position without a break in service exceeding 3 days, except that a break in employment in secondary positions which begins with an involuntary separation (not for cause), within the meaning of 8336(d)(1) of title 5, United States Code, is not considered in determining whether the service in secondary positions is continuous for this purpose.
(b) This requirement for continuous employment in a secondary position applies only to voluntary breaks in service beginning after January 19, 1988.
(c) An employee who is not in a primary position, nor covered while in a secondary position, and who is detailed or temporarily promoted to a secondary position is not covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8336(c).
(d) The service of an employee who is in a position on January 19, 1988, that has been approved as a secondary position under this subpart will continue to be covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8336(c) as long as the employee remains in that position without a voluntary break in service, and coverage is not revoked by OPM under § 831.911, or by the agency head.
§ 831.905
Evidence.
(a) An agency head's determination that a position is a primary position must be based solely on the official position description of the position in question, and any other official description of duties and qualifications. The official documentation for the position must establish that it satisfies the requirements defined in § 831.902.
(b) A determination under § 831.904 must be based on the official position description and any other evidence deemed appropriate by the agency head for making the determination.
§ 831.906
Requests from individuals.
(a) An employee who requests credit for service under 5 U.S.C. 8336(c) bears the burden of proof with respect to that service, and must provide the employing agency with all pertinent information regarding duties performed, including—
(1) For law enforcement officers, a list of the provisions of Federal criminal law the incumbent is responsible for enforcing and arrests made; and
(2) For firefighters, number of fires fought, names of fires fought, dates of fires, and position occupied while on firefighting duty.
(b) An employee who is currently serving in a position that has not been approved as a primary or secondary position, but who believes that his or her service is creditable as service in a primary or secondary position may request the agency head to determine whether or not the employee's service should be credited and, if it qualifies, whether it should be a primary or secondary position.
(c) A current or former employee (or the survivor of a former employee) who believes that a period of past service in an unapproved position qualifies as service in a primary or secondary position and meets the conditions for credit must follow the procedure in paragraph (b) of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the request must be made to the agency where the claimed service was performed.
(d) For a current or former employee seeking credit under 5 U.S.C. 8336(c) for service performed at an agency that is no longer in existence, and for which there is no successor agency, OPM will accept, directly from the current or former employee (or the survivor of a former employee), a request for a determination as to whether a period of past service qualifies as service in a primary or secondary position and meets the conditions for credit.
(e) Coverage in a position or credit for past service will not be granted for a period greater than 1 year prior to the date that the request from an individual is received under paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section by the employing agency, the agency where past service was performed, or OPM.
(f) An agency head, in the case of a request filed under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, or OPM, in the case of request filed under paragraph (d) of this section, may extend the time limit for filing when, in the judgment of such agency head or OPM, the individual shows that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit.
§ 831.907
Withholdings and contributions.
(a) During the service covered under the conditions established by § 831.903 and § 831.904, the employing agency will deduct and withhold from the employee's base pay the amount required under 5 U.S.C. 8334(a) for such positions and submit that amount, together with agency contributions required by 5 U.S.C. 8334(a), to OPM in accordance with payroll office instructions issued by OPM.
(b) If the correct withholdings and/or Government contributions are not submitted to OPM for any reason whatsoever, including cases in which it is finally determined that past service of a current or former employee was subject to the higher deduction and Government contribution rates, the employing agency must correct the error by submitting the correct amounts (including both employee and agency shares) to OPM as soon as possible. Even if the agency waives collection of the overpayment of pay under any waiver authority that may be available for this purpose, such as 5 U.S.C. 5584, or otherwise fails to collect the debt, the correct amount must still be submitted to OPM without delay as soon as possible.
(c) Upon proper application from an employee, former employee or eligible survivor of a former employee, an employing agency or former employing agency will pay a refund of erroneous additional withholdings for service that is found not to have been covered service. If an individual has paid to OPM a deposit or redeposit, including the additional amount required for covered service, and the deposit or redeposit is later determined to be erroneous because the service was not covered service, OPM will pay the refund, upon proper application, to the individual, without interest.
(d) The additional employee withholding and agency contribution for covered or creditable service properly made as required under 5 U.S.C. 8334(a)(1) or deposited under 5 U.S.C. 8334(c) are not separately refundable, even in the event that the employee or his or her survivor does not qualify for a special annuity computation under 5 U.S.C. 8339(d).
(e) While an employee who does not hold a primary or secondary position is detailed or temporarily promoted to a primary or secondary position, the additional withholdings and agency contributions will not be made. While an employee who does hold a primary or secondary position is detailed or temporarily promoted to a position which is not a primary or secondary position, the additional withholdings and agency contributions will continue to be made.

§ 831.908
Mandatory separation.
(a) The mandatory separation provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8335(b) apply to all law enforcement officers and firefighters in primary and secondary positions. A mandatory separation under section 8335(b) is not an adverse action under part 752 of this chapter or a removal action under part 359 of this chapter. Section 831.502 provides the procedures for requesting an exemption from mandatory separation.
(b) In the event an employee is separated mandatorily under 5 U.S.C. 8335(b), or is separated for optional retirement under 5 U.S.C. 8336(c), and OPM finds that all or part of the minimum service required for entitlement to immediate annuity was in a position which did not meet the requirements of a primary or secondary position and the conditions set forth in this subpart, such separation will be considered erroneous.
[58 FR 64367, Dec. 7, 1993, as amended at 66 FR 38524, July 25, 2001]
§ 831.909
Reemployment.

§ 831.910
Review of decisions.
(a) The final decision of an agency head or OPM issued to an employee, former employee, or survivor as the result of a request for determination filed under § 831.906 may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board.
(b) The final decision of an agency head that a break in service referred to in § 831.904(a)(2) did not begin with an involuntary separation within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 8336(d)(1) may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board.
[66 FR 38524, July 25, 2001]
§ 831.911
Oversight of coverage determinations.
(a) Upon deciding that a position is a law enforcement officer or firefighter position, each agency head must notify OPM (Attention: Associate Director for Retirement and Insurance) stating the title of each position, the number of incumbents, and whether the position is primary or secondary. The Director of OPM retains the authority to revoke an agency head's determination that a position is a primary or secondary position, or that an individual's service in any other position is creditable under 5 U.S.C. 8336(c).
(b) Each agency must establish a file containing each coverage determination made by an agency head under § 831.903 and § 831.904, and all background material used in making the determination.
(c) Upon request by OPM, the agency will make available the entire coverage determination file for OPM to audit to ensure compliance with the provisions of this subpart.
(d) Upon request by OPM, an agency must submit to OPM a list of all covered positions and any other pertinent information requested.
(e) A coverage determination issued by OPM or its predecessor, the Civil Service Commission, will not be reopened by an employing agency, unless the agency head determines that new and material evidence is available that, despite due diligence, was not available before the decision was issued.

This subpart sets out the requirements an employee must meet to qualify for disability retirement, how an employee applies for disability retirement, how an agency applies for disability retirement for an employee, when a disability annuity ends, an individual's retirement rights after the
disability annuity ends, and the effect of reemployment in the Federal service on a disability annuitant.
§ 831.1202
Definitions.
As used in this subpart—
Accommodation
means an adjustment made to an employee's job or work environment that enables the employee to perform the duties of the position. Reasonable accommodation may include modifying the worksite; adjusting the work schedule; restructuring the job; obtaining or modifying equipment or devices; providing interpreters, readers, or personal assistants; and reassigning or retraining the employee.
Basic pay
means the pay an employee receives that is subject to civil service retirement deductions. The definition is the same as the definition of “basic pay” under 5 U.S.C. 8331(3).
Commuting area
means the geographic area that usually constitutes one area for employment purposes. It includes a population center (or two or more neighboring ones) and the surrounding localities in which people live and can reasonably be expected to travel back and forth daily from home to work in their usual employment.
Disabled
and
disability
mean unable or inability, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the employee's current position, or in a vacant position in the same agency at the same grade or pay level for which the individual is qualified for reassignment.
Examination
and
reexamination
mean an evaluation of evidentiary material related to the question of disability. Unless OPM exercises its choice of a physician, the cost of providing medical documentation rests with the employee or disability annuitant, who must provide any information OPM needs to make an evaluation.
Medical condition
means a health impairment resulting from a disease or injury, including a psychiatric disease. This is the same definition of “medical condition” as in § 339.104 of this chapter.
Medical documentation
and
documentation of a medical condition
mean a statement from a licensed physician or other appropriate practitioner that provides information OPM considers necessary to determine an individual's entitlement to benefits under this subpart. Such a statement must meet the criteria set forth in § 339.104 of this chapter.
Permanent position
means an appointment without time limitation.
Physician
and
practitioner
have the same meanings given in § 339.104 of this chapter.
Qualified for reassignment
means able to meet the minimum requirements for the grade and series of the vacant position in question.
Same grade or pay level
means, in regard to a vacant position within the same pay system as the employee currently occupies, the same grade and an equivalent amount of basic pay. A position under a different pay system or schedule is at the “same pay level” if the representative rate, as defined in § 532.401 of this chapter, equals the representative rate of the employee's current position.
Useful and efficient service
means (1) acceptable performance of the critical or essential elements of the position; and (2) satisfactory conduct and attendance.
Vacant position
means an unoccupied position of the same grade or pay level and tenure for which the employee is qualified for reassignment that is located in the same commuting area and is serviced by the same appointing authority of the employing agency. The vacant position must be full time, unless the employee's current position is less than full time, in which case the vacant position must have a work schedule of no less time than that of the current position. In the case of an employee of the United States Postal Service, a vacant position does not include a position in a different craft or a position to which reassignment would be inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement covering the employee.
§ 831.1203
Basic requirements for disability retirement.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the following conditions must be met for an individual to be eligible for disability retirement:
(1) The individual must have completed at least 5 years of civilian service that is creditable under the Civil Service Retirement System.
(2) The individual must, while employed in a position subject to the Civil Service Retirement System, have become disabled because of a medical condition, resulting in a service deficiency in performance, conduct, or attendance, or if there is no actual service deficiency, the disabling medical condition must be incompatible with either useful and efficient service or retention in the position.
(3) The disabling medical condition must be expected to continue for at least 1 year from the date the application for disability retirement is filed.
(4) The employing agency must be unable to accommodate the disabling medical condition in the position held or in an existing vacant position.
(5) An application for disability retirement must be filed with the employing agency before the employee or Member separates from service, or with the former employing agency or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) within 1 year thereafter. This time limit can be waived only in certain instances explained in § 831.1204.
(b) A National Guard technician who is retiring under the special provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8337(h) is not required to meet the conditions given in paragraphs (a) (2), (3), and (4) of this section. Instead, the individual must be disabled for membership in the National Guard or for the military grade required to hold his or her position and meet the other eligibility requirements under 5 U.S.C. 8337(h)(2).

§ 831.1204
Filing disability retirement applications: General.
(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, an application for disability retirement is timely only if it is filed with the employing agency before the employee or Member separates from service, or with the former employing agency or OPM within 1 year thereafter.
(b) An application for disability retirement that is filed with OPM, an employing agency or former employing agency by personal delivery is considered filed on the date on which OPM, the employing agency or former employing agency receives it. The date of filing by facsimile is the date of the facsimile. The date of filing by mail is determined by the postmark date; if no legible postmark date appears on the mailing, the application is presumed to have been mailed 5 days before its receipt, excluding days on which OPM, the employing agency or former employing agency, as appropriate, is closed for business. The date of filing by commercial overnight delivery is the date the application is given to the overnight delivery service.
(c) An application for disability retirement that is filed with OPM or the applicant's former employing agency within 1 year after the employee's separation, and that is incompletely executed or submitted in a letter or other form not prescribed by OPM, is deemed timely filed. OPM will not adjudicate the application or make payment until the application is filed on a form prescribed by OPM.
(d) OPM may waive the 1-year time limit if the employee or Member is mentally incompetent on the date of separation or within 1 year thereafter, in which case the individual or his or her representative must file the application with the former employing agency or OPM within 1 year after the date the individual regains competency or a court appoints a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.
(e) An agency may consider the existence of a pending disability retirement application when deciding whether and when to take other personnel actions. An employee's filing for disability retirement does not require the agency to delay any appropriate personnel action.
[63 FR 17049, Apr. 8, 1998]
§ 831.1205
Agency-filed disability retirement applications.
(a)
Basis for filing an application for an employee.
An agency must file an application for disability retirement of an employee who has 5 years of civilian Federal service when all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The agency has issued a decision to remove the employee;
(2) The agency concludes, after its review of medical documentation, that the cause for unacceptable performance, attendance, or conduct is disease or injury;
(3) The employee is institutionalized, or the agency concludes, based on a review of medical and other information, that the employee is incapable of making a decision to file an application for disability retirement;
(4) The employee has no personal representative or guardian; and
(5) The employee has no immediate family member who is willing to file an application on his or her behalf.
(b)
Agency procedures.
(1) When an agency issues a decision to remove an employee and not all of the conditions described in paragraph (a) of this section have been satisfied, but the removal is based on reasons apparently caused by a medical condition, the agency must advise the employee in writing of his or her possible eligibility for disability retirement.
(2) If the agency is filing a disability retirement application on the employee's behalf, the agency must inform the employee in writing at the same time it informs the employee of its removal decision, or at any time before the separation is effected, that—
(i) The agency is submitting a disability retirement application on the employee's behalf to OPM;
(ii) The employee may review any medical information in accordance with the criteria in § 294.106(d) of this chapter; and
(iii) The action does not affect the employee's right to submit a voluntary application for retirement under this part.
(3) When an agency submits an application for disability retirement to OPM on behalf of an employee, it must provide OPM with copies of the decision to remove, the medical documentation, and any other documents needed to show that the cause for removal is due to a medical condition. Following separation, the agency must provide OPM with a copy of the documentation of the separation.
(c)
OPM procedures.
(1) OPM will not act on any application for disability retirement filed by an agency on behalf on an employee until it receives the appropriate documentation of the separation. When OPM receives a complete application for disability retirement under this section, it will notify the former employee that it has received the application, and that he or she may submit medical documentation. OPM will determine entitlement to disability benefits under § 831.1206.
(2) OPM will cancel any disability retirement when a final decision of an administrative authority or court reverses the removal action and orders the reinstatement of an employee to the agency rolls.
§ 831.1206
Evidence supporting entitlement to disability benefits.
(a)
Evidence to support disability retirement application.
(1) Before OPM determines whether an individual meets the basic requirements for disability retirement under § 831.1203, an applicant for disability retirement or the employing agency must submit to OPM the following forms included in Standard Form 2824, “Documentation in Support of Disability Retirement Application:”
(i) Standard Form 2824A—“Applicant's Statement;”
(ii) Standard Form 2824B—“Supervisor's Statement;”
(iii) Standard Form 2824D—“Agency Certification or Reassignment and Accommodation Efforts;” and
(iv) Standard Form 2824E—“Disability Retirement Application Checklist.”
(2) Standard Form 2824C—“Physician's Statement” and the supporting medical documentation may be submitted directly to OPM.
(3) The applicant, or the employing agency, must also obtain and submit additional documentation as may be required by OPM to determine entitlement to the disability retirement benefit.
(4) Refusal by the applicant, physician, or employing agency to submit the documentation OPM has determined is necessary to decide eligibility for disability retirement is grounds for disallowance of the application.
(b)
OPM procedures for processing a disability retirement application.
(1) OPM
will review the documentation submitted under paragraph (a) of this section in support of an application for disability retirement to determine whether the applicant has met the conditions stated in § 831.1203 of this part. OPM will issue its decision in writing to the applicant and to the employing agency. The decision will include a statement of the findings and conclusions, and an explanation of the right to request consideration under § 831.109 of this part.
(2) OPM may rescind a decision to allow an application for disability retirement at any time if there is an indication of error in the original decision, such as fraud or misstatement of fact, or if additional medical documentation is needed. The written notification will include a statement of the findings and conclusions, and an explanation of the right to request reconsideration under § 831.109 of this part.
(c)
Medical examination.
OPM may offer the applicant a medical examination when it determines that additional medical evidence is necessary to make a decision on an application. The medical evaluation will be conducted by a medical officer of the United States or a qualified physician or board of physicians designated by OPM. The applicant's refusal to submit to an examination is grounds for disallowance of the application.
(d)
Responsibility for providing evidence.
It is the responsibility of the applicant to obtain and submit documentation that is sufficient for OPM to determine whether there is a service deficiency, caused by disease or injury, of sufficient degree to preclude useful and efficient service, or a medical condition that warrants restriction from the critical task or duties of the position held. It is also the responsibility of the disability annuitant to obtain and submit evidence OPM requires to show continuing entitlement to disability benefits.
§ 831.1207
Withdrawal of disability retirement applications.
(a) OPM will honor, without question, an applicant's request to withdraw an employee-filed disability retirement application if it receives the withdrawal request before the employing agency has separated the current employee, or, if the employee has already separated from the service, the withdrawal request is received before the official notice of approval has been issued by OPM. Similarly, OPM will honor, without question, an agency's request to withdraw an agency-filed disability retirement application if it receives the withdrawal request before the employee has separated from the service. Once the request to withdraw the application is accepted, an applicant must reapply to receive any further consideration.
(b) Withdrawal of a disability retirement application does not ensure the individual's continued employment. It is the employing agency's responsibility to determine whether it is appropriate to continue to employ the individual.
(c) OPM considers voluntary acceptance of a permanent position in which the employee has civil service retirement coverage, including a position at a lower grade or pay level, to be a withdrawal of the employee's disability retirement application. The employing agency must notify OPM immediately when an applicant for disability retirement accepts a position of this type.
(d) OPM also considers a disability retirement application to be withdrawn when the agency reports to OPM that it has reassigned an applicant or an employee has refused a reassignment to a vacant position, or the agency reports to OPM that it has successfully accommodated the medical condition in the employee's current position. Placement consideration is limited only by agency authority and can occur after OPM's allowance of the application up to the date of separation for disability retirement. The employing agency must notify OPM immediately if any of these events occur.
(e) After OPM allows a disability retirement application and the employee is separated, the application cannot be withdrawn. However, an individual entitled to a disability annuity may decline to accept all or any part of the annuity under the waiver provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8345(d) or request to be found medically recovered under § 831.1208(e) of this part.
§ 831.1208
Termination of disability annuity because of recovery.
(a) Each annuitant receiving disability annuity from the Fund shall be examined under the direction of OPM at the end of 1 year from the date of disability retirement and annually thereafter until the annuitant becomes 60 years of age unless the disability is found by OPM to be permanent in character. OPM may order a medical or other examination at any time to determine the facts relative to the nature and degree of disability of the annuitant. Failure to submit to reexamination shall result in suspension of annuity.
(b) A disability annuitant may request medical reevaluation under the provisions of this section at any time. OPM will reevaluate the medical condition of disability annuitants age 60 or over only on their own request.
(c) Recovery based on medical documentation. When an examination or reevaluation shows that a disability annuitant has medically recovered from the disability, OPM will terminate the annuity effective on the first day of the month beginning 1 year after the date of the medical examination showing recovery.
(d) Recovery based on reemployment by the Federal Government. Reemployment by an agency at any time before age 60 is evidence of recovery if the reemployment is in a permanent position at the same or higher grade or pay level as the position from which the disability annuitant retired. The permanent position must be full-time unless the position the disability annuitant occupied immediately before retirement was less than full-time, in which case the permanent position must have a work schedule of no less time than that of the position from which the disability annuitant retired. In this instance, OPM needs no medical documentation to find the annuitant recovered. Disability annuity payments will terminate effective on the first day of the month following the month in which the recovery finding is made under this paragraph.
(e) Recovery based on a voluntary request. OPM will honor a written and signed statement of medical recovery voluntarily filed by a disability annuitant when the medical documentation on file does not demonstrate that the annuitant is mentally incompetent. OPM needs no other documentation to find the annuitant recovered. Disability annuity payments will terminate effective on the first day of the month beginning 1 year after the date of the statement. A disability annuitant can withdraw the statement only if the withdrawal is received by OPM before annuity payments terminate.
(f) When an agency reemploys a recovered disability annuitant at any grade or rate of pay within the 1-year period pending termination of the disability retirement benefit under paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section, OPM will terminate the annuity effective on the date of reemployment.
§ 831.1209
Termination of disability annuity because of restoration to earning capacity.
(a)
Restoration to earning capacity.
If a disability annuitant is under age 60 on December 31 of any calendar year and his or her income from wages or self-employment or both during that calendar year equal at least 80 percent of the current rate of basic pay of the position occupied immediately before retirement, the annuitant's earning capacity is considered to be restored. The disability annuity will terminate on the June 30 after the end of the calendar year in which earning capacity is restored. When an agency reemploys a restored disability annuitant at any grade or rate of pay within the 180-day waiting period pending termination of the disability retirement benefit, OPM will terminate the annuity effective on the date of reemployment.
(b)
Current rate of basic pay for the position occupied immediately before retirement.
(1) A disability annuitant's income for a calendar year is compared to the gross annual rate of basic pay in effect on December 31 of that year for the position occupied immediately before retirement. The income for most disability annuitants is based on the rate for the grade and step which reflects the total amount of basic pay (both the grade and step and any additional basic pay) in effect on the date of separation from the agency for disability retirement. Additional basic
pay is included subject to the premium pay restrictions of 5 U.S.C. 5545 (c)(1) and (c)(2). A higher grade and step will be established if it results from using either the date of application for disability retirement or the date of reasonable accommodation, as adjusted by any increases in basic pay that would have been effected between each respective date and the date of final separation. Use of these two alternative pay setting methods is subject to paragraph (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section. The highest grade and step established as a result of setting pay under the normal method and the two alternative methods is designated as the rate of basic pay for the position occupied immediately before retirement and applies only to restoration to earning capacity decisions. In cases involving use of either of the two alternative pay setting methods, the determination of the rate of basic pay for the position occupied immediately before retirement is made by the employing agency at the time the disability retirement is allowed. OPM must review the rate so determined to establish whether the correct rate has been established, and will inform the employee of the proper rate at the time the disability annuity is awarded. This rate of basic pay becomes the basis for all future earning capacity determinations.
(i) The “date of application for disability retirement” is the date the application is signed by the authorized official of the employing agency immediately before forwarding the application to OPM.
(ii) The “date of reasonable accommodation” is the date of the employing agency's notice of reasonable accommodation to an employee's medical condition (as a result of its review of medical documentation) which results in a reduction in the rate of basic pay. The use of the date of reasonable accommodation to establish the rate of basic pay for the position held at retirement is subject to the following conditions:
(A) The date of the employing agency's notice to provide accommodation is no more than 1 year before the date the disability retirement application is signed by the authorized official in the employing agency immediately before forwarding it to OPM; and
(B) A complete record of the date of the personnel decision, the medical documentation substantiating the existence of the medical condition, and the justification for the accommodation is established in writing and included at the time the agency submits the application for disability retirement. OPM will review the record to determine whether the medical documentation demonstrates that the medical condition existed at the time of the accommodation and warranted the accommodation made.
(2) In the case of an annuitant whose basic pay rate on the date determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section did not match a specific grade and step in a pay schedule:
(i) For those retiring from a merit pay position, a position for which a special pay rate is authorized (except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section), or any other position in which the rate of basic pay is not equal to a grade and step in a pay schedule, the grade and step will be established for this purpose at the lowest step in the pay schedule grade that is equal to or greater than the actual rate of basic pay payable. This rule will not be applied when the rate exceeds that of the schedule applicable to the organization from which the individual retired, when there is no existing apposite schedule with grades and steps, or in other organizations which are excluded from coverage of schedules with grades and steps, as in the case of pay systems using pay bands.
(ii) For those retiring with a retained rate of basic pay or from a position for which a special pay rate is in effect but whose rate of basic pay exceeds the highest rate payable in the pay schedule grade applicable to the position held, the grade and step is established for this purpose in the grade in the schedule that is closest to the grade of the position held and within which the amount of the retained pay falls. The step is established for this purpose at the lowest step in that grade which equals or exceeds the actual rate of pay payable.
(iii) When the pay system under which an annuitant retired has been either modified or eliminated since the individual retired, the individual will be treated as if he or she had been employed at their retirement grade and step at the time of the system change, and will be deemed to have been placed under the new system using whatever rules would have been applicable at that time. This will only apply when a pay system has been abolished or modified, and not when the grade and step of a position has been modified subsequent to retirement by reclassification or other action, in which case the grade and step in effect at the time of retirement will control.
(iv) If using the above rules it is not possible to set a grade and step for computing the current rate of pay, then if possible the current rate of pay will be set using the relative position in the range of pay applicable to the position from which the individual retired. For example, if at the time of retirement the rate of pay was $75,000 in a range from $70,000 to $90,000, for all future determinations, the current rate of pay would be 25% up the new pay range from the bottom. If the new range was $96,000 to $120,000, then the new current rate of pay would be $102,000 ($96,000 plus 0.25 times $24,000 ($120,000 minus $96,000)).
(v) In those cases, such as of some former Congressional staff employees and others whose pay is not set under a formal system, where none of the above guidelines will yield a current rate of pay, OPM will ascertain the current rate of pay after consultation with the former employing organization, or successor organization.
(3) For annuitants retiring from the United States Postal Service, only cost-of-living allowances subject to civil service retirement deductions are included in determining the current rate of basic pay of the position held at retirement.
(c)
Income.
Earning capacity for the purposes of this section is demonstrated by an annuitant's ability to earn post-retirement income in a calendar year through personal work efforts or services. The total amount of income from all sources is used to determine earning capacity. This includes income received as gross wages from one or more employers, net earnings from one or more self-employment endeavors, and deferred income that is earned in a calendar year. In determining an annuitant's income for a calendar year, the following considerations apply:
(1) There are two sources of income: wages and self-employment income. All income which is subject to Federal employment taxes (i.e., social security or Medicare taxes) or self-employment taxes constitutes earned income. In addition, any other income as described in this section also constitutes earned income. The determination of whether a disability annuitant earns wages as an employee of an organization or earns income as a self-employed person is based on the usual common law rules applicable in determining the existence of an employer-employee relationship. Whether the relationship exists under the usual common law rules will be determined by OPM after the examination of the particular facts of each case.
(2) Income earned from one source is not offset by losses from another source. Income earned as wages is not reduced by a net loss from self-employment. The net income from each self-employment endeavor is calculated separately, and the income earned as net earnings from one self-employment endeavor is not reduced by a net loss from another self-employment endeavor. The net incomes from each separate self-employment endeavor are added together to determine the total amount of income from self-employment for a calendar year.
(3) Only income earned from personal work efforts or services is considered in determining earning capacity. All forms of non-work-related unearned income are excluded. Paragraph (f) of this section includes a representative list of the types of unearned income that are not considered.
(4) Income earned in a calendar year may only be reduced by certain self-employment business expenses, as provided in paragraph (e) of this section; job-connected expenses incurred because of the disabling condition, as provided in paragraph (g) of this section; and the return from investment
allowance, as provided in paragraph (h) of this section. Once earned, income cannot be reduced by any other means. Thus, income cannot be lowered by such means as leave buy-back provisions, conversion of wages for paid time to leave without pay or a similar non-paid status, reductions in wages attributable to cash shortages or product losses, etc.
(5) For determining annual income from wages or self-employment or both, income is earned in the calendar year the annuitant actually renders the personal work effort or service and either actually or constructively receives the remuneration, except as provided under paragraph (c)(7) of this section. For this purpose, income paid on a regular basis (i.e., on a weekly, bi-weekly, monthly or similar pay period basis) will be deemed earned in the year in which payment is made in the regular course of business.
(6) Deferred income is included as income in the calendar year in which it is constructively received. Income is constructively received when it is credited, set apart, or otherwise made available so that the annuitant may draw upon it at any time, or could draw upon it during the calendar year if the annuitant had given notice of the intent to do so. Deferred income includes all earnings, whether in the form of cash or property or applied to provide a benefit for the employee, which are subject to the disability annuitant's designation or assignment. Usually, the earnings are set aside by a salary-reduction agreement, a deferred compensation arrangement, or the designation of specific earnings amounts towards the purchase of non-taxable employee fringe benefits. Thus, any earnings for which the individual has the opportunity to adjust the amount of income received in a calendar year by controlling the remuneration of voluntarily giving up the right to control the remuneration, regardless of whether a written instrument exists, are income for earning capacity purposes.
(7) The Internal Revenue Code provides exceptions to the general rule on constructive receipt for certain deferred compensation plans which, by their design, defer receipt of income for Federal employment tax purposes as of the later of when services are performed or when there is no substantial risk of forfeiture of the rights to such amount. Even though these special deferred compensation plans defer the constructive receipt of the income for tax purposes to future years beyond the year in which the income is actually earned, the income reflects earning capacity. Therefore, employer contributions and employee payments to these special deferred compensation plans are considered income in the calendar year in which the services are performed, even though the Internal Revenue Code may exclude these contributions and payments from income for tax purposes.
(d)
Wages.
For purposes of earning capacity determinations, the term “wages” means the gross amount of all remuneration for services performed by an employee for his or her employer, unless specifically excluded herein, before any deductions or withholdings.
(1) The name by which the remuneration for services is designated is immaterial. Remuneration includes but is not limited to one-time or recurring—
(i) Base salary or pay; tips; commissions; professional fees; honoraria; bonuses and gift certificates of any type; golden parachute payments; payments for any non-work periods, such as vacation, holiday, or sick pay; pay advances; overtime pay; severance pay; dismissal pay; termination pay; and back pay;
(ii) Deferred income, within the meaning of paragraphs (c) (6) and (7) of this section, or other employer contributions or payments in an arrangement in which the employee has the opportunity (whether exercised or not) to adjust income by recovering the contributions or payments during the calendar year in which earned, for general discretionary income purposes;
(iii) Non-cash wages or payment of in-kind benefits, such as shares of stock in the business, real or personal property, stock in trade, inventory items, goods, lodging, food, and clothing. The valuation for all non-cash wages or other in-kind benefits is determined in a manner consistent with the fair value standards that appear in the Social Security Administration's regulations at 20 CFR 404.1041(d).
(2) Any amount offset or deducted under 5 U.S.C. 8344 is treated as wages if the annuity continues while the annuitant is reemployed by the Federal Government.
(3) As a general rule, remuneration as wages does not include any contribution, payment, benefits furnished, or service provided by an employer in any of the following areas:
(i) The general retirement system established by the employer for its employees, usually either a qualified pension, profit-sharing, stock bonus plan, or a qualified annuity contract plan;
(ii) Medical or hospitalization health benefit plans;
(iii) Life insurance plans;
(iv) Sickness or accident disability pay beyond 6 months of illness, or workers' compensation payments;
(v) The value of meals and lodgings provided at the convenience of the employer;
(vi) Moving expenses;
(vii) Educational assistance programs;
(viii) Dependent care assistance programs;
(ix) Scholarships and fellowship grants;
(x) De minimis fringe benefits, such as items of merchandise given by the employer at holidays which are not readily convertible into cash and courtesy discounts on company products offered not as remuneration for services performed but as a means of promoting good will;
(xi) Qualified group legal services plans;
(xii) Uniforms and tools supplied by the employer, including employer-provided allowances for such items, for the exclusive use by the employee on the job; and
(xiii) Amounts that an employer pays the individual specifically, either as advances or reimbursements, for traveling or other ordinary and necessary expenses incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred in the employer's business.
(4) However, there are two exceptions to this general rule:
(i) When it is provided under circumstances in which either a salary reduction or deferral agreement is used (whether evidenced by a written instrument or otherwise); or
(ii) When the employee had the opportunity (whether exercised or not) to elect to receive the cash value, whether in the form of money or personal or real property, of the employer-provided amount or service.
(e)
Self-employment income.
(1) Self-employment income is the remuneration that is received as an independent contractor, either as
(i) A sole proprietor of a business or farm;
(ii) A professional in one's own practice; or
(iii) A member of a partnership or corporation, as these terms are defined by the Internal Revenue Code, and regardless of whether the business entity is operated for profit.
(2) The term “net earnings” from self-employment in a business enterprise means the gross revenue to the business endeavor from all sources before any other deductions or withholdings, minus
(i) Allowable business expenses, as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section;
(ii) Any job-connected disability expenses, as provided in paragraph (g) of this section; and
(iii) Any return from investment allowance, as provided in paragraph (h) of this section.
(3) Certain expenses of a self-employed business entity may be offset from the gross revenue from all sources of that self-employed business in determining the amount of net earnings for a particular calendar year. Expenses which may be deducted are only those items and costs which are permitted by the Internal Revenue Code for income tax purposes as ordinary and necessary to the operation of the business. However, expenses incurred on behalf of the disability annuitant may not be deducted, regardless of whether they are permitted by the Internal Revenue Code. These expenses that are incurred but cannot be deducted include the costs for wages paid to the individual, interest earnings, guaranteed payments, dividends, employee benefits, pension plans, and salary reduction or deferral plans. Also, self-employed disability annuitants may not deduct the
costs of other withdrawals or expenses which are not used solely for business purposes. Examples of items that cannot be deducted if used at all for personal use by the self-employed disability annuitant include personal property items, such as automobiles and boats; real property, such as vacation property or residences; and memberships, dues, or fees for professional associations or public or private organizations or clubs.
(4) Fees paid to an annuitant as a director of a corporation are a part of net earnings from self-employment.
(f)
Income not included.
Other types of income not considered in determining earning capacity include—
(1) Investment income, such as interest or dividends from savings accounts, stocks, personal loans or home mortgages held, unless the disability annuitant receives the return from capital investment in the course of his or her trade or business;
(2) Capital gains from sales of real or personal property that the disability annuitant owns, unless received in the course of his or her trade or business:
(3) Rents or royalties, unless received in the course of his or her trade or business;
(4) Distributions from pension plans, annuity plans, Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA's), Simplified Employee Benefit-IRA's (SEP-IRA's), Keogh Accounts, employee stock ownership plans, profit sharing plans, or deferred income payments that are received by the annuitant in any year after the calendar year in which the funds were contributed to the plan;
(5) Income earned before the commencing date of civil service retirement annuity payments;
(6) Scholarships or fellowships;
(7) Proceeds from life insurance, inheritances, estates, trusts, endowments, gifts, prizes, awards, gambling or lottery winnings, and amounts received in court actions whether by verdict or settlement, unless received in the course of their trade or business;
(8) Unemployment compensation under State or Federal law, supplemental unemployment benefits, or workers' compensation:
(9) Alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments received;
(10) Pay for jury duty; and
(11) Entitlement payments from other Federal agencies, such as benefits from the Social Security Administration or the Veterans Administration, Railroad Retirement System retirement pay, or military retirement pay.
(g)
Job-connected expenses incurred because of the disabling condition may be deducted from income.
(1) Job-connected expenses deductible from income for purposes of determining earning capacity are those expenses that are primarily for and essential to the annuitant's occupation or business and are directly connected with or result from the disability for which the disability annuity was allowed.
(2) The determination of whether a job-connected expense may be deducted from income is governed by the following considerations:
(i) The expense must be directly attributable to the disability and must be one which would not have been incurred in the absence of the annuitant working in his or her business or occupation. Expenses incurred for the preservation of the annuitant's health, alleviation of his or her physical or mental discomfort, or other expenses of an employed person cannot be deducted.
(ii) The disability must be of such severity that it requires the annuitant to use special means of transportation, services, or equipment to perform the duties of the occupation or business. Examples of such disabilities include blindness, paraplegia, multiple sclerosis, and cerebral hemorrhage. Claims involving transportation or equipment may be deducted only in the amount normally allowed for business expenses or as depreciation by the Internal Revenue Service for Federal income tax purposes.
(iii) Claims involving services performed by a family member or other individual directly employed by the annuitant may be deducted only if a true employer-employee relationship exists between the annuitant and the employed individual, and the amount claimed as an expense does not exceed the local market rate of payment to individuals who provide similar services. It is the responsibility of the annuitant to provide evidence demonstrating that
an employer-employee relationship exists, and what the local market rate is for such services. For the purpose of this paragraph, to establish that a true employer-employee relationship exists, the annuitant must provide evidence that all statutorily mandated employment requirements are met, including (but not limited to) income tax withholdings, FICA tax deductions and payments, and unemployment insurance. If the annuitant fails to provide evidence of the local market rate for such services, payments may be deducted only if the amount claimed does not exceed the Federal minimum hourly rate in effect on December 31 of the calendar year in which claimed. Absent evidence that it is customary and regular practice in the local labor market to work more hours per week, payment may not be deducted for services provided by an individual in excess of 40 hours a week.
(3) A job-connected expense can be deducted only in the calendar year in which paid.
(4) Claims for items used for both personal and job-related purposes may be deducted only by the prorated amount attributable to the job-related use.
(5) A job-connected expense may not be deducted from income from self-employment if the expense has already been deducted as a business expense.
(6) It is the responsibility of the annuitant claiming job-connected expense to provide adequate documentation to substantiate the amount claimed. Adequate documentation will generally include the following information:
(i) Written recommendation of a physician, vocational rehabilitation specialist, occupational health resource specialist, or other similar professional specialist that the retiree should use the transportation, services, or equipment;
(ii) A description of the item and an explanation of its use by the annuitant in the performance of his or her occupation or business;
(iii) A copy of the receipt of purchase, bill of sale, or leasing agreement for the item claimed with the date, duration of the agreement, and agreed upon price clearly specified;
(iv) A complete supporting explanation of how the amount claimed for the job-connected expense has been calculated; and
(v) An explanation of the circumstances and calculation of the prorated cost of the item if used for both personal and business use.
(h)
Return from investment allowance.
A disability annuitant may reduce the net earnings from a self-employed business endeavor (adjusted for any interest paid on borrowed capital) by 6 percent of his or her capital investment in that business, owned or borrowed. The capital investment's value is its fair-market value as of December 31 of the year for which the income is being reported.
(i)
Requirement to report income.
All disability annuitants who, on December 31 of any calendar year, are under age 60 must report to OPM their income from wages or self-employment or both for that calendar year. Each year as early as possible, OPM will send a form to annuitants to use in reporting their income from the previous calendar year. The form specifies the date by which OPM must receive the report. OPM will determine entitlement to continued annuity on the basis of the report. If an annuitant fails to submit the report, OPM may stop annuity payments until it receives the report.
§ 831.1210
Annuity rights after a disability annuity terminates.
(a) An individual is entitled to an immediate annuity when the disability annuity stops because of recovery or restoration to earning capacity if the individual is not reemployed in a position subject to civil service retirement coverage and—
(1) Is at least age 50 when the disability annuity stops and had 20 or more years of service at the time of retirement for disability; or
(2) Had 25 or more years of service at the time of retirement for disability regardless of age.
(b) An individual whose annuity stops because of recovery or restoration to earning capacity and who is not eligible for an immediate annuity under paragraph (a) of this section, is
eligible for a deferred annuity upon reaching age 62.
(c) The disability annuity of an individual whose annuity stopped because of recovery or restoration to earning capacity may be reinstated under § 831.1212 of this part.
§ 831.1211
Reinstatement of disability annuity.
(a) When a disability annuity stops, the individual must again prove that he or she meets the eligibility requirements in order to have the annuity reinstated.
(b) When a recovered disability annuitant under age 62 whose annuity was terminated because he or she was found recovered on the basis of medical evidence (§ 831.1208(b)), is not reemployed in a position subject to civil service retirement coverage, and, based on the results of a current medical examination, OPM finds that the individual's medical condition has worsened since the finding of recovery and that the original disability on which retirement was based has recurred, OPM will reinstate the disability annuity. The right to the reinstated annuity begins with the date of the medical examination showing that the disability recurred.
(c) OPM will reinstate the disability annuity of a recovered disability annuitant under age 62 whose annuity was terminated because he or she was found recovered on the basis of Federal reemployment (§ 831.1208(c)) when—
(1) The results of a current medical examination show that the disabling medical condition that was the basis of the disability retirement continues to exist; and
(2) Within 1 year after the date of reemployment, this medical condition has again caused the individual to be unable to provide useful and efficient service, and the employee has been—
(i) Separated and not reemployed in a position subject to civil service retirement coverage; or
(ii) Placed in a position that results in a reduction in grade or pay below the grade from which the individual retired, or in a change to a non-permanent position. The right to the reinstated annuity begins with the date of the medical examination showing that the disabling medical condition continues to exist, but not earlier than the first day after separation, or the effective date of the placement in the position which results in a reduction in grade or pay or change to a non-permanent position.
(d) When a recovered disability annuitant under age 62 whose annuity was terminated because he or she was found recovered on the basis of a voluntary request (§ 831.1208(e)), is not reemployed in a position subject to civil service retirement coverage, and, based on the results of a current medical examination, OPM finds that the disability has recurred, OPM will reinstate the disability annuity. The right to the reinstated annuity begins with the date of the medical examination showing that the disability recurred, but not earlier than 1 year before the date the request for reinstatement is received by OPM.
(e) When a disability annuitant whose earning capacity has been restored but who is not reemployed in a position in which he or she is subject to civil service retirement coverage, and who (except in the case of a National Guard technician whose annuity was awarded under 5 U.S.C. 8337(h)), has not recovered from the disability for which retired, loses his or her earning capacity, as determined by OPM, before reaching age 62, OPM will reinstate the disability annuity. The reinstated annuity is payable from January 1 of the year following the calendar year in which earning capacity was lost. Earning capacity is lost if, during any calendar year, the individual's income from wages or self-employment or both is less than 80 percent of the current rate of basic pay of the position held at retirement.
(f) A reinstated annuity is the same type as the original annuity and is paid at the rate of annuity to which the annuitant was entitled on the date his or her disability annuity was last discontinued.
(g) Reinstatement of the disability annuity ends the right to any other annuity based on the same service, unless the annuitant makes a written election to receive the other annuity instead of the disability annuity.
(h) When OPM reinstates an employee's disability annuity, the agency must offset the employee's pay by the
amount of annuity allocable to the period of employment, unless the annuitant is exempted from this requirement under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8344(i). The offset begins on the date of OPM's determination of eligibility for reinstatement. OPM must reduce any retroactive payment of annuity for a period of employment with an agency before that date by the amount of pay earned during that period.
(i) When an individual's annuity is terminated upon reemployment (subject to subchapter III of chapter 83, title 5, United States Code), OPM must determine the individual's future annuity rights under the law in effect at the date of his or her subsequent separation. If, upon separation from such reemployment, the individual does not meet the eligibility requirements under subchapter III of chapter 83, title 5, United States Code, for title to annuity based on such separation, OPM will resume payment of the terminated annuity at the rate last payable, unless payment is otherwise barred.

(1) The reason for and the amount of the debt;
(2) The date on which the full payment is due;
(3) OPM's policy on interest, penalties, and administrative charges;
(4) If payment in full would create financial hardship to the debtor and offset is available, the types of payment(s) to be offset, the repayment schedule, the right to request an adjustment in the repayment schedule and the right to request a voluntary repayment agreement in lieu of offset;
(5) The individual's right to inspect and/or receive a copy of the Government's records relating to the debt;

(b)
Requests for reconsideration, waiver, and/or compromise.
(1) If a request for reconsideration, waiver and/or compromise is returned to us by mail, it must be postmarked within 30 calendar days of the date of the notice detailed in paragraph (a) of this section. If a request for reconsideration, waiver, and/or compromise is hand delivered, it must be received within 30 calendar days of the date of the notice detailed in paragraph (a) of this section. OPM may extend the 30 day time limit for filing when individuals can prove that they: (i) Were not notified of the time limit and were not otherwise aware of it; or (ii) were prevented by circumstances beyond their control from making the request within the time limit.
(2) When a request for reconsideration, waiver, and/or compromise covered by this paragraph is properly filed before the death of the debtor, it will be processed to completion unless the relief sought is nullified by the debtor's death.
(3) Individuals requesting reconsideration, waiver, and/or compromise will be given a full opportunity to present any pertinent information and documentation supporting their position.
(4) An individual's request for waiver will be evaluated on the basis of the standards set forth in subpart N of this part. An individual's request for compromise will be evaluated on the basis of standards set forth in the FCCS (4 CFR part 103).
(c)
Reconsideration, waiver, and/or compromise decisions.
(1) OPM's decision will be based upon the individual's written submissions, evidence of record, and other pertinent available information.
(2) After consideration of all pertinent information, a written decision will be issued. The decision will state the extent of the individual's liability, and, for waiver and compromise requests, whether the debt will be waived or compromised. If the individual is determined to be liable for all or a portion of the debt, the decision will reaffirm or modify the conditions for the collection previously proposed under paragraph (a) of this section. The decision will state the individual's right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board as provided by § 1201.3 of this title, and, in the case of a denial of waiver, that a timely appeal will stop collection of the debt.
§ 831.1305
Collection of debts.
(a)
Means of collection.
Collection of a debt may be made by means of offset under § 831.1306, or under any statutory provision providing for offset of money due the debtor from the Federal Government, or by referral to the Justice Department for litigation, as provided in § 831.1306. Referral may also be made to a collection agency under the provisions of the FCCS.
(b)
Additional charges.
Interest, penalties, and administrative costs will be assessed on the debt in accordance with standards established in the FCCS at 4 CFR 102.13. Additional charges will be waived when required by the FCCS. In addition, such charges may be waived when OPM determines—
(1) Collection would be against equity and good conscience under the standards prescribed in §§ 831.1403 through 831.1405 of this part; or
(2) Waiver would be in the best interest of the United States.
(c)
Collection in installments.
Whenever feasible, debts will be collected in one lump sum. However, when the debtor is financially unable to pay in one lump sum of fails to respond to a demand for full payment and off-set is available, installment payments may be effected. The amount of the installment payments will be set in accordance with the criteria in 4 CFR 102.11.
(d)
Commencement of collection.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, collection will begin after the time limits for requesting further rights stated in § 831.1304(a)(6) expire or OPM has issued decisions on all timely requests for those rights and the Merit Systems Protection Board has acted on any timely appeal of a waiver denial, unless: (i) Failure to make an offset would substantially prejudice the Government's ability to collect the debt; and (ii) the time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of the proceedings in § 831.1304 or litigation. When offset begins without completion of the administrative review process, these procedures will be completed promptly, and amounts recovered by offset but later found not owed will be refunded promptly.
(2) The procedures identified in § 831.1304 will not be applied when the debt is caused by (i) a retroactive adjustment in the periodic rate of annuity or any deduction taken from annuity when the adjustment is a result of the annuitant's election of different entitlements under law, if the adjustment is made within 120 days of the effective date of the election; or (ii) interim, estimated payments made before the formal determination of entitlement to annuity, if the amount is recouped from the total annuity payable on the first day of the month following the last advance payment or the date the formal determination is made, whichever is later.
§ 831.1306
Collection by administrative offset.
(a)
Offset from retirement payments.
A debt may be collected in whole or in part from lump-sum retirement payment or recurring annuity payments.
(b)
Offset from other payments
—(1)
Administrative offset.
(i) A debt may be offset from other payments due the debtor from other agencies in accordance with 4 CFR 102.3, except that offset from back pay awarded under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5596 (and 5 CFR 550.801
et seq.
) will be made in accordance with § 550.805(e)(2) of this chapter.
(ii) In determining whether to collect claims by means of administrative offset after the expiration of the six year limitation provided in 5 U.S.C. 2415, the Director or his designee will determine the cost effectiveness of leaving a claim unresolved for more than 6 years. This decision will be based on such factors as the amount of the debt; the cost of collection; and the likelihood of recovering the debt.
(2)
Salary offset.
When the debtor is an employee, or a member of the Armed Forces or a reserve component of the Armed Forces, OPM may effect collection action by offset of the debtor's pay in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR 550.1101
et seq.
Due process described in § 831.1304 will apply. The questions of fact and liability, and entitlements to waiver or compromise determined through that process are deemed correct and will not be amended under salary offset procedures. When the debtor did not receive a hearing on the amount of the offset under § 831.1304 and requests such hearing, one
will be conducted in accordance with subpart K of part 550 of this chapter.
§ 831.1307
Use of consumer reporting agencies.
(a)
Notice.
If a debtor's response to the notice described in § 831.1304(a) does not result in payment in full, payment by offset, or payment in accordance with a voluntary repayment agreement or other repayment schedule acceptable to OPM, and the debtor's rights under § 831.1304 have been exhausted, OPM may report the debtor to a consumer reporting agency. In addition, a debtor's failure to make subsequent payments in accordance with a repayment schedule may result in a report to a consumer reporting agency. Before making a report to a consumer reporting agency, OPM will notify the debtor in writing that—
(1) The payment is overdue;
(2) OPM intends, after 60 days, to make a report as described in paragraph (b) of this section to a consumer reporting agency;
(3) The debtor's right to dispute the liability has been exhausted under § 831.1304; and
(4) The debtor may suspend OPM action on referral by paying the debt in one lump sum or making payments current under a repayment schedule.
(b)
Report.
When a debtor's response to the notice described in paragraph (a) of this section fails to comply with paragraph (a)(4) of this section and 60 days have elapsed since the notice was mailed, OPM may report to a consumer reporting agency that an individual is responsible for an unpaid debt and provide the following information:
(1) The individual's name, address, taxpayer identification number, and any other information necessary to establish the identity of the individual;
(2) The amount, status, and history of the debt; and
(3) The fact that the debt arose in connection with the administration of the Civil Service Retirement System.
(c)
Subsequent reports.
OPM will update its report to the consumer reporting agency whenever it has knowledge of events that substantially change the status or the amount of the liability.
§ 831.1308
Referral to a collection agency.
(a) OPM may refer certain debts to commercial collection agencies under the following conditions:
(1) All processing required by § 831.1304 has been completed before the debt is released.
(2) A contract for collection services has been negotiated.
(3) OPM retains the responsibility for resolving disputes, compromising claims, referring the debt for litigation, or suspending or terminating collection action.
§ 831.1309
Referral for litigation.
From time to time and in a manner consistent with the General Accounting Office's and the Justice Department's instructions, OPM will refer certain overpayments to the Justice Department for litigation. Referral for litigation will suspend processing under this subpart.

# Subpart N—Standards for Waiver of Overpayments

# Source:
45 FR 23635, Apr. 8, 1980, unless otherwise noted.
§ 831.1401
Conditions for waiver.
Recovery of an overpayment from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund may be waived pursuant to section 8346(b), of title 5, United States Code, when the annuitant (a) is without fault and (b) recovery would be against equity and good conscience. Where it has been determined that the recipient of an overpayment is ineligible for waiver, the individual is nevertheless entitled to an adjustment in the recovery schedule if he/she shows that it would cause him/her financial hardship to make payment at the rate scheduled.
§ 831.1402
Fault.
A recipient of an overpayment is without fault if he/she performed no act of commission or omission which resulted in the overpayment. The fact
that the Office of Personnel Management may have been at fault in initiating an overpayment will not necessarily relieve the individual from liability.
(a)
Considerations.
Pertinent considerations in finding fault are—
(1) Whether payment resulted from the individual's incorrect but not necessarily fraudulent statement, which he/she should have known to be incorrect;
(2) Whether payment resulted from the individual's failure to disclose material facts in his/her possession which he/she should have known to be material; or
(3) Whether he/she accepted a payment which he/she knew or should have known to be erroneous.
(b)
Mitigation factors.
The individual's age, physical and mental condition or the nature of the information supplied to him/her by OPM or a Federal agency may mitigate against finding fault if one or more contributed to his/her submission of an incorrect statement, a statement which did not disclose material facts in his/her possession, or his/her acceptance of an erroneous overpayment.
§ 831.1403
Equity and good conscience.
(a)
Defined.
Recovery is against equity and good conscience when—
(1) It would cause financial hardship to the person from whom it is sought;
(2) The recipient of the overpayment can show (regardless of his or her financial circumstances) that due to the notice that such payment would be made or because of the incorrect payment either he/she has relinquished a valuable right or changed positions for the worse; or
(3) Recovery could be unconscionable under the circumstances.
§ 831.1404
Financial hardship.
Financial hardship may be deemed to exist in—but not limited to—those situations where the annuitant from whom collection is sought needs substantially all of his/her current income and liquid assets to meet current ordinary and necessary living expenses and liabilities.
(a)
Considerations.
Some pertinent considerations in determining whether recovery would cause financial hardship are as follows:
(1) The individual's financial ability to pay
at the time collection is scheduled to be made.
(2) Income to other family member(s), if such member's ordinary and necessary living expenses are included in expenses reported by the annuitant.
(b)
Exemptions.
Assets exempt from execution under State law should not be considered in determining an individual's ability to repay the indebtedness, rather primary emphasis shall be placed upon the annuitant's liquid assets and current income in making such determinations.
§ 831.1405
Ordinary and necessary living expenses.
An individual's ordinary and necessary living expenses include rent, mortgage payments, utilities, maintenance, food, clothing, insurance (life, health and accident), taxes, installment payments, medical expenses, support expenses when the annuitant is legally responsible, and other miscellaneous expenses which the individual can establish as being ordinary and necessary.
§ 831.1406
Waiver precluded.
(a)
When not granted.
Waiver of an overpayment cannot be granted when—
(1) The overpayment was obtained by fraud; or
(2) The overpayment was made to an estate.
§ 831.1407
Burdens of proof.
(a)
Burden of OPM.
The Associate Director for Compensation must establish by the preponderance of the evidence that an overpayment occurred.
(b)
Burden of annuitant.
The recipient of an overpayment must establish by substantial evidence that he/she is eligible for waiver or an adjustment.

§ 831.1602
Definitions.
In this subpart—
Agency head
means the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. For purposes of an approval of coverage under this subpart, agency head is also deemed to include the designated representative of the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), except that the designated representative must be a department headquarters-level official who reports directly to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, or to the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, and who is the sole such representative for the entire department. For the purposes of a denial of coverage under this subpart, agency head is also deemed to include the designated representative of the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security at any level within the Department of Homeland Security.
Customs and border protection officer
means an employee in the Department of Homeland Security occupying a position within the Customs and Border Protection Officer (GS-1895) job series (determined applying the criteria in effect as of September 1, 2007) or any successor position, and whose duties include activities relating to the arrival and departure of persons, conveyances, and merchandise at ports of entry. Also included in this definition is an employee engaged in this activity who is transferred directly to a supervisory or administrative position in the Department of Homeland Security after performing such duties in 1 or more positions within the GS-1895 job series (determined applying the criteria in effect as of September 1, 2007), or any successor position, for at least 3 years.
First-level supervisors
are employees classified as supervisors who have direct and regular contact with the employees they supervise. First-level supervisors do not have subordinate supervisors. A first-level supervisor may occupy a primary position or a secondary position if the appropriate definition is met.
Primary position
means a position classified within the Customs and Border Protection Officer (GS-1895) job series (determined applying the criteria in effect as of September 1, 2007) or any successor position whose duties include the performance of work directly connected with activities relating to the arrival and departure of persons, conveyances, and merchandise at ports of entry.
Secondary position
means a position within the Department of Homeland Security that is either—
(1) Supervisory; i.e., a position whose primary duties are as a first-level supervisor of customs and border protection officers in primary positions; or
(2) Administrative; i.e., an executive, managerial, technical, semiprofessional, or professional position for which experience in a primary customs and border protection officer position is a prerequisite.
§ 831.1603
Conditions for coverage in primary positions.
(a) An employee's service in a position that has been determined by the employing agency head to be a primary customs and border protection officer position is covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8336(c).
(b) An employee who is not in a primary position, nor covered while in a secondary position, and who is detailed or temporarily promoted to a primary
position is not covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8336(c) for any purpose under this subpart.
§ 831.1604
Conditions for coverage in secondary positions.
(a) An employee's service in a position that has been determined by the employing agency head to be a secondary position is covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8336(c) if all of the following criteria are met:
(1) The employee is transferred directly (i.e., without a break in service exceeding 3 days) from a primary position to a secondary position; and
(2) The employee has completed 3 years of service in a primary position, including a position for which no CSRS deductions were withheld; and
(3) If applicable, the employee has been continuously employed in secondary positions since transferring from a primary position without a break in service exceeding 3 days, except that a break in employment in secondary positions which begins with an involuntary separation (not for cause), within the meaning of 8336(d)(1) of title 5, United States Code, is not considered in determining whether the service in secondary positions is continuous for this purpose.
(b) For the purpose of applying the criteria at paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section to evaluate transfers, service, and employment periods that occurred before September 1, 2007—
(1) A primary position is deemed to include:
(i) A position whose duties included the performance of work directly connected with activities relating to the arrival and departure of persons, conveyances, and merchandise at ports of entry that was classified within the Immigration Inspector Series (GS-1816), Customs Inspector Series (GS-1890), Canine Enforcement Officer Series (GS-1801), or any other series which the agency head determines were predecessor series to the Customs and Border Protection Series (GS-1895), and that would have been classified under the GS-1895 series had it then existed; and
(ii) A position within the Customs and Border Protection Series (GS-1895) whose duties included the performance of work directly connected with activities relating to the arrival and departure of persons, conveyances, and merchandise at ports of entry.
(2) A secondary position is deemed to include:
(i) A first-level supervisor of an employee in a position described at paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section; or
(ii) An executive, managerial, technical, semiprofessional, or professional position for which experience in a position described at paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section is a mandatory prerequisite.
(c) An employee who is not in a primary position, nor covered while in a secondary position, and who is detailed or temporarily promoted to a secondary position is not covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8336(c) for any purpose under this subpart.
§ 831.1605
Evidence.
(a) An agency head's determination under §§ 831.1603(a) and 831.1604(a) must be based solely on the official position description of the position in question and any other official description of duties and qualifications.
(b) If an employee is in a position not subject to the one-half percent higher withholding rate of 5 U.S.C. 8334(c), and the employee does not, within 6 months after entering the position or after any significant change in the position, formally and in writing seek a determination from the employing agency that his position is properly covered by the higher withholding rate, the agency head's determination that the service was not so covered at the time of the service is presumed to be correct. This presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee was unaware of his or her status or was prevented by cause beyond his or her control from requesting that the official status be changed at the time the service was performed.
§ 831.1606
Requests from individuals.
(a) An employee who requests credit for service under 5 U.S.C. 8336(c) bears the burden of proof with respect to
that service, and must provide the employing agency with all pertinent information regarding duties performed.
(b) An employee who is currently serving in a position that has not been approved as a primary or secondary position, but who believes that his or her service is creditable as service in a primary or secondary position may request the agency head to determine whether or not the employee's current service should be credited and, if it qualifies, whether it should be credited as service in a primary or secondary position. A written request for current service must be made within 6 months after entering the position or after any significant change in the position.
(c) A current or former employee (or the survivor of a former employee) who believes that a period of past service in an unapproved position qualifies as service in a primary or secondary position and meets the conditions for credit may request the agency head to determine whether or not the employee's past service should be credited and, if it qualifies, whether it should be credited as service in a primary or secondary position. A written request for past service must be made no later than June 30, 2012.
(d) The agency head may extend the time limit for filing under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section when, in the judgment of such agency head, the individual shows that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit.
§ 831.1607
Withholdings and contributions.
(a) During the service covered under the conditions established by § 831.1603 and § 831.1604, the Department of Homeland Security will deduct and withhold from the employee's base pay the amount required under 5 U.S.C. 8334(a) for such positions and submit that amount, together with agency contributions required by 5 U.S.C. 8334(a), to OPM in accordance with payroll office instructions issued by OPM.
(b) If the correct withholdings and/or Government contributions are not submitted to OPM for any reason whatsoever, the Department of Homeland Security must correct the error by submitting the correct amounts (including both employee and agency shares) to OPM as soon as possible. Even if the Department of Homeland Security waives collection of the overpayment of pay under any waiver authority that may be available for this purpose, such as 5 U.S.C. 5584, or otherwise fails to collect the debt, the correct amount must still be submitted to OPM without delay as soon as possible.
(c) Upon proper application from an employee, former employee or eligible survivor of a former employee, the Department of Homeland Security will pay a refund of erroneous additional withholdings for service that is found not to have been covered service. If an individual has paid to OPM a deposit or redeposit, including the additional amount required for covered service, and the deposit or redeposit is later determined to be erroneous because the service was not covered service, OPM will pay the refund, upon proper application, to the individual, without interest.
(d) The additional employee withholding and agency contribution for covered or creditable service properly made as required under 5 U.S.C. 8334(a)(1) or deposited under 5 U.S.C. 8334(c) are not separately refundable, even in the event that the employee or his or her survivor does not qualify for a special annuity computation under 5 U.S.C. 8339(d).
(e) While an employee who does not hold a primary or secondary position is detailed or temporarily promoted to a primary or secondary position, the additional withholdings and agency contributions will not be made. While an employee who does hold a primary or secondary position is detailed or temporarily promoted to a position which is not a primary or secondary position, the additional withholdings and agency contributions will continue to be made.
§ 831.1608
Mandatory separation.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the mandatory separation provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8335(b) apply to customs and border protection officers appointed in primary and secondary positions. A mandatory separation under section 8335(b) is not an adverse action under part 752 of this
chapter or a removal action under part 359 of this chapter. Section 831.502 provides the procedures for requesting an exemption from mandatory separation.
(b) In the event an employee is separated mandatorily under 5 U.S.C. 8335(b), or is separated for optional retirement under 5 U.S.C. 8336(c), and OPM finds that all or part of the minimum service required for entitlement to immediate annuity was in a position which did not meet the requirements of a primary or secondary position and the conditions set forth in this subpart, such separation will be considered erroneous.
(c) The customs and border protection officer mandatory separation provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8335(b) do not apply to an individual first appointed as a customs and border protection officer before July 6, 2008.
§ 831.1609
Reemployment.
An employee who has been mandatorily separated under 5 U.S.C. 8335(b) is not barred from reemployment in any position except a primary position after age 60. Service by a reemployed annuitant is not covered by the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8336(c).
§ 831.1610
Review of decisions.
(a) The final decision of the agency head issued to an employee as the result of a request for determination filed under § 831.1606 may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board.
(b) The final decision of the agency head denying an individual coverage while serving in an approved secondary position because of failure to meet the conditions in § 831.1604(a) may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board.
§ 831.1611
Oversight of coverage determinations.
(a) Upon deciding that a position is a customs and border protection officer position, the agency head must notify OPM (Attention: Associate Director, Retirement Services, or such other official as may be designated) stating the title of each position, occupational series, position description number (or other unique identifier), the number of incumbents, and whether the position is primary or secondary. The Director of OPM retains the authority to revoke the agency head's determination that a position is a primary or secondary position.
(b) The Department of Homeland Security must establish and maintain a file containing all coverage determinations made by the agency head under § 831.1603 and § 831.1604, and all background material used in making the determination.
(c) Upon request by OPM, the Department of Homeland Security will make available the entire coverage determination file for OPM to audit to ensure compliance with the provisions of this subpart.
(d) Upon request by OPM, the Department of Homeland Security must submit to OPM a list of all covered positions and any other pertinent information requested.
§ 831.1612
Elections of Retirement Coverage, exclusions from retirement coverage, and proportional annuity computations.
(a)
Elections of coverage.
(1) The Department of Homeland Security must provide an employee who is a customs and border protection officer on December 26, 2007, the opportunity to elect not to be treated as a customs and border protection officer under section 535(a) and (b) of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2008, Public Law 110-161, 121 Stat. 2042.
(2) An election under this paragraph (a) is valid only if made on or before June 22, 2008.
(3) An individual eligible to make an election under this paragraph who fails to make such an election on or before June 22, 2008, is deemed to have elected to be treated as a customs and border protection officer for retirement purposes.
(b)
Exclusion from coverage.
The provisions of this subpart and any other specific reference to customs and border protection officers in this part do not apply to employees who on December 25, 2007, were law enforcement officers under subpart I of this part or subpart H of part 842 within U.S. Customs and
Border Protection. These employees cannot elect to be treated as a customs and border protection officer under paragraph (a) of this section, nor can they be deemed to have made such an election.
(c)
Proportional annuity computation.
The annuity of an employee serving in a primary or secondary customs and border protection officer position on July 6, 2008, must, to the extent that its computation is based on service rendered as a customs and border protection officer on or after that date, be at least equal to the amount that would be payable—
(1) To the extent that such service is subject to the Civil Service Retirement System, by applying section 8339(d) of title 5, United States Code, with respect to such service; and
(2) To the extent such service is subject to the Federal Employees' Retirement System, by applying section 8415(d) of title 5, United States Code, with respect to such service.

(a) Phased employment is effective the first day of the first pay period beginning after phased employment is approved by the authorized agency official under § 831.1713(a), or the first day of a later pay period specified by the employee with an authorized agency official's concurrence.
(b) The commencing date of a phased retirement annuity (i.e., the beginning date of the phased retirement period) is the first day of the first pay period beginning after phased employment is approved by an authorized agency official under § 831.1713(a), or the first day of a later pay period specified by the employee with the authorized agency official's concurrence.
§ 831.1715
Effect of phased retirement.
(a)(1) A phased retiree is deemed to be a full-time employee for the purpose of 5 U.S.C. chapter 89 and 5 CFR part 890 (related to health benefits), as required by 5 U.S.C. 8336a(i). The normal rules governing health benefits premiums for part-time employees in 5 U.S.C. 8906(b)(3) do not apply.
(2) A phased retiree is deemed to be receiving basic pay at the rate applicable to a full-time employee holding the same position for the purpose of determining a phased retiree's annual rate of basic pay used in calculating premiums (employee withholdings and agency contributions) and benefits under 5 U.S.C. chapter 87 and 5 CFR part 870 (dealing with life insurance), as required by 5 U.S.C. 8336a(n). The deemed full-time schedule will consist of five 8-hour workdays each workweek, resulting in a 40-hour workweek. Only basic pay for hours within the deemed full-time schedule will be considered, consistent with 5 U.S.C. 8336a(n) and the definition of “full-time” in § 831.1702. Any premium pay
creditable as basic pay for life insurance purposes under 5 CFR 870.204 for overtime work or hours outside the full-time schedule that an employee was receiving before phased retirement, such as standby duty pay under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c)(1) or customs officer overtime pay under 19 U.S.C. 267(a), may not be considered in determining a phased retiree's deemed annual rate of basic pay under this paragraph.
(b) A phased retiree may not be appointed to more than one position at the same time.
(c) A phased retiree may move to another position in the agency or another agency during phased retirement status only if the change would not result in a change in the working percentage. To move to another agency during phased retirement status and continue phased employment and phased retirement status, the phased retiree must submit a written and signed request and obtain the signed written approval, in accordance with § 831.1713(a)(1) and (2), of the authorized agency official of the agency to which the phased retiree is moving. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 831.1714, if the authorized agency official approves the request, the phased retiree's phased employment and phased retirement status will continue without interruption at the agency to which the phased retiree moves. If the authorized agency official at the agency to which the phased retiree moves does not approve the request, phased employment and phased retirement status terminates in accordance with § 831.1722(b).
(d) A phased retiree may be detailed to another position or agency, subject to 5 CFR part 300, subpart C, if the working percentage of the position to which detailed is the same as the working percentage of the phased retiree's position of record.
(e) A retirement-eligible employee who makes an election under this subpart may not elect an alternative annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8343a.
(f) If the employee's election of phased retirement status becomes effective, the employee is barred from electing phased retirement status again. Ending phased retirement status or entering full retirement status does not create a new opportunity for the individual to elect phased retirement status.
(g) Except as otherwise expressly provided by law or regulation, a phased retiree is treated as any other employee on a part-time tour of duty for all other purposes.
(h)(1) A phased retiree may not be assigned hours of work in excess of the officially established part-time schedule (reflecting the working percentage), except under the conditions specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
(2) An authorized agency official may order or approve a phased retiree to perform hours of work in excess of the officially established part-time schedule only in rare and exceptional circumstances meeting all of the following conditions:
(i) The work is necessary to respond to an emergency posing a significant, immediate, and direct threat to life or property;
(ii) The authorized agency official determines that no other qualified employee is available to perform the required work;
(iii) The phased retiree is relieved from performing excess work as soon as reasonably possible (e.g., by management assignment of work to other employees); and
(iv) When an emergency situation can be anticipated in advance, agency management made advance plans to minimize any necessary excess work by the phased retiree.
(3) Employing agencies must inform each phased retiree and his or her supervisor of—
(i) The limitations on hours worked in excess of the officially established part-time schedule;
(ii) The requirement to maintain records documenting that exceptions met all required conditions;
(iii) The fact that, by law and regulation, any basic pay received for hours outside the employee's officially established part-time work schedule (as described in § 831.1712(a)(1) and (b)) is subject to retirement deductions and agency contributions, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8336a(d), but is not used in computing retirement benefits; and
(iv) The fact that, by law and regulation, any premium pay received for overtime work or hours outside the
full-time schedule, that would otherwise be basic pay for retirement, such as customs officer overtime pay under 19 U.S.C. 267(a), will not be subject to retirement deductions or agency contributions, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8336a(d), and that any such premium pay received will not be included in computing retirement benefits.
(4) Employing agencies must maintain records documenting that exceptions granted under paragraph (h)(2) of this section meet the required conditions. These records must be retained for at least 6 years and be readily available to auditors. OPM may require periodic agency reports on the granting of exceptions and of any audit findings.
(5) If OPM finds that an agency (or subcomponent) is granting exceptions that are not in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph (h), OPM may administratively withdraw the agency's (or subcomponent's) authority to grant exceptions and require OPM approval of any exception.
(6) If OPM finds that a phased retiree has been working a significant amount of excess hours beyond the officially established part-time schedule to the degree that the intent of the phased retirement law is being undermined, OPM may require that the agency end the individual's phased retirement by unilateral action, notwithstanding the normally established methods of ending phased retirement. This finding does not need to be based on a determination that the granted exceptions failed to meet the required conditions in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. With the ending of an individual's phased retirement, that individual must be returned to regular employment status on the same basis as a person making an election under § 831.1721—unless that individual elects to fully retire as provided under § 831.1731.
(7) A phased retiree must be compensated for excess hours of work in accordance with the normally applicable pay rules.
(8) Any premium pay received for overtime work or hours outside the full-time schedule that would otherwise be basic pay for retirement, such as customs officer overtime pay under 19 U.S.C. 267(a), is not subject to retirement deductions or agency contributions, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8336a(d).
(i) A phased retiree is deemed to be an annuitant for the purpose of subpart S of 5 CFR part 831.

# Returning to Regular Employment Status
§ 831.1721
Ending phased retirement status to return to regular employment status.
(a)
Election to end phased retirement status to return to regular employment status.
(1) A phased retiree may elect, with the permission of an authorized agency official, to end phased employment at any time to return to regular employment status. The election is deemed to meet the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 8336a(g) regardless of the employee's work schedule. The employee is not subject to any working percentage limitation (i.e., full-time, 50 percent of full-time, or any other working percentage) upon electing to end phased retirement status.
(2) To elect to end phased retirement status to return to regular employment status, a phased retiree must—
(i) Submit to the authorized agency official, on a form prescribed by OPM, a written and signed request to end phased retirement status to return to regular employment status; and
(ii) Obtain the signed written approval of the authorized agency official for the request.
(3) An employee may cancel an approved election to end phased retirement status to return to regular employment status by submitting a signed written request to the agency and obtaining the approval of an authorized agency official before the effective date of return to regular employment status.
(4) The employing agency must notify OPM that the employee's phased retirement status has ended by submitting to OPM a copy of the completed election to end phased retirement status to return to regular employment status within 15 days of its approval.
(b)
Mandated return to regular employment status.
A phased retiree may be returned to regular employment status as provided under § 831.1715(h)(6).
(c)
Bar on reelection of phased retirement.
Once an election to end phased
retirement status to return to regular employment status is effective, the employee may not reelect phased retirement status.
§ 831.1722
Effective date of end of phased retirement status to return to regular employment status.
(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, if a request to end phased retirement status to return to regular employment status is approved by an authorized agency official under § 831.1721 on any date on or after the first day of a month through the fifteenth day of a month, the phased retiree's resumption of regular employment status is effective the first day of the first full pay period of the month following the month in which the election to end phased retirement status to return to regular employment status is approved.
(2) If a request to end phased retirement status to return to regular employment status is approved by an authorized agency official under § 831.1721 on any date on or after the sixteenth day of a month through the last day of a month, the phased retiree's resumption of regular employment status is effective on the first day of the first full pay period of the second month following the month in which the election to end phased retirement status to return to regular employment status is approved.
(3) The phased retirement annuity terminates on the date determined under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section.
(b) When a phased retiree moves from the agency that approved his or her phased employment and phased retirement status to another agency and the authorizing official at the agency to which the phased retiree moves does not approve a continuation of phased employment and phased retirement status, phased employment and phased retirement status terminates when employment ends at the current employing agency.
§ 831.1723
Effect of ending phased retirement status to return to regular employment status.
(a) After phased retirement status ends under § 831.1722, the employee's rights under subchapter III of chapter 83 or chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code, are determined based on the law in effect at the time of any subsequent separation from service.
(b) After an individual ends phased retirement status to return to regular employment status, for the purposes of subchapter III of chapter 83 or chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code, at the time of the subsequent separation from service, the phased retirement period will be treated as if it had been a period of part-time employment with the work schedule described in § 831.1712(a)(1) and (b). The part-time proration adjustment for the phased retirement period will be based upon the individual's officially established part-time work schedule, with no credit for extra hours worked. In determining the individual's deemed rate of basic pay during the phased retirement period, only basic pay for hours within the individual's officially established part-time work schedule may be considered. No pay received for other hours during the phased retirement period may be included as part of basic pay for the purpose of computing retirement benefits, notwithstanding the normally applicable rules.
(c) The restrictions in §§ 831.1751 and 831.1752 regarding when an individual must complete a deposit for civilian service, a redeposit for civilian service that ended on or after March 1, 1991, or a deposit for military service do not apply when a phased retiree ends phased retirement status to return to regular employment status under this section.
(d) When a phased retiree whose phased retirement annuity was subject to an actuarial reduction for unpaid redeposit service, in accordance with § 831.303(c) and (d), ends phased retirement status to return to regular employment status, the annuity the individual becomes entitled to at retirement is subject to the actuarial reduction, increased by cost-of-living adjustments under § 831.1743(d). For the purpose of applying the provisions of § 831.1743(d) under this paragraph, cost-of-living adjustments are applied through the annuity commencing date.

# Computation of Phased Retirement Annuity at Phased Retirement and Composite Retirement Annuity at Full Retirement
§ 831.1741
Computation of phased retirement annuity.
(a) Subject to adjustments described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a phased retiree's phased retirement annuity equals the product obtained by multiplying—
(1) The amount of annuity computed under 5 U.S.C. 8339, including any reduction for any unpaid deposit for non-deduction service performed before October 1, 1982, but excluding reduction for survivor annuity, that would have been payable to the phased retiree if, on the date on which the phased retiree enters phased retirement status, the phased retiree had separated from service and retired under 5 U.S.C. 8336(a) or (b); by
(2) The phased retirement percentage for the phased retiree.
(b)(1) The monthly installment of annuity derived from the computation of the annuity under paragraph (a) of this section is reduced by any actuarial reduction for unpaid redeposit service in accordance with § 831.303(c) and (d).
(2) For the purpose of applying § 831.303(c) and (d) in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the term “time of retirement” in § 831.303(c)(2) and (d)(2)(i) means the commencing date of the phased retiree's phased retirement annuity.
(c) The monthly installment of annuity derived from the computation of the annuity under paragraph (a) of this section is also subject to any offset under § 831.1005, adjusted by multiplying the offset that would otherwise apply had the phased retiree fully retired under 5 U.S.C. 8336(a) or (b) by the phased retirement percentage.
§ 831.1742
Computation of composite annuity at final retirement.
(a) Subject to the adjustment described in paragraph (c) of this section, a phased retiree's composite retirement annuity at final retirement equals the sum obtained by adding—
(1) The amount computed under § 831.1741(a) without adjustment under § 831.1741(b) and (c), increased by cost-of-living adjustments under § 831.1743(c); and
(2) The “fully retired phased component” computed under paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)(1) Subject to the requirements described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, a “fully retired phased
component” equals the product obtained by multiplying—
(i) The working percentage; by
(ii) The amount of an annuity computed under 5 U.S.C. 8339 that would have been payable at the time of full retirement if the individual had not elected phased retirement status and as if the individual was employed on a full-time basis in the position occupied during the phased retirement period and before any reduction for survivor annuity.
(2) In applying paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the individual must be deemed to have a full-time schedule during the period of phased retirement. The deemed full-time schedule will consist of five 8-hour workdays each workweek, resulting in a 40-hour workweek. In determining the individual's deemed rate of basic pay during phased retirement, only basic pay for hours within the deemed full-time schedule will be considered, consistent with the definition of “full-time” in § 831.1702. Any premium pay creditable as basic pay for retirement purposes for overtime work or hours outside the full-time schedule that an employee was receiving before phased retirement, such as standby duty pay under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c)(1) or customs officer overtime pay under 19 U.S.C. 267(a), may not be considered in determining a phased retiree's deemed rate of basic pay during phased retirement.
(3) In computing the annuity amount under paragraph (b)(1) of this section—
(i) The amount of unused sick leave equals the result of dividing the days of unused sick leave to the individual's credit at separation for full retirement by the working percentage; and
(ii) The reduction for any unpaid deposit for non-deduction service performed before October 1, 1982, is based on the amount of unpaid deposit, with interest computed to the commencing date of the composite annuity.
(c) The composite retirement annuity computed under paragraph (a) of this section is adjusted by applying any reduction for any survivor annuity benefit.
(d) The monthly installment derived from a composite retirement annuity computed under paragraph (a) of this section and adjusted under paragraph (c) is adjusted by any—
(1) Actuarial reduction applied to the phased retirement annuity under § 831.1741(b), increased by cost-of-living adjustments under § 831.1743(d); and
(2) Offset under § 831.1005 (i.e., the offset based on all service, including service during the phased retirement period, performed by the individual that was subject to mandatory Social Security coverage).
§ 831.1743
Cost-of-living adjustments.
(a) The phased retirement annuity under § 831.1741 is increased by cost-of-living adjustments in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8340.
(b) A composite retirement annuity under § 831.1742 is increased by cost-of-living adjustments in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8340, except that 5 U.S.C. 8340(c)(1) does not apply.
(c)(1) For the purpose of computing the amount of phased retirement annuity used in the computation under § 831.1742(a)(1), the initial cost-of-living adjustment applied is prorated in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8340(c)(1).
(2) If the individual enters full retirement status on the same day as the effective date of a cost-of-living adjustment (usually December 1st), that cost-of-living adjustment is applied to increase the phased retirement annuity used in the computation under § 831.1742(a)(1).
(d)(1) For the purpose of computing the actuarial reduction used in the computation under § 831.1742(d)(1), the initial cost-of-living adjustment applied is prorated in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8340(c)(1).
(2) If the individual enters full retirement status on the same day as the effective date of a cost-of-living adjustment (usually December 1st), that cost-of-living adjustment is applied to increase the actuarial reduction used in the computation under § 831.1742(d)(1).
(3) When applying each cost-of-living adjustment to the actuarial reduction used in the computation under § 831.1742(d)(1), the actuarial reduction is rounded up to the next highest dollar.

# Opportunity of a Phased Retiree To Pay a Deposit or Redeposit for Civilian or Military Service
§ 831.1751
Deposit for civilian service for which no retirement deductions were withheld and redeposit for civilian service for which retirement deductions were refunded to the individual.

(4) As provided under § 831.1742(b)(2), the amount of any unpaid deposit for non-deduction service performed before October 1, 1982, including interest computed to the commencing date of the composite annuity, will be the basis for reduction of the “fully retired phased component” for such unpaid deposit.
(b)(1) Any redeposit an employee entering phased retirement status wishes to make for civilian service for which retirement deductions were refunded to the employee must be paid within 30 days from the date OPM notifies the employee of the amount of the redeposit, during the processing of the employee's application for phased retirement. The redeposit amount will include interest under § 831.105 computed to the effective date of phased retirement.
(2) No redeposit payment may be made by the phased retiree when entering full retirement status.
(3) As provided under § 831.1741(b), for the computation of monthly installment of phased retirement annuity, the amount of any unpaid redeposit at phased retirement, or unpaid balance thereof, including interest computed to the effective date of phased retirement, will be the basis, along with the phased retiree's age, for any actuarial reduction of the monthly installment of phased retirement annuity for such unpaid redeposit.
(4) As provided under § 831.1742(d)(1), any actuarial reduction for unpaid redeposit service applied to the monthly installment of phased retirement annuity, as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section and § 831.1741(b), is increased by cost-of-living adjustments and applied to the monthly installment derived from the composite retirement annuity.
§ 831.1752
Deposit for military service.
(a) A phased retiree who wishes to make a military service credit deposit under § 831.2104(a) for military service performed prior to entering phased retirement status must complete such a deposit no later than the day before the effective date of his or her phased employment and the commencing date of the phased retirement annuity. A military service credit deposit for military service performed prior to an individual's entry into phased retirement status cannot be made after the effective date of phased employment and the commencing date of phased retirement annuity.
(b) A phased retiree who wishes to make a military service credit deposit under § 831.2104(a) for military service performed after the effective date of phased employment and the commencing date of the phased retirement annuity and before the effective date of the composite retirement annuity (e.g., due to the call-up of the employee for active military service) must complete such a deposit no later than the day before the effective date of his or her composite retirement annuity.
§ 831.1753
Civilian and military service of an individual affected by an erroneous retirement coverage determination.
(a) For the purpose of crediting service for which actuarial reduction of annuity is permitted under § 831.303(d) for an employee who enters phased retirement, the deposit amounts under § 831.303(d) form the basis, along with the phased retiree's age, for any actuarial reduction of the phased retirement annuity for such unpaid deposits.
(b) No deposit payment for service described under § 831.303(d) may be made by the phased retiree when entering full retirement status.
(c) As provided under § 831.1741(b), the amount of any deposit under § 831.303(d) at the commencing date of the individual's phased retirement annuity, or unpaid balance thereof, including interest computed to the effective date of phased retirement annuity, will be the basis, along with the phased retiree's age, for any actuarial reduction of the phased retirement annuity for such unpaid deposit.
(d) As provided under § 831.1742(d)(1), any actuarial reduction for any unpaid deposit service under § 831.303(d) applied to the phased retirement annuity, as described in § 831.1741(b), is increased by cost-of-living adjustments and applied to the monthly installment derived from the composite retirement annuity.

(2) The phased retirement period is deemed to have been a period of part-time employment with the work schedule described in § 831.1712(a)(1) and (b) for the purpose of determining survivor benefits. The part-time proration adjustment for the phased retirement period will be based upon the employee's officially established part-time work schedule, with no credit for extra hours worked. In determining the employee's deemed rate of basic pay during the phased retirement period, only basic pay for hours within the employee's officially established part-time work schedule may be considered. No pay received for other hours during the phased retirement period may be included as part of basic pay for the purpose of computing retirement benefits, notwithstanding the normally applicable rules.
(b) If a phased retiree elects not to make a deposit described in 5 U.S.C. 8334(d)(1), such that his or her annuity is actuarially reduced under 5 U.S.C. 8334(d)(2) and § 831.1741(b), and that individual dies in service as a phased retiree, the amount of any deposit upon which such actuarial reduction was to have been based will be deemed to have been fully paid.
§ 831.1762
Death of an individual who has separated from phased employment and who dies before submitting an application for a composite retirement annuity.
(a) For the purpose of 5 U.S.C. 8341, an individual who dies after separating from phased employment and before submitting an application for composite retirement annuity is deemed to have filed an application for full retirement status, and composite retirement annuity, with OPM.
(b) Unless an individual described in paragraph (a) of this section was reemployed with the Federal Government after separating from phased employment, the composite retirement annuity of an individual described in paragraph (a) of this section is deemed to have accrued from the day after separation through the date of death. Any composite annuity accrued during such period of time, minus any phased annuity paid during that period, will be paid as a lump-sum payment of accrued and unpaid annuity, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8342(c) and (f).
§ 831.1763
Lump-sum credit.
If an individual performs phased employment, the lump-sum credit will be reduced by any annuity that is paid or accrued during phased employment.

# Reemployment After Separation From Phased Retirement Status
§ 831.1771
Reemployment of an individual who has separated from phased employment and who dies before submitting an application for a composite retirement annuity.
(a) Unless eligibility for annuity terminates under 5 U.S.C. 8344, a phased retiree who has been separated from employment for more than 3 days and who has entered full retirement status, but who has not submitted an application for composite retirement annuity, is deemed to be an annuitant receiving annuity from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund during any period of employment in an appointive or elective position in the Federal Government.
(b) A phased retiree described in paragraph (a) whose entitlement to a composite retirement annuity terminates under 5 U.S.C. 8344 due to reemployment, is an employee effective upon reemployment. The individual is not entitled to a phased retirement annuity (i.e., phased retirement annuity does not resume) during the period of employment, and the individual's entitlement to a composite retirement annuity terminates effective on the date of employment.

# Mentoring
§ 831.1781
Mentoring.
(a) A phased retiree, other than an employee of the United States Postal Service, must spend at least 20 percent of his or her working hours in mentoring activities as defined by an authorized agency official.

Creditor agencies follow specific procedures approved by OPM, rather than those described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, for the collection of—
(i) Debts due because of the individual's failure to pay health benefits premiums while he or she was in nonpay status or while his or her salary was not sufficient to cover the cost of premiums;
(ii) Unpaid Federal taxes to be collected by Internal Revenue Service levy;
(iii) Premiums due because of the annuitant's election of Part B, Medicare coverage (retroactive collection limited to 6 months of premiums); or
(iv) Overpaid military retired pay an annuitant elects in writing to have withheld from his or her annuity.
(5)
General certification requirements for debt claims.
Creditor agencies submitting debt claims must certify—
(i) That the debt is owed to the United States;
(ii) The amount and reason for the debt and whether additional interest accrues;
(iii) The date the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued;
(iv) The agency has complied with the applicable statutes, regulations, and OPM procedures;
(v) That if a competent administrative or judicial authority issues an order directing OPM to pay a debtor an amount previously paid to the agency (regardless of the reasons behind the order), the agency will reimburse OPM or pay the debtor directly within 15 days of the date of the order (NOTE: OPM may, at its discretion, decline to collect other debt claims sent by an
agency that does not abide by this certification.);
(vi) If the collection will be in installments, the amount or percentage of net annuity in each installment; and,
(vii) If the debtor does not (in writing) consent to the offset, or does not (in writing) acknowledge receipt of the required notices and procedures, or the creditor agency does not document a judgment offset or a previous salary offset, the action(s) taken to comply with 4 CFR 102.3, including any required hearing or review, and the date(s) the action(s) was taken.
(6)
Notice of debt.
When a creditor agency cannot send a complete debt claim, it should notify OPM of the existence of the debt so the lump-sum will not be paid before the debt claim arrives.
(i) The notice to OPM must include a statement that the debt is owed to the United States, the date the debt first accrued, and the basis for and amount of the debt, if known. If the amount of the debt is not known, the agency must establish the amount and notify OPM in writing as soon as possible after submitting the notice.
(ii) The creditor agency may either notify OPM by making a notation in column 8 [Remarks] under “Fiscal Record” on the Standard Form 2806 (Individual Retirement Record), if the SF 2806 is in its possession, or if not, by submitting a separate document identifying the debtor by name, giving his or her date of birth, social security number, and date of separation, if known.
(c)
Time limits for sending records and debt claims to OPM
—(1)
Time limits for submitting debt claims.
Unless there is an application for refund pending, there is no specific time for submitting a debt claim or notice of debt to OPM. Generally, however, agencies must file a debt claim before the statute of limitations expires (4 CFR 102.4(c)) or before a refund is paid. Time limits are imposed (see § 831.1806(a)) when the debtor is eligible for a refund and OPM receives his or her application requesting payment. In the latter situation, creditor agencies must file a complete debt claim within 120 days (or 180 days if the agency requests an extension of time before the refund is paid) of the date OPM requests a complete debt claim.
(2)
Time limit for submitting retirement records to OPM.
A paying agency must send an individual's SF 2806 to OPM no later than 60 days after the separation, termination, or entrance on duty in a position in which the employee is not covered by the Civil Service Retirement System.
§ 831.1806
OPM processing for non-fraud claims.
(a)
Refunds—incomplete debt claims.
(1) If a creditor agency sends OPM a notice of debt or an incomplete debt claim against a refund OPM is processing for payment, OPM will withhold the amount of the debt but will not make any payment to the creditor agency. OPM will notify the creditor agency that the procedures in this subpart and 4 CFR 102.4 must be completed; and a debt claim must be completed and returned to OPM within 120 days of the date of OPM's notice to the creditor agency. Upon request, OPM will grant the creditor agency one extension of up to 60 days if the request for extension is received before the lump-sum payment has been made. The extension will commence on the day after the 120-day period expires so that the total time OPM holds payment of the refund will not exceed 180 days.
(2) During the period allotted the creditor agency for sending OPM a complete debt claim, OPM will handle the debtor's application for refund under section 8342(a) of title 5, United States Code, in one of two ways:
(i) If the amount of the debt is known, OPM will notify the debtor of the debt claim against his or her lump-sum credit, withhold the amount of the debt, and pay the balance to the debtor, if any.
(ii) If the amount of the debt is not known, OPM will not pay any amount to the debtor until the creditor agency certifies the amount of the debt, submits a complete debt claim, or the time limit for submission of the debt claim expires, whichever comes first.
(b)
Refunds—complete debt claims
—(1)
If OPM receives an application from the debtor prior to or at the same time as the agency's debt claim.
(i) If a refund has
been paid, we will notify the creditor agency there are no funds available for offset. Except in the case of debts due because of the employee's failure to pay health benefits premiums while he or she is in nonpay status or while his or her salary was not sufficient to cover the cost of premiums, creditor agencies should refer to the instructions in the FCCS for other measures to recover the outstanding debt; however, OPM will retain the SF 2805 on file in the event the debtor is once again employed in a position subject to retirement deductions.
(ii) If a refund is payable, and the creditor agency submits a complete debt claim in accordance with § 831.1805(b) (1), (2), (3), or (4), the debt will be collected from the refund and any balance paid to the debtor. OPM will send the debtor a copy of the debt claim, judgment, consent, or other document, and notify him or her that the creditor agency was paid.
(2)
If OPM has not received an application from the debtor when the agency's debt claim is received.
If a debtor has not filed application for a refund, OPM will retain the debt claim for future recovery. OPM will make the collection whenever an application is received, provided the creditor agency
initiated
the administrative offset before the statute of limitations expired. (See 4 CFR 102.3(b)(3) and 102.4(c).) OPM will notify the creditor agency that it does not have an application from the debtor so that the agency may take other action to recover the debt. (Note: If the recovery action is successful, the creditor agency must notify OPM so it can void the debt claim).
(3)
Future recovery.
(i) If OPM receives an application for refund within 1 year of the date the agency's debt claim was received
and
the creditor agency does not indicate that interest is accruing on the debt, the debt will be processed as stated in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
(ii) If OPM receives an application for refund within 1 year of the date the agency's debt claim was received and the creditor agency indicates that interest accrues on the debt, when necessary, OPM will contact the creditor agency to confirm that the debt is outstanding and request submission in writing, of the total additional accrued interest. OPM will not make interest computations for creditor agencies.
(iii) When OPM receives an application for refund more than 1 year after the creditor agency's debt claim was received, whether interest accrues or not, OPM will contact the creditor agency to see if the debt is still outstanding and, when necessary, request an update of the interest charges. If the debt is still due, the creditor agency must give the debtor an opportunity to establish that his or her changed financial circumstances, if any, would make the offset unjust. (See 4 CFR 102.4(c).) If the creditor agency determines that offset as requested in the debt claim would be unjust because of the debtor's changed financial circumstances, the agency should permit the debtor to offer a satisfactory repayment plan in lieu of offset. If the agency decides to pursue the offset, it must submit to OPM the requested information and any new instructions within 60 days of the date of OPM's request or the claim may be voided and the balance paid to the individual.
(c)
Annuities—incomplete debt claims.
If a creditor agency sends OPM notice of a debt or an incomplete debt claim against a debtor who is receiving an annuity, OPM will not offset the annuity. OPM will notify the creditor agency that the procedures in this subpart and 4 CFR 102.4 must be completed; and a debt claim must be completed and sent to OPM. No time limit will be given for the submission of a debt claim against an annuity; however, a complete debt claim must be received within 10 years of the date the Government's right to collect first accrued (4 CFR 102.3(b)(3)).
(d)
Annuities—complete debt claims
—(1)
General
—(i)
Notice.
When OPM receives a complete debt claim and an application for annuity, OPM will offset the annuity, pay the creditor agency, and mail the debtor a copy of the debt claim along with notice of the payment to the creditor agency.
(ii)
Beginning deductions.
If OPM has already established the debtor's annuity payment, deductions will begin
with the next available annuity payment. If OPM is in the process of establishing the annuity payments, deductions will not be taken from advance annuity payments, but will begin with the annuity payable on the first day of the month following the last advance payment.
(iii)
Updating accrued interest.
Once OPM has completed a collection, if there are additional accrued interest charges, the creditor agency must contact OPM regarding any additional amount due within 90 days of the date of the final payment.
(2)
Claims held for future recovery.
(i) If OPM receives an application for annuity within 1 year of the date the agency's debt claim was received, the debt will be processed as stated in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(ii) If OPM receives an application for annuity more than 1 year after the agency's debt claim was submitted, OPM will contact the creditor agency to see if the debt is still outstanding. If the debt is still due, the creditor agency should permit the debtor to offer a satisfactory repayment plan in lieu of offset if the debtor establishes that his or her changed financial circumstances would make the offset unjust. (See 4 CFR 102.4(c).) If the agency decides to pursue the offset, it must submit the requested information and any new instructions about the collection to OPM.
(3)
Limitations on OPM review.
In no case will OPM review—
(1) The merits of a creditor agency's decision with regard to reconsideration, compromise, or waiver; or
(2) The creditor agency's decision that a hearing was not required in any particular proceeding.
§ 831.1807
Installment withholdings.
(a) When possible, OPM will collect a creditor agency's full claim in one payment from the debtor's refund or annuity.
(b) If collection must be made from an annuity and the debt is large, the creditor agency must generally accept payment in installments. The responsibility for establishing and notifying the debtor of the amount of the installments belongs to the creditor agency (see § 831.1805(b)(5)). However, OPM will not make an installment deduction for more than 50 percent of net annuity, unless a higher percentage is needed to satisfy a judgment against a debtor within 3 years or the annuitant has consented to the higher amount in writing. All correspondence concerning installment deductions received by OPM will be referred to the creditor agency for consideration.
§ 831.1808
Special processing for fraud claims.
When an agency sends a claim indicating fraud, presentation of a false claim, misrepresentation by the debtor or any other party interested in the claim, or any claim based in whole or part on conduct violating the antitrust laws, to the Department of Justice (Justice) for possible treatment as a fraud claim (4 CFR 101.3), the following special procedures apply.
(a)
Agency processing.
If the debtor is separated or separates while Justice is reviewing the claim, the paying agency must send the SF 2806 to OPM, as required by § 831.1805(c)(2). The agency where the claim arose must send OPM notice that a claim is pending with Justice. (See § 831.1805(b)(6) for instructions on giving OPM a notice of debt.)
(b)
Department of Justice processing.
(1) The Attorney General or a designee will decide whether a debt claim sent in by an agency will be reserved for collection by Justice as a fraud claim. Upon receiving a possible fraud claim to be collected by offset from the Fund, the Attorney General or a designee must notify OPM. The notice to OPM must contain the following:
(i) The name, date of birth, and social security number of the debtor;
(ii) The amount of the possible fraud claim, if known;
(iii) The basis of the possible fraud claim; and
(iv) A statement that the claim is being considered as a possible fraud claim, the collection of which is reserved to Justice.
(2) When there is a pending refund application, the Attorney General or designee must file a complaint seeking a judgment on the claim and send a copy of the complaint to OPM; or as provided in 4 CFR 101.3, refer the claim to the agency where the claim arose and
submit a copy of the referral to OPM within 180 days of the date of either notice from the agency that a claim is pending with Justice (paragraph (a) of this section) or notice from Justice that it has received a possible fraud claim (paragraph (b)(1) of this section) whichever is earlier. When the claim is referred to the agency where it arose, the agency must begin administrative collection action under 4 CFR 102.4 and send a complete debt claim to OPM as required in § 831.1805.
(c)
OPM processing against refunds.
(1) Upon receipt of a notice under paragraph (a) or (b)(1) of this section, whichever is earlier, OPM will withhold the amount of the debt claim, if known; notify the debtor that the amount of the debt will be withheld from the refund for at least 180 days from the date of the notice that initiated OPM processing; and pay the balance to the debtor. If the amount of the debt claim is not known, OPM will notify the debtor that a debt claim may be offset against his or her refund and that OPM will not pay any amount until either the amount of the debt claim is established, or the time limit for filing a complaint in court or submitting the debt claim expires, whichever comes first.
(2) If the Attorney General files a complaint and notifies OPM within the applicable 180-day period, OPM will continue to withhold payment of the lump-sum credit until there is a final judgment.
(3) If the Attorney General refers the claim to the agency where the claim arose (creditor agency) and notifies OPM within the applicable 180-day period, OPM will notify the creditor agency that the procedures in this subpart and 4 CFR 102.4 must be completed; and a debt claim must be sent to OPM within 120 days of the date of OPM's notice to the creditor agency. At the request of the creditor agency, one extension of time of not more than 60 days will be granted, as provided by § 831.1806(a).
(4) If OPM is not notified that a complaint has been filed or that the claim has been referred to the creditor agency within the applicable 180-day period, OPM will pay the balance of the refund to the debtor.
(d)
OPM processing against annuities.
If the debtor has filed an annuity claim, OPM will not take action against the annuity. OPM will continue to pay the annuity unless and until there is a final judgment for the United States or submission of a complete debt claim.
(e)
OPM collection and payment of the debt.
(1) If the United States obtains a judgment against the debtor for the amount of the debt or the creditor agency submits a complete debt claim, OPM will collect and pay the debt to the creditor agency as provided in §§ 831.1806 and 831.1807.
(2) If the suit or the administrative proceeding results in a judgment for the debtor without establishing a debt to the United States, OPM will pay the balance of the refund to the debtor upon receipt of a certified copy of the judgment or administrative decision.

§ 831.1902
Federal-State agreements.
OPM will enter into an agreement with any State within 120 days of an application for agreement from the proper State official. The terms of the standard agreement will be §§ 831.1903 through 831.1906 of this subpart. OPM and the State may agree to additional terms and provisions, insofar as those additional terms and provisions do not contradict or otherwise limit the terms of the standard agreement.
§ 831.1903
OPM responsibilities.
OPM will, in performance of this agreement:
(a) Process the magnetic tape containing State tax transactions against the annuity roll once a month at the time monthly recurring payments are prepared for the United States Treasury Department. Errors that are identified will not be processed into the file, and will be identified and returned to the State for resolution via the monthly error report. Collections of State income tax will continue in effect until the State requesting the initial action supplies either a valid revocation or change. The magnetic tape must be received 35 days prior to the date of the check in which the transactions are to be effective. For example, withholding transactions for the July 1 check must be received 5 days prior to June 1. If the magnetic tape submitted by the State cannot be read, OPM will notify the State of this fact, and if a satisfactory replacement can be supplied in time for monthly processing, it will be processed.
(b) Deduct from the regular, recurring annuity payments of an annuitant the amount he or she has so requested to be withheld, provided that:
(1) The amount of the request is an even dollar amount, not less than Five Dollars nor more than the net recurring amount. The State may set any even dollar amount above Five Dollars as a minimum withholding amount.
(2) The annuitant has not designated more than one other State for withholding purposes within the calendar year. The State can set any limit on the number of changes an annuitant may make in the amount to be withheld.
(c) Retain the amounts withheld in the Fund until payment is due.
(d) Pay the net withholding to the State on the last day of the first month following each calendar quarter.
(e) Make the following reports:
(1) A monthly report which will include all the State tax withholdings, cancellations and adjustments for the month, and also each request OPM was not able to process, with an explanation, in coded format, of the reason for rejection.
(2) A quarterly report which will include State, State address, quarterly withholdings, quarterly cancellations and adjustments, quarterly net withholdings and year-to-date amounts. Where cancelled or adjusted payments were made in a previous year, OPM shall append a listing of the cancelled or adjusted payments which shows the date and amount of each cancelled or adjusted tax withholding, and the name and Social Security identification number of the annuitant from whom it was withheld. If either party terminates the agreement and the amount of cancelled or adjusted deductions exceeds the amount withheld for the final quarter, then the quarterly report shall show the amount to be refunded to OPM and the address to which payment should be made.
(3) An annual summary report which contains the name, Social Security identification number, and total amount withheld from non-cancelled payments during the previous calendar year, for each annuitant who requested tax withholding payable to the State. In the event the annuitant had State income tax withholding in effect for more than one State in that calendar year, the report will show only the amount withheld for the State receiving the report.
(4) An annual report to each annuitant for whom State income taxes were withheld giving the amount of withholding paid to the State during the calendar year.
§ 831.1904
State responsibilities.
The State will, in performance of this agreement:
(a) Accept requests and revocations from annuitants who have designated that State income tax deductions will go to the State.
(b) Convert these requests on a monthly basis to a machine-readable magnetic tape using specifications received from OPM, and forward that tape to OPM for processing.
(c) Inform annuitants whose tax requests are rejected by OPM that the request was so rejected and of the reason why it was so rejected.
(d) Recognize that, to the extent not prohibited by State laws, records maintained by the State relating to this program are considered jointly maintained by OPM and are subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a). Accordingly, the States will maintain such records in accordance with that statute and OPM's implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 297.
(e) Respond to requests of annuitants for information and advice in regard to State income tax withholding.
(f) Credit the amounts withheld from civil service annuities to the State tax liability of the respective annuitants, and, subject to applicable provisions of State law to the contrary, refund any balance over and above that liability to the annuitant, unless he or she should request otherwise.
(g) Surrender all tax withholding requests to OPM when this agreement is terminated or when the documents are not otherwise needed for this State tax withholding program.
(h) Allow OPM, the Comptroller General or any of their duly authorized representatives access to, and the right to examine, all records, books, papers or documents related to the processing of requests for State income tax withholding from civil service annuities.
§ 831.1905
Additional provisions.
These additional provisions are also binding on the State and OPM:
(a) A request or revocation is effective when processed by OPM. OPM will process each request by the first day of the second month following the month in which it is received, but incurs no liability or indebtedness by its failure to do so.
(b) Any amount deducted from an annuity payment and paid to the State as a result of a request is deemed properly
paid, unless the annuity payment itself is cancelled.
(c) OPM will provide the State with the information necessary to properly process a request for State income tax withholding.
(d) If the State is paid withholding which is contrary to the terms of the annuitant's request, the State is liable to the annuitant for the amount improperly withheld, and subject to account verification from OPM, agrees to pay that amount to the annuitant on demand.
(e) In the case of a disputed amount in any of the reports described and authorized by this agreement, the Associate Director for Compensation of OPM will issue an accounting. If the State finds this accounting unacceptable, it may then and only then pursue such remedies as are otherwise available.
(f) If a State receives an overpayment of monies properly belonging to the Fund, OPM will offset the overpayment from a future payment due the State. If there are no further payments due the State, OPM will inform the State in writing of the amount due. Within 60 days of the date of receipt of that communication the State will make payment of the amount due.
§ 831.1906
Agreement modification and termination.
This agreement may be modified or terminated in the following manner:
(a) Either party may suggest a modification of non-regulatory provisions of the agreement in writing to the other party. The other party must accept or reject the modification within 60 calendar days of the date of the suggestion.
(b) The agreement may be terminated by either party on 60 calendar days written notice.
(c) OPM may modify this agreement unilaterally through the rule making process described in sections 553, 1103, 1105 of title 5, United States Code.

§ 831.2003
Eligibility for lump-sum payment upon death or retirement.
(a) If there is no survivor who is entitled to monthly survivor annuity benefits on the death of a former employee, Member, annuitant, or survivor annuitant, the total lump-sum credit to the former employee's or Member's credit in the Retirement Fund is payable, except as provided in section 3716 of title 31, United States Code, on administrative offset for government claims, to the person(s) entitled in the normal order of precedence described in section 8342(c) of title 5, United States Code.

An interim appointment effective within 31 days of the employee's separation makes the employee ineligible for the lump-sum payment. Payments made in error will be collected under subpart M of part 831 of this chapter.
(b) When an employee's separation is cancelled after the MSPB initial decision becomes final, when the Board issues a final order cancelling the employee's separation, or when the agency and the employee agree to cancel the separation, the agency must notify OPM and request the amount of the erroneous lump-sum payment.
(c) At the time the employee's separation is cancelled, the agency must deduct the amount of the lump-sum payment from any back pay to which the employee is entitled as required by 5 CFR 550.805(e).
(d) Amounts recovered from back pay will not be subject to waiver consideration under 5 U.S.C. 8346(b). If there is no back pay or the back pay is insufficient to recover the erroneous payment, the employee may request that OPM waive the recovery of the uncollected portion of the overpayment. If waiver is not granted, the employee must repay the erroneous payment.

That monthly rate is then reduced by an amount equal to the retiree's lump-sum credit divided by the present value factor for the retiree's attained age (in full years) at the time of retirement. The reduced monthly rate is then rounded to the next lowest dollar and becomes the rate of annuity payable.

Federal Register
announcing any proposed adjustments in present value factors at least 30 days before the effective date of the adjustments.

(b) The amount of a deposit or redeposit deemed paid under paragraph (a) of this section will include any interest owed by the employee or Member under 5 U.S.C. 8334.

# Subpart F—Collection of Debts by Federal Tax Refund Offset
§ 835.601
Purpose.
This subpart establishes procedures for OPM to refer past-due legally enforceable debts to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for offset against the income tax refunds of persons owing debts to OPM. It specifies the agency procedures and the rights of the debtor applicable to claims referred under the Federal Tax Refund Offset Program for the collection of debts owed to OPM.
§ 835.602
Past-due legally enforceable debt.
A past-due legally enforceable debt for referral to the IRS is a debt that—
(a) Resulted from—
(1) Erroneous payments made under the Civil Service Retirement or the Federal Employees' Retirement Systems; or
(2) Unpaid health or life insurance premiums due under the Federal Employees' Health Benefits or Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Programs; or
(3) Any other statute administered by OPM;
(b) Is an obligation of a debtor who is a natural person;
(c) Except in the case of a judgment debt, has been delinquent at least 3 months but not more than 10 years at the time the offset is made;
(d) Is at least $25.00;
(e) With respect to which the individual's rights described in 5 CFR 831.1301 through 831.1309 have been exhausted;
(f) With respect to which either:
(1) OPM's records do not contain evidence that the person owing the debt (or his or her spouse) has filed for bankruptcy under title 11 of the United States Code; or
(2) OPM can clearly establish at the time of the referral that the automatic stay under 11 U.S.C. 362 has been lifted or is no longer in effect with respect to the person owing the debt or his or her spouse, and the debt was not discharged in the bankruptcy proceeding;
(g) Cannot currently be collected under the salary offset provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1);
(h) Is not eligible for administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) because of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2), or cannot currently be collected as an administrative offset by OPM under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) against amounts payable to the debtor by OPM; and
(i) Has been disclosed by OPM to a consumer reporting agency as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3711(f), unless the consumer reporting agency would be prohibited from reporting information concerning the debt by reason of 15 U.S.C. 1681c, or unless the amount of the debt does not exceed $100.
§ 835.603
Notification of intent to collect.
(a)
Notification before submission to the IRS.
A request for reduction of an IRS income tax refund will be made only after OPM makes a determination that an amount is owed and past-due and gives or makes a reasonable attempt to give the debtor 60 days written notice of the intent to collect by IRS tax refund offset.
(b)
Contents of notice.
OPM's notice of intention to collect by IRS tax refund offset (Notice of Intent) will state:
(1) The amount of the debt;
(2) That unless the debt is repaid within 60 days from the date of OPM's Notice of Intent, OPM intends to collect the debt by requesting the IRS to reduce any amounts payable to the debtor as a Federal income tax refund by an amount equal to the amount of the debt and all accumulated interest and other charges;
(3) A mailing address for forwarding any written correspondence and a contract name and a telephone number for any questions; and
(4) That the debtor may present evidence to OPM that all or part of the debt is not past due or legally enforceable by—
(i) Sending a written request for a review of the evidence to the address provided in the notice;
(ii) Stating in the request the amount disputed and the reasons why the debtor believes that the debt is not past-due or is not legally enforceable;
(iii) Including in the request any documents that the debtor wishes to be considered or stating that the additional information will be submitted within the remainder of the 60-day period.
§ 835.604
Reasonable attempt to notify.
In order to constitute a reasonable attempt to notify the debtor, OPM must have used a mailing address for the debtor obtained from the IRS pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6103(m)(2) within a period of 1 year preceding the attempt to notify the debtor, unless OPM received clear and concise notification from the debtor that notices from the agency are to be sent to an address different from the address obtained from IRS. Clear and concise notice means that the debtor has provided the agency with written notification, including the debtor's name and identifying number (as defined in 26 CFR 301.6109-1), and the debtor's intent to have the agency notices sent to the new address.
§ 835.605
OPM action as a result of consideration of evidence submitted as a result of the notice of intent.
(a)
Consideration of evidence.
If, as a result of the Notice of Intent, OPM receives notice that the debtor will submit additional evidence or receives additional evidence from the debtor within the prescribed time period, any notice to the IRS will be stayed until OPM can—
(1) Consider the evidence presented by the debtor; and
(2) Determine whether or not all or a portion of the debt is still past due and legally enforceable; and
(3) Notify the debtor of its determination.
(b)
Notification to the debtor.
Following review of the evidence, OPM will issue a written decision notifying the debtor whether OPM has sustained, amended, or canceled its determination that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable. The notice will advise the debtor of any further action to be taken and explain the supporting rationale for the decision.
(c)
OPM action on the debt.
(1) OPM will notify the debtor of its intent to refer the debt to the IRS for offset against the debtor's Federal income tax refund, if it sustains its decision that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable. OPM will also notify the debtor whether the amount of the debt remains the same or is modified.
(2) OPM will not refer the debt to the IRS for offset against the debtor's Federal income tax refund, if it reverses its decision that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable.
§ 835.606
Change in notification to Internal Revenue Service.
(a) Except as noted in paragraph (b) of this section, after OPM sends IRS notification of an individual's liability for a debt, OPM will promptly notify IRS of any change in the notification, if OPM—
(1) Determines that an error has been made with respect to the information contained in the notification;
(2) Receives a payment or credits a payment to the account of the debtor named in the notification that reduces the amount of the debt referred to the IRS for offset; or
(3) Receives notification that the individual owing the debt has filed for bankruptcy under title 11 of the United States Code or has been adjudicated bankrupt and the debt has been discharged.
(b) OPM will not notify the IRS to increase the amount of a debt owed by a debtor named in OPM's original notification to the IRS.
(c) If the amount of a debt is reduced after referral by OPM and offset by the IRS, OPM will refund to the debtor any excess amount and will promptly notify the IRS of any refund made by OPM.
§ 835.607
Administrative charges.
All administrative charges incurred in connection with the referral of the
debts to the IRS will be assessed on the debt and thus increase the amount of the offset.

Retirement coverage under either CSRS or FERS is governed by subpart B of part 831 or subpart A of part 842 of this chapter, as is appropriate.
(b)
When annuity continues.
(1) Unless a reemployed FERS annuitant's employment is on an intermittent basis, as an employee subject to another retirement system, or as President, deductions for the Fund shall be made under 5 U.S.C. 8422(a).
(2) A CSRS annuitant is not subject to deductions, unless he or she is serving in an other-than-intermittent status (except as President), is not covered by another retirement system, and elects to have retirement deductions made from his or her pay. Generally, deductions are made no later than the beginning of the first pay period immediately following the date the reemployed annuitant files the election with the employing agency. When the annuitant elects to have deductions made, he or she may not
change the election during continuous service with that agency.
(3) The amount of basic pay prior to offset of annuity under § 837.303 of this part is used in computing the amount of deductions. The rate of retirement deductions is that which attaches to the position under the provisions of sections 8334(a), 8334(k), or 8422(a) of title 5, United States Code, as is applicable.
§ 837.302
Agency contributions.
(a)
FERS annuitants.
An agency that reemploys a FERS annuitant subject to retirement deductions under § 837.301(b)(1) of this part shall make contributions, as specified in 5 U.S.C. 8423, to the Fund, based on the reemployed annuitant's pay prior to offset of annuity under the provisions of § 837.303 of this part.
(b)
CSRS annuitants.
An agency that reemploys a CSRS annuitant is required to make an agency contribution when—
(1) The annuity is suspended or terminated under the provisions of subpart B of this part; and
(2) The appointment is subject to CSRS deductions under the provisions of subpart B of part 831 of this chapter.
§ 837.303
Annuity offset.
(a)
Applicability.
When the right to receive annuity continues during reemployment (even though actual receipt of annuity may have been waived under 5 U.S.C. 8345(d) or 8465(a)), the pay of the reemployed annuitant shall be offset by the amount of annuity allocable to the period of reemployment, except that—
(1) No amount shall be offset from pay in accordance with this section for a period for which the annuitant has elected to receive FEC benefits in lieu of annuity; and
(2) No amount shall be offset from a lump-sum payment of annual leave, made on or after termination of the reemployment period.
(b)
Payment.
The employing agency shall pay to the Fund the full amount required to be offset from a reemployed annuitant's salary under this section in accordance with instructions issued by OPM. Payment in full to the Fund is not contingent on actual offset from the reemployed annuitant's salary.
(c)
Computation.
To compute the amount of the annuity offset for any particular pay period, divide the amount of annuity for the calendar days included in the pay period by the number of hours that would constitute a full-time tour of duty for that pay period, then multiply the result by the number of hours actually paid for the pay period, not to exceed the number of hours that constitutes a full-time tour of duty.
§ 837.304
Agency liability for payments.
(a) The agency will remit funds properly withheld from the pay of a reemployed annuitant in accordance with this subpart to OPM in the manner prescribed for the transmission of withholdings and contributions as soon as possible, but not later than provided by standards established by OPM.
(b) When the employing agency fails to withhold from the pay of the reemployed annuitant some or all of the amounts required to be withheld from that pay by this subpart, the employee has received an overpayment of pay. The employing agency must collect the overpayment of pay (unless it is waived under 5 U.S.C. 5584 or some other applicable statute) and remit the proper funds to OPM in the manner prescribed for the transmission of withholdings and contributions as soon as possible, but not later than provided by standards established by OPM.
(c) If the employing agency waives the annuitant's repayment of the salary overpayment, it must submit—on behalf of the reemployed annuitant—an amount equal to the correct deduction from pay (or the balance due in the case of a partial deduction) to OPM in the manner prescribed for the transmission of withholdings and contributions as soon as possible, but not later than provided by standards established by OPM.
[58 FR 48266, Sept. 15, 1993, as amended at 66 FR 66711, Dec. 27, 2001]
§ 837.305
Lump-sum credit not reduced.
When annuity continues during the period of reemployment, and the reemployment is subject to annuity offset under the provisions of § 837.303 of this subpart, or any similar provision of law or regulation, the amount of an annuitant's lump-sum credit to the Fund shall not be reduced by the amount of annuity allocable to the period of reemployment.
§ 837.306
Refund of lump-sum credit.
An annuitant serving as a justice or judge of the United States, as defined by section 451 of title 28, United States Code, may apply for and receive payment of the annuitant's lumpsum credit, less the amount of annuity or other benefits previously paid on that account. Receipt of a refund under this section will irrevocably terminate the right to annuity, and the annuitant status, of the recipient, based on any prior separations from employment covered by CSRS or FERS.

# Subpart D—Reemployment of Disability Annuitants
§ 837.401
Generally.
A disability annuitant may be reemployed in any position for which he or she is qualified.
§ 837.402
Special notice.
(a)
To annuitant.
In addition to the advice described in paragraph 837.103(b) of this part, the agency should generally also advise a disability annuitant, in writing, prior to reemployment, that—
(1) Reemployment on a permanent basis in a position equivalent in grade and pay to the position from which the annuitant retired may constitute the basis for an OPM finding of recovery from disability;
(2) Reemployment subject to medical and physical qualification standards equivalent to those of the position from which the annuitant retired may constitute the basis for an OPM finding of recovery from disability;
(3) The pay of the position in which the annuitant is reemployed, prior to the offset of annuity, or the pay of an interim appointment under § 772.102 of this chapter, as may be applicable, will be included as earnings in determining whether the disability annuity will be terminated due to restoration to earning capacity;
(4) Receipt of, or continued entitlement to receive, full or partial FEC benefits during reemployment, when those benefits are based on the same injury or medical condition that is the basis for OPM's award of disability retirement, is conclusive evidence (unless there is contravening medical evidence) that the annuitant has not recovered from the disability; and
(5) A disability annuitant age 60 or over cannot be found by OPM to be restored to earning capacity, and can only be found recovered at the annuitant's request.
(b)
To OPM.
On reemployment of a disability annuitant, the employing agency shall, in addition to the notice required by § 837.103(a) of this part, notify OPM in writing of—
(1) The physical and medical requirements of the position (providing a copy of the employee's position description);
(2) The position's grade level and/or rate of pay;
(3) Whether the employment is full-time, part-time, or intermittent;
(4) Whether, to the best of the agency's knowledge, the reemployed annuitant is receiving, or entitled to receive, FEC benefits; and
(5) Whether any medical evidence was used in making the employment decision, and if so, provide OPM with a copy of the medical information.
§ 837.403
Termination of annuity during reemployment.
(a)
Agency action.
When a reemployed disability annuitant is found recovered from disability or restored to earning capacity by OPM, OPM shall terminate the annuity as of the date of the finding, and the employing agency shall cease reducing pay by the amount of annuity allocable to the period of reemployment effective that same date. If the appointment is subject to retirement deductions, retirement deductions will begin or continue, as the case may be.
(b)
Subsequent benefits
—(1)
CSRS.
If, on separation from a period of reemployment during which the disability annuity was terminated because of recovery or restoration to earning capacity, the former disability annuitant is entitled to either an immediate or deferred annuity based on the most recent separation, any right to an annuity based on a prior separation is permanently extinguished. If no such right to immediate or deferred annuity accrues based on this most recent separation, however, any right to immediate or deferred annuity will be determined on the basis of the next prior separation.
(2)
FERS.
If a disability annuity is terminated during a period of reemployment because of recovery or restoration to earning capacity, any right to an annuity based on a prior separation is permanently extinguished, except as otherwise provided by § 844.405(b)(2) of this chapter.
§ 837.404
Reinstatement of annuity during a period of employment not subject to CSRS or FERS.
When OPM reinstates the disability annuity of an individual employed in a position not subject to CSRS or FERS, the employing agency shall withhold retirement deductions and offset pay subject to the provisions of subpart C of this part, as of the date of OPM's administrative determination of reinstatement. OPM shall offset from any retroactive payment of annuity for a period that is also a period of employment an amount equal to the amount of annuity, or the pay for the period of employment, whichever is the lesser.

# Subpart E—Retirement Benefits on Separation
§ 837.501
Refund of retirement deductions.
A reemployed annuitant who separates from reemployment without title to either a supplemental annuity or a redetermined annuity under this subpart is entitled to have any retirement deductions withheld from pay during the period of reemployment refunded without interest.

(i) The reemployed annuitant's right to annuity has not been terminated under any other provision of regulation or statute; and
(ii) The reemployed annuitant is not entitled to either an immediate or deferred CSRS or FERS annuity based on the separation from reemployment.
(2) When an annuity was suspended because of reemployment under the provisions of § 837.203 of this part, the annuity that was suspended will be reinstated effective the date immediately following the date the reemployed annuitant separated from reemployment.
(b)
Amount of reinstated annuity.
The amount of an annuity reinstated under the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section will be the amount of the annuity at the effective date of termination, adjusted by such adjustments as would have occurred had the annuity remained payable during the period of reemployment.
§ 837.503
Supplemental annuity.
(a)

If the reemployed annuitant's annuity, at the time he or she applies for supplemental annuity, is reduced to provide a survivor benefit for a spouse, (or, for FERS annuitants only, a former spouse), the supplemental annuity will be reduced by 10 percent, and the survivor annuities increased, if the annuitant was retired under CSRS, by 55 percent of the supplemental annuity, and if the annuitant was retired under FERS, by 50 percent of the supplemental annuity, unless the reemployed annuitant notifies OPM at the time of application that he or she does not wish to have such reductions and increases effected.
(c)
Creditable service.
(1) All actual reemployment service performed after the date of retirement on a full-time or part-time basis may be credited in the computation of a supplemental annuity provided—
(i) When the reemployment service was performed on or after October 1, 1982, retirement deductions were withheld or, for CSRS annuitants, a deposit has been paid under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8334;
(ii) The reemployment service was not performed subject to another retirement system, except when the deductions under the other retirement system have been refunded and a deposit paid to OPM, where the law so permits, or benefits under the other retirement system have been waived in favor of CSRS or FERS benefits; and
(iii) The reemployment service has not been used in the computation of another supplemental or redetermined annuity.
(2) A period of reemployment service during which annuitant status continues and annuity is paid, and which is excluded from the normal annuity offset from pay by special statutory provision, cannot be credited in the computation of a supplemental annuity or any subsequent annuity entitlement.

(iii) Separated from reemployment service, or converted to intermittent status, after serving 3 days or less in the month of such separation or conversion—shall commence on the earlier of the day after separation from reemployment service, the effective date of conversion to intermittent status, or the day after the date pay ceases.
§ 837.504
Redetermined annuity.
(a)
Title requirements.
(1) A reemployed annuitant is entitled, on separation, or conversion to intermittent service, to a redetermined annuity if—
(i) The annuitant performed—
(A) At least 5 years of actual, continuous, full-time service;

(2) The amount of the redetermined annuity of an individual whose previous annuity was terminated under the provisions of § 837.202(b)(1)(iii) of this part will at least equal the amount of the terminated annuity plus any increases under section 8340 of title 5, United States Code, occurring after the termination of the previous annuity and before the commencement of the redetermined annuity, adjusted by any annuity increase or reduction resulting from additional or different elections made by the reemployed annuitant.
(c)
Commencing date.
The commencing date of the redetermined annuity is the same as the law and/or regulations would provide in the case of a retiring employee.

# Subpart F—Death Benefits
§ 837.601
Generally.
Except as otherwise provided by this subpart, when an annuitant who is reemployed under circumstances that provide for continuation of annuitant status during reemployment dies, death benefits are payable under CSRS or FERS as if the individual died as an annuitant, and not as employee.
§ 837.602
Lump-sum payment of retirement deductions.
If an annuitant reemployed subject to the provisions of this part dies while so reemployed, and the annuitant would not have been entitled to a supplemental annuity, had the separation been for reasons other than death, or if there is no supplemental spousal survivor annuity payable (including a survivor annuity payable to a former spouse, if the annuitant retired under FERS) the amount of retirement deductions withheld during the period of reemployment will be paid in a lump sum to the person entitled under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8342(c) or 8424(d), as appropriate.
§ 837.603
Increased survivor benefits.
(a)
Supplemental survivor annuity.
(1) If an annuitant reemployed subject to the provisions of this part dies while so reemployed, and the annuitant would have been entitled to a supplemental annuity, had the separation been for reasons other than death, and there is a spousal survivor annuity payable (including a survivor annuity payable to a former spouse, if the annuitant retired under FERS) the amount of the spousal survivor annuity will, if any necessary deposit for service credit is made, be increased by 55 percent of the supplemental annuity, if the reemployed annuitant was retired under CSRS, or 50 percent of the supplemental annuity, if the reemployed annuitant was retired under FERS.

(b)
Redetermined survivor annuity.
If an annuitant reemployed subject to the provisions of this part dies while so reemployed, and the annuitant would have been entitled to elect a redetermined annuity, had the separation been for reasons other than death, and if there is a spousal survivor annuity payable (including a survivor annuity payable to a former spouse, if the annuitant retired under FERS), a person entitled to a spousal survivor annuity may elect to have his or her survivor annuity computed as if the annuitant had elected a redetermined annuity, provided any necessary deposit for service credit is made.

# Subpart G—CSRS Offset
§ 837.701
Offset from supplemental annuity.

(1) Is entitled to a supplemental annuity under this part; and
(2) Is entitled, or on proper application would be entitled, to old-age benefits under title II of the Social Security Act.
(c) Subject to paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, the amount of the reduction required under paragraph (a) of this section is the lesser of—
(1) The difference between—
(i) The social security old-age benefit for the month referred to in paragraph (b) of this section; and
(ii) The old-age benefit that would be payable to the individual for the month referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, excluding all CSRS-Offset wages as a reemployed annuitant, and assuming the annuitant was fully insured (as defined by section 214(a) of the Social Security Act); or
(2) The product of—
(i) The old-age benefit to which the individual is entitled or would, on proper application, be entitled; and
(ii) A fraction—
(A) The numerator of which is the annuitant's total CSRS-Offset service as a reemployed annuitant, rounded to the nearest whole number of years not exceeding 40 years; and
(B) The denominator of which is 40.
(d) Cost-of-living adjustments under 5 U.S.C. 8340 occurring after the effective date of the reduction required under paragraph (a) of this section will be based on only the supplemental annuity remaining after reduction under this subpart.
(e) The amounts for paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), and (c)(2)(i) of this section are computed without regard to subsections (b) through (1) of section 203 of the Social Security Act (relating to reductions in social security benefits), and without applying the provisions of the second sentence of section 215(a)(7)(B)(i) or section 215(d)(5)(ii) of the Social Security Act (relating to part of the computation of the social security windfall elimination provisions).
(f) OPM will accept the determination of the Social Security Administration, submitted in a form prescribed by OPM, concerning entitlement to social security benefits and the beginning and ending dates thereof.
§ 837.702
Offset from supplemental survivor annuity.
(a) OPM will reduce a supplemental survivor annuity (an annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8341) based on the service of an individual who performed CSRS-Offset service, if the survivor annuitant is entitled, or on proper application would be entitled, to survivor benefits under section 202(d), (e), or (f) (relating to children's, widows', and widowers' benefits, respectively) of the Social Security Act.
(b) The reduction required under paragraph (a) of this section begins (or is reinstated) on the first day of the month during which the survivor annuitant—
(1) Is entitled to a disability or survivor annuity under CSRS; and
(2) Is entitled, or on proper application would be entitled, to survivor benefits under the Social Security Act provisions mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, respectively.
(c) The reduction under paragraphs (a) of this section will be computed and adjusted in a manner consistent with the provisions of § 837.701 (c) through (e) of this part.
(d) A reduction under paragraph (a) of this section stops on the date entitlement to the disability or survivor benefits under title II of the Social Security Act terminates. In the case of a survivor annuitant who has not made proper application for the social security benefit, the reduction under paragraph (a) of this section stops on the date entitlement to such survivor benefits would otherwise terminate. If a social security benefit is reduced under any provision of the Social Security Act, even if reduced to zero, entitlement to that benefit is not considered to have terminated.
(e) OPM will accept the determination or certification of the Social Security Administration, submitted in a form prescribed by OPM, concerning entitlement to social security survivor benefits and the beginning and ending dates thereof.

(1) The provisions of law or regulation governing the other retirement system do not permit the annuitant to receive both benefits simultaneously, or for the same period of time; or
(2) Entitlement to the annuity from the other retirement system is based on service credited in the computation of the CSRS or FERS annuity, or service credited in the computation of the annuity from the other retirement system was used in the computation of the CSRS or FERS annuity.

(d)
Forfeiture.
Where an annuitant's coverage as an employee under another retirement system, whether by election or by operation of law or regulation, results in forfeiture of annuity rights under CSRS or FERS, the CSRS or FERS annuity will terminate as of the effective date of coverage.
(e)
Survivors.
The rules detailed in this section in regard to dual entitlement to annuity benefits under CSRS or FERS and another retirement system also apply to dual entitlement to survivor benefits under CSRS or FERS and another retirement system, unless the particular circumstance is otherwise governed by specific provision of statute or regulation.
(f)
Agency responsibilities.
The agency responsible for administering another retirement system must—
(1) Promptly notify OPM of an election of coverage under that retirement system by a reemployed CSRS or FERS
annuitant, or the coverage of a reemployed CSRS annuitant under that retirement system by election or operation of law or regulation, when such coverage affects the annuitant's entitlement to CSRS annuity;

(b)
Agency notification to OPM.
Upon receiving a final order requiring cancellation of the annuitant's separation or after the annuitant and the agency agree to cancel the separation, the employing agency must notify OPM and request the amount of the erroneous payment to be recovered under § 550.805(e) of this chapter from any back pay adjustment to which the employee may be entitled.
(c)
Collection of erroneously paid retirement benefits.
(1) If OPM determines that an overpayment of annuity or lump-sum credit has occurred and the employee is entitled to receive back pay because of the canceled separation, the overpaid retirement benefits must be deducted to the extent they can be recovered from the back pay adjustment as required by § 550,805(e) of this chapter.
(2) Amounts recovered from back pay will not be subject to waiver consideration under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8346(b) or 8470(b). If there is no back pay or the back pay is insufficient to recover the entire payment, the employee may request that OPM waive the uncollected portion of the overpayment. If waiver is not granted, the employee must repay the erroneous payment.
§ 837.804
Finality of elections under this subpart.
Except as otherwise provided by this subpart, an election of coverage under, or annuity from, another retirement system, in lieu of CSRS or FERS coverage or annuity, or the election between simultaneous entitlements under CSRS or FERS, is final and conclusive for the period of simultaneous entitlement to coverage or annuity.

[57 FR 33574, July 29, 1992, as amended at 79 FR 46626, Aug. 8, 2014]
§ 838.223
OPM action on receipt of a court order not acceptable for processing.
If OPM receives an application from a former spouse not based on a court order acceptable for processing, OPM will inform the former spouse that OPM cannot approve the application and provide the specific reason(s) for disapproving the application. Examples of reasons for disapproving an application include that the court order does not meet the definition of court order in § 838.103 or does not meet one or more of the requirements of subpart C of this part.
§ 838.224
Contesting the validity of court orders.
(a) An employee, separated employee, or retiree who alleges that a court order is invalid must prove the invalidity of the court order by submitting a court order that—
(1) Declares the court order submitted by the former spouse is invalid; or
(2) Sets aside the court order submitted by the former spouse.

§ 838.225
Processing amended court orders.
(a) If the employee, separated employee, retiree, or former spouse submits an amended court order pertaining to payment of a portion of the employee annuity, OPM will process the amended court order prospectively only, effective against employee annuity accruing beginning the first day of the second month after OPM receives the amended court order.
(b) A court order is not effective to adjust payments prior to the first day of the second month after OPM receives the court order unless—

(iii) Provides a specific monthly amount of the adjustment or a formula to compute the amount of the monthly adjustment; and
(2) Annuity continues to be available from which to make the adjustment.

# Payment Procedures
§ 838.231
Commencing date of payments.
(a) A court order acceptable for processing is effective against employee annuity accruing beginning the first day of the second month after OPM receives the court order.
(b)(1) OPM will not begin payments to the former spouse until OPM receives all the documentation required by § 838.221 (b) and (c).
(2) If payments are delayed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, after OPM receives all required documentation, it will authorize payment of the annuity that has accrued since the date determined under paragraph (a) of this section but the payment of which was delayed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
§ 838.232
Suspension of payments.
(a) Payments from employee annuities under this part will be discontinued whenever the employee annuity payments are suspended or terminated. If employee annuity payments to the retiree or phased retiree are restored, payments to the former spouse will also resume, subject to the terms of any court order acceptable for processing in effect at that time.
(b) Paragraph (a) of this section will not be applied to permit a retiree or phased retiree to deprive a former spouse of payment by causing suspension of payment of employee annuity.
[79 FR 46626, Aug. 8, 2014]
§ 838.233
Termination of payments.
A former spouse portion of an employee annuity stops accruing at the earliest of—
(a) The date on which the terms of the court order require termination;
(b)(1) The last day of the first month before OPM receives a court order invalidating, vacating, or setting aside the court order submitted by the former spouse if OPM receives the latest court order no later than 20 days before the end of the month; or
(2) The last day of the month in which OPM receives a court order invalidating, vacating, or setting aside the court order submitted by the former spouse if OPM receives the latest court order than 20 days before the end of the month; or

[57 FR 33574, July 29, 1992, as amended at 79 FR 46626, Aug. 8, 2014]
§ 838.234
Collection of arrearages.
Specific instructions are required before OPM may pay any arrearage. Except as provided in § 838.225(b), OPM will not increase a former spouse's share of employee annuity to satisfy an arrearage due the former spouse. However, under § 838.225, OPM will prospectively honor the terms of an amended court order that either increases or decreases the court order's entitlement.
§ 838.235
Payment of lump-sum awards.
If a court order acceptable for processing awards a former spouse a lump-sum amount from the employee annuity and does not state the monthly rate at which OPM should pay the lump-sum, OPM will pay the former spouse equal monthly installments at 50 percent of the gross annuity (subject to the limitations under § 838.211) at the time of retirement or the date of the order, whichever comes later, until the lump-sum amount is paid.
§ 838.236
Court orders barring payment of annuities.
(a) State courts lack authority to prevent OPM from paying employee annuities as required by section 8345(a) or section 8463 of title 5, United States Code. OPM will not honor court orders directing that OPM delay or otherwise not pay employee annuities at the time or in the amount required by statute.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, OPM will honor court orders acceptable for processing that direct OPM to pay the employee annuity to the court, an officer of the court acting as a fiduciary, or a State or local government agency during the pendency of a divorce or legal separation proceeding.
§ 838.237
Death of the former spouse.
(a) Unless the court order acceptable for processing expressly provides otherwise, the former spouse's share of an employee annuity terminates on the last day of the month immediately preceding the death of the former spouse, and the former spouse's share of employee annuity reverts to the retiree or phased retiree.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, OPM will honor a court order acceptable for processing or an amended court order acceptable for processing that directs OPM to pay, after the death of the former spouse, the former spouse's share of the employee annuity to—
(1) The court;
(2) An officer of the court acting as fiduciary;
(3) The estate of the former spouse; or
(4) One or more of the retiree's or phased retiree's children as defined in 5 U.S.C. 8342(c) or 8424(d).
[57 FR 33574, July 29, 1992, as amended at 58 FR 43493, Aug. 17, 1993; 79 FR 46626, Aug. 8, 2014]

# Procedures for Computing the Amount Payable
§ 838.241
Cost-of-living adjustments.
Unless otherwise provided in the court order, when the terms of the court order or § 838.621 provide for cost-of-living adjustments on the former spouse's payment from employee annuity, the cost-of-living adjustment will be effected at the same time and at the same percentage rate as the cost-of-living adjustment in the employee annuity.
§ 838.242
Computing lengths of service.
(a)(1) The smallest unit of time that OPM will calculate in computing a formula in a court order is a month, even where the court order directs OPM to make a more precise calculation.
(2) If the court order states a formula using a specified simple or decimal fraction other than twelfth parts of a year, OPM will use the specified number to perform simple mathematical computations.
(b) Unused sick leave is counted as “creditable service” on the date of separation for an immediate CSRS or FERS annuity. The unused sick leave of a phased retiree is counted as “creditable service” on the date of separation of the phased retiree to enter full retirement status. Unused sick leave is not apportioned over the time when earned.
[57 FR 33574, July 29, 1992, as amended at 79 FR 46626, Aug. 8, 2014]
§ 838.243
Minimum amount of awards.
OPM will treat any court order that awards a former spouse a portion of an employee annuity equal to less than $12 per year as awarding the former spouse $1 per month.

# Subpart C—Requirements for Court Orders Affecting Employee Annuities
§ 838.301
Purpose and scope.
This subpart regulates the requirements that a court order directed at employee annuity must meet to be a court order acceptable for processing.
§ 838.302
Language not acceptable for processing.
(a)
Qualifying Domestic Relations Orders.
(1) Any court order labeled as a “qualified domestic relations order” or issued on a form for ERISA qualified domestic relations orders is not a court order acceptable for processing unless the court order expressly states that the provisions of the court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are governed by this part.
(2) When a court order is required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section to state that the provisions of a court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are governed by this part the court order must expressly—
(i) Refer to part 838 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, and
(ii) State that the provisions of the court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are drafted in accordance with the terminology used in this part.
(3) Although any language satisfying the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section is sufficient to prevent a court order from being unacceptable under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, OPM recommends the use of the language provided in ¶ 001 in appendix A to subpart F of this part to state that the provisions of the court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are governed by this part.
(4) A court order directed at employee annuity that contains the language described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section must also satisfy all other requirements of this subpart to be a court order acceptable for processing.
(b)
Benefits for the lifetime of the former spouse.
Any court order directed at employee annuity that expressly provides that the former spouse's portion of the employee annuity may continue after the death of the employee or retiree, such as a court order providing that the former spouse's portion of the employee annuity will continue for the lifetime of the former spouse, is not a court order acceptable for processing.
§ 838.303
Expressly dividing employee annuity.
(a) A court order directed at employee annuity is not a court order acceptable for processing unless it expressly divides the employee annuity as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) To expressly divide employee annuity as required by paragraph (a) of this section the court order must—
(1) Identify the retirement system using terms that are sufficient to identify the retirement system as explained in § 838.611; and
(2) Expressly state that the former spouse is entitled to a portion of the employee annuity using terms that are sufficient to identify the employee annuity as explained in § 838.612.
§ 838.304
Providing for payment to the former spouse.
(a) A court order directed at employee annuity is not a court order acceptable for processing unless it provides for OPM to pay the former spouse a portion of an employee annuity as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) To provide for OPM to pay the former spouse a portion of an employee annuity as required by paragraph (a) of this section the court order must—
(1) Expressly direct OPM to pay the former spouse directly;
(2) Direct the retiree to arrange or to execute forms for OPM to pay the former spouse directly; or
(3) Be silent concerning who is to pay the portion of the employee annuity awarded to the former spouse.
(c) Except when the court order directed at employee annuity contains a provision described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a court order directed
at employee annuity that instructs the retiree to pay a portion of the employee annuity to the former spouse is not a court order acceptable for processing.
(d) Although paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section provide acceptable methods for satisfying the requirement that a court order directed at employee annuity provide for OPM to pay the former spouse, OPM strongly recommends that any court order directed at employee annuity expressly direct OPM to pay the former spouse directly.
§ 838.305
OPM computation of formulas.
(a) A court order directed at employee annuity is not a court order acceptable for processing unless the court order provides sufficient instructions and information that OPM can compute the amount of the former spouse's monthly benefit using only the express language of the court order, subparts A, B, and F of this part, and information from normal OPM files.
(b)(1) To provide sufficient instructions and information for OPM to compute the amount of the former spouse's share of the employee annuity as required by paragraph (a) of this section the court order must state the former spouse's share as—
(i) A fixed amount;
(ii) A percentage or a fraction of the employee annuity; or
(iii) A formula that does not contain any variables whose values are not readily ascertainable from the face of the court order directed at employee annuity or normal OPM files.
(2) Normal OPM files include information about—
(i) The dates of employment for all periods of creditable civilian and military service;
(ii) The rate of basic pay for all periods of creditable civilian service;
(iii) The annual rates of basic pay for each grade and step under the General Schedule since 1920;
(iv) The amount of premiums for basic and optional life insurance under the Federal Employees Group Life Insurance Program;
(v) The amount of the Government and the employee shares of premiums for any health insurance plan under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program;
(vi) The standard Federal income tax withholding tables;
(vii) The amount of cost-of-living adjustments under section 8340 or section 8462 of title 5, United States Code, and the amount of the percentage change in the national index on which the adjustment is based;
(viii) The amount of pay adjustments to the General Schedule under section 5303 (or section 5305 prior to November 5, 1990) of title 5, United States Code, and the amount of the percentage change in the national index on which the adjustment is based;
(ix) The provision of law under which a retiree has retired; and
(x) Whether a retiree has elected to provide survivor benefits for a current spouse, former spouse, or a person with an insurable interest.
(c)(1) A court order directed at employee annuity is not a court order acceptable for processing if OPM would have to examine a State statute or court decision (on a different case) to understand, establish, or evaluate the formula for computing the former spouse's share of the employee annuity.
(2) A court order directed at employee annuity is not a court order acceptable for processing if it awards the former spouse a “community property” fraction, share, or percentage of the employee annuity and does not provide a formula by which OPM can compute the amount of the former spouse's share of the employee annuity from the face of the court order or from normal OPM files.
(d) A court order directed at employee annuity is not a court order acceptable for processing if the court order awards a portion of the “present value” of an annuity unless the amount of the “present value” is stated in the court order.
(e) A court order directed at employee annuity is not a court order acceptable for processing if the court order directs OPM to determine a rate of employee annuity that would require OPM to determine a salary or average salary, other than a salary or average salary actually used in computing the employee annuity, as of a
date prior to the date of the employee's entry into phased retirement or separation and to adjust that salary for use in computing the former spouse share unless the adjustment is by—
(1) A fixed amount or fixed annual amounts that are stated in the order;
(2) The rate of cost-of-living or salary adjustments as those terms are described in § 838.622;
(3) The percentage change in pay that the employee actually received excluding changes in grade and/or step; or
(4) The percentage change in either of the national indices used to compute cost-of-living or salary adjustments as those terms are described in § 838.622.
[57 FR 33574, July 29, 1992, as amended at 79 FR 46627, Aug. 8, 2014]
§ 838.306
Specifying type of annuity for application of formula, percentage or fraction.
(a) A court order directed at an employee annuity that states the former spouse's share of employee annuity as a formula, percentage, or fraction is not a court order acceptable for processing unless OPM can determine the type of annuity (i.e., phased retirement annuity, composite retirement annuity, net annuity, gross annuity, or self-only annuity) on which to apply the formula, percentage, or fraction.
(b) The standard types of annuity to which OPM can apply the formula, percentage, or fraction are phased retirement annuity of a phased retiree, or net annuity, gross annuity, or self-only annuity of a retiree. Unless the court order otherwise directs, OPM will apply to gross annuity the formula, percentage, or fraction directed at annuity payable to either a retiree or a phased retiree. Section 838.625 contains information on other methods of describing these types of annuity.
(c)(1) A court order may include provisions directed at:
(i) Phased retirement annuity payable to a phased retiree, to address the possibility that an employee will enter phased retirement status;
(ii) Composite retirement annuity payable to a phased retiree at entry into full retirement status, to address the possibility that an employee will enter phased retirement status and then enter full retirement status; and
(iii) Annuity payable to an employee who retires without having elected phased retirement status.
(2) To separately provide for division of phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity, a provision of a court order must expressly state that it is directed at “phased retirement annuity” or “composite retirement annuity,” and must meet the requirements of paragraph (a). That is, it must state the type of annuity to be divided (e.g., “net phased retirement annuity”). If such a provision is unclear as to whether it is directed at gross, net, or self-only phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity, the provision will be applied to gross phased retirement annuity or gross composite retirement annuity, as described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(3) Unless a court order expressly states that phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity is not to be divided, a court order meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and that generally provides for division of annuity, without meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, regarding the specific type of annuity being divided, will be applied to divide any employee annuity, including phased retirement annuity and composite retirement annuity.

[57 FR 33574, July 29, 1992, as amended at 58 FR 43493, Aug. 17, 1993]
§ 838.423
OPM action on receipt of a court order acceptable for processing.
(a) If OPM receives a court order acceptable for processing that is directed at a refund of employee contributions, OPM will inform—
(1) The former spouse—
(i) That the court order is acceptable for processing;
(ii) Of the date on which OPM received the court order;
(iii) Whether OPM has a record of unrefunded employee contributions on the employee;
(iv) That the former spouse's share of the refund of employee contributions cannot be paid unless the employee separates from the Federal service and applies for a refund of employee contributions;
(v) To the extent possible, the formula that OPM will use to compute the former spouse's share of a refund of employee contributions; and
(vi) That, if the former spouse disagrees with the formula, the former spouse must obtain, and submit to OPM, an amended court order clarifying the amount; and
(2) The employee or separated employee—
(i) That the former spouse has applied for benefits under this subpart;
(ii) That the court order is acceptable for processing and that OPM must comply with the court order;
(iii) Of the date on which OPM received the court order;
(iv) That the former spouse's share of the refund of employee contributions cannot be paid unless the employee separates from the Federal service and applies for a refund of employee contributions;
(v) To the extent possible, the formula that OPM will use to compute the former spouse's share of the refund of employee contributions;
(vi) That, if he or she contests the validity of the court order, he or she must obtain, and submit to OPM, a court order invalidating the court order submitted by the former spouse; and
(vii) That, if he or she disagrees with the formula, he or she must obtain, and submit to OPM, an amended court order clarifying the amount.
(b) The failure of OPM to provide, or of the employee or separated employee or the former spouse to receive, the information specified in this section does not affect the validity of payment under the court order.
§ 838.424
OPM action on receipt of a court order not acceptable for processing.
If OPM receives an application from a former spouse not based on a court order acceptable for processing, OPM will inform the former spouse that OPM cannot approve the application and provide the specific reason(s) for disapproving the application. Examples of reasons for disapproving an application include that the order does not meet the definition of court order in § 838.103 or does not meet one or more of the requirements of subpart E of this part.
§ 838.425
Contesting the validity of court orders.
(a) An employee or separated employee who alleges that a court order is invalid must prove the invalidity of the court order by submitting a court order that—
(1) Declares invalid the court order submitted by the former spouse; or
(2) Sets aside the court order submitted by the former spouse.
(b) OPM must honor a court order acceptable for processing that appears to be valid and that the former spouse has certified is currently in force and has not been amended, superseded, or set aside, until the employee or separated employee submits a court order described in paragraph (a) of this section or a court order amending or superseding the court order submitted by the former spouse.

# Payment Procedures
§ 838.431
Correcting failures to provide required spousal notification.
The interests of a former spouse with a court order acceptable for processing that is directed at a refund of employee
contributions who does not receive notice of an application for refund of employee contributions because the employee or separated employee submits fraudulent proof of notification or fraudulent proof that the former spouse's whereabouts are unknown are protected if, and only if—
(a) The former spouse files a court order acceptable for processing that affects or bars the refund of employee contributions with OPM no later than the last day of the second month before the payment of the refund; or
(b) The former spouse submits proof that—
(1) The evidence submitted by the employee was fraudulent; and
(2) Absent the fraud, the former spouse would have been able to submit the necessary documentation required by § 838.421 within the time limit prescribed in § 838.422.
§ 838.432
Court orders barring payment of refunds.
A court order, notice, summons, or other document that attempts to restrain OPM from paying a refund of employee contributions is not effective unless it meets all the requirements of § 838.505 or part 581 of this chapter.

# Procedures for Computing the Amount Payable
§ 838.441
Computing lengths of service.
(a) The smallest unit of time that OPM will calculate in computing a formula in a court order is a month, even where the court order directs OPM to make a more precise calculation.
(b) If the court order states a formula using a specified simple or decimal fraction other than twelfth parts of a year, OPM will use the specified number to perform simple mathematical computations.

# Subpart E—Requirements for Court Orders Affecting Refunds of Employee Contributions
§ 838.501
Purpose and scope.
This subpart regulates the requirements that a court order directed at or barring a refund of employee contributions must meet to be a court order acceptable for processing.
(a) A court order is directed at a refund of employee contributions if it awards a former spouse a portion of a refund of employee contributions.
(b) A court order bars a refund of employee contributions if it prohibits payment of a refund of employee contributions to preserve a former spouse's court-awarded entitlement to a portion of an employee annuity or to a former spouse survivor annuity.
§ 838.502
Expressly dividing a refund of employee contributions.
(a) A court order directed at a refund of employee contributions is not a court order acceptable for processing unless it expressly awards a former spouse a portion of a refund of employee contributions as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) To expressly award a former spouse a portion of a refund of employee contributions as required by paragraph (a) of this section, the court order must—
(1) Identify the retirement system using terms that are sufficient to identify the retirement system as explained in § 838.611; and
(2) Expressly state that the former spouse is entitled to a portion of a refund of employee contributions using terms that are sufficient to identify the refund of employee contributions as explained in § 838.612.
§ 838.503
Providing for payment to the former spouse.
(a) A court order directed at a refund of employee contributions is not a court order acceptable for processing unless it provides for OPM to pay a portion of a refund of employee contributions to the former spouse as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) To provide for OPM to pay a portion of a refund of employee contributions to the former spouse as required by paragraph (a) of this section, the court order must—
(1) Expressly direct OPM to pay the former spouse directly;
(2) Direct the employee or separated employee to arrange or to execute forms for OPM to pay the former spouse directly; or
(3) Be silent concerning who is to pay the portion of the refund of employee
contributions awarded to the former spouse.
(c) Although paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section provide acceptable methods for satisfying the requirement that the court order provide for OPM to pay the former spouse, OPM strongly recommends that the court order expressly direct OPM to pay the former spouse directly.
§ 838.504
OPM computation of formulas.
(a) A court order directed at a refund of employee contributions is not a court order acceptable for processing unless the court order provides sufficient instructions and information so that OPM can compute the amount of the former spouse's share of the refund of employee contributions using only the express language of the court order, subparts A, D, and F of this part, and information from normal OPM files.
(b) To provide sufficient instructions and information that OPM can compute the amount of the former spouse's share of the refund of employee contributions as required by paragraph (a) of this section requires that the court order state the former spouse's share as—
(1) A fixed amount;
(2) A percentage or a fraction of the refund of employee contributions; or
(3) A formula that does not contain any variables whose values are not readily ascertainable from the face of the court order or normal OPM files.
(c) A court order directed at a refund of employee contributions is not a court order acceptable for processing if OPM would have to examine a State statute or court decision (on a different case) to understand, establish, or evaluate the formula for computing the former spouse's share of the refund of employee contributions.
§ 838.505
Barring payment of refunds.
A court order barring payment of a refund of employee contributions is not a court order acceptable for processing unless—
(a) It expressly directs OPM not to pay a refund of employee contributions;
(b) It awards, or a prior court order acceptable for processing has awarded, the former spouse a former spouse survivor annuity or a portion of the employee annuity; and
(c) Payment of the refund of employee contributions would prevent payment to the former spouse under the court order described in paragraph (b) of this section.

# Subpart F—Terminology Used in Court Orders Affecting Employee Annuities or Refunds of Employee Contributions

# Regulatory Structure
§ 838.601
Purpose and scope.
(a) This subpart regulates the meaning of terms necessary to award benefits in a court order directed at an employee annuity or a refund of employee contributions. OPM applies the meanings to determine whether a court order directed at an employee annuity or a refund of employee contributions is a court order acceptable for processing and to establish the amount of the former spouse's share of an employee annuity or a refund of employee contributions.
(b)(1) This subpart establishes a uniform meaning to be used for terms and phrases frequently used in awarding a former spouse a portion of an employee annuity or a refund of employee contributions.
(2) This subpart informs the legal community about the definitions to apply terms used in drafting court orders so that the resulting court orders contain the proper language to accomplish the aims of the court.
(c)(1) To assist attorneys and courts in preparing court orders that OPM can honor in the manner that the court intends, appendix A of this subpart contains model language to accomplish many of the more common objectives associated with the award of a former spouse's share of an employee annuity or a refund of employee contributions.
(2) By using the language in appendix A of this subpart, the court, attorneys, and parties will know that the court order will be acceptable for processing
and that OPM will treat the terminology used in the court order in the manner stated in the appendix.

# Identification of Benefits
§ 838.611
Identifying the retirement system.
(a) To satisfy the requirements of § 838.303(b)(1) or § 838.502(b)(1), a court order must contain language identifying the retirement system to be affected. For example, “CSRS,” “FERS,” “OPM,” or “Federal Government” benefits, or benefits payable “based on service with the U.S. Department of Agriculture,” etc., are sufficient identification of the retirement system.
(b) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, language referring to benefits under another retirement system, such as military retired pay, Foreign Service retirement benefits or Central Intelligence Agency retirement benefits, does not satisfy the requirements of § 838.303(b)(1) or § 838.502(b)(1).
(1) A court order that mistakenly labels CSRS benefits as FERS benefits and vice versa satisfies the requirements of §§ 838.303(b)(1) and 838.502(b)(1).
(2) Unless the court order expressly provides otherwise, for employees transferring to FERS, court orders directed at CSRS benefits apply to the entire FERS basic benefit, including the CSRS component, if any. Such a court order satisfies the requirements of §§ 838.303(b)(1) and 838.502(b)(1).
(c) A court order affecting military retired pay, even when military retired pay has been waived for inclusion in CSRS annuities, does not award a former spouse a portion of an employee annuity or a refund of employee contributions under CSRS or FERS. Such a court order does not satisfy the requirements of § 838.303(b)(1) or § 838.502(b)(1).
§ 838.612
Distinguishing between annuities and contributions.
(a) A court order that uses terms such as “annuities,” “pensions,” “retirement benefits,” or similar terms, without distinguishing between phased retirement annuity payable to a phased retiree, or composite retirement annuity payable to a phased retiree upon entry into full retirement status, and employee annuity payable to a retiree, satisfies the requirements of §§ 838.303(b)(2) and 838.502(b)(2) for purposes of dividing any employee annuity or a refund of employee contributions.
(b)(1) A court order using “contributions,” “deductions,” “deposits,” “retirement accounts,” “retirement fund,” or similar terms satisfies the requirements of § 838.502(b)(2) and may be used only to divide the amount of contributions that the employee has paid into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.
(2) Unless the court order specifically states otherwise, when an employee annuity is payable, a court order using the terms specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section satisfies the requirements of § 838.303(b)(2) and awards the former spouse a benefit to be paid in equal monthly installments at 50 percent of the gross annuity beginning on the date the employee annuity commences or the date of the court order, whichever comes later, until the specific dollar amount is reached.
[79 FR 46627, Aug. 8, 2014]

# Computation of Benefits
§ 838.621
Prorata share.
(a)
Pro rata share
means one-half of the fraction whose numerator is the number of months of Federal civilian and military service that the employee performed during the marriage and whose denominator is the total number of months of Federal civilian and military service performed by the employee through the day before the effective date of phased retirement or separation for retirement, as applicable to the annuity calculation. In the computation of the division of phased retirement annuity and a composite retirement annuity, a pro rata share will be computed through the day before the effective date of an employee's phased retirement for the computation of the division of a phased retirement annuity and then recomputed for division of the composite retirement annuity under §§ 831.1742 and 848.502.
(b) A court order that awards a former spouse a prorata share of an employee annuity or a refund of employee contributions by using the term
“prorata share” and identifying the date when the marriage began satisfies the requirements of §§ 838.305 and 838.504 and awards the former spouse a prorata share as defined in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) A court order that awards a portion of an employee annuity as of a specified date before the employee's phased retirement or retirement awards the former spouse a pro rata share as defined in paragraph (a) of this section.
(d) A court order that awards a portion of the “value” of an annuity as of a specific date before retirement, without specifying what “value” is, awards the former spouse a prorata share as defined in paragraph (a) of this section.
[57 FR 33574, July 29, 1992, as amended at 79 FR 46627, Aug. 8, 2014]
§ 838.622
Cost-of-living and salary adjustments.
(a)(1) A court order that awards adjustments to a former spouse's portion of an employee annuity stated in terms such as “cost-of-living adjustments” or “Cola's” occurring after the date of the decree but before the date of phased retirement or retirement provides increases equal to the adjustments described in or effected under 5 U.S.C. 8340 or 8462.
(2) A court order that awards adjustments to a former spouse's portion of an employee annuity stated in terms such as “salary adjustments” or “pay adjustments” occurring after the date of the decree provides increases equal to the adjustments described in or effected under 5 U.S.C. 5303, until the date the individual enters phased retirement status or retires.
(b)(1) Unless the court order directly and unequivocally orders otherwise, a court order that awards a former spouse a portion of an employee annuity either on a percentage basis or by use of a fraction or formula provides that the former spouse's share of the employee annuity will be adjusted to maintain the same percentage or fraction whenever the employee annuity changes as a result of—
(i) Salary adjustments occurring after the date of the decree and before the employee retires; and
(ii) Cost-of-living adjustments occurring after the date of the decree and after the date of the employee's retirement.
(2) A court order that awards a former spouse a specific dollar amount from the employee annuity prevents the former spouse from benefiting from salary and cost-of-living adjustments after the date of the decree, unless the court expressly orders their inclusion.
(c)(1)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a court order that contains a general instruction to calculate the former spouse's share effective at the time of divorce or separation entitles the former spouse to the benefit of salary adjustments occurring after the specified date to the same extent as the employee.
(ii) To prevent the application of salary adjustments after the date of the divorce or separation, the court order must either state the exact dollar amount of the award to the former spouse or specifically instruct OPM not to apply salary adjustments after the specified date in computing the former spouse's share of the employee annuity.
(2)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a court order that requires OPM to compute a benefit as of a specified date before the employee's phased retirement or retirement, and specifically instructs OPM not to apply salary adjustments after the specified date in computing the former spouse's share of an employee annuity, provides that the former spouse is entitled to the application of cost-of-living adjustments after the date the individual enters phased retirement status or retires (if the employee does not enter phased retirement status first), in the manner described in § 838.241.
(ii) To award cost-of-living adjustments between a specified date and the employee's phased retirement or retirement, the court order must specifically instruct OPM to adjust the former spouse's share of the employee annuity by any cost-of-living adjustments occurring between the specified date and the date the employee enters phased retirement status or retires (if the employee does not enter phased retirement status first).
(iii) To prevent the application of cost-of-living adjustments that occur after the employee annuity begins to accrue to the former spouse's share of the employee annuity, the decree must either state the exact dollar amount of the award to the former spouse or specifically instruct OPM not to apply cost-of-living adjustments occurring after the date the employee enters phased retirement status or retires (if the employee does not enter phased retirement status first).
[57 FR 33574, July 29, 1992, as amended at 79 FR 46627, Aug. 8, 2014]
§ 838.623
Computing lengths of service.
(a) Sections 838.242 and 838.441 contain information on how OPM calculates lengths of service.
(b) Unless the court order otherwise expressly directs—
(1) For the purpose of describing a period of time to be excluded from any element of a computation, the term “military service” means military service as defined in section 8331(13) of title 5, United States Code, and does not include civilian service with the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard; and
(2) For the purpose of describing a period of time to be included in any element of a computation, the term “military service” means all periods of military and civilian service performed with the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard.
(c)(1) When a court order directed at employee annuity (other than a phased retirement annuity or a composite retirement annuity) contains a formula for dividing employee annuity that requires a computation of service worked as of a date prior to separation and using terms such as “years of service,” “total service,” “service performed,” or similar terms, the time attributable to unused sick leave will not be included.
(2) When a court order directed at employee annuity other than a phased retirement annuity or a composite retirement annuity contains a formula for dividing employee annuity that requires a computation of “creditable service” (or some other phrase using “credit” or its equivalent) as of a date prior to retirement, unused sick leave will be included in the computation as follows:
(i) If the amount of unused sick leave is specified, the court order awards a portion of the employee annuity equal to the monthly employee annuity at retirement times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months of “creditable service” as of the date specified plus the number of months of unused sick leave specified (which sum is rounded to eliminate partial months) and whose denominator is the months of “creditable service” used in the retirement computation.
(ii) If the amount of unused sick leave is not specified, the court order awards a portion of the employee annuity equal to the monthly rate at the time of retirement times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months of “creditable service” as of the date specified (no sick leave included) and whose denominator is the number of months of “creditable service” used in the retirement computation (sick leave included).
(d)(1) General language such as “benefits earned as an employee with the U.S. Postal Service * * *” provides only that CSRS or FERS retirement benefits are subject to division and does not limit the period of service included in the computation (i.e., service performed with other Government agencies will be included).
(2) To limit the computation of benefits other than a phased retirement annuity or a composite retirement annuity to a particular period of employment, the court order must—
(i) Use language expressly limiting the period of service to be included in the computation (e.g., “only U.S. Postal Service” or “exclusive of any service other than U.S. Postal Service employment”); or
(ii) Specify the number of months to be included in the computation; or
(iii) Describe specifically the period of service to be included in the computation (e.g., “only service performed during the period Petitioner and Defendant were married” or “benefits based on service performed through the date of divorce”).
(e) A court order directed at a phased retirement annuity or a composite retirement annuity cannot limit the computation and division of a phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity to a particular period of employment or service. A phased retirement annuity is based on an employee's service as of phased retirement and a “fully retired phased component,” described in §§ 831.1742 and 848.502, of a composite retirement annuity is based on a phased retiree's service as of his or her full retirement. A court order that attempts to limit the computation of a phased retirement annuity or a composite retirement annuity to a particular period of employment or service is not a court order acceptable for processing. If the former spouse's award of a portion of phased retirement annuity or a composite retirement annuity is to be limited, the limitation of the division must be accomplished in a manner other than by limiting the service to be used in the computation.
[57 FR 33574, July 29, 1992, as amended at 79 FR 46628, Aug. 8, 2014]
§ 838.624
Distinguishing between formulas and fixed amounts.
(a) A court order that contains both a formula or percentage instruction and a dollar amount is deemed to include the dollar amount only as the court's estimate of the initial amount of payment. The formula or percentage instruction controls.
(b) A court order that awards a portion of the “present value” of an employee annuity and specifically states the amount of either the “present value” of the employee annuity or of the award is deemed to give the former spouse “a specific dollar amount” that is payable from a monthly employee annuity and will be paid as a lump-sum award in accordance with § 838.235.
§ 838.625
Types of annuity.
(a) Terms that are synonymous with net annuity are—
(1) Disposable annuity; and
(2) Retirement check.
(b) Terms that are synonymous with self-only annuity are—
(1) Life rate annuity;
(2) Unreduced annuity; and
(3) Annuity without survivor benefit.
(c) All court orders that do not specify net annuity or self-only annuity apply to gross annuity.

# Model Paragraphs
Pt. 838, Subpt. F, App. A

# Appendix A to Subpart F of Part 838—Recommended Language for Court Orders Dividing Employee Annuities
This appendix provides recommended language for use in court orders attempting to divide employee annuity. A court order directed at employee annuity should include five elements:
• Identification of the benefits;
• Instructions that OPM pay the former spouse;
• A method for computing the amount of the former spouse's benefit;
• Identification of the type of annuity to which to apply a fraction, percentage or formula; and
• Instructions on what OPM should do if the employee leaves Federal service before retirement and applies for a refund of employee contributions.
The court order may also include instructions for disposition of the former spouse's share if the former spouse dies before the employee. By using the model language, courts will know that the court order will have the effect described in this appendix.
The model language in this appendix does not award a benefit that is payable after the death of the employee. A separate, distinct award of a former spouse survivor annuity is necessary to award a former spouse a benefit that is payable after the death of the employee. Appendix A to subpart I of this part contains model language for awarding survivor annuities and contains some examples that award both a portion of an employee annuity and a survivor annuity.
The model language uses the terms “[former spouse]” to identify the spouse who is receiving a former spouse's portion of an employee annuity and “[employee]” to identify the Federal employee whose employment was covered by the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees Retirement System. Obviously, in drafting an actual court order the appropriate terms, such as “Petitioner” and “Respondent,” or the names of the parties should replace “[former spouse]” and “[employee].”
Similarly, the models are drafted for employees covered by the Civil Service Retirement System. The name of the retirement system should be changed for employees covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System.

# 000 Series—Special technical provisions.
¶ 001 Language required in Qualified Domestic Relations Orders.
Using the following paragraph will expressly state that the provisions of the court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are governed by this part. A court order directed at employee annuity (or awarding a survivor annuity) that is labelled a “Qualified Domestic Relations Order” or is issued on an ERISA form will not be automatically rendered unacceptable under § 838.302(a) or § 838.803(a) if the court order contains the following paragraph.
“The court has considered the requirements and standard terminology provided in part 838 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations. The terminology used in the provisions of this order that concern benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System are governed by the standard conventions established in that part.”

# 100 Series—Identification of the benefits and instructions that OPM pay the former spouse.
¶ 101 Identifying retirement benefits and directing OPM to pay the former spouse.
Using the following paragraph will expressly divide employee annuity to satisfy the requirements of § 838.303 and direct OPM to pay the former spouse a share of an employee annuity to satisfy the requirements of § 838.304.
“[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. [Insert language for computing the former spouse's share from 200 series of this appendix.] The
United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].”
¶ 102-110
[Reserved]
¶ 111 Protecting a former spouse entitled to military retired pay.
Using the following paragraph will protect the former spouse interest in military retired pay in the event that the employee waives the military retired pay to allow crediting the military service under CSRS or FERS. The paragraph should be used only if the former spouse is awarded a portion of the military retired pay. “If [Employee] waives military retired pay to credit military service under the Civil Service Retirement System, [insert language for computing the former spouse's share from 200 series of this appendix]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].”

# 200 Series—Computing the amount of the former spouse's benefits.
Paragraphs 201 through 204 contain model language for the most common types of wards that court orders make to former spouses. Subsequent paragraphs in the 200 series contain model language for less common, more complex awards.
Awards other than fixed amounts require that the court order specify the type of annuity (“gross,” “net,” or self-only) on which the award is computed. The types of annuity are defined in § 838.103. Variations on type of annuity are covered by the 300 series of this appendix.
¶ 201 Award of a fixed monthly amount.
Using the following paragraph will award the former spouse a fixed monthly amount. OPM will not apply COLA's to a fixed monthly amount unless the court order expressly directs that OPM and COLA's using the language in ¶ 231 of this appendix or similar language.
“[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. [Former spouse] is entitled to $[insert a number] per month from [employee]'s civil service retirement benefits. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].”
¶ 202 Award of a percentage.
Using the following paragraph will award the former spouse a stated percentage of the employee annuity. Unless the court order expressly directly that OPM not add COLA's to the former spouse's share of the employee annuity, OPM will add COLA's to keep the former spouse's share at the stated percentage. Paragraph 232 of this appendix provides language for excluding COLA's.
“[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. [Former spouse] is entitled to [insert a number] percent of [employee]'s [insert “gross,” “net,” or “self-only”] monthly annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].”
¶ 203 Award of a fraction.
Using the following paragraph will award the former spouse a stated fraction of the employee annuity. Unless the court order expressly directly that OPM not add COLA's to the former spouse's share of the employee annuity, OPM will add COLA's to keep the former spouse's share at the stated percentage. Paragraph 232 of this appendix provides language for excluding COLA's.
“[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. [Former spouse] is entitled to [insert fraction]ths of [employee]'s [insert “gross,” “net,” or “self-only”] monthly annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].”
¶ 204 Award of a prorata share.
Using the following paragraph will award the former spouse a prorata share of the employee annuity. Prorata share is defined in § 838.621. To award a prorata share the court order must state the date of the marriage. Unless the court order specifies a different ending date, the marriage ends for computation purposes on the date that the court order is filed with the court clerk. Unless the court order expressly directs that OPM not add COLA's to the former spouse's share of the employee annuity, OPM will add COLA's to keep the former spouse's share at the stated percentage. Paragraph 232 of this appendix provides language for excluding COLA's.
“[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. [Former spouse] is entitled to a prorata share of [employee]'s [insert ‘gross,’ ‘net,’ or self-only] monthly annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. The marriage began on [insert date]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].”
¶ 205-210
[Reserved]
¶ 211 Award based on a stated formula.
Using the following paragraphs will award the former spouse a share of the employee
annuity based on a formula stated in the court order. The formula must be stated in the court order (including a court-approved property settlement agreement). The formula may not be incorporated by reference to a statutory provision or a court decision in another case. If the court order uses a formula, the court order must include any data that is necessary for OPM to apply the formula unless the necessary data is contained in normal OPM files.
“[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. [Former spouse] is entitled to a share of [employee]'s [insert ‘gross,’ ‘net,’ or self-only] monthly annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System to be computed as follows: [Insert formula for computing the former spouse's share.]”
“The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].”
¶¶ 212-217 Award of phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity.
A court order may include an award directed at (1) phased retirement annuity payable to a phased retiree, to address the possibility that an employee will enter phased retirement status; (2) composite retirement annuity payable to a phased retiree at entry into full retirement status, to address the possibility that an employee will enter phased retirement status and then enter full retirement status; or (3) annuity payable to an employee who retires without having elected phased retirement status.
A general non-specific award will apply to any employee annuity payable, including phased retirement annuity and composite retirement annuity (
see
¶¶ 201-211). For example, an award dividing employee annuity that uses terms such as “annuities,” “pensions,” “retirement benefits,” or similar general terms, would apply to all types of employee annuity.
To separately provide for division of phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity, a provision of a court order must expressly state that it is directed at “phased retirement annuity” or “composite retirement annuity,” and must indicate the share of employee annuity as a formula, percentage, or fraction. That is, it must state the type of annuity to be divided (e.g., “net phased retirement annuity”). If such a provision is unclear as to whether it is directed at gross, net, or self-only phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity, the provision will be applied to gross phased retirement annuity or gross composite retirement annuity.
It should be noted that a former spouse survivor annuity cannot be awarded from a phased retirement annuity; therefore, a phased retirement annuity is not subject to reduction to provide a former spouse survivor annuity. As a consequence, an award dividing either “self-only phased retirement annuity” or a “gross phased retirement annuity” would be directed at identical annuities. However, a former spouse survivor annuity can be awarded from a composite retirement annuity payable to a phased retiree at entry into full retirement status (i.e., when the “phased retiree” enters full retirement status and becomes a “retiree”); therefore, there would be a difference between an award of a share of “self-only composite retirement annuity” and an award of a share of “gross composite retirement annuity.”
Due to the complexity of the benefits, care should be taken in drafting separate awards of phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity. It should also be noted, for example, that an award directed only at the division of phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity payable to a phased retiree will not be effective to divide annuity payable to an employee who retires in the usual manner, without having entered phased retirement status first. If separate awards of phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity are to be provided, consideration should be given to including provisions in the paragraph addressing the possibility that the employee may retire in the usual manner without entering phased retirement status before fully retiring. Similarly, if employee annuity is only to be awarded in the event the employee retires in the usual manner, without entering phased retirement status before fully retiring, consideration should be given to including specific language to that effect.
¶ 212 Award of phased retirement annuity and composite retirement annuity while providing for the possibility that the employee retires in the usual manner without entering phased retirement status before fully retiring.
Using the following paragraph will award phased retirement annuity and composite retirement annuity and provides for the possibility that the employee retires in the usual manner without entering phased retirement status:
“[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. If [employee] enters phased retirement status, the [former spouse] is entitled to a [insert description of percentage, fraction, formula, or insert term `pro rata share'] of [employee]'s [insert `gross,' `net,' or `self-only'] monthly phased retirement annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. When [employee] enters full retirement status and receives a composite retirement annuity, [former spouse] is awarded [insert language awarding fraction,
formula, or `pro rata share'] of [employee]'s monthly [insert “gross,” “net” or “self-only”] composite retirement annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. If [employee] retires from employment with the United States Government without entering phased retirement status before fully retiring, [former spouse] is entitled to [insert appropriate language from 200 series or 300 series paragraphs] under the Civil Service Retirement System. The marriage began on [insert date]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].”
¶ 213 Award of composite retirement annuity while providing for the possibility that the employee retires in the usual manner without entering phased retirement status, but not providing for award of phased retirement annuity.
Using the following will award composite retirement annuity when an employee enters phased retirement status and subsequently enters full retirement status, and provides for the possibility that the employee retires in the usual manner without having entered phased retirement status; however, the paragraph will not award a phased retirement annuity when the employee enters phased retirement status:
“[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. If [employee] enters phased retirement status and subsequently enters full retirement status, the [former spouse] is entitled to a [insert description of percentage, fraction, formula, or insert term `pro rata share'] of [employee]'s [insert `gross,' `net,' or `self-only'] monthly composite retirement annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. If [employee] retires from employment with the United States Government without entering phased retirement status before fully retiring, [former spouse] is entitled to [insert appropriate language from 200 series or 300 series paragraphs] under the Civil Service Retirement System. The marriage began on [insert date]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].”
¶ 214 Award of employee annuity when the employee retires in the usual manner, without providing for the possibility that the employee enters phased retirement status and full retirement status.
Use the following paragraph if the former spouse is only to be awarded a portion of the employee's annuity when the employee retires in the usual manner, without an award of a portion of the employee's phased retirement annuity or composite retirement annuity in the event that the employee enters phased retirement status. It should be noted, however, that if this conditional clause provided below is used in an appropriate 200 or 300 series paragraph without a conditional award of a portion of phased retirement annuity and composite retirement annuity, the former spouse will not receive a portion of the employee's annuity if the employee enters phased retirement status and then enters full retirement status:
“If [employee] retires from employment with the United States Government without entering phased retirement status before fully retiring, [former spouse] is awarded [insert remaining language for the paragraph from the appropriate 200 series or 300 series]. . . The marriage began on [insert date]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].”
¶ 215 Award of phased retirement annuity and composite retirement annuity, without providing for the possibility that the employee retires in the usual manner without having entered phased retirement status and full retirement status.
Use the following paragraph to award only phased retirement annuity and composite retirement annuity. This paragraph will not award benefits if the employee retires in the usual manner without entering phased retirement status:
“[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. If [employee] enters phased retirement status, the [former spouse] is entitled to a [insert description of percentage, fraction, formula, or insert term `pro rata share'] of [employee]'s monthly [insert `gross,' `net,' or `self-only'] phased retirement annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. When [employee] enters full retirement status and receives a composite retirement annuity, [former spouse] is awarded [insert language awarding percentage, fraction, formula, or pro rata share] of [employee]'s monthly [insert “gross,” “net” or “self-only”] composite retirement annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. The marriage began on [insert date]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].”
¶ 216 Award of only phased retirement annuity, but not awarding composite retirement annuity when the employee enters full retirement status or providing for the possibility that the employee retires in the usual manner without entering phased retirement status before fully retiring.
Using the following will award only phased retirement annuity. This paragraph will not award composite retirement annuity when the employee enters full retirement status nor will it provide for the possibility that
the employee retires in the usual manner without entering phased retirement status. It should be noted that if this paragraph is used, the former spouse will not receive a portion of the employee's annuity benefits if the employee retires in the usual manner without entering phased retirement status first:
“[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. If [employee] enters phased retirement status, the [former spouse] is entitled to a [insert description of percentage, fraction, formula, or insert term `pro rata share'] of [employee]'s [insert `gross,' `net,' or `self-only'] monthly phased retirement annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. The marriage began on [insert date]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].”
¶ 217 Award of only composite retirement annuity when employee enters full retirement status following phased retirement, but not awarding phased retirement annuity when the employee enters phased retirement status or providing for the possibility that the employee retires in the usual manner without entering phased retirement status before fully retiring.
Using the following will award only composite retirement annuity when the employee enters full retirement status following phased retirement. This paragraph will not award phased retirement annuity when the employee enters phased retirement status nor will it provide for the possibility that the employee retires in the usual manner without entering phased retirement status. It should be noted that if this paragraph is used, the former spouse will not receive a portion of the employee's annuity benefits if the employee retires without entering full retirement status from phased retirement status:
“[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. If [employee] enters phased retirement status and enters full retirement status, the [former spouse] is entitled to a [insert description of percentage, fraction, formula, or insert term `pro rata share'] of [employee]'s [insert `gross,' `net,' or `self-only'] monthly composite retirement annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. The marriage began on [insert date]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].”
¶ 218-230
¶ 231 Awarding COLA's on fixed monthly amounts.
Using the following paragraph will award COLA's in addition to a fixed monthly amount to the former spouse. The model awards COLA's at the same rate applied to the employee annuity.
“[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. [Former spouse] is entitled to $[insert a number] per month from [employee]'s civil service retirement benefits. When COLA's are applied to [employee]'s retirement benefits, the same COLA applies to [former spouse]'s share. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].”
¶ 232 Excluding COLA's on awards other than fixed monthly amounts.
Using the following paragraph will prevent application of COLA's to a former spouse's share of an employee annuity in cases where the former spouse has been awarded a percentage, fraction or pro rata share of the employee annuity, rather than a fixed dollar amount.
“[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. [Insert language for computing the former spouse's share from ¶ 202, ¶ 203, ¶ 204, ¶ 211, or ¶¶ 212-217 of this appendix.] The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to determine the amount of [former spouse]'s share on the date [insert `when [employee] retires or enters phased retirement status' or if the employee has not retired or entered phased retirement status, or `of this order' if the employee is already retired or entered phased retirement status] and not to apply COLA's to that amount. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].”

# 300 Series—Type of Annuity
Awards of employee annuity to a former spouse (other than awards of fixed dollar amounts) must specify whether OPM will use the “phased retirement annuity,” “composite retirement annuity,” “gross annuity,” “net annuity,” or “self-only annuity” as defined in § 838.103 (see also § 838.306) in determining the amount of the former spouse's entitlement. The court order may contain a formula that has the effect of creating other types of annuity, but the court order may only do this by providing a formula that starts from “phased retirement annuity,” “composite retirement annuity,” “gross annuity,” “net annuity,” or “self-only annuity” as defined in § 838.103.
¶ 301 Awards based on benefits actually paid.
The court order may include a formula that effectively uses the court's definition of net annuity rather than the one provided by § 838.103. For example, using the following paragraph will award the former spouse a prorata share of the employee annuity reduced only by the amount deducted as premiums for basic life insurance under the Federal Employee Group Life Insurance Program.
“[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United States Government. [Former spouse] is entitled to a prorata share of [employee]'s monthly annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System, where monthly annuity means the self-only annuity less the amount deducted as premiums for basic life insurance under the Federal Employee Group Life Insurance Program. The marriage began on [insert date]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].”
¶ 302-310
[Reserved]
¶ 311 Awards of earned annuity in cases where the actual annuity is based on disability.
Using the following paragraph will award a former spouse a prorata share of what the employee annuity would have been based on only the employee's actual service in cases where the actual employee annuity is based on disability. The paragraph also allows the court order to provide for the former spouse's share to begin when the employee reaches a stated age, using age 62 as an example. As with all other formulas the court order must specify whether the computation applies to “gross,” “net,” or self-only annuity. OPM will apply COLA's that occurred after the date of the disability retirement to the former spouse's share. The following paragraph should be used only for disability retirees under CSRS. Under FERS, section 8452 of title 5, United States Code, provides a formula for recomputation of disability annuities at age 62 to approximate an earned annuity. Therefore to award a portion of the “earned” benefit under FERS add the introductory phrase, “Starting when [employee] reaches age 62,” to the paragraph describing how to compute the amount.
“[Employee] is (or will be) eligible for retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System based on employment with the United State's Government. Starting when [employee] reaches age 62, [former spouse] is entitled to a prorata share of [employee]'s [insert “gross,” “net,” or self-only] monthly annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System, where monthly annuity means the amount of [employee]'s monthly annuity computed as though [employee] had retired on an immediate, nondisability annuity on the commencing date of [employee]'s annuity based on disability. In computing the amount of the immediate annuity, the United States Office of Personnel Management will deem [employee] to have been age 62 at the time that [employee] retired on disability. The marriage began on [insert date]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].”

# 400 Series—Refunds of employee contributions.
Court orders that award a former spouse a portion of a future employee annuity of an employee who is not then eligible to retire should include an additional paragraph containing instructions that tell OPM what to do if the employee separates before becoming eligible to retire and requests a refund of employee contributions. The court order may award the former spouse a portion of the refund of employee contributions or bar payment of the refund of employee contributions.
¶ 401 Barring payment of a refund of employee contributions.
Using the following paragraph will bar payment of the refund of employee contributions if payment of the refund of employee contributions would extinguish the former spouse's entitlement to a portion of the employee annuity. “The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed not to pay [employee] a refund of employee contributions.”
¶ 402 Dividing a refund of employee contributions.
Using the following paragraph will allow the refund of employee contributions to be paid but will award a prorata share of the refund of employee contributions to the former spouse. The sentence on the beginning date of the marriage is unnecessary if the beginning is stated elsewhere in the order. The award of a prorata share is used only as an example; the court order could provide another fraction, percentage, or formula, or a fixed amount. Note that a refund of employee contributions voids the employee's rights to an employee annuity and the former spouse's right to any portion of that annuity.
“If [employee] becomes eligible and applies for a refund of employee contributions, [former spouse] is entitled to a prorata share of the refund of employee contributions. The marriage began on [insert date]. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share directly to [former spouse].”

# 500 Series—Death of the former spouse.
¶ 501 Full annuity restored to the retiree.
No special provision is necessary to restore the entire annuity to the retiree upon the death of the former spouse. Unless the court order expressly provides otherwise, OPM will pay the former spouse's share to the retiree after the death of the former spouse.
¶ 502 Former spouse share paid to children.
Using the following paragraph will award the former spouse's share of an employee annuity to the children, including any adopted children, of the employee and former spouse.
“If [former spouse] dies before [employee], the United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share of [employee]'s civil service retirement benefits to surviving children of the marriage including any adopted children, in equal shares. Upon the deaths of any child, that child's share will be distributed among the other surviving children.”
The language may be modified to terminate the payments to the children when they reach a stated age. A court order that includes such a provision for termination must include sufficient information (such as the children's dates of birth) to permit OPM to determine when the children's interest terminate. OPM will not consider evidence outside the court order (and normal OPM files) to establish the children's dates of birth.
¶ 503 Former spouse share paid to the court.
Using the following paragraph will provide for payment of the former spouse's share of an employee annuity to the court after the death of the former spouse. This would allow a court officer to administer the funds. “If [former spouse] dies before [employee], the United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay [former spouse]'s share of [employee]'s civil service retirement benefits to this court at the following address: “[Insert address where checks should be sent. The address may be up to six lines and should include sufficient information for court officials to credit the correct account.]”

[57 FR 33574, July 29, 1992, as amended at 58 FR 52882, Oct. 13, 1993]

This subpart regulates the requirements that a court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity must meet to be a court order acceptable for processing.

(b) In the case of a retiree who retired under CSRS before May 7, 1985, a court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity under CSRS is not a court order acceptable for processing unless the retiree was receiving a reduced annuity to provide a survivor annuity to benefit that spouse on May 7, 1985.
§ 838.803
Language not acceptable for processing.
(a)
Qualifying Domestic Relations Orders.
(1) Any court order labeled as a “qualified domestic relations order” or issued on a form for ERISA qualified domestic relations orders is not a court order acceptable for processing unless the court order expressly states that the provisions of the court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are governed by this part.
(2) When a court order is required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section to state that the provisions of a court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are governed by this part the court order must—
(i) Expressly refer to part 838 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, and
(ii) Expressly state that the provisions of the court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are drafted in accordance with the terminology used in this part.
(3) Although any language satisfying the requirement of paragraph (a) (2) of this section is sufficient to prevent a court order from being unacceptable under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, OPM recommends the use of the language provided in ¶ 001 in appendix A to subpart F of this part to state that the provisions of the court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are governed by this part.
(4) A court order directed at employee annuity that contains the language described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section must also satisfy all other requirements of this subpart to be a court order acceptable for processing.
(b)
Employee annuity cannot continue after the death of the retiree.
Any court order that provides that the former spouse's portion of the employee annuity shall continue after the death of
the employee or retiree, by using language such as “will continue to receive benefits after the death of” the employee, that the former spouse “will continue to receive benefits for his (or her) lifetime,” or “that benefits will continue after the death of” the employee, but does not use terms such as “survivor annuity,” “death benefits,” “former spouse annuity,” or similar terms is not a court order acceptable for processing.
(c) A court order that attempts to award a former spouse survivor annuity based on a phased retirement annuity or to reduce a phased retirement annuity to provide survivor benefits is not a court order acceptable for processing.
[57 FR 33574, July 29, 1992, as amended at 79 FR 46631, Aug. 8, 2014]
§ 838.804
Court orders must expressly award a former spouse survivor annuity or expressly direct an employee or retiree to elect to provide a former spouse survivor annuity.

(b) To provide sufficient instructions and information for OPM to compute the amount of a former spouse survivor annuity as required by paragraph (a) of this section, if the court order uses a formula to determine the former spouse survivor annuity, it must not use any variables whose values are not readily ascertainable from the face of the court order or normal OPM files.
(c) A court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity is not a court order acceptable for processing if OPM would have to examine a State statute or court decision (on a different case) to understand, establish, or evaluate the formula for computing the former spouse survivor annuity.
§ 838.806
Amended court orders.
(a) A court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity is not a court order acceptable for processing if it is issued after the date of retirement or death of the employee and modifies or replaces the first order dividing the marital property of the employee or retiree and the former spouse.

(1) Issued on a day prior to the date of retirement or date of death of the employee; or
(2) The first order dividing the marital property of the retiree and the former spouse.
(c) A court order that awards a former spouse survivor annuity and
that is issued after the first order dividing the marital property of the retiree and the former spouse has been vacated, set aside, or otherwise declared invalid is not a court order acceptable for processing if—
(1) It is issued after the date of retirement or death of the retiree;
(2) It changes any provision concerning a former spouse survivor annuity in the court order that was vacated, set aside or otherwise declared invalid; and
(3)(i) The court order is effective prior to the date when it is issued; or

(1) The date that the employee files an application for retirement; or
(2) The effective commencing date for the employee's annuity other than the commencing date of a phased retirement annuity.

(f)(1) In this section, the “first order dividing the marital property of the retiree and the former spouse” means—
(i) The original written order that first ends (or first documents an oral order ending) the marriage if the court divides any marital property (or approves a property settlement agreement that divides any marital property) in that order, or in any order issued before that order); or
(ii) The original written order issued after the marriage has been terminated in which the court first divides any marital property (or first approves a property settlement agreement that divides any marital property) if no marital property has been divided prior to the issuance of that order.

(i) Any court order that amends, explains, clarifies, or interprets the original written order regardless of the effective date of the court order making the amendment, explanation, clarification, or interpretation; or

# Subpart I—Terminology Used in Court Orders Awarding Former Spouse Survivor Annuities

# Regulatory Structure
§ 838.901
Purpose and scope.
(a) This subpart regulates the meaning of terms necessary to award a former spouse survivor annuity in a court order, and for OPM to determine whether a court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity is a court order acceptable for processing and the amount of the former spouse survivor annuity.
(b)(1) This subpart establishes a uniform meaning to be used for terms and phrases frequently used in awarding a former spouse survivor annuity.
(2) This subpart informs the legal community about the definition to be applied to terms used in court orders, to permit the resulting orders to be more carefully drafted, using the proper language to accomplish the aims of the court.
(c)(1) To assist attorneys and courts in preparing court orders that OPM can honor in the manner that the court intends, appendix A of this subpart contains model language to accomplish many of the more common objectives associated with the award of a former spouse survivor annuity.
(2) By using the language in appendix A of this subpart, the court, attorneys, and parties will know that the court order will be acceptable for processing and that OPM will treat the terminology used in the court order in the manner stated in the appendix.

# Identification of Benefits
§ 838.911
Identifying the retirement system.
(a) To satisfy the requirements of § 838.804(b)(1), a court order must contain language identifying the retirement system affected. For example, “CSRS,” “FERS,” “OPM,” or “Federal Government” survivor benefits, or “survivor benefits payable based on service with the U.S. Department of Agriculture,” etc., are sufficient identification of the retirement system.
(b) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, language referring to benefits under another retirement system, such as military retired pay, Foreign Service retirement benefits and Central Intelligence Agency retirement benefits, does not satisfy the requirements of § 838.804(b)(1).
(1) A court order that mistakenly labels CSRS benefits as FERS benefits and vice versa satisfies the requirements of § 838.804(b)(1).
(2) Unless the court order expressly provides otherwise, for employees transferring to FERS, court orders directed at CSRS benefits apply to this entire FERS basic benefit, including the CSRS component, if any. Such a court order satisfies the requirements of § 838.804(b)(1).
