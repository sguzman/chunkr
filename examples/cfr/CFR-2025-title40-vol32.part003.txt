Alternative in-use weighting factors for dual fuel model types.
Using one of the methods in either paragraph (k)(1) or (2) of this section, manufacturers may request the use of alternative values for the weighting factor F in the equations in paragraphs (j)(2)(vi) and (vii) of this section. Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, the manufacturer must use the value of F that is in effect in paragraphs (j)(2)(vi) and (vii) of this section.
(1) Upon written request from a manufacturer, the Administrator will determine and publish by written guidance an appropriate value of F for each requested alternative fuel based on the Administrator's assessment of real-world use of the alternative fuel. Such published values would be available for any manufacturer to use. The Administrator will periodically update these values upon written request from a manufacturer.
(2) The manufacturer may optionally submit to the Administrator its own demonstration regarding the real-world use of the alternative fuel in their vehicles and its own estimate of the appropriate value of F in the equations in paragraphs (j)(2)(vi) and (vii) of this section. Depending on the nature of the analytical approach, the manufacturer could provide estimates of F that are model type specific or that are generally applicable to the manufacturer's dual fuel fleet. The manufacturer's analysis could include use of data gathered from on-board sensors and computers, from dual fuel vehicles in fleets that are centrally fueled, or from other sources. The analysis must be based on sound statistical methodology and must account for analytical uncertainty. Any approval by the Administrator will pertain to the use of values of F for the model types specified by the manufacturer.

(a) Except with advance approval of the Administrator, an automobile shall be considered domestically produced in any model year if it is included within a domestically produced car line (car line includes station wagons for purposes of this paragraph), unless the assembly of such automobile is completed in Canada or Mexico and such automobile is not imported into the United States prior to the expiration of 30 days following the end of the model year. For purposes of this paragraph a car line will be considered domestically produced if the following ratio is less than 0.25:
(1) The sum of the declared value, as defined in § 600.502, of all of the imported components installed or included on automobiles produced within such a car line within a given model year plus the cost of transportation and insuring such components to the United States port of entry, the Mexican port of entry (when paragraph (b)(3) of this section applies), or the Canadian port of entry but exclusive of any customs duty, divided by
(2) The cost of production, as defined in § 600.502, of automobiles within such car line.
(b) For the purposes of calculations under this subpart with respect to automobiles manufactured during any model year,
(1) An average exchange rate for the country of origin of each imported component shall be used that is calculated by taking the mean of the exchange rates in effect at the end of each quarter set by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for twelve calendar quarters prior to and including the calendar quarter ending one year prior to the date that the manufacturer submits the calculation of the preliminary average for such model year. Such rate, once calculated, shall be in effect for the duration of the model year. Upon petition of a manufacturer, the Administrator may permit the use of a different exchange rate where appropriate and necessary.
(2) For automobiles for which paragraph (b)(3) of this section does not
apply pursuant to the schedule in paragraph (b)(4), components shall be considered imported unless they are either:
(i) Wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of the United States and/or Canada, or
(ii) Substantially transformed in the United States or Canada into a new and different article of commerce.
(3) For automobiles for which this paragraph applies pursuant to the schedule in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, components shall be considered imported unless they are either:
(i) Wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of the United States and/or Canada and/or Mexico, or
(ii) Substantially transformed in the United States and/or Canada and/or Mexico into a new and different article of commerce.
(4) Paragraphs (b)(4) (i) through (v) of this section set forth the schedule according to which paragraph (b)(3) of this section applies for all automobiles manufactured by a manufacturer and sold in the United States, wherever assembled.
(i) With respect to a manufacturer that initiated the assembly of automobiles in Mexico before model year 1992, the manufacturer may elect, at any time between January 1, 1997, and January 1, 2004, to have paragraph (b)(3) of this section apply to all automobiles it manufactures, beginning with the model year commencing after the date of such election.
(ii) With respect to a manufacturer initiating the assembly of automobiles in Mexico after model year 1991, paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall apply to all automobiles it manufactures, beginning with the model year commencing after January 1, 1994, or the model year commencing after the date that the manufacturer initiates the assembly of automobiles in Mexico, whichever is later.
(iii) With respect to a manufacturer not described by paragraph (b)(4) (i) or (ii) of this section assembling automobiles in the United States or Canada but not in Mexico, the manufacturer may elect, at any time between January 1, 1997, and January 1, 2004, to have paragraph (b)(3) of this section apply to all automobiles it manufactures, beginning with the model year commencing after the date of such election, except that if such manufacturer initiates the assembly of automobiles in Mexico before making such election, this paragraph shall not apply, and the manufacturer shall be subject to paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section.
(iv) With respect to a manufacturer not assembling automobiles in the United States, Canada, or Mexico, paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall apply to all automobiles it manufactures, beginning with the model year commencing after January 1, 1994.
(v) With respect to a manufacturer authorized to make an election under paragraph (b)(4) (i) or (iii) of this section which has not made that election within the specified period, paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall apply to all automobiles it manufactures, beginning with the model year commencing after January 1, 2004.
(5) All elections under paragraph (b)(4) of this section shall be made in accordance with the procedures established by the Secretary of Transportation pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 32904(b)(3)(C).
(c) If it is determined by the Administrator at some date later than the date of entry that the declared value of such imported components did not represent fair market value at the date of entry, through U.S. Bureau of Customs appraisals, the Administrator may review the determination made pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section as to whether the pertinent car lines which utilize such components were correctly included within the manufaturer's domestically-produced or foreign-produced fleets. If such a determination was in error due to misrepresentation of the valuation of imported components at the date of entry, the Administrator may recalculate the manufacturer's average for the affected model year, according to § 600.510, to reflect the correct valuation of such imported components in each affected car line.

§ 600.514-12
Reports to the Environmental Protection Agency.
This section establishes requirements for automobile manufacturers to submit reports to the Environmental Protection Agency regarding their efforts to reduce automotive greenhouse gas emissions.
(a)
General Requirements.
(1) For each model year, each manufacturer shall submit a pre-model year report.
(2) The pre-model year report required by this section for each model year must be submitted before the model year begins and before the certification of any test group, no later than December 31 of the calendar year two years before the model year. For example the pre-model year report for the 2012 model year must be submitted no later than December 31, 2010.
(3) Each report required by this section must:
(i) Identify the report as a pre-model year report;
(ii) Identify the manufacturer submitting the report;
(iii) State the full name, title, and address of the official responsible for preparing the report;
(iv) Be submitted to: Director, Compliance and Innovative Strategies Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2000 Traverwood, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105;
(v) Identify the current model year;
(vi) Be written in the English language; and
(vii) Be based upon all information and data available to the manufacturer approximately 30 days before the report is submitted to the Administrator.
(b)
Content of pre-model year reports.
(1) Each pre-model year report must include the following information for each compliance category for the applicable future model year and to the extent possible, two model years into the future:
(i) The manufacturer's estimate of its footprint-based fleet average CO
2
standards (including temporary lead time allowance alternative standards, if applicable);
(ii) Projected total and model-level production volumes for each applicable standard category;
(iii) Projected fleet average CO
2
compliance level for each applicable standard category; and the model-level CO
2
emission values which form the basis of the projection;
(iv) Projected fleet average CO
2
credit/debit status for each applicable standard category;
(v) A description of the various credit, transfer and trading options that will be used to comply with each applicable standard category, including the amount of credit the manufacturer intends to generate for air conditioning leakage, air conditioning efficiency, off-cycle technology, advanced technology vehicles, hybrid or low-emission full size pickup trucks, and various early credit programs;
(vi) A description of the method which will be used to calculate the carbon-related exhaust emissions for any electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles;
(vii) A summary by model year (beginning with the 2009 model year) of the number of electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, dedicated compressed natural gas vehicles, and dual fuel natural gas vehicles using (or projected to use) the advanced technology vehicle credit and incentives program, including the projected use of production multipliers;
(viii) The methodology which will be used to comply with N
2
O and CH
4
emission standards; and
(ix) Notification of the manufacturer's intent to exclude emergency vehicles from the calculation of fleet average standards and the end-of-year fleet average, including a description of the excluded emergency vehicles and the quantity of such vehicles excluded.
(x) Other information requested by the Administrator.
(2) Manufacturers must submit, in the pre-model year report for each model year in which a credit deficit is generated (or projected to be generated), a compliance plan demonstrating how the manufacturer will comply with the fleet average CO
2
standard by the end of the third year after the deficit occurred.

# Appendix II to Part 600—Sample Fuel Economy Calculations
(a) This sample fuel economy calculation is applicable to 1978 through 1987 model year automobiles.
(1) Assume that a gasoline-fueled vehicle was tested by the Federal Emission Test Procedure and the following results were calculated:
HC = .139 grams/mile
CO = 1.59 grams/mile
CO
2
= 317 grams/mile
According to the procedure in § 600.113-78, the city fuel economy or MPG
c
, for the vehicle may be calculated by substituting the HC, CO, and CO
2
grams/mile values into the following equation.
EC15NO91.202
MPG
c
= 27.7
(2) Assume that the same vehicle was tested by the Federal Highway Fuel Economy Test Procedure and calculation similar to that shown in paragraph (a) by this appendix resulted in a highway fuel economy or MPG
h
of 36.9. According to the procedure in § 600.113, the combined fuel economy (called MPG
c/h
) for the vehicle may be calculated by substituting the city and highway fuel economy values into the following equation:
EC15NO91.203
(b) This sample fuel economy calculation is applicable to 1988 and later model year automobiles.
(1) Assume that a gasoline-fueled vehicle was tested by the Federal Emission Test Procedure and the following results were calculated:
HC = .139 grams/mile.
CO = 1.59 grams/mile.
CO
2
= 317 grams/mile.
(2) Assume that the test fuel used for this test had the following properties:
SG = 0.745.
CWF = 0.868.
NHV = 18,478 Btu/lb.
(3) According to the procedure in § 600.113-08, the city fuel economy or MPG
c
, for the vehicle may be calculated by substituting the HC, CO, and CO
2
gram/mile values and the SG, CWF, and NHV values into the following equation:
MPG
c
= (5174 × 10
4
× CWF × SG) / [((CWF × HC) + (0.429 × CO + (0.273 × CO
2
)) ((0.6 × SG × NHV) + 5471)]
Example:
MPG
c
= (5174 × 10
4
× 0.868 × 0.745) / [(0.868 × .139 + 0.429 × 1.59 + 0.273 × 317)(0.6 × 0.745 × 18478 + 5471)]
MPG
c
= 27.9
(4) Assume that the same vehicle was tested by the Federal Highway Fuel Economy Test Procedure and a calculation similar to that shown in (b)(3) of this section resulted in a highway fuel economy of MPG
h
of 36.9. According to the procedure in § 600.210-08(c) or § 600.210-12(c), the combined fuel economy (called MPG
comb
) for the vehicle may be calculated by substituting the city and highway fuel economy values into the following equation:

Pt. 600, App. III

# Appendix III to Part 600—Sample Fuel Economy Label Calculation
Suppose that a manufacturer called Mizer Motors has a product line composed of eight car lines. Of these eight, four are available with the 3.0 liter, 6 cylinder, sequential multi-point fuel injection, 4-valve per cylinder, and 3-way catalyst engine. These four car lines are:
Ajax
Boredom III
Dodo
Castor (Station Wagon)
A. A car line is defined in subpart A (with additional guidance provided in EPA Advisory Circular 89) as a group of vehicles within a make or division which has a degree of commonality in construction. Car line does not consider any level of decor or opulence and is not generally distinguished by such characteristics as roofline, number of doors, seats, or windows. Station wagons and light duty trucks are, however, identified separately from the remainder of each car line. In other words, a Castor station wagon would be considered a different car line than the normal Castor car line made up of sedans, coupes, etc.
B. The engine considered here is defined as a basic engine in subpart A of this part (with additional guidance provided in EPA Advisory Circular 83A). A basic engine is a unique combination of manufacturer, engine displacement, number of cylinders, fuel system, catalyst usage and other engine and emission control system characteristics specified by the Administrator. A model type is a unique combination of car line, basic engine, and transmission class. Thus Ajax is a car line but Ajax 3.0 liter, 6 cylinder manual four-speed transmission is a model type whereas Ajax 3.0 liter, 6 cylinder automatic three-speed transmission is a different model type.
C. The following calculations provide an example of the procedures described in subpart C of this part for the calculation of vehicle configuration and model type fuel economy values. In order to simplify the presentation, only city fuel economy values are included (as determined by either the derived 5-cycle method or vehicle-specific 5-cycle based method). The procedure is identical for highway and combined fuel economy values.
Step I. Input data as supplied by the manufacturer or as determined from testing conducted by the Administrator.

The vehicle configuration fuel economy values, rounded to the nearest mile per gallon, are the fuel economy values that would be used on specific labels for that vehicle configuration.

Step III. Determine base level fuel economy values.
A. For all the base levels except the base level which includes 4,000 pound, manual four-speed transmission data, the base level fuel economy is as noted in Step II since only one vehicle configuration was tested within each of these base levels.
3,500 lb/M4 transmission
16.1001 mpg.
3,500 lb/A3 transmission
15.9020 mpg.
4,000 lb/A3 transmission
13.8138 mpg.
4,500 lb/A3 transmission
13.2203 mpg.
5,000 lb/A3 transmission
10.6006 mpg.
B. Since data from more than one vehicle configuration are included in the 4,000-pound, manual four-speed transmission base level, this fuel economy is harmonically averaged in proportion to the percentage of total sales of all vehicle configurations tested within that base level represented by each vehicle configuration tested within that base level.
ER27DE06.083
Base level: M4 transmission, 4000 pounds:
ER27DE06.084
Therefore, the 4000 pound, M4 transmission fuel economy is 14.6840 miles per gallon.
Note that the car line of the test vehicle using a given engine makes no difference—only the weight and transmission do.
Step IV. For each model type offered by the manufacturer with that basic engine, determine the sales fraction represented by each inertia weight/transmission class combination and the corresponding fuel economy.

0.2000 at 4,500 lb
13.2203
0.8000 at 5,000 lb
10.6006
Step V. Determine fuel economy for each model type (that is, car line/basic engine/transmission class combination).
Ajax, 3.0 liter, 6 cylinder, A3 transmission, model type MPG is calculated as follows:
ER27DE06.085
Similarly, Ajax and Dodo 3.0 liter, 6 cylinder, M4 model type MPG is calculated as follows:
ER27DE06.086
Dodo 3.0 liter, 6 cylinder, A3 model type MPG is calculated as follows:
ER27DE06.087
Boredom III 3.0 liter 6 cylinder M4 model type MPG = 14.6840 mpg, which rounds to 15 mi./gal
1
1
The model type fuel economy values rounded to the nearest mile per gallon, are the fuel economy values listed in the EPA Fuel Economy Guide and used on the general labels (window stickers) for production vehicles for that model year.
Boredom III 3.0 liter, 6 cylinder, A3 model type MPG is calculated as follows:
ER27DE06.088
Castor 3.0 liter, 6 cylinder, A3 model type MPG is calculated as follows:
ER27DE06.089
Note that even though no Dodo was actually tested, this approach permits its fuel economy figure to be estimated, based on the inertia weight distribution of projected Dodo sales within a specific engine and transmission grouping.

(a) Fuel economy labels must be printed on white or very light paper. Any label markings for which colors are not specified must be in black and white as shown. Some portions of the label must be filled with a blue or blue-shaded color as specified in subpart D of this part. Use the color blue defined in CMYK values of 40c-10m-0y-0k, or it may be specified as Pantone 283.
(b) Use a Univers font from Adobe or another source that properly reproduces the labels as shown in the samples. Use Light (L), Roman (R), Bold (B) or Black (Bl) font weights as noted. Font size is shown in points, followed by leading specifications in points to indicate line spacing (if applicable). Use white characters in black fields; use black characters in all other places. Unless noted otherwise, text is left-justified with a 1.6 millimeter margin. Some type may need tracking adjustments to fit in the designated space.
(c) Use the following conventions for lines and borders:
(1) Narrow lines defining the border or separating the main fields are 1.6 millimeter thick.
(2) Each rectangular shape or area, including the overall label outline, has an upper left corner that is square (0 radius). All other corners have a 3.2 millimeter radius.

§ 610.10
Program purpose.
(a) The purpose of an evaluation program initiated under these rules is to determine, in accordance with standardized procedures, the performance of various retrofit devices applicable to automobiles for which fuel economy improvement claims are made, and to compile and disseminate the results of the evaluation. It should be stressed that the role of this program will be the generation, analysis and dissemination of technical data, and not the approval or certification of retrofit devices.
(1) Through engineering or statistical analysis of data from vehicle tests, the evaluation program will determine the effects on fuel economy, exhaust emissions, durability and driveability of the applicable vehicles due to the installation or use of the devices. The evaluation program will also include additional procedures, whenever determined by the Administrator as necessary, to evaluate the durability of the devices themselves, their effects on vehicle durability or other effects only evident over the course of extended mileage accumulation.
(b) Data generated in an evaluation program by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are public information and will be published in the
Federal Register

(d) In the absence of sufficient information from the device manufacturer on this topic or if the Administrator's preliminary analysis indicates that testing is necessary to determine the nature or extent of possible adverse effects of device installation and use on vehicle operation and performance, the Administrator will require such tests to be conducted prior to the publication of a complete evaluation of the device.
[44 FR 17946, Mar. 23, 1979, as amended at 49 FR 18489, May 1, 1984]
§ 610.22
Device integrity.
The integrity of a device will be evaluated with respect to:
(a) The extent to which device manufacture is standardized by means of drawings, specifications, and other fabrication and quality assurance controls;
(b) The degree of sensitivity of device effectiveness to deterioration under exposure to normal operating conditions.
(c) The susceptibility of the device to deterioration of effectiveness under abnormal operating conditions;
(d) The effect upon its surroundings of device malfunction which may be reasonably anticipated to occur in actual use; and
(e) The extent to which test data support (b), (c) and (d).
§ 610.23
Operator interaction effects.
The device will also be evaluated with respect to:
(a) The degree of sensitivity of device effectiveness to variances in installation, operation and maintenance;
(b) The adequacy of manufacturer-furnished instructions for minimizing variances in installation, operation and maintenance;
(c) The extent to which device installation or use, or the effects of such installation or use, relate to Federal emission control regulations;
(d) Effects on the performance, safety, or occupant comfort of the retrofitted vehicle, and on that of other vehicles; and
(e) The relationship between total cost of ownership of the device (purchase price plus maintenance costs) and the cost savings realizable from its fuel economy effects.
§ 610.24
Validity of test data.
The Administrator will make a determination as to the validity of manufacturer-furnished test data on the basis of:
(a) The correlation between the test procedures used by the manufacturer or testing agent and the procedures prescribed in subpart D;
(b) The choice of test vehicle(s) as representative of the manufacturer's claim for operation and/or principles of operation;
(c) The degree of control exercised over ambient and operating conditions in the tests, including vehicle calibrations;
(d) Accuracy and precision of the measurement techniques and instrumentation used in the tests;
(e) Disclosure of all test data acquired on the device, whether representing positive, negative, or inconclusive results;
(f) Qualifications and independence of the testing agent; and
(g) The extent to which test data include evaluation of the durability of the device, or its effect on vehicle durability.
§ 610.25
Evaluation of test data.
Valid manufacturer-furnished test data will be evaluated with respect to:
(a) Vehicle applicability;
(b) Dependence of device effects upon vehicle type;
(c) Device effects on fuel economy, and on emissions, with statistical or other caveats as established by the data base;
(d) Definition of claims which can be made based on the available data; and
(e) Substantiation of specified claims made by the manufacturer.

# Subpart C—Test Requirement Criteria
§ 610.30
General.
(a) If the Administrator determines, by the criteria given in subpart B, that the claims made for a device are not supported by existing test data or other information, the Administrator will request the manufacturer to furnish additional information, and may design a test program to investigate those areas where claims appear to be erroneous or unsupported or where adverse effects due to use of the device are suspected.
(b) In cases where the Administrator determines on the basis of the preliminary analysis that a device either can have no significant beneficial effect on fuel economy, or will have an adverse effect on emissions, he may elect not to design a test program or test the device and to publish only his preliminary analysis and conclusions.
(c) If the evaluation was initiated upon application of a manufacturer (as described in § 610.12(c)) and the manufacturer elects not to have the device tested, the Administrator's preliminary analysis and conclusions will be published.
(d) For each device that the Agency intends to test, the Administrator will give the manufacturer prior notice by mail of the Agency's intent to test the device and provide the manufacturer the opportunity to attend the test sessions and to comment on the specific test design and results.
[44 FR 17946, Mar. 23, 1979, as amended at 49 FR 18489, May 1, 1984]
§ 610.31
Vehicle tests for fuel economy and exhaust emissions.
(a) The tests described in subpart D, E, or F may be conducted if existing data or other information are insufficient to support claims for a device in any of these areas:
(1) Degree of improvement in fuel economy
(2) Effect on exhaust emissions
(3) Vehicle applicability
(b) The Administrator may determine that, in certain cases, tests using engine dynamometers are adequate for determining the effect of a device. Examples of such cases are given below.
(1)
Long-term effects.
In some cases, it may be necessary for the engine to operate for several thousand miles before the effectiveness can be adequately measured. In such cases an engine dynamometer will permit a less expensive and better controlled durability and economy test than one in which a vehicle must be driven on a durability route and then tested on a chassis dynamometer or test track.
(2)
Durability requirements.
Aspects of engine durability can be efficiently determined using specialized engine testing rather than through durability mileage accumulation in a vehicle. A number of standard engine tests are presently used which can be incorporated into this requirement.
(c) When in the judgment of the Administrator a device cannot satisfactorily be evaluated using either dynamometer or track versions of the City Fuel Economy Test and the Highway
Fuel Economy Test, the Administrator will select or design other procedures.
§ 610.32
Test fleet selection.
(a) The composition and size of the test fleet will be determined by the Administrator. In a device evaluation program initiated at the request of the FTC, the composition and size of the test fleet will be determined by the Administrator in consultation with the FTC.
(b) The goal of the test fleet selection will be the provision of a data base adequate to give the Administrator reasonable confidence in the conclusions to be reached.
(c) Once the number of vehicles to be tested has been determined, the Administrator will specify the test fleet makeup by make, model, model year, engine displacement and carburetor, transmission type, and such other factors as he may deem relevant to the testing program.
§ 610.33
Durability tests.
The Administrator may determine that a device under evaluation will require durability testing in addition to the basic evaluation testing for device effectiveness. This requirement may be necessary for several reasons:
(a) A retrofit device manufacturer may claim that some mileage accumulation may be needed before the full effectiveness of the device can be obtained. If such claims are made, durability testing as described in subpart E may be performed. To determine whether the effectiveness change during the mileage accumulation is a function of the device or of the mileage accumulation alone, in some durability tests it may be necessary to run the mileage accumulation on vehicles with and without the device. Due to the high cost of durability testing and in particular of such duplicate testing, it will be used only where it is judged by the Administrator to be necessary.
(b) A device may have a limited life expectancy or be such that it requires replacement or adjustment at a prescribed mileage interval. Confirmatory durability tests may be run to assess whether such mileage intervals are proper and effective.
(c) A device may be suspected of having an adverse effect on the durability of the engine to which it is applied. After identification of a potential failure mode, durability tests may be conducted to investigate any changes in engine characteristics associated with that failure mode. Examples are valve problems, deterioration in spark plug life, increase in carburetor or combustion chamber deposits, or increased engine wear. If it is not possible to directly measure the change in the suspect characteristic, then a durability run may be made as described in subpart E, in which fuel economy and exhaust emissions are periodically checked during the accumulation of up to 15,000 miles.
(d) A critical item which can influence fuel economy is vehicle maintenance. Any durability test program used in evaluation of the effectiveness of a fuel economy device will be designed to differentiate maintenance effects from the effect of the device. Any maintenance associated with the device operation will be rigidly controlled. If the maintenance appears to be a significant factor in the effectiveness of a device, then it may be necessary to run a control test on vehicles without the device installed where the same maintenance is performed to quantify any incremental effect of that maintenance.
§ 610.34
Special test conditions.
If the Administrator determines that a device may have potentially detrimental effects on the operation of a vehicle when operated in ambient conditions outside the range specified in 40 CFR part 86, or if the device manufacturer claims a fuel economy improvement in such conditions, additional tests may be performed. These tests will determine whether the device will significantly limit the operational usefulness of the vehicle and will assess the claimed fuel economy benefit.
(a)
Extreme temperatures.
As required by the Administrator, tests will be conducted at extreme ambient temperature conditions to determine the effect due to devices (e.g. engine heaters) for which fuel economy improvements at extreme temperatures are made. For other devices it may be necessary to
determine whether the cold starting and driving capability of device-equipped vehicles is affected sufficiently to make them dangerous, or whether fuel economy characteristics at extreme temperatures are significantly worse than before the device was installed.
(b)
High altitude.
Devices for which specific claims of improved fuel economy at high altitude are made may be tested using the procedures in subpart D, at altitudes above 4000 feet. For other devices, testing at high altitude may be necessary for determining whether a device will make the vehicle less useful or efficient when operated at various altitudes. The Administrator will determine when such testing is required.
§ 610.35
Driveability and performance tests.
If the Administrator determines that driveability and performance of a vehicle may be adversely affected by the use of a device, a number of automobiles to be determined by the Administrator will be subjected to the driveability and performance tests discussed in §§ 610.62 and 610.63, respectively.

# Subpart D—General Vehicle Test Procedures
§ 610.40
General.
Two chassis dynamometer test procedures, the Federal Test Procedure and the Highway Fuel Economy Test will generally be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the devices supplemented by steady state or engine dynamometer tests where warranted. Under unusual circumstances, other test procedures, durability test procedures or special test procedures such as track versions of the City and Highway fuel economy tests may be used. These procedures are described in subparts E and F.
§ 610.41
Test configurations.
(a) In order to measure the effectiveness of a retrofit device at least two, and in some cases, three vehicle configurations defined in § 610.11 will be tested. Each vehicle will be tested at least twice in each configuration, as determined by the Administrator.
(b) The first test configuration is a baseline configuration. In this configuration the baseline or unretrofitted vehicle emissions will be measured.
(c) A second test configuration, an adjusted configuration, may be required at the discretion of the Administrator if a device requires both hardware and engine parameter modifications to achieve the fuel economy improvement. If, in the Administrator's judgment, based on a review of the available information, the combined effects of retrofit hardware installation and parametric adjustment could be substantially duplicated by parametric adjustment alone, then the Administrator may specify a second test, to evaluate such adjustment exclusive of the retrofit hardware.
(d) The third series of tests, in the retrofitted configuration, will evaluate the full retrofit system installed on the vehicle.
§ 610.42
Fuel economy measurement.
(a) Fuel consumption will be measured by:
(1) The carbon balance method, or
(2) Gravimetric or volumetric methods. In the gravimetric and volumetric methods, fuel consumption is determined by weighing the fuel source before and after a test, or by measuring the volume of fuel consumed during a test. Since the distance traveled during the tests is known, the fuel economy, in miles per gallon, can be calculated. Gravimetric and volumetric methods require the use of special test equipment in addition to the emissions measuring equipment.
(b) The carbon balance procedure for measuring fuel consumption relates the carbon products in the exhaust to the amount of fuel burned during the test. This method will be the one used to measure fuel economy unless track or road tests are employed.
(c) Three values of fuel economy will be reported: for city driving ('75 FTP), for highway driving (HFET), and the combined city/highway value calculated according to this equation:
EC15NO91.205
§ 610.43
Chassis dynamometer procedures.
(a)(1)
1975 Federal Test Procedure.
Vehicle exhaust emissions and fuel economy under urban driving conditions will be measured according to the Federal emission test procedure described in 40 CFR part 86, subpart B, which is known as the 1975 Federal Test Procedure ('75 FTP). However, the following modifications will be employed:
(i) No evaporative emission loss, as specified by 40 CFR part 86 need be measured (with the exception of devices modifying or disconnecting existing evaporative control devices in such a manner as would be expected to adversely affect their evaporative emission control performance).
(ii) Vehicle preconditioning shall consist of operation of the vehicle through one (1) EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule. This preconditioning must be done at least 12 hours, but no earlier than 36 hours before the emission test.
(iii) While the test fuel must meet the specifications outlined in 40 CFR part 86, fuel conditioning as specified for evaporative emission test procedures is not required.
(b)
Highway Fuel Economy Test.
The test vehicle is fully warmed up at the start of the highway Fuel Economy Test which is ordinarily run immediately following the Federal Emission Test Procedure. The test procedure to be followed for generation of highway fuel economy data is that specified in § 600.111.
(c)
Steady state tests.
Constant speed, road load tests may be conducted to help give insight into operational differences and exhaust emission and fuel economy changes due to a retrofit device. Speeds between 0 (engine idling) and 60 mpg will be investigated, with a time period at each speed long enough to ensure that engine operation has stabilized.

# Subpart E—Durability Test Procedures
§ 610.50
Test configurations.
(a) In addition to the tuneup to manufacturer's specifications per § 610.41, all vehicles in the durability fleet will have installed the following new parts: Air, oil, and fuel filters, spark plugs, points, condenser, rotor, distributor cap, PCV valve, and emission control devices such as vacuum control valves and EGR valves.
(b) Vehicles included in the durability fleet will be subjected at zero device-miles to the same test sequence for fuel economy and exhaust emissions as specified in subpart D. Subsequently, they will be tested at 3,000 device-mile intervals, up to and including the final mileage point of 15,000 device-miles. Testing at these mileage points will be performed with the vehicle equipped with the full retrofit system.
(c) After the 15,000-mile test the vehicle will be tuned as necessary and the device adjusted to the manufacturer's specifications as required. The fully restored retrofitted configuration will then be tested. The device will then be removed from the vehicle and the vehicle set to vehicle manufacturer's specifications. A tuned baseline test will then be conducted.
§ 610.51
Mileage accumulation procedure.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this part, the mileage accumulation procedure will be that provided in 40 CFR part 86. This mileage accumulation schedule, or a suitable alternate procedure approved by the Administrator, will be used.
(b) Fuel used in the accumulation of mileage will be commercial fuel available in the retail market and shall conform to the requirements of 40 CFR part 86 for mileage accumulation fuel.
(1) The requirements of this paragraph may be modified by the Administrator when it is a fuel or fuel additive that is being tested.
§ 610.52
Maintenance.
(a) Maintenance during the durability evaluation can best be considered in three separate categories:
(1) Normal scheduled vehicle maintenance,
(2) Unscheduled vehicle maintenance, and
(3) Retrofit maintenance.
(b) Normal scheduled vehicle maintenance is the periodic service specified in the original owner's manual supplied
to the owner at the time of new vehicle purchase.
(1) Normal periodic engine oil changes, vehicle lubrication, and oil filter changes, as specified in the original owner's manual, will be performed during durability mileage accumulation.
(2) For purposes of this part, the following items of normally scheduled vehicle maintenance will not be performed during the durability mileage accumulation:
(i) Normal tune-up items:
(A) Spark plugs.
(B) Condenser.
(C) Rotor.
(D) Distributor cap.
(ii) Air Cleaner element.
(iii) PCV Inspection.
(iv) Dwell and timing check.
(v) Charging circuit check.
(3) Periodic maintenance items specified in the original owner's manual, other than those listed above, may be performed if found to be necessary by the Administrator.
(c)
Unscheduled maintenance.
Because the vehicles used for durability evaluation in this program will probably have considerable mileage accumulation and unknown maintenance prior to inclusion in the program, it can be anticipated that certain vehicle and engine failures may occur, which may be unrelated to the retrofit device. Unscheduled maintenance will be performed only in those cases where a significant and obvious driveability problem has been reported by the driver of the vehicle.
(1) Correction of the following problems will be made as soon as the problems occur:
(i) Tire replacement (same size and type).
(ii) Vehicle body repairs (remote from engine and retrofit).
(iii) Windshield wipers.
(iv) Fluid levels unrelated to retrofit.
(v) Brakes.
(vi) Hoses unrelated to retrofit.
(vii) Belts unrelated to retrofit.
(viii) Suspension failures.
(ix) Wheel alignment.
(x) Steering.
(xi) Wheel bearings.
(xii) Non-engine electrical system.
(xiii) Drivetrain components (U-joints, axles, transmission adjustments, etc.)
(2) Other unscheduled maintenance of the engine or drivetrain may be made as directed by the Administrator. Upon notification of a need for unscheduled maintenance, the Administrator may decide that before and after maintenance fuel economy tests are required.
(d)
Retrofit maintenance.
Maintenance of the retrofit device will normally not be performed during the accumulation of durability mileage of 15,000 miles. However, certain retrofit devices may require periodic maintenance that is directly related to device function. An example is the periodic addition of fluid to the reservoir of a vapor injector. The Administrator will determine whether periodic maintenance will be allowed, based on his review of available information including the device manufacturer's maintenance instructions to the consumer.
(e) A log of all maintenance shall be kept for every vehicle. These logs will be summarized in the final report by the Administrator.

# Subpart F—Special Test Procedures
§ 610.60
Non-standard ambient conditions.
(a)
Extreme temperatures.
For vehicles required to be tested at extreme temperatures, the test sequence described in § 610.41 will be performed using either test track or dynamometer, in ambient temperatures outside the 60° to 90° range specified in § 610.64 as determined by the Administrator. The driveability tests described in § 610.62 may also be performed at non-standard temperatures, as determined to be necessary by the Administrator.
(b)
High altitudes.
Vehicles required to be tested at high altitudes will undergo the tests described in § 610.43 if necessary, on either test track or dynamometer as determined by the Administrator. One test location, at an elevation of no less than 4000 feet, will be selected.
§ 610.61
Engine dynamometer tests.
The Administrator will choose a test procedure or procedures from various
engine dynamometer durability test procedures used by research organizations in government, the oil industry, engine manufacturing companies, and independent laboratories.
§ 610.62
Driveability tests.
Driveability assessment (at normal ambient temperatures) of the baseline configuration, of the adjusted configuration (if required by the Administrator), and of the fully retrofitted configuration may be conducted at zero device-miles for all vehicles included in the durability fleet, and at approximately zero device-miles at low ambient temperatures (0 °F-20 °F). Driveability evaluation procedures will be provided by the Administrator when necessary.
§ 610.63
Performance tests.
The effect of a device on a vehicle's performance will be determined by performing wide-open-throttle 0 to 60 mph acceleration tests (at normal ambient temperatures) on the baseline vehicle configuration, on the adjusted configuration (if required), and on the fully retrofitted configuration. Tests will be conducted on a dry, level, smooth-surfaced test track, with appropriate speed-time measuring equipment, on as many vehicles as determined to be necessary.
§ 610.64
Track test procedures.
(a) Cases may arise where it will be necessary to evaluate the fuel economy effects of a retrofit device on a test track, because the effect of the device cannot be adequately tested using the chassis dynamometer procedures. (An obvious example is a device that changes the aerodynamic drag of the test vehicle.) In such cases, testing will be performed on a dry, level, smooth-surfaced test track for such dimensions that the speeds required by the city and highway fuel economy tests may be safely achieved.
(1) Because aerodynamic drag is not a linear function of velocity, it will be necessary to limit testing to times when the wind velocity is less than 5 mph, with gusts less than 10 mph.
(2) Testing will also be limited to ambient temperatures between 60° and 90 °F, and to times when the ambient temperature remains reasonably constant during individual tests. Temperature differences between tests of baseline and retrofit configurations will also be minimized.
(3) Exhaust emissions will not be measured during track testing.
(4) Fuel economy of a vehicle running on a track will be measured using either a volumetric or gravimetric procedure approved by the Administrator.
(5) Vehicle speed and distance will be measured with a “fifth wheel” type of device. Suitable apparatus will be used to generate a permanent record (strip chart recorder, etc.) of the vehicle speed versus time.
(b)
City fuel economy test.
Although essentially the same procedures will be used for track testing as for dynamometer testing, some modifications will be necessary to insure safe operation of the test vehicle and to adjust to the requirements of track testing.
(1) An assistant to the driver will be necessary to steer the vehicle, so that the driver will not be distracted from following the speed-time schedules used in the Federal test procedure.
(2) The test vehicle will be preconditioned within the same time constraints given in § 610.43(a)(1)(ii). Preconditioning may take place either on the track or on a dynamometer. The 12-hour soak after preconditioning will take place in an area where the ambient temperature will remain within the 60° to 90 °F range, indoors, if necessary.
(3) The vehicle will be transported to the test track without being started. If the distance from soak area to track is no greater than one-quarter mile, then the vehicle may be pushed or towed to the track. Otherwise the vehicle must be transported by truck or trailer.
(4) Fuel economy will be determined by either a gravimetric or volumetric method.
(c)
Highway fuel economy test.
The highway test will follow the city fuel economy test in the same manner as in dynamometer tests (§ 610.43(b)). Fuel economy will be measured by gravimetric or volumetric methods.
(d)
Steady state tests.
Steady state tests on the track will be run in the same manner as on the dynamometer
except that fuel economy will be measured by gravimetric or volumetric methods.
§ 610.65
Other test procedures.
The Administrator may, pursuant to § 610.31(c), choose a test procedure or procedures from those used by research organizations in government, the oil industry, engine manufacturing companies, and independent laboratories. If none of these is deemed suitable, the Administrator may, in consultation with the party requesting the test, design a dynamometer, track or road test to measure the effects of the device.
