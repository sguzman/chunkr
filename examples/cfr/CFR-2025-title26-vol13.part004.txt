corporation for the taxable year is a shareholder as described in section 1362(a)(2). A single election statement may be filed for all elections made under § 1.1368-1(g)(2)(i) for the taxable year. An election made under § 1.1368-1(g)(2)(i) is irrevocable. In the case of elections for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003, the statement through which a corporation makes an election under § 1.1368-1(g)(2)(i) must be signed by an officer of the corporation under penalties of perjury. In the case of elections for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002, the statement described in the preceding sentence shall be verified by signing the return.
(iv)
Coordination with election under section 1377(a)(2).
If the event resulting in a qualifying disposition also results in a termination of a shareholder's entire interest as described in § 1.1377-1(b)(4), the election under this paragraph (g)(2) cannot be made. Rather, the election under section 1377(a)(2) and § 1.1377-1(b) may be made. See § 1.1377-1(b) (concerning the election under section 1377(a)(2)).

§ 1.1368-2
Accumulated adjustments account (AAA).
(a)
Accumulated adjustments account
—(1)
In general.
The accumulated adjustments account is an account of the S corporation and is not apportioned among shareholders. The AAA is relevant for all taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1983, for which the corporation is an S corporation. On the first day of the first year for which the corporation is an S corporation, the balance of the AAA is zero. The AAA is increased in the manner provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and is decreased in the manner provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. For the adjustments to the AAA in the case of redemptions, liquidations, reorganizations, and corporate separations, see paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Increases to the AAA.
The AAA is increased for the taxable year of the corporation by the sum of the following items with respect to the corporation for the taxable year:
(i) The items of income described in section 1366(a)(1)(A) other than income that is exempt from tax;
(ii) Any nonseparately computed income determined under section 1366(a)(1)(B); and
(iii) The excess of the deductions for depletion over the basis of property subject to depletion unless the property is an oil or gas property the basis of which has been allocated to shareholders under section 613A(c)(11).
(3)
Decreases to the AAA
—(i)
In general.
The AAA is decreased for the taxable year of the corporation by the sum of the following items with respect to the corporation for the taxable year—
(A) The items of loss or deduction described in section 1366(a)(1)(A);
(B) Any nonseparately computed loss determined under section 1366(a)(1)(B);
(C) Any expense of the corporation not deductible in computing its taxable income and not properly chargeable to a capital account, other than—
(
1
) Federal taxes attributable to any taxable year in which the corporation was a C corporation; and
(
2
) Expenses related to income that is exempt from tax; and
(D) The sum of the shareholders' deductions for depletion for any oil or gas property held by the corporation described in section 1367(a)(2)(E).
(ii)
Extent of allowable reduction.
The AAA may be decreased under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section below zero. The AAA is decreased by noncapital, nondeductible expenses under paragraph (a)(3)(i)(C) of this section even though a portion of the noncapital, nondeductible expenses is not taken into account by a shareholder under § 1.1367-1(g) (relating to the elective ordering rule). The AAA is also decreased by the entire amount of any loss or deduction even though a portion of the loss or deduction is not taken into account by a shareholder under section 1366(d)(1) or is otherwise not currently deductible under the Internal Revenue Code. However, in any subsequent taxable year in which the loss, deduction, or noncapital, nondeductible expense is treated as incurred by the corporation with respect to the
shareholder under section 1366(d)(2) or § 1.1367-1(g) (or in which the loss or deduction is otherwise allowed to the shareholder), no further adjustment is made to the AAA.
(iii)
Decrease to the AAA for distributions.
The AAA is decreased (but not below zero) by any portion of a distribution to which section 1368 (b) or (c)(1) applies.
(4)
Ordering rules for the AAA for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1997.
For any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1997, the adjustments to the AAA are made in the following order—
(i) The AAA is increased under paragraph (a)(2) of this section before it is decreased under paragraph (a)(3) of this section for the taxable year;
(ii) The AAA is decreased under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section before it is decreased under paragraph (a)(3) (iii) of this section;
(iii) The AAA is decreased (but not below zero) by any portion of an ordinary distribution to which section 1368 (b) or (c)(1) applies; and
(iv) The AAA is adjusted (whether negative or positive) for redemption distributions under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(5)
Ordering rules for the AAA for taxable years beginning on or after August 18, 1998.
For any taxable year of the S corporation beginning on or after August 18, 1998, the adjustments to the AAA are made in the following order—
(i) The AAA is increased under paragraph (a)(2) of this section before it is decreased under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section for the taxable year;
(ii) The AAA is decreased under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section (without taking into account any net negative adjustment (as defined in section 1368(e)(1)(C)(ii)) before it is decreased under paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section;
(iii) The AAA is decreased (but not below zero) by any portion of an ordinary distribution to which section 1368(b) or (c)(1) applies;
(iv) The AAA is decreased by any net negative adjustment (as defined in section 1368(e)(1)(C)(ii)); and
(v) The AAA is adjusted (whether negative or positive) for redemption distributions under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(b)
Distributions in excess of the AAA
—(1)
In general.
A portion of the AAA (determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section) is allocated to each of the distributions made for the taxable year if—
(i) An S corporation makes more than one distribution of property with respect to its stock during the taxable year of the corporation (including an S short year as defined under section 1362(e)(1)(A));
(ii) The AAA has a positive balance at the close of the year; and
(iii) The sum of the distributions made during the corporation's taxable year exceeds the balance of the AAA at the close of the year.
(2) Amount of the AAA allocated to each distribution. The amount of the AAA allocated to each distribution is determined by multiplying the balance of the AAA at the close of the current taxable year by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the distribution and the denominator of which is the amount of all distributions made during the taxable year. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), the term
all distributions made during the taxable year
does not include any distribution treated as from earnings and profits or previously taxed income pursuant to an election made under section 1368(e)(3) and § 1.1368-1(f)(2). See paragraph (d)(1) of this section for rules relating to the adjustments to the AAA for redemptions and distributions in the year of a redemption.
(c)
Distribution of money and loss property
—(1)
In general.
The amount of the AAA allocated to a distribution under this section must be further allocated (under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) if the distribution—
(i) Consists of property the adjusted basis of which exceeds its fair market value on the date of the distribution and money;
(ii) Is a distribution to which § 1.1368-1(d)(1) applies; and
(iii) Exceeds the amount of the corporation's AAA properly allocable to that distribution.
(2)
Allocating the AAA to loss property.
The amount of the AAA allocated to the property other than money is equal
to the amount of the AAA allocated to the distribution multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the fair market value of the property other than money on the date of distribution and the denominator of which is the amount of the distribution. The amount of the AAA allocated to the money is equal to the amount of the AAA allocated to the distribution reduced by the amount of the AAA allocated to the property other than money.
(d)
Adjustment in the case of redemptions, liquidations, reorganizations, and divisions
—(1)
Redemptions
—(i)
General rule.
In the case of a redemption distribution by an S corporation that is treated as an exchange under section 302(a) or section 303(a) (a
redemption distribution
), the AAA of the corporation is adjusted in an amount equal to the ratable share of the corporation's AAA (whether negative or positive) attributable to the redeemed stock as of the date of the redemption.
(ii)
Special rule for years in which a corporation makes both ordinary and redemption distributions.
In any year in which a corporation makes one or more distributions to which section 1368(a) applies (
ordinary distributions
) and makes one or more redemption distributions, the AAA of the corporation is adjusted first for any ordinary distributions and then for any redemption distributions.
(iii)
Adjustments to earnings and profits.
Earnings and profits are adjusted under section 312 independently of any adjustments made to the AAA.
(2)
Liquidations and reorganizations.
An S corporation acquiring the assets of another S corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies will succeed to and merge its AAA (whether positive or negative) with the AAA (whether positive or negative) of the distributor or transferor S corporation as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer. Thus, the AAA of the acquiring corporation after the transaction is the sum of the AAAs of the corporations prior to the transaction.
(3)
Corporate separations to which section 368(a)(l)(D) applies.
If an S corporation with accumulated earnings and profits transfers a part of its assets constituting an active trade or business to another corporation in a transaction to which section 368(a)(l)(D) applies, and immediately thereafter the stock and securities of the controlled corporation are distributed in a distribution or exchange to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applies, the AAA of the distributing corporation immediately before the transaction is allocated between the distributing corporation and the controlled corporation in a manner similar to the manner in which the earnings and profits of the distributing corporation are allocated under section 312 (h). See § 1.312-10(a).
(e)
Election to terminate year under section 1377(a)(2) or § 1.1368-1(g)(2).
If an election is made under section 1377(a)(2) (to terminate the year in the case of termination of a shareholder's interest) or § 1.1368-1(g)(2) (to terminate the year in the case of a qualifying disposition), this section applies as if the taxable year consisted of separate taxable years, the first of which ends at the close of the day on which the shareholder terminated his or her interest in the corporation or makes a substantial disposition of stock, whichever the case may be.
[T.D. 8508, 59 FR 20, Jan. 3, 1994, as amended by T.D. 8852, 64 FR 71650, Dec. 22, 1999; T.D. 8869, 65 FR 3855, Jan. 25, 2000]
§ 1.1368-3
Examples.
The principles of §§ 1.1368-1 and 1.1368-2 are illustrated by the examples below. In each example Corporation S is a calendar year corporation:

# Example 1. Distributions by S corporations without C corporation earnings and profits for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1997.
(i) Corporation S, an S corporation, has no earnings and profits as of January 1, 1996, the first day of its 1996 taxable year. S's sole shareholder, A, holds 10 shares of S stock with a basis of $1 per share as of that date. On March 1, 1996, S makes a distribution of $38 to A. For S's 1996 taxable year, A's pro rata share of the amount of the items described in section 1367(a)(1) (relating to increases in basis of stock) is $50 and A's pro rata share of the amount of the items described in section 1367(a)(2) (B) through (D) (relating to decreases in basis of stock for items other than distributions) is $26.
(ii) Under section 1368(d)(1) and § 1.1368-1(e)(1), the adjustments to the bases of A's stock in S described in section 1367 are made
before the distribution rules of section 1368 are applied. Thus, A's basis per share in the stock is $3.40 ($1 + [($50-$26) / 10 shares]) before taking into account the distribution. Under section 1367(a)(2)(A), the basis of A's stock is decreased by distributions to A that are not includible in A's income. Under § 1.1367-1(c)(3), the amount of the distribution that is attributable to each share of A's stock is $3.80 ($38 distribution / 10 shares). However, A only has a basis of $3.40 in each share, and basis may not be reduced below zero. Therefore, the basis of each share of his stock is reduced by $3.40 to zero, and the remaining $4.00 of the distribution ([$3.80-$3.40] × 10 shares) is treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property. As of January 1, 1997, A has a basis of $0 in his shares of S stock.

# Example 2. Distributions by S corporations without earnings and profits for taxable years beginning on or after August 18, 1998.
(i) Corporation S, an S corporation, has no earnings and profits as of January 1, 2001, the first day of its 2001 taxable year. S's sole shareholder, A, holds 10 shares of S stock with a basis of $1 per share as of that date. On March 1, 2001, S makes a distribution of $38 to A. The balance in Corporation S's AAA is $100. For S's 2001 taxable year, A's pro rata share of the amount of the items described in section 1367(a)(1) (relating to increases in basis of stock) is $50. A's pro rata share of the amount of the items described in sections 1367(a)(2)(B) through (D) (relating to decreases in basis of stock for items other than distributions) is $26, $20 of which is attributable to items described in section 1367(a)(2)(B) and (C) and $6 of which is attributable to items described in section 1367(a)(2)(D) (relating to decreases in basis attributable to noncapital, nondeductible expenses).
(ii) Under section 1368(d)(1) and § 1.1368-1(e)(1) and (2), the adjustments to the basis of A's stock in S described in sections 1367(a)(1) are made before the distribution rules of section 1368 are applied. Thus, A's basis per share in the stock is $6.00 ($1 + [$50/10]) before taking into account the distribution. Under section 1367(a)(2)(A), the basis of A's stock is decreased by distributions to A that are not includible in A's income. Under § 1.1367-1(c)(3), the amount of the distribution that is attributable to each share of A's stock is $3.80 ($38 distribution/10 shares). Thus, A's basis per share in the stock is $2.20 ($6.00-$3.80), after taking into account the distribution. Under section 1367(a)(2)(D), the basis of each share of A's stock in S after taking into account the distribution, $2.20, is decreased by $.60 ($6 noncapital, nondeductible expenses/10). Thus, A's basis per share after taking into account the nondeductible, noncapital expenses is $1.60. Under section 1367(a)(2)(B) and (C), A's basis per share is further decreased by $2 ($20 items described in section 1367(a)(2)(B) and (C)/10 shares). However, basis may not be reduced below zero. Therefore, the basis of each share of A's stock is reduced to zero. As of January 1, 2002, A has a basis of $0 in his shares of S stock. Pursuant to section 1366(d)(2), the $.40 of loss in excess of A's basis in each of his shares of S stock is treated as incurred by the corporation in the succeeding taxable year with respect to A.

# Example 3. Distributions by S corporations with C corporation earnings and profits for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1997.
(i) Corporation S properly elects to be an S corporation beginning January 1, 1997, and as of that date has accumulated earnings and profits of $30. B, an individual and sole shareholder of Corporation S, has 10 shares of S stock with a basis of $12 per share. In addition, B lends $30 to S evidenced by a demand note.
(ii) During 1997, S has a nonseparately computed loss of $150. S makes no distributions to B during 1997. Under section 1366(d)(1), B is allowed a loss equal to $150, the amount equal to the sum of B's bases in his shares of stock and his basis in the debt. Under section 1367, the loss reduces B's adjusted basis in his stock and debt to $0. Under § 1.1368-2(a)(3), S's AAA as of December 31, 1997, has a deficit of $150 as a result of S's loss for the year.
(iii) For 1998, S has $220 of separately stated income and distributes $110 to B. The balance in the AAA (negative $150 from 1997) is increased by $220 for S's income for the year and decreased to $0 for the portion of the distribution that is treated as being from the AAA ($70). Under § 1.1367-2(c), B's net increase is $150, determined by reducing the $220 of income by the $70 of the distribution not includible in income by B. Thus, B's basis in the debt is fully restored to $30, and B's basis in S stock (before accounting for the distribution) is increased from zero to $19 per share ([$220-$30 applied to the debt] / 10). Thirty dollars of the distribution is considered a dividend to the extent of S's $30 of earnings and profits, and the remaining $10 of the distribution reduces B's basis in the S stock. Thus, B's basis in the S stock as of December 31, 1998, is $11 per share ($19-[$70 AAA distribution / 10]-[10 distribution treated as a reduction in basis / 10]). The balance in the AAA is $0, S's earnings and profits are $0, and B's basis in the loan is $30.

# Example 4.
Distributions by S corporations with earnings and profits and no net negative adjustment for taxable years beginning on or after August 18, 1998. (i) Corporation S, an S corporation, has accumulated earnings and profits of $1,000 and a balance in the AAA of $2,000 on January 1, 2001. S's sole shareholder B holds 100 shares of stock with a basis of $20 per share as of January 1, 2001. On April 1, 2001, S makes a distribution of $1,500 to B. B's pro rata share of the income
earned by S during 2001 is $2,000 and B's pro rata share of S's losses is $1,500. For the taxable year ending December 31, 2001, S does not have a net negative adjustment as defined in section 1368(e)(1)(C). S does not make the election under section 1368(e)(3) and § 1.1368-1(f)(2) to distribute its earnings and profits before its AAA.
(ii) The AAA is increased from $2,000 to $4,000 for the $2,000 of income earned during the 2001 taxable year. The AAA is decreased from $4,000 to $2,500 for the $1,500 of losses. The AAA is decreased from $2,500 to $1,000 for the portion of the distribution ($1,500) to B that does not exceed the AAA.
(iii) As of December 31, 2001, B's basis in his stock is $10 ($20 + $20 ($2,000 income/100 shares)—$15 ($1,500 distribution/100 shares)—$15 ($1,500 loss/100 shares).

# Example 5.
Distributions by S corporations with earnings and profits and net negative adjustment for taxable years beginning on or after August 18, 1998. (i) Corporation S, an S corporation, has accumulated earnings and profits of $1,000 and a balance in the AAA of $2,000 on January 1, 2001. S's sole shareholder B holds 100 shares of stock with a basis of $20 per share as of January 1, 2001. On April 1, 2001, S makes a distribution of $2,000 to B. B's pro rata share of the income earned by S during 2001 is $2,000 and B's pro rata share of S's losses is $3,500. For the taxable year ending December 31, 2001, S has a net negative adjustment as defined in section 1368(e)(1)(C). S does not make the election under section 1368(e)(3) and § 1.1368-1(f)(2) to distribute its earnings and profits before its AAA.
(ii) The AAA is increased from $2,000 to $4,000 for the $2,000 of income earned during the 2001 taxable year. Because under section 1368(e)(1)(C)(ii) and § 1.1368-2(a)(ii), the net negative adjustment is not taken into account, the AAA is decreased from $4,000 to $2,000 for the portion of the losses ($2,000) that does not exceed the income earned during the 2001 taxable year. The AAA is reduced from $2,000 to zero for the portion of the distribution to B ($2,000) that does not exceed the AAA. The AAA is decreased from zero to a negative $1,500 for the portion of the $3,500 of loss that exceeds the $2,000 of income earned during the 2001 taxable year.
(iii) Under § 1.1367-1(c)(1), the basis of a shareholder's share in an S corporation stock may not be reduced below zero. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2001, B's basis per share in his stock is zero ($20 + $20 income—$20 distribution—$35 loss). Pursuant to section 1366(d)(2), the $15 of loss in excess of B's basis in each of his shares of S stock is treated as incurred by the corporation in the succeeding taxable year with respect to B.

# Example 6. Election in case of disposition of substantial amount of stock.
(i) Corporation S, an S corporation, has earnings and profits of $3,000 and a balance in the AAA of $1,000 on January 1, 1997. C, an individual and the sole shareholder of Corporation S, has 100 shares of S stock with a basis of $10 per share. On July 3, 1997, C sells 50 shares of his S stock to D, an individual, for $250. For 1997, S has taxable income of $1,000, of which $500 was earned on or before July 3, 1997, and $500 earned after July 3, 1997. During its 1997 taxable year, S distributes $1,000 to C on February 1 and $1,000 to each of C and D on August 1. S does not make the election under section 1368(e)(3) and § 1.1368-1(f)(2) to distribute its earnings and profits before its AAA. S makes the election under § 1.1368-1(g)(2) to treat its taxable year as if it consisted of separate taxable years, the first of which ends at the close of July 3, 1997, the date of the qualifying disposition.
(ii) Under section § 1.1368-1(g)(2), for the period ending on July 3, 1997, S's AAA is $500 ($1,000 (AAA as of January 1, 1997) + $500 (income earned from January 1, 1997 through July 3, 1997)-$1,000 (distribution made on February 1, 1997)). C's bases in his shares of stock is decreased to $5 per share ($10 (original basis) + $5 (increase per share for income)-$10 (decrease per share for distribution)).
(iii) The AAA is adjusted at the end of the taxable year for the period July 4 through December 31, 1997. It is increased from $500 (AAA as of the close of July 3, 1997) to $1,000 for the income earned during this period and is decreased by $1,000, the portion of the distribution ($2,000 in total) made to C and D on August 1 that does not exceed the AAA. The $1,000 portion of the distribution that remains after the AAA is reduced to zero is attributable to earnings and profits. Therefore C and D each have a dividend of $500, which does not affect their basis or S's AAA. The earnings and profits account is reduced from $3,000 to $2,000.
(iv) As of December 31, 1997, C and D have bases in their shares of stock of zero ($5 (basis as of July 4) + $5 ($500 income/100 shares)-$10 ($1,000 distribution/100 shares)). C and D each will report $500 as dividend income, which does not affect their basis or S's AAA.

# Example 7. Election to distribute earnings and profits first.
(i) Corporation S has been a calendar year C corporation since 1975. For 1982, S elects for the first time to be taxed under subchapter S, and during 1982 has $60 of earnings and profits. As of December 31, 1995, S has an AAA of $10 and earnings and profits of $160, consisting of $100 of subchapter C earnings and profits and $60 of subchapter S earnings and profits. For 1996, S has $200 of taxable income and the AAA is increased to $210 (before taking distributions into account). During 1996, S distributes $240 to its shareholders. With its 1996 tax return, S properly elects under section 1368(e)(3) and § 1.1368-1(f)(2) to distribute its earnings and profits before its AAA.
(ii) Because S elected to distribute its earnings and profits before its AAA, the first $100 of the distribution is characterized as a distribution from subchapter C earnings and profits; the next $60 of the distribution is characterized as a distribution from subchapter S earnings and profits. Because $160 of the distribution is from earnings and profits, the shareholders of S have a $160 dividend. The remaining $80 of the distribution is a distribution from S's AAA and is treated by the shareholders as a return of capital or gain from the sale or exchange of property, as appropriate, under § 1.1368-1(d)(1). S's AAA, as of December 31, 1996, equals $130 ($210-$80).

# Example 8. Distributions in excess of the AAA.
(i) On January 1, 1995, Corporation S has $40 of earnings and profits and a balance in the AAA of $100. S has two shareholders, E and F, each of whom own 50 shares of S's stock. For 1995, S has taxable income of $50, which increases the AAA to $150 as of December 31, 1995 (before taking into account distributions made during 1995). On February 1, 1995, S distributes $60 to each shareholder. On September 1, 1995, S distributes $30 to each shareholder. S does not make the election under section 1368(e)(3) and § 1.1368-1(f)(2) to distribute its earnings and profits before its AAA.
(ii) The sum of the distributions exceed S's AAA. Therefore, under § 1.1368-2(b), a portion of S's $150 balance in the AAA as of December 31, 1995, is allocated to each of the February 1 and September 1 distributions based on the respective sizes of the distributions. Accordingly, S must allocate $100 ($150 (AAA) × ($120 (February 1 distribution)/$180 (the sum of the distributions))) of the AAA to the February 1 distribution, and $50 ($150 × ($60/$180)) to the September 1 distribution. The portions of the distributions to which the AAA is allocated are treated by the shareholder as a return of capital or gain from the sale or exchange of property, as appropriate. The remainder of the two distributions is treated as a dividend to the extent that it does not exceed S's earnings and profits. E and F must each report $10 of dividend income for the February 1 distribution. For the September 1 distribution, E and F must each report $5 of dividend income.

# Example 9. Ordinary and redemption distributions in the same taxable year.
(i) On January 1, 1995, Corporation S, an S corporation, has $20 of earnings and profits and a balance in the AAA of $10. S has two shareholders, G and H, each of whom owns 50 shares of S's stock. For 1995, S has taxable income of $16, which increases the AAA to $26 as of December 31, 1995 (before taking into account distributions made during 1995). On February 1, 1995, S distributes $10 to each shareholder. On December 31, 1995, S redeems for $13 all of shareholder G's stock in a redemption that is treated as a sale or exchange under section 302(a).
(ii) The sum of the ordinary distributions does not exceed S's AAA. Therefore, S must reduce the $26 balance in the AAA by $20 for the February 1 ordinary distribution. The portions of the distribution by which the AAA is reduced are treated by the shareholders as a return of capital or gain from the sale or exchange of property. S must adjust the remaining AAA, $6, in an amount equal to the ratable share of the remaining AAA attributable to the redeemed stock, or $3 (50% × $6).
(iii) S also must adjust the earnings and profits of $20 in an amount equal to the ratable share of the earnings and profits attributable to the redeemed stock. Therefore, S adjusts the earnings and profits by $10 (50% × $20), the ratable share of the earnings and profits attributable to the redeemed stock.

Distributions of money by an eligible terminated S corporation.
(a)
Scope and definitions
—(1)
Scope.
This section provides rules relating to qualified distributions and distributions to which section 301 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) applies during each taxable year of the ETSC period, including the taxable year in which the ETSC period ends. If an ETSC does not make any qualified distributions during a taxable year, then no distribution by the ETSC is governed by section 1371(f) of the Code or this section. Paragraph (a)(2) of this section contains definitions that apply for purposes of this section. Paragraph (b) of this section contains rules regarding the characterization of a qualified distribution. Paragraph (c) of this section contains rules regarding the characterization of any excess qualified distribution and non-qualified distribution during each taxable year of the ETSC period, including the taxable year in which the ETSC period ends. Paragraph (d) of this section contains examples illustrating the rules of this section. Paragraph (e) of this section contains the applicability date of this section.
(2)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this section—
(i)
AAA.
The term
AAA
means the accumulated adjustments account, within the meaning of section 1368(e)(1)(A) of the Code and § 1.1368-2(a)(1).
(ii)
AAA ratio.
Except as provided in this paragraph or paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, the term
AAA ratio
means the fraction of which the numerator is historical AAA and the denominator is the sum of historical AAA and historical AE
P. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the AE
P of the ETSC is less than or equal to zero as of the beginning of a taxable year, then the AAA ratio is one for such year and for all subsequent taxable years of the ETSC period.
(iii)
AE
P.
The term
AE
P
means earnings and profits described in section 316(a)(1) of the Code.
(iv)
AE
P ratio.
Except as provided in this paragraph or paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, the term
AE
P ratio
means the fraction of which the numerator is historical AE
P, and the denominator is the sum of historical AAA and historical AE
P. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the AE
P of the ETSC is less than or equal to zero as of the beginning of a taxable year, then the AE
P ratio is zero for such year and all subsequent taxable years of the ETSC period.
(v)
CE
P.
The term
CE
P
means earnings and profits that are described in section 316(a)(2).
(vi)
ETSC.
The term
ETSC
means an eligible terminated S corporation, within the meaning of section 481(d) of the Code and § 1.481-5.
(vii)
ETSC period.
In general, the term
ETSC period
means any taxable year, or portion thereof, of an ETSC beginning on the first day after the post-termination period within the meaning of section 1377(b)(1)(A) of the Code and ending on the date on which the ETSC's AAA balance is zero. Additionally, an ETSC does not have an ETSC period if the ETSC's AAA balance is not greater than zero at the end of its post-termination transition period. See § 1.1371-2 for rules governing the impact of a post-termination period, within the meaning of section 1377(b)(1)(B), on the ETSC period.
(viii)
Excess qualified distribution.
The term
excess qualified distribution
means the portion of a qualified distribution that is not characterized pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section.
(ix)
Historical AAA.
The term
historical AAA
means the AAA of the ETSC as of the beginning of the day on which the revocation of an election under section 1362(a) of the Code is effective pursuant to section 1362(d)(1).
(x)
Historical AE
P.
The term
historical AE
P
means the AE
P of the ETSC as of the beginning of the day on which the revocation of an election under section 1362(a) is effective pursuant to section 1362(d)(1). For purposes of the preceding sentence, if the ETSC's historical AE
P is less than zero, then the historical AE
P is treated as zero.
(xi)
Non-qualified distribution.
The term
non-qualified distribution
means a distribution that is not a qualified distribution and to which section 301 applies.
(xii)
Qualified distribution.
The term
qualified distribution
means a distribution of money by an ETSC during the ETSC period to which, absent the application of section 1371(f) and this section, section 301 would apply. However, if paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section applies to the ETSC, then a qualified distribution to a non-legacy shareholder is treated as a non-qualified distribution.
(b)
Characterization of qualified distribution
—(1)
In general.
Paragraph (b)(2) of this section provides rules regarding the determination of the amount of a qualified distribution that is sourced from AAA and the corollary effects of such a characterization. Paragraph (b)(3) of this section provides rules regarding the determination of the amount of a qualified distribution that is sourced from AE
P and the corollary effects of such a characterization. Paragraph (b)(4) of this section provides rules regarding the characterization of an excess qualified distribution as a separate qualified distribution. The rules in paragraphs (b)(2) through (4) of this section are applied before the application of paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Distribution of AAA
—(i)
Amount.
The portion of a qualified distribution that is sourced from an ETSC's AAA is equal to the lesser of:
(A) The product of the qualified distribution and the AAA ratio; and
(B) The ETSC's AAA immediately before the qualified distribution.
(ii)
Reduction or elimination of ETSC's AAA.
The ETSC's AAA is reduced by the amount of the distribution described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. If, with respect to a qualified distribution, the amount described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section equals or exceeds the amount described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, then the rules in this paragraph (b) do not apply to any subsequent distributions by the ETSC. Instead, the subsequent distributions are treated in the manner provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
(iii)
Effect on the shareholder.
The amount described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is applied against and reduces the shareholder's adjusted basis of the shares of stock with respect to which the distribution is made under the principles of section 301(c)(2). If the application of the amount described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section would result in a reduction of basis that exceeds the shareholder's adjusted basis of any share of stock with respect to which the distribution is made, such excess is treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property. The reduction of the shareholder's basis described in this paragraph with respect to a qualified distribution occurs prior to the application of paragraph (c) of this section to the excess qualified distribution, if any, with respect to such qualified distribution.
(3)
Distribution of AE
P
—(i)
Amount.
This paragraph (b)(3) applies if an ETSC's AE
P ratio is greater than zero. If this paragraph (b)(3) applies, the portion of a qualified distribution that is sourced from the ETSC's AE
P is equal to the lesser of:
(A) The product of the qualified distribution and the AE
P ratio; and
(B) The ETSC's AE
P immediately before the qualified distribution. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if the ETSC's AE
P immediately before the qualified distribution is less than zero, then the ETSC's AE
P is treated as zero.
(ii)
Effect on ETSC's AE
P.
The ETSC's AE
P is reduced, as described in section 312(a)(1), by the amount of the distribution described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. The AE
P reduction described in this paragraph occurs prior to the application of paragraph (c) of this section, even if a distribution to which paragraph (c) of this section applies (regarding excess qualified distributions and non-qualified distributions) occurs earlier in time than the qualified distribution to which this paragraph applies.
(iii)
Effect on the shareholder.
The amount of the qualified distribution that is sourced from the ETSC's AE
P described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is included in the gross income of the shareholder as a dividend under section 301(c)(1).
(iv)
Adjustment to the AAA ratio and the AE
P ratio.
After the application of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, if the ETSC's AE
P is zero and the ETSC's AAA is greater than zero, then
the ETSC's AAA ratio is one and the ETSC's AE
P ratio is zero for all subsequent qualified distributions during:
(A) That taxable year; and
(B) All subsequent taxable years of the ETSC period.
(4)
Excess qualified distribution treated as a separate qualified distribution
—(i)
In general.
After the application of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section with respect to a qualified distribution, if the ETSC has any remaining AAA, then any amount of excess qualified distribution, with respect to such qualified distribution, is treated as a separate qualified distribution and is analyzed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
(ii)
No change in characterization of previously characterized portion of qualified distribution.
Paragraph (b)(4)(i) will not change the characterization of any portion of a qualified distribution that was previously characterized pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section and will reflect the application of paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section to the portion of the qualified distribution previously characterized.
(c)
Characterization of excess qualified distribution and non-qualified distributions.
After the application of paragraph (b), the excess qualified distributions, if any, and non-qualified distributions, if any, are treated in the manner provided in sections 301(c) and 316.
(d)
Examples.
Paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section (
Examples 1
through
5
) illustrate the rules of this section. For purposes of paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section (
Examples 1
through
5
), X is a calendar year S corporation with a single share of stock outstanding. A, an individual, purchased its share of X stock prior to December 22, 2017, and, except as otherwise indicated, never contributed any amounts to X's capital. A remained the sole shareholder of X when X made a valid revocation on March 15, 2018, pursuant to section 1362(d)(1) and §§ 1.1362-2 and 1.1362-6, of its S election and when that revocation became effective on January 1, 2018. X qualified as an ETSC pursuant to § 1.481-5(b) and its ETSC period began on January 1, 2019. Additionally, X did not make any distributions during its post-termination transition period, within the meaning of section 1377(b)(1)(A). Furthermore, A remains the sole shareholder of X at the time of the distribution(s) described.

Example 1: Historical AE
P is zero
—(i)
Facts.
At the beginning of January 1, 2018, X had AAA of $100 and AE
P of $0. During 2018, X had $300 of CE
P and made no distributions. At the beginning of January 1, 2019, X has AAA of $100 and AE
P of $300, and A's adjusted basis in its share of X stock is $460. During 2019, the only distribution that X makes is a $60 distribution of money to A on December 27. X's CE
P during 2019 is $150, without diminution by reason of any distributions made during the taxable year.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Calculation of AAA ratio and AE
P ratio.
Pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(ix) and (x) of this section, respectively, X's historical AAA and X's historical AE
P are determined as of the beginning of January 1, 2018, the beginning of the day on which the revocation of X's election under section 1362(a) is effective pursuant to section 1362(d)(1). Accordingly, X's historical AAA is $100 and X's historical AE
P is $0. Therefore, X's AAA ratio is 1 ($100/($100 + $0)), and X's AE
P ratio is zero ($0/($100 + $0)).
(B)
Characterization of distribution.
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(xii) of this section, the $60 distribution on December 27, 2019, is a qualified distribution because it is a distribution of money by an ETSC during the ETSC period to which section 301 would apply absent the application of section 1371(f) and this section.
(C)
Analysis of qualified distribution

Distribution of AAA.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the portion of the qualified distribution that is sourced from AAA is equal to the lesser of: The product of the qualified distribution and the AAA ratio ($60 × 1, or $60), and X's AAA immediately before the qualified distribution ($100). Therefore, $60 is sourced from AAA. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, after the distribution, X's AAA is reduced by $60 to $40. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, A's basis in its X stock is reduced by $60 to $400.
(

)
Distribution of AE
P.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the portion of the distribution that is sourced from AE
P is equal to the lesser of: The product of the qualified distribution and the AE
P ratio ($60 × 0, or $0), and X's AE
P immediately before the qualified distribution ($300). Therefore, $0 is sourced from AE
P.

Example 2: Qualified distributions with both historical AAA and historical AE
P
—(i)
Facts.
At the beginning of January 1, 2018, X had AAA of $200 and AE
P of $100. During 2018, X had $0 of CE
P and made no distributions. At the beginning of January 1, 2019, X has AAA of $200 and AE
P of $100, and A's adjusted basis in its share of X stock is $500. During 2019, X makes a $90 distribution of money on February 9 and a $150 distribution of money on June 5. X's CE
P during 2019 is $500, without diminution by reason of any distributions made during the taxable year.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Calculation of AAA ratio and AE
P ratio.
Pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(ix) and (x) of this section, respectively, X's historical AAA and X's historical AE
P are determined as of the beginning of January 1, 2018, the beginning of the day on which the revocation of X's election under section 1362(a) is effective pursuant to section 1362(d)(1). Accordingly, X's historical AAA is $200 and X's historical AE
P is $100. Therefore, X's AAA ratio is 0.67 ($200/($200 + $100)), and X's AE
P ratio is 0.33 ($100/($200 + $100)).
(B)
Characterization of distributions.
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(xii) of this section, the $90 distribution on February 9, 2019, and the $150 distribution on June 5, 2019, are both qualified distributions because they are distributions of money by an ETSC during the ETSC period to which section 301 would apply absent the application of section 1371(f) and this section.

Distribution of AAA.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the portion of the qualified distribution that is sourced from AAA is equal to the lesser of: The product of the qualified distribution and the AAA ratio ($90 × 0.67, or $60), and X's AAA immediately before the qualified distribution ($200). Therefore, $60 is sourced from AAA. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, after the distribution, X's AAA is reduced by $60 to $140. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, A's basis in its X stock is reduced by $60 to $440.

P immediately before the qualified distribution ($100). Therefore, $30 is sourced from AE
P. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, after the distribution, X's AE
P is reduced by $30 to $70. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, the $30 distribution is characterized as a dividend.

P immediately before the qualified distribution ($70). Therefore, $50 is sourced from AE
P. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, after the distribution, X's AE
P is reduced by $50 to $20. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, the $50 distribution is characterized as a dividend.

Example 3: Limitation on amount characterized as AAA
—(i)
Facts.
At the beginning of January 1, 2018, X had AAA of $100 and AE
P of $300. During 2018, X had $280 of CE
P and made no distributions. At the beginning of January 1, 2019, X has AAA of $100 and
AE
P of $580, and A's adjusted basis in its share of X stock is $450. During 2019, the only distribution that X makes is a $500 distribution of money to A on October 5. X's CE
P during 2019 is $150, without diminution by reason of any distributions made during the taxable year.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Calculation of AAA ratio and AE
P ratio.
Pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(ix) and (x) of this section, respectively, X's historical AAA and X's historical AE
P are determined as of the beginning of January 1, 2018, the beginning of the day on which the revocation of X's election under section 1362(a) is effective pursuant to section 1362(d)(1). Accordingly, X's historical AAA is $100 and X's historical AE
P is $300. Therefore, X's AAA ratio is 0.25 ($100/($100 + $300)), and X's AE
P ratio is 0.75 ($300/($100 + $300)).
(B)
Characterization of distribution.
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(xii) of this section, the $500 distribution on October 5, 2019, is a qualified distribution because it is a distribution of money by an ETSC during the ETSC period to which section 301 would apply absent the application of section 1371(f) and this section.

Distribution of AAA.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the portion of the qualified distribution that is sourced from AAA is equal to the lesser of: The product of the qualified distribution and the AAA ratio ($500 × 0.25, or $125), and X's AAA immediately before the qualified distribution ($100). Therefore, $100 is sourced from AAA. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, after the distribution, X's AAA is reduced by $100 to $0. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, A's basis in its X stock is reduced by $100 to $350.
(

)
Distribution of AE
P.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the portion of the distribution that is sourced from AE
P is equal to the lesser of: the product of the qualified distribution and the AE
P ratio ($500 × 0.75, or $375), and X's AE
P immediately before the qualified distribution ($580). Therefore, $375 is sourced from AE
P. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, after the distribution, X's AE
P is reduced by $375 to $205. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, the $375 distribution is characterized as a dividend.
(D)
Effect of qualified distribution on ETSC period.
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(vii) of this section, X's ETSC period ends because X's AAA balance is zero following the October 5, 2019 distribution.

)
Amount of excess qualified distribution.
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(viii) of this section, the amount of the excess qualified distribution is $25, the portion of the qualified distribution ($500) not characterized pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section ($100 AAA distribution + $375 AE
P distribution).
(
2
)
Characterization of excess qualified distribution.
Paragraph (b)(4) of this section does not apply to the excess qualified distribution because X's AAA balance is zero after the application of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section (see paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section). Pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, section 301(c) applies to the excess qualified distribution. Pursuant to sections 301(c)(1) and 316, the $25 excess qualified distribution is sourced from CE
P.
(iii)
Subsequent contribution.
The facts are the same as paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, except that at the time of the October 5, 2019 distribution, A's adjusted basis in its X stock is $90. Further, on December 27, 2019, A contributes $100 to X in a transaction described in section 351(a). The analysis in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section remains the same, except that, unlike the second to last sentence of paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section, A's basis in its X stock is reduced by $90 to $0 and pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, $10 is treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property. Additionally, as a result of the December 27, 2019 contribution of $100, A's basis in its X stock is increased by $100, so that at the end of 2019, A's basis in its X stock is $100.

Pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(ix) and (x) of this section, respectively, X's historical AAA and X's historical AE
P are determined as of the beginning of January 1, 2018, the beginning of the day on which the revocation of X's election under section 1362(a) is effective pursuant to section 1362(d)(1). Accordingly, X's historical AAA is $100 and X's historical AE
P is $100. Therefore, X's AAA ratio is 0.5 ($100/($100 + $100)), and X's AE
P ratio is 0.5 ($100/($100 + $100)).

Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the portion of the distribution that is sourced from AE
P is equal to the lesser of: The product of the qualified distribution and the AE
P ratio ($100 × 0.5, or $50), and X's AE
P immediately before the qualified distribution ($25). Therefore, $25 is sourced from AE
P. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, after the distribution, X's AE
P is reduced by $25 to $0. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, $25 of the distribution is characterized as a dividend.
(

)
Recalculation of AAA and AE
P ratios.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, because the July 9, 2019 distribution caused X's AE
P to be reduced to zero, the AAA ratio is one and the AE
P ratio is zero for all subsequent qualified distributions during the 2019 taxable year and subsequent taxable years of the ETSC period.

)
Amount of excess qualified distribution.
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(viii) of this section, the amount of the excess qualified distribution is $25, the amount of the qualified distribution ($100) not characterized pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section ($50 AAA distribution + $25 AE
P distribution).
(

)
Characterization of excess qualified distribution as a separate qualified distribution.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, because X has AAA remaining after characterizing the qualified distribution (
see
paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(B)(

)(
i
) of this section), the $25 excess qualified distribution is treated as a separate qualified distribution and is analyzed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
(iii)
Analysis of excess qualified distribution that is treated as a separate qualified distribution.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the portion of the distribution that is sourced from AAA is equal to the lesser of: The product of the excess qualified distribution and the AAA ratio ($25 × 1, or $25), and X's AAA immediately before the excess qualified distribution ($50). Therefore, $25 is sourced from AAA. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, after the distribution, X's AAA is reduced by $25 to $25. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, A's basis in its X stock is reduced by $25 to $425. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, because X's AE
P ratio is zero, paragraph (b)(3) of this section does not apply.

)
Characterization of the distribution.
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(xii) of this section, the $40 distribution on September 27, 2019, is a qualified distribution because it is a distribution of money by an ETSC during the ETSC period to which section 301 would apply absent the application of section 1371(f) and this section.

Distribution of AAA.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the portion of the distribution that is sourced from AAA is equal to the lesser of: The product of the qualified distribution and the AAA ratio ($40 × 1, or $40), and X's AAA immediately before the qualified distribution ($25) (
see
paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(B)(
4
)(
iii
) of this section). Therefore, $25 is sourced from AAA. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, after the distribution, X's AAA is reduced by $25 to $0. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, A's basis in its X stock is reduced by $25 to $400.

Amount of excess qualified distribution.
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(viii) of this section, the amount of the excess qualified distribution is $15, the portion of the qualified distribution ($40) not characterized pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section ($25 AAA distribution + $0 AE
P distribution).
(
ii
)
Excess qualified distribution not characterized as a separate qualified distribution.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, because X has AAA of $0 after characterizing the qualified distribution (
see
paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C)(
2
)(
i
) of this section), the $15 excess qualified distribution is not treated as a separate qualified distribution.
(iii)
Analysis of excess qualified distribution that is not treated as a separate qualified distribution.
Pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, section 301(c) applies to the excess qualified distribution. Pursuant to sections 301(c)(1) and 316, the $15 excess qualified distribution is sourced from CE

Example 5: Distributions include non-qualified distributions
—(i)
Facts.
At the beginning of January 1, 2018, X had AAA of $100 and AE
P of $100. During 2018, X had $0 of CE
P and made no distributions. At the beginning of January 1, 2019, X has AAA of $100 and AE
P of $100, and A's adjusted basis in its X stock is $200. During 2019, X makes a $100 distribution of money on June 14; a $300 distribution of property on November 9; and a $200 distribution of money on December 18. X's CE
P during 2019 is $160, without diminution by reason of any distributions made during the taxable year.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Calculation of AAA ratio and AE
P ratio.
Pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(ix) and (x) of this section, respectively, X's historical AAA is $100 and X's historical AE
P is $100. Therefore, X's AAA ratio is 0.5 ($100/($100 + $100)), and X's AE
P ratio is 0.5 ($100/($100 + $100)).
(B)
Characterization of distributions.
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(xii) of this section, the $100 distribution on June 14, 2019, and the $200 distribution on December 18, 2019, are both qualified distributions because they are distributions of money by an ETSC during the ETSC period to which section 301 would apply absent the application of section 1371(f) and this section. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(xi) of this section, the $300 distribution of property on November 9, 2019, is a non-qualified distribution. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the rules of paragraph (b)(2) through (b)(4) of this section apply to the qualified distributions before the rules of paragraph (c) of this section apply to the non-qualified distribution and any excess qualified distributions.

Distribution of AAA.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the portion of the distribution that is sourced from AAA is equal to the lesser of: The product of the qualified distribution and the AAA ratio ($100 × 0.5, or $50), and X's AAA immediately before the qualified distribution ($100). Therefore, $50 is sourced from AAA. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, after the
distribution, X's AAA is reduced by $50 to $50. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, on June 14, 2019, A's basis in its X stock is reduced by $50 to $150.

Distribution of AE
P.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the portion of the distribution that is sourced from AE
P is equal to the lesser of: The product of the qualified distribution and the AE
P ratio ($100 × 0.5, or $50), and X's AE
P immediately before the qualified distribution ($100). Therefore, $50 is sourced from AE
P. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, after the distribution, X's AE
P is reduced by $50 to $50. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, the $50 distribution is characterized as a dividend.

)
Distribution of AAA.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the portion of the distribution that is sourced from AAA is equal to the lesser of: The product of the qualified distribution and the AAA ratio ($200 × 0.5, or $100), and X's AAA immediately before the qualified distribution ($50). Therefore, $50 is sourced from AAA. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, after the distribution, X's AAA is reduced by $50 to $0. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, A must determine its basis as of December 18, 2019, in order to determine the consequences of receiving the $50 AAA distribution. Because the non-qualified distribution on November 9, 2019, which precedes the December 18, 2019 qualified distribution, could have the effect of reducing A's basis, any effect on A's basis from that non-qualified distribution must be analyzed prior to determining the effect of the December 18, 2019 distribution of AAA on A's basis. See paragraphs (d)(5)(ii)(D)(
3
) and (
4
) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(vii) of this section, X's ETSC period ends because X's AAA balance is zero following the December 18, 2019 distribution.

Distribution of AE
P.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the portion of the distribution that is sourced from AE
P is equal to the lesser of: The product of the qualified distribution and the AE
P ratio ($200 × 0.5, or $100), and X's AE
P immediately before the qualified distribution ($50). Therefore, $50 is sourced from AE
P. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, after the distribution, X's AE
P is reduced by $50 to $0. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, the $50 distribution is characterized as a dividend.

Amount of excess qualified distribution.
The amount of the excess qualified distribution is $100, the amount of the qualified distribution ($200) not characterized pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section ($50 AAA distribution + $50 AE

In general.
The $300 non-qualified distribution on November 9, 2019, and the $100 excess qualified distribution on December 18, 2019, are treated in the manner provided in section 301(c).
(

)
Allocation of CE
P.
Pursuant to section 316 and § 1.316-2, X's CE
P is allocated proportionately among the excess qualified and the non-qualified distributions. Therefore, the portion of X's CE
P that is allocated to the November 9, 2019 distribution and the December 18, 2019 distribution is $120 ($160 CE
P × ($300 distribution/$400 total excess qualified and non-qualified distributions during 2019) and $40 ($160 CE
P × ($100 distribution/$400 total excess qualified and non-qualified distributions during 2019), respectively.

ii
) of this section, the amount of X's AE
P available to allocate the November 9, 2019 distribution is $0. Therefore, the remaining $180 is characterized pursuant to section 301(c)(2) and (3). Pursuant to paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(C)(
1
)(
i
) of this section, A's basis in its X stock prior to the November 9, 2019 distribution is $150. Therefore, $150 is applied against basis pursuant to section 301(c)(2) (reducing A's
basis to $0) and $30 is treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property pursuant to section 301(c)(3).

Consequences of AAA distribution.
As of December 18, 2019, A's basis in its X stock is $0. See paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(D)(

)(
i
) of this section, $50 of the distribution is characterized as a distribution of AAA. Because the amount of the distribution of AAA ($50) exceeds A's basis in its X stock ($0), pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, on December 18, 2019, $50 is treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property.

Characterization of excess qualified distribution.
Pursuant to paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(C)(

) of this section, $100 of the December 18, 2019 distribution is an excess qualified distribution. Paragraph (b)(4) of this section does not apply to the excess qualified distribution because X's AAA balance is zero after the application of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section (see paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(C)(

Applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years beginning after October 20, 2020. However, a corporation may choose to apply the rules in §§ 1.481-5, 1.1371-1, and 1.1371-2 in their entirety to taxable years beginning on or before October 20, 2020. If a corporation makes the choice described in the previous sentence, all shareholders of the corporation must report consistently, and the corporation must continue to apply the rules in §§ 1.481-5, 1.1371-1, and 1.1371-2 in their entirety for the corporation's subsequent taxable years.

§ 1.1371-2
Impact of Audit PTTP on ETSC Period.
(a)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section, the definitions used in § 1.1371-1(a)(2) are applicable. Additionally, the following definitions apply for purposes of this section—
(1)
Audit PTTP.
The term
audit PTTP
means a post-termination transition period described in section 1377(b)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code).
(2)
Initial PTTP.
The term
initial PTTP
means a post-termination transition period described in section 1377(b)(1)(A).
(3)
Intervening audit PTTP.
The term
intervening audit PTTP
means an audit PTTP arising during the ETSC period.
(b)
In general.
If an intervening audit PTTP arises, the ETSC period immediately stops. Immediately following the end of the intervening audit PTTP, the ETSC period resumes if the ETSC's AAA balance is greater than zero. Otherwise, any subsequent distributions by the ETSC are treated in the manner provided in section 301(c) of the Code.
(c)
Examples.
Paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section (
Examples 1
and
2
) illustrate the rules of this section. For purposes of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section (
Examples 1
and
2
), X is a calendar year S corporation. A, an individual, purchased all of the outstanding shares of X in a single transaction at the same price per share prior to December 22, 2017, and was the sole shareholder of X at all times. Pursuant to section 1362(d)(1) of the Code and §§ 1.1362-2 and 1.1362-6, X made a valid revocation of its S election on March 15, 2019, that became effective on January 1, 2019. No amount distributed by X is an extraordinary dividend within the meaning of section 1059.
(1)
Example 1: No ETSC period following initial PTTP
—(i)
Facts.
At the beginning of January 1, 2019, X had AAA of $49,000 and AE
P of $2,000, and A's adjusted basis in its shares of X stock was $50,000. During 2019, the only distribution that X made was a $49,000 distribution of money to A on March 13, 2019. X's CE
P during 2019 was $0,
without regard to any diminution by reason of any distributions made during the taxable year.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Distribution during initial PTTP.
Pursuant to sections 1371(e) and 1377(b)(1)(A), the $49,000 distribution of money on March 13, 2019, is characterized as a distribution of AAA because it was made during the initial PTTP.
(B)
Effect on corporation.
Pursuant to § 1.1368-2(a)(3)(iii), X's AAA is reduced by $49,000 to $0. Following the initial PTTP, even if X satisfies the requirements of section 481(d)(2) of the Code and § 1.481-5(b) to be an ETSC, X does not have an ETSC period because its AAA balance is zero at the end of its initial PTTP. Therefore, section 1371(f) of the Code and § 1.1371-1 will not apply to any subsequent distributions by X.
(C)
Effect on shareholder.
Pursuant to section 1371(e)(1), A reduces its basis in its X stock by $49,000 to $1,000.
(2)
Example 2: Intervening audit PTTP
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as the facts in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. On May 20, 2020, which is after X's initial PTTP, the IRS begins an audit of X's 2018 return. During the audit it is agreed that X overstated its advertising expense deduction by $10,000. On July 6, 2020, A signs a closing agreement whereby X's overstatement results in an additional tax on A's 2018 individual return. As a result, at the beginning of January 1, 2019, X had AAA of $59,000 ($49,000 + $10,000) and AE
P of $2,000. Additionally, at the beginning of January 1, 2019, A's adjusted basis in its shares of X stock was $60,000 ($50,000 + $10,000). During 2020, the only distribution X makes is a $6,000 distribution of money to A on September 1, 2020. X's CE
P during 2020 was $0, without regard to any diminution by reason of any distributions made during the taxable year.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Analysis of March 13, 2019 distribution.
The treatment of the March 13, 2019, distribution is the same as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, because the amount of the distribution ($49,000) does not exceed X's AAA balance at the beginning of January 1, 2019 ($59,000), and so the entirety of the $49,000 distribution is properly characterized as a distribution of AAA.
(
1
)
Effect on corporation.
As described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, X's AAA ($59,000 at the beginning of January 1, 2019) is reduced by $49,000 to $10,000. At the conclusion of X's initial PTTP (ending on December 31, 2019), X's AAA balance is $10,000. Pursuant to § 1.1371-1(a)(2)(vii), X has an ETSC period. Therefore, section 1371(f) and § 1.1371-1 will apply to any subsequent qualified distributions by X.
(
2
)
Effect on shareholder.
As described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C) of this section, A reduces its basis in its X stock ($60,000 at the beginning of January 1, 2019) by $49,000 to $11,000.
(B)
Intervening audit PTTP.
Pursuant to section 1377(b)(1)(B), X enters an intervening audit PTTP that begins on July 6, 2020, and ends on November 2, 2020. The application of section 1371(f) and § 1.1371-1 to distributions during the intervening audit PTTP is stopped. Instead, sections 1371(e) and 1377(b)(1)(B) and §§ 1.1371-2 and 1.1377-2 apply for the duration of the intervening audit PTTP. During the intervening audit PTTP, the only distribution X made is a $6,000 distribution of money to A on September 1, 2020. Pursuant to sections 1371(e) and 1377(b)(1)(B), the $6,000 distribution is characterized as a distribution of AAA because it was made during the intervening audit PTTP.
(
1
)
Effect on corporation.
Pursuant to § 1.1368-2(a)(3)(iii), X's AAA is reduced by $6,000 to $4,000. Beginning on November 3, 2020, pursuant to § 1.1371-1(a)(2)(vii), X's ETSC period resumes (after the intervening audit PTTP's conclusion) because its AAA balance is greater than zero.
(
2
)
Effect on shareholder.
Pursuant to section 1371(e)(1), A reduces its basis in its X stock by $6,000 to $5,000.
(C)
ETSC period.
Beginning on November 3, 2020, X's ETSC period resumes, and distributions of money are subject to section 1371(f) and § 1.1371-1 until X's AAA balance is zero. For purposes of calculating each of X's AAA and AE
P ratios, X's historical AAA is $59,000 (at the beginning of January 1, 2019, which includes the $10,000 increase as a result of the July 6, 2020, closing agreement).
(d)
Applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years beginning after
October 20, 2020. However, a corporation may choose to apply the rules in §§ 1.481-5, 1.1371-1, and 1.1371-2 in their entirety to taxable years that began on or before October 20, 2020. If a corporation makes the choice described in the previous sentence, all shareholders of the corporation must report consistently, and the corporation must continue to apply the rules in §§ 1.481-5, 1.1371-1, and 1.1371-2 in their entirety for the corporation's subsequent taxable years.

§ 1.1374-1
General rules and definitions.
(a)
Computation of tax.
The tax imposed on the income of an S corporation by section 1374(a) for any taxable
year during the recognition period is computed as follows—
(1) Step One: Determine the net recognized built-in gain of the corporation for the taxable year under section 1374(d)(2) and § 1.1374-2;
(2) Step Two: Reduce the net recognized built-in gain (but not below zero) by any net operating loss and capital loss carryforward allowed under section 1374(b)(2) and § 1.1374-5;
(3) Step Three: Compute a tentative tax by applying the rate of tax determined under section 1374(b)(1) for the taxable year to the amount determined under paragraph (a)(2) of this section;
(4) Step Four: Compute the final tax by reducing the tentative tax (but not below zero) by any credit allowed under section 1374(b)(3) and § 1.1374-6.
(b)
Anti-trafficking rules.
If section 382, 383, or 384 would have applied to limit the use of a corporation's recognized built-in loss or section 1374 attributes at the beginning of the first day of the recognition period if the corporation had remained a C corporation, these sections apply to limit their use in determining the S corporation's pre-limitation amount, taxable income limitation, net unrealized built-in gain limitation, deductions against net recognized built-in gain, and credits against the section 1374 tax.
(c)
Section 1374 attributes.
Section 1374 attributes are the loss carryforwards allowed under section 1374(b)(2) as a deduction against net recognized built-in gain and the credit and credit carryforwards allowed under section 1374(b)(3) as a credit against the section 1374 tax.
(d)
Recognition period.
The recognition period is the 10-year (120-month) period beginning on the first day the corporation is an S corporation or the day an S corporation acquires assets in a section 1374(d)(8) transaction. For example, if the first day of the recognition period is July 14, 1996, the last day of the recognition period is July 13, 2006. If the recognition period for certain assets ends during an S corporation's taxable year (for example, because the corporation was on a fiscal year as a C corporation and changed to a calendar year as an S corporation or because an S corporation acquired assets in a section 1374(d)(8) transaction during a taxable year), the S corporation must determine its pre-limitation amount (as defined in § 1.1374-2(a)(1)) for the year as if the corporation's books were closed at the end of the recognition period.
(e)
Predecessor corporation.
For purposes of section 1374(c)(1), if the basis of an asset of the S corporation is determined (in whole or in part) by reference to the basis of the asset (or any other property) in the hands of another corporation, the other corporation is a predecessor corporation of the S corporation.

§ 1.1374-2
Net recognized built-in gain.
(a)
In general.
An S corporation's net recognized built-in gain for any taxable year is the least of—
(1) Its taxable income determined by using all rules applying to C corporations and considering only its recognized built-in gain, recognized built-in loss, and recognized built-in gain carryover (pre-limitation amount);
(2) Its taxable income determined by using all rules applying to C corporations as modified by section 1375(b)(1)(B) (taxable income limitation); and
(3) The amount by which its net unrealized built-in gain exceeds its net recognized built-in gain for all prior taxable years (net unrealized built-in gain limitation).
(b)
Allocation rule.
If an S corporation's pre-limitation amount for any taxable year exceeds its net recognized built-in gain for that year, the S corporation's net recognized built-in gain consists of a ratable portion of each item of income, gain, loss, and deduction included in the pre-limitation amount.
(c)
Recognized built-in gain carryover.
If an S corporation's net recognized built-in gain for any taxable year is equal to its taxable income limitation, the amount by which its pre-limitation amount exceeds its taxable income limitation is a recognized built-in gain carryover included in its pre-limitation amount for the succeeding taxable year. The recognized built-in gain carryover consists of that portion of each item of income, gain, loss, and deduction not included in the S corporation's
net recognized built-in gain for the year the carryover arose, as determined under paragraph (b) of this section.
(d)
Accounting methods.
In determining its taxable income for pre-limitation amount and taxable income limitation purposes, a corporation must use the accounting method(s) it uses for tax purposes as an S corporation.
(e)
Example.
The rules of this section are illustrated by the following example.

# Example: Net recognized built-in gain.
X is a calendar year C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. X has a net unrealized built-in gain of $50,000 and no net operating loss or capital loss carryforwards. In 1996, X has a pre-limitation amount of $20,000, consisting of ordinary income of $15,000 and capital gain of $5,000, a taxable income limitation of $9,600, and a net unrealized built-in gain limitation of $50,000. Therefore, X's net recognized built-in gain for 1996 is $9,600, because that is the least of the three amounts described in paragraph (a) of this section. Under paragraph (b) of this section, X's net recognized built-in gain consists of recognized built-in ordinary income of $7,200 [$15,000 × ($9,600/$20,000) = $7,200] and recognized built-in capital gain of $2,400 [$5,000 × ($9,600/$20,000) = $2,400]. Under paragraph (c) of this section, X has a recognized built-in gain carryover to 1997 of $10,400 ($20,000−$9,600 = $10,400), consisting of $7,800 ($15,000−$7,200 = $7,800) of recognized built-in ordinary income and $2,600 ($5,000−$2,400 = $2,600) of recognized built-in capital gain.
[T.D. 8579, 59 FR 66463, Dec. 27, 1994]
§ 1.1374-3
Net unrealized built-in gain.
(a)
In general.
An S corporation's net unrealized built-in gain is the total of the following—
(1) The amount that would be the amount realized if, at the beginning of the first day of the recognition period, the corporation had remained a C corporation and had sold all its assets at fair market value to an unrelated party that assumed all its liabilities; decreased by
(2) Any liability of the corporation that would be included in the amount realized on the sale referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, but only if the corporation would be allowed a deduction on payment of the liability; decreased by
(3) The aggregate adjusted bases of the corporation's assets at the time of the sale referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; increased or decreased by
(4) The corporation's section 481 adjustments that would be taken into account on the sale referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and increased by
(5) Any recognized built-in loss that would not be allowed as a deduction under section 382, 383, or 384 on the sale referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(b)
Adjustment to net unrealized built-in gain
—(1)
In general.
If section 1374(d)(8) applies to an S corporation's acquisition of assets, some or all of the stock of the corporation from which such assets were acquired was taken into account in the computation of the net unrealized built-in gain for a pool of assets of the S corporation, and some or all of such stock is redeemed or canceled in such transaction, then, subject to the limitations of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, such net unrealized built-in gain is adjusted to eliminate any effect that any built-in gain or built-in loss in the redeemed or canceled stock (other than stock with respect to which a loss under section 165 is claimed) had on the initial computation of net unrealized built-in gain for that pool of assets. For purposes of this paragraph, stock described in section 1374(d)(6) shall be treated as taken into account in the computation of the net unrealized built-in gain for a pool of assets of the S corporation.
(2)
Limitations on adjustment
—(i)
Recognized built-in gain or loss.
Net unrealized built-in gain for a pool of assets of the S corporation is only adjusted under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to reflect built-in gain or built-in loss in the redeemed or canceled stock that has not resulted in recognized built-in gain or recognized built-in loss during the recognition period.
(ii)
Anti-duplication rule.
Paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not be applied to duplicate an adjustment to the net unrealized built-in gain for a pool of assets made pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(3)
Effect of adjustment.
Any adjustment to the net unrealized built-in gain made pursuant to this paragraph (b) only affects computations of the
amount subject to tax under section 1374 for taxable years that end on or after the date of the acquisition to which section 1374(d)(8) applies.
(4)
Pool of assets.
For purposes of this section, a pool of assets means—
(i) The assets held by the corporation on the first day it became an S corporation, if the corporation was previously a C corporation; or
(ii) The assets the S corporation acquired from a C corporation in a section 1374(d)(8) transaction.
(c)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:

# Example 1. Computation of net unrealized built-in gain.
(i)(A) X, a calendar year C corporation using the cash method, elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On December 31, 1995, X has assets and liabilities as follows:
Assets
FMV
Basis
Factory
$500,000
$900,000
Accounts Receivable
300,000
0
Goodwill
250,000
0
Total
1,050,000
900,000
Liabilities
Amount
Mortgage
$200,000
Accounts Payable
100,000
Total
300,000
(B) Further, X must include a total of $60,000 in taxable income in 1996, 1997, and 1998 under section 481(a).
(ii) If, on December 31, 1995, X sold all its assets to a third party that assumed all its liabilities, X's amount realized would be $1,050,000 ($750,000 cash received + $300,000 liabilities assumed = $1,050,000). Thus, X's net unrealized built-in gain is determined as follows:
Amount realized
$1,050,000
Deduction allowed (A/P)
(100,000)
Basis of X's assets
(900,000)
Section 481 adjustments

Net unrealized built-in gain
110,000

# Example 2. Adjustment to net unrealized built-in gain for built-in gain in eliminated C corporation stock.
(i) X, a calendar year C corporation, elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 2005. On that date, X's assets (the first pool of assets) have a net unrealized built-in gain of $15,000. Among the assets in the first pool of assets is all of the outstanding stock of Y, a C corporation, with a fair market value of $33,000 and an adjusted basis of $18,000. On March 1, 2009, X sells an asset that it owned on January 1, 2005, and as a result has $10,000 of recognized built-in gain. X has had no other recognized built-in gain or built-in loss. X's taxable income limitation for 2009 is $50,000. Effective June 1, 2009, X elects under section 1361 to treat Y as a qualified subchapter S subsidiary (QSub). The election is treated as a transfer of Y's assets to X in a liquidation to which sections 332 and 337(a) apply.
(ii) Under paragraph (b) of this section, the net unrealized built in-gain of the first pool of assets is adjusted to account for the elimination of the Y stock in the liquidation. The net unrealized built-in gain of the first pool of assets, therefore, is decreased by $15,000, the amount by which the fair market value of the Y stock exceeded its adjusted basis as of January 1, 2005. Accordingly, for taxable years ending after June 1, 2009, the net unrealized built-in gain of the first pool of assets is $0.
(iii) Under § 1.1374-2(a), X's net recognized built-in gain for any taxable year equals the least of X's pre-limitation amount, taxable income limitation, and net unrealized built-in gain limitation. In 2009, X's pre-limitation amount is $10,000, X's taxable income limitation is $50,000, and X's net unrealized built-in gain limitation is $0. Because the net unrealized built-in gain of the first pool of assets has been adjusted to $0, despite the $10,000 of recognized built-in gain in 2009, X has $0 net recognized built-in gain for the taxable year ending on December 31, 2009.

# Example 3. Adjustment to net unrealized built-in gain for built-in loss in eliminated C corporation stock.
(i) X, a calendar year C corporation, elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 2005. On that date, X's assets (the first pool of assets) have a net unrealized built-in gain of negative $5,000. Among the assets in the first pool of assets is 10 percent of the outstanding stock of Y, a C corporation, with a fair market value of $18,000 and an adjusted basis of $33,000. On March 1, 2009, X sells an asset that it owned on January 1, 2005, resulting in $8,000 of recognized built-in gain. X has had no other recognized built-in gains or built-in losses. X's taxable income limitation for 2009 is $50,000. On June 1, 2009, Y transfers its assets to X in a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(C).
(ii) Under paragraph (b) of this section, the net unrealized built in-gain of the first pool of assets is adjusted to account for the elimination of the Y stock in the reorganization. The net unrealized built-in gain of the first pool of assets, therefore, is increased by $15,000, the amount by which the adjusted basis of the Y stock exceeded its fair market value as of January 1, 2005. Accordingly, for taxable years ending after June 1, 2009, the net unrealized built-in gain of the first pool of assets is $10,000.
(iii) Under § 1.1374-2(a), X's net recognized built-in gain for any taxable year equals the least of X's pre-limitation amount, taxable
income limitation, and net unrealized built-in gain limitation. In 2009, X's pre-limitation amount is $8,000 and X's taxable income limitation is $50,000. The net unrealized built-in gain of the first pool of assets has been adjusted to $10,000, so X's net unrealized built-in gain limitation is $10,000. X, therefore, has $8,000 net recognized built-in gain for the taxable year ending on December 31, 2009. X's net unrealized built-in gain limitation for 2010 is $2,000.

# Example 4. Adjustment to net unrealized built-in gain in case of prior gain recognition.
(i) X, a calendar year C corporation, elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 2005. On that date, X's assets (the first pool of assets) have a net unrealized built-in gain of $30,000. Among the assets in the first pool of assets is all of the outstanding stock of Y, a C corporation, with a fair market value of $45,000 and an adjusted basis of $10,000. Y has no current or accumulated earnings and profits. On April 1, 2007, Y distributes $18,000 to X, $8,000 of which is treated as gain to X from the sale or exchange of property under section 301(c)(3). That $8,000 is recognized built-in gain to X under section 1374(d)(3), and results in $8,000 of net recognized built-in gain to X for 2007. X's net unrealized built-in gain limitation for 2008 is $22,000. On June 1, 2009, Y transfers its assets to X in a liquidation to which sections 332 and 337(a) apply.
(ii) Under paragraph (b) of this section, the net unrealized built in-gain of the first pool of assets is adjusted to account for the elimination of the Y stock in the liquidation. The net unrealized built-in gain of that pool of assets, however, can only be adjusted to reflect the amount of built-in gain that was inherent in the Y stock on January 1, 2005 that has not resulted in recognized built-in gain during the recognition period. In this case, therefore, the net unrealized built-in gain of the first pool of assets cannot be reduced by more than $27,000 ($35,000, the amount by which the fair market value of the Y stock exceeded its adjusted basis as of January 1, 2005, minus $8,000, the recognized built-in gain with respect to the stock during the recognition period). Accordingly, for taxable years ending after June 1, 2009, the net unrealized built-in gain of the first pool of assets is $3,000. The net unrealized built-in gain limitation for 2009 is $0.
[T.D. 8579, 59 FR 66464, Dec. 27, 1994, as amended by T.D. 9180, 70 FR 8728, Feb. 23, 2005]
§ 1.1374-4
Recognized built-in gain or loss.
(a)
Sales and exchanges
—(1)
In general.
Section 1374(d)(3) or 1374(d)(4) applies to any gain or loss recognized during the recognition period in a transaction treated as a sale or exchange for Federal income tax purposes.
(2)
Oil and gas property.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an S corporation's adjusted basis in oil and gas property equals the sum of the shareholders' adjusted bases in the property as determined in section 613A(c)(11)(B).
(3)
Examples.
The rules of this paragraph (a) are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1. Production and sale of oil.
X is a C corporation that purchased a working interest in an oil and gas property for $100,000 on July 1, 1993. X elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. On that date, the working interest has a fair market value of $250,000 and an adjusted basis of $50,000, but no oil has as yet been extracted. In 1996, X begins production of the working interest, sells oil that it has produced to a refinery for $75,000, and includes that amount in gross income. Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the $75,000 is not recognized built-in gain because as of the beginning of the recognition period X held only a working interest in the oil and gas property (since the oil had not yet been extracted from the ground), and not the oil itself.

# Example 2. Sale of oil and gas property.
Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. Y has two shareholders, A and B. A and B each own 50 percent of Y's stock. In addition, Y owns a royalty interest in an oil and gas property with a fair market value of $300,000 and an adjusted basis of $200,000. Under section 613A(c)(11)(B), Y's $200,000 adjusted basis in the royalty interest is allocated $100,000 to A and $100,000 to B. During 1996, A and B take depletion deductions with respect to the royalty interest of $10,000 and $15,000, respectively. As of January 1, 1997, A and B have a basis in the royalty interest of $90,000 and $85,000, respectively. On January 1, 1997, Y sells the royalty interest for $250,000. Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, Y has gain recognized and recognized built-in gain of $75,000 ($250,000−($90,000 + $85,000) = $75,000) on the sale.
(b)
Accrual method rule
—(1)
Income items.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, any item of income properly taken into account during the recognition period is recognized built-in gain if the item would have been properly included in gross income before the beginning of the recognition period by an accrual method taxpayer (disregarding any method of accounting for which an election by the taxpayer
must be made unless the taxpayer actually used the method when it was a C corporation).
(2)
Deduction items.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, any item of deduction properly taken into account during the recognition period is recognized built-in loss if the item would have been properly allowed as a deduction against gross income before the beginning of the recognition period to an accrual method taxpayer (disregarding any method of accounting for which an election by the taxpayer must be made unless the taxpayer actually used the method when it was a C corporation). In determining whether an item would have been properly allowed as a deduction against gross income by an accrual method taxpayer for purposes of this paragraph, section 461(h)(2)(C) and § 1.461-4(g) (relating to liabilities for tort, worker's compensation, breach of contract, violation of law, rebates, refunds, awards, prizes, jackpots, insurance contracts, warranty contracts, service contracts, taxes, and other liabilities) do not apply.
(3)
Examples.
The rules of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1. Accounts receivable.
X is a C corporation using the cash method that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. On January 1, 1996, X has $50,000 of accounts receivable for services rendered before that date. On that date, the accounts receivable have a fair market value of $40,000 and an adjusted basis of $0. In 1996, X collects $50,000 on the accounts receivable and includes that amount in gross income. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the $50,000 included in gross income in 1996 is recognized built-in gain because it would have been included in gross income before the beginning of the recognition period if X had been an accrual method taxpayer. However, if X instead disposes of the accounts receivable for $45,000 on July 1, 1996, in a transaction treated as a sale or exchange for Federal income tax purposes, X would have recognized built-in gain of $40,000 on the disposition.

# Example 2. Contingent liability.
Y is a C corporation using the cash method that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. In 1995, a lawsuit was filed against Y claiming $1,000,000 in damages. In 1996, Y loses the lawsuit, pays a $500,000 judgment, and properly claims a deduction for that amount. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the $500,000 deduction allowed in 1996 is not recognized built-in loss because it would not have been allowed as a deduction against gross income before the beginning of the recognition period if Y had been an accrual method taxpayer (even disregarding section 461(h)(2)(C) and § 1.461-4(g)).

# Example 3. Deferred payment liabilities.
X is a C corporation using the cash method that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. In 1995, X lost a lawsuit and became obligated to pay $150,000 in damages. Under section 461(h)(2)(C), this amount is not allowed as a deduction until X makes payment. In 1996, X makes payment and properly claims a deduction for the amount of the payment. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the $150,000 deduction allowed in 1996 is recognized built-in loss because it would have been allowed as a deduction against gross income before the beginning of the recognition period if X had been an accrual method taxpayer (disregarding section 461(h)(2)(C) and § 1.461-4(g)).

# Example 4. Deferred prepayment income.
Y is a C corporation using an accrual method that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. In 1995, Y received $2,500 for services to be rendered in 1996, and properly elected to include the $2,500 in gross income in 1996 under Rev. Proc. 71-21, 1971-2 C.B. 549 (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter). Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the $2,500 included in gross income in 1996 is not recognized built-in gain because it would not have been included in gross income before the beginning of the recognition period by an accrual method taxpayer using the method that Y actually used before the beginning of the recognition period.

# Example 5. Change in method.
X is a C corporation using an accrual method that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. In 1995, X received $5,000 for services to be rendered in 1996, and properly included the $5,000 in gross income. In 1996, X properly elects to include the $5,000 in gross income in 1996 under Rev. Proc. 71-21, 1971-2 C.B. 549 (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter). As a result of the change in method of accounting, X has a $5,000 negative section 481(a) adjustment. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the $5,000 included in gross income in 1996 is recognized built-in gain because it would have been included in gross income before the beginning of the recognition period by an accrual method taxpayer using the method that X actually used before the beginning of the recognition period. In addition, the $5,000 negative section 481(a) adjustment is recognized built-in loss because it relates to an item (the $5,000 X received for services in 1995) attributable to periods before the beginning of the recognition period under the principles for determining recognized built-in gain or loss in this section. See paragraph (d) of this section for rules regarding section 481(a) adjustments.
(c)
Section 267(a)(2) and 404(a)(5) deductions
—(1)
Section 267(a)(2).
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any amount properly deducted in the recognition period under section 267(a)(2), relating to payments to related parties, is recognized built-in loss to the extent—
(i) All events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability to pay the amount, and the exact amount of the liability can be determined, as of the beginning of the recognition period; and
(ii) The amount is paid—
(A) In the first two and one-half months of the recognition period; or
(B) To a related party owning, under the attribution rules of section 267, less than 5 percent, by voting power and value, of the corporation's stock, both as of the beginning of the recognition period and when the amount is paid.
(2)
Section 404(a)(5).
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any amount properly deducted in the recognition period under section 404(a)(5), relating to payments for deferred compensation, is recognized built-in loss to the extent—
(i) All events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability to pay the amount, and the exact amount of the liability can be determined, as of the beginning of the recognition period; and
(ii) The amount is not paid to a related party to which section 267(a)(2) applies.
(3)
Examples.
The rules of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1. Fixed annuity.
X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. On December 31, 1995, A is age 60, has provided services to X as an employee for 20 years, and is a vested participant in X's unfunded nonqualified retirement plan. Under the plan, A receives $1,000 per month upon retirement until death. The plan provides no additional benefits. A retires on December 31, 1997, after working for X for 22 years. A at no time is a shareholder of X. X's deductions under section 404(a)(5) in the recognition period on paying A the $1,000 per month are recognized built-in loss because all events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability to pay the amount, and the exact amount of the liability can be determined, as of the beginning of the recognition period.

# Example 2. Increase in annuity for working beyond 20 years.
The facts are the same as
Example 1,
except that under the plan A receives $1,000 per month, plus $100 per month for each year A works for X beyond 20 years, upon retirement until death. X's deductions on paying A the $1,000 per month are recognized built-in loss. However, X's deductions on paying A the $200 per month for the two years A worked for X beyond 20 years are not recognized built-in loss because all events have not occurred that establish the fact of the liability to pay the amount, and the exact amount of the liability cannot be determined, as of the beginning of the recognition period.

# Example 3. Cost of living adjustment.
The facts are the same as
Example 1,
except that under the plan A receives $1,000 per month, plus annual cost of living adjustments, upon retirement until death. X's deductions under section 404(a)(5) on paying A the $1,000 per month are recognized built-in loss. However, X's deductions under section 404(a)(5) on paying A the annual cost of living adjustment are not recognized built-in loss because all events have not occurred that establish the fact of the liability to pay the amount, and the exact amount of the liability cannot be determined, as of the beginning of the recognition period.
(d)
Section 481(a) adjustments
—(1)
In general.
Any section 481(a) adjustment taken into account in the recognition period is recognized built-in gain or loss to the extent the adjustment relates to items attributable to periods before the beginning of the recognition period under the principles for determining recognized built-in gain or loss in this section. The principles for determining recognized built-in gain or loss in this section include, for example, the accrual method rule under paragraph (b) of this section.

The rules of this paragraph (d) are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1. Omitted item attributable to prerecognition period.
X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. X improperly capitalizes repair costs and recovers the costs through depreciation of the related assets. In 1999, X properly changes to deducting repair costs as they are incurred. Under section 481(a), the basis of the related assets are reduced by an amount equal to the excess of the repair costs incurred before the year of change over the repair costs recovered through depreciation before the year of change. In addition, X has a negative section 481(a) adjustment
equal to the basis reduction. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the portion of X's negative section 481(a) adjustment relating to the repair costs incurred before the recognition period is recognized built-in loss because those repair costs are items attributable to periods before the beginning of the recognition period under the principles for determining recognized built-in gain or loss in this section.

# Example 2. Duplicated item attributable to prerecognition period.
Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. Y improperly uses an accrual method without regard to the economic performance rules of section 461(h) to account for worker's compensation claims. As a result, Y takes deductions when claims are filed. In 1999, Y properly changes to an accrual method with regard to the economic performance rules under section 461(h)(2)(C) for worker's compensation claims. As a result, Y takes deductions when claims are paid. The positive section 481(a) adjustment resulting from the change is equal to the amount of claims filed, but unpaid, before the year of change. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the deduction allowed in the recognition period for claims filed, but unpaid, before the recognition period is recognized built-in loss because a deduction was allowed for those claims before the recognition period under an accrual method without regard to section 461(h)(2)(C). Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the portion of Y's positive section 481(a) adjustment relating to claims filed, but unpaid, before the recognition period is recognized built-in gain because those claims are items attributable to periods before the beginning of the recognition period under the principles for determining recognized built-in gain or loss in this section.
(e)
Section 995(b)(2) deemed distributions.
Any item of income properly taken into account during the recognition period under section 995(b)(2) is recognized built-in gain if the item results from a DISC termination or disqualification occurring before the beginning of the recognition period.
(f)
Discharge of indebtedness and bad debts.
Any item of income or deduction properly taken into account during the first year of the recognition period as discharge of indebtedness income under section 61(a)(12) or as a bad debt deduction under section 166 is recognized built-in gain or loss if the item arises from a debt owed by or to an S corporation at the beginning of the recognition period.
(g)
Completion of contract.
Any item of income properly taken into account during the recognition period under the completed contract method (as described in § 1.460-4(d)) where the corporation began performance of the contract before the beginning of the recognition period is recognized built-in gain if the item would have been included in gross income before the beginning of the recognition period under the percentage of completion method (as described in § 1.460-4(b)). Any similar item of deduction is recognized built-in loss if the item would have been allowed as a deduction against gross income before the beginning of the recognition period under the percentage of completion method.
(h)
Installment method
—(1)
In general.
If a corporation sells an asset before or during the recognition period and reports the income from the sale using the installment method under section 453 during or after the recognition period, that income is subject to tax under section 1374.
(2)
Limitation on amount subject to tax.
For purposes of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the taxable income limitation under § 1.1374-2(a)(2) is equal to the amount by which the S corporation's net recognized built-in gain would have been increased from the year of the sale to the earlier of the year the income is reported under the installment method or the last year of the recognition period, assuming all income from the sale had been reported in the year of the sale and all provisions of section 1374 applied. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if the corporation sells the asset before the recognition period, the income from the sale that is not reported before the recognition period is treated as having been reported in the first year of the recognition period.
(3)
Rollover rule.
If the limitation in paragraph (h)(2) of this section applies, the excess of the amount reported under the installment method over the amount subject to tax under the limitation is treated as if it were reported in the succeeding taxable year(s), but only for succeeding taxable year(s) in the recognition period. The amount reported in the succeeding taxable year(s) under the preceding sentence is reduced to the extent that the amount not subject to tax under the limitation
in paragraph (h)(2) of this section was not subject to tax because the S corporation had an excess of recognized built-in loss over recognized built-in gain in the taxable year of the sale and succeeding taxable year(s) in the recognition period.
(4)
Use of losses and section 1374 attributes.
If income is reported under the installment method by an S corporation for a taxable year after the recognition period and the income is subject to tax under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the S corporation's section 1374 attributes may be used to the extent their use is allowed under all applicable provisions of the Code in determining the section 1374 tax. However, the S corporation's loss recognized for a taxable year after the recognition period that would have been recognized built-in loss if it had been recognized in the recognition period may not be used in determining the section 1374 tax.
(5)
Examples.
The rules of this paragraph (h) are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1. Rollover rule.
X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. On that date, X sells Blackacre with a basis of $0 and a value of $100,000 in exchange for a $100,000 note bearing a market rate of interest payable on January 1, 2001. X does not make the election under section 453(d) and, therefore, reports the $100,000 gain using the installment method under section 453. In the year 2001, X has income of $100,000 on collecting the note, unexpired C year attributes of $0, recognized built-in loss of $0, current losses of $100,000, and taxable income of $0. If X had reported the $100,000 gain in 1996, X's net recognized built-in gain from 1996 through 2001 would have been $75,000 greater than otherwise. Under paragraph (h) of this section, X has $75,000 net recognized built-in gain subject to tax under section 1374. X also must treat the $25,000 excess of the amount reported, $100,000, over the amount subject to tax, $75,000, as income reported under the installment method in the succeeding taxable year(s) in the recognition period, except to the extent X establishes that the $25,000 was not subject to tax under section 1374 in the year 2001 because X had an excess of recognized built-in loss over recognized built-in gain in the taxable year of the sale and succeeding taxable year(s) in the recognition period.

# Example 2. Use of losses.
Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. On that date, Y sells Whiteacre with a basis of $0 and a value of $250,000 in exchange for a $250,000 note bearing a market rate of interest payable on January 1, 2006. Y does not make the election under section 453(d) and, therefore, reports the $250,000 gain using the installment method under section 453. In the year 2006, Y has income of $250,000 on collecting the note, unexpired C year attributes of $0, loss of $100,000 that would have been recognized built-in loss if it had been recognized in the recognition period, current losses of $150,000, and taxable income of $0. If Y had reported the $250,000 gain in 1996, X's net recognized built-in gain from 1996 through 2005 (that is, during the recognition period) would have been $225,000 greater than otherwise. Under paragraph (h) of this section, X has $225,000 net recognized built-in gain subject to tax under section 1374.

# Example 3. Use of section 1374 attribute.
Z is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. On that date, Z sells Greenacre with a basis of $0 and a value of $500,000 in exchange for a $500,000 note bearing a market rate of interest payable on January 1, 2011. Z does not make the election under section 453(d) and, therefore, reports the $500,000 gain using the installment method under section 453. In the year 2011, Z has income of $500,000 on collecting the note, loss of $0 that would have been recognized built-in loss if it had been recognized in the recognition period, current losses of $0, taxable income of $500,000, and a minimum tax credit of $60,000 arising in 1995. None of Z's minimum tax credit is limited under sections 53(c) or 383. If Z had reported the $500,000 gain in 1996, Z's net recognized built-in gain from 1996 through 2005 (that is, during the recognition period) would have been $350,000 greater than otherwise. Under paragraph (h) of this section, Z has $350,000 net recognized built-in gain subject to tax under section 1374, a tentative section 1374 tax of $122,500 ($350,000 × .35 = $122,500), and a section 1374 tax after using its minimum tax credit arising in 1995 of $62,250 ($122,500 − $60,000 = $62,250).
(i)
Partnership interests
—(1)
In general.
If an S corporation owns a partnership interest at the beginning of the recognition period or transfers property to a partnership in a transaction to which section 1374(d)(6) applies during the recognition period, the S corporation determines the effect on net recognized built-in gain from its distributive share of partnership items as follows—
(i) Step One: Apply the rules of section 1374(d) to the S corporation's distributive share of partnership items of
income, gain, loss, or deduction included in income or allowed as a deduction under the rules of subchapter K to determine the extent to which it would have been treated as recognized built-in gain or loss if the partnership items had originated in and been taken into account directly by the S corporation (partnership 1374 items);
(ii) Step Two: Determine the S corporation's net recognized built-in gain without partnership 1374 items;
(iii) Step Three: Determine the S corporation's net recognized built-in gain with partnership 1374 items; and
(iv) Step Four: If the amount computed under Step Three (paragraph (i)(1)(iii) of this section) exceeds the amount computed under Step Two (paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section), the excess (as limited by paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section) is the S corporation's partnership RBIG, and the S corporation's net recognized built-in gain is the sum of the amount computed under Step Two (paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section) plus the partnership RBIG. If the amount computed under Step Two (paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section) exceeds the amount computed under Step Three (paragraph (i)(1)(iii) of this section), the excess (as limited by paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section) is the S corporation's partnership RBIL, and the S corporation's net recognized built-in gain is the remainder of the amount computed under Step Two (paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section) after subtracting the partnership RBIL.
(2)
Limitations
—(i)
Partnership RBIG.
An S corporation's partnership RBIG for any taxable year may not exceed the excess (if any) of the S corporation's RBIG limitation over its partnership RBIG for prior taxable years. The preceding sentence does not apply if a corporation forms or avails of a partnership with a principal purpose of avoiding the tax imposed under section 1374.
(ii)
Partnership RBIL.
An S corporation's partnership RBIL for any taxable year may not exceed the excess (if any) of the S corporation's RBIL limitation over its partnership RBIL for prior taxable years.
(3)
Disposition of partnership interest.
If an S corporation disposes of its partnership interest, the amount that may be treated as recognized built-in gain may not exceed the excess (if any) of the S corporation's RBIG limitation over its partnership RBIG during the recognition period. Similarly, the amount that may be treated as recognized built-in loss may not exceed the excess (if any) of the S corporation's RBIL limitation over its partnership RBIL during the recognition period.
(4)
RBIG and RBIL limitations
—(i)
Sale of partnership interest.
An S corporation's RBIG or RBIL limitation is the total of the following—
(A) The amount that would be the amount realized if, at the beginning of the first day of the recognition period, the corporation had remained a C corporation and had sold its partnership interest (and any assets the corporation contributed to the partnership during the recognition period) at fair market value to an unrelated party; decreased by
(B) The corporation's adjusted basis in the partnership interest (and any assets the corporation contributed to the partnership during the recognition period) at the time of the sale referred to in paragraph (i)(4)(i)(A) of this section; and increased or decreased by
(C) The corporation's allocable share of the partnership's section 481(a) adjustments at the time of the sale referred to in paragraph (i)(4)(i)(A) of this section.
(ii)
Amounts of limitations.
If the result in paragraph (i)(4)(i) of this section is a positive amount, the S corporation has a RBIG limitation equal to that amount and a RBIL limitation of $0, but if the result in paragraph (i)(4)(i) of this section is a negative amount, the S corporation has a RBIL limitation equal to that amount and a RBIG limitation of $0.
(5)
Small interest exception
—(i)
In general.
Paragraph (i)(1) of this section does not apply to a taxable year in the recognition period if the S corporation's partnership interest represents less than 10 percent of the partnership's capital and profits at all times during the taxable year and prior taxable years in the recognition period, and the fair market value of the S corporation's partnership interest as of
the beginning of the recognition period is less than $100,000.
(ii)
Contributed assets.
For purposes of paragraph (i)(5)(i) of this section, if the S corporation contributes any assets to the partnership during the recognition period and the S corporation held the assets as of the beginning of the recognition period, the fair market value of the S corporation's partnership interest as of the beginning of the recognition period is determined as if the assets were contributed to the partnership before the beginning of the recognition period (using the fair market value of each contributed asset as of the beginning of the recognition period). The contribution does not affect whether paragraph (i)(5)(i) of this section applies for taxable years in the recognition period before the taxable year in which the contribution was made.
(iii)
Anti-abuse rule.
Paragraph (i)(5)(i) of this section does not apply if a corporation forms or avails of a partnership with a principal purpose of avoiding the tax imposed under section 1374.
(6)
Section 704(c) gain or loss.
Solely for purposes of section 1374, an S corporation's section 704(c) gain or loss amount with respect to any asset is not reduced during the recognition period, except for amounts treated as recognized built-in gain or loss with respect to that asset under this paragraph.
(7)
Disposition of distributed partnership asset.
If on the first day of the recognition period an S corporation holds an interest in a partnership that holds an asset and during the recognition period the partnership distributes the asset to the S corporation that thereafter disposes of the asset, the asset is treated as having been held by the S corporation on the first day of the recognition period and as having the fair market value and adjusted basis in the hands of the S corporation that it had in the hands of the partnership on that day.
(8)
Examples.
The rules of this paragraph (i) are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1. Pre-conversion partnership interest.
X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, X owns a 50 percent interest in partnership P and P owns (among other assets) Blackacre with a basis of $25,000 and a value of $45,000. In 1996, P buys Whiteacre for $50,000. In 1999, P sells Blackacre for $55,000 and recognizes a gain of $30,000 of which $15,000 is included in X's distributive share. P also sells Whiteacre in 1999 for $42,000 and recognizes a loss of $8,000 of which $4,000 is included in X's distributive share. Under this paragraph and section 1374(d)(3), X's $15,000 gain is presumed to be recognized built-in gain and thus treated as a partnership 1374 item, but this presumption is rebutted if X establishes that P's gain would have been only $20,000 ($45,000−$25,000 = $20,000) if Blackacre had been sold on the first day of the recognition period. In such a case, only X's distributive share of the $20,000 built-in gain, $10,000, would be treated as a partnership 1374 item. Under this paragraph and section 1374(d)(4), X's $4,000 loss is not treated as a partnership 1374 item because P did not hold Whiteacre on the first day of the recognition period.

# Example 2. Post-conversion contribution.
Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, Y owns (among other assets) Blackacre with a basis of $100,000 and a value of $200,000. On January 1, 1998, when Blackacre has a basis of $100,000 and a value of $200,000, Y contributes Blackacre to partnership P for a 50 percent interest in P. On January 1, 2000, P sells Blackacre for $300,000 and recognizes a gain of $200,000 on the sale ($300,000−$100,000 = $200,000). P is allocated $100,000 of the gain under section 704(c), and another $50,000 of the gain for its fifty percent share of the remainder, for a total of $150,000. Under this paragraph and section 1374(d)(3), if Y establishes that P's gain would have been only $100,000 ($200,000−$100,000 = $100,000) if Blackacre had been sold on the first day of the recognition period, Y would treat only $100,000 as a partnership 1374 item.

# Example 3. RBIG limitation of $100,000 or $50,000.
X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, X owns a 50 percent interest in partnership P with a RBIG limitation of $100,000 and a RBIL limitation of $0. P owns (among other assets) Blackacre with a basis of $50,000 and a value of $200,000. In 1996, P sells Blackacre for $200,000 and recognizes a gain of $150,000 of which $75,000 is included in X's distributive share and treated as a partnership 1374 item. X's net recognized built-in gain for 1996 computed without partnership 1374 items is $35,000 and with partnership 1374 items is $110,000. Thus, X has a partnership RBIG of $75,000 except as limited under paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section. Because X's RBIG limitation is $100,000, X's partnership RBIG of $75,000 is not limited and X's net recognized built-in gain for the year is $110,000 ($35,000 + $75,000 = $110,000). However, if X had a RBIG limitation of $50,000 instead
of $100,000, X's partnership RBIG would be limited to $50,000 under paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section and X's net recognized built-in gain would be $85,000 ($35,000 + $50,000 = $85,000).

# Example 4. RBIL limitation of $60,000 or $40,000.
Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, Y owns a 50 percent interest in partnership P with a RBIG limitation of $0 and a RBIL limitation of $60,000. P owns (among other assets) Blackacre with a basis of $225,000 and a value of $125,000. In 1996, P sells Blackacre for $125,000 and recognizes a loss of $100,000 of which $50,000 is included in Y's distributive share and treated as a partnership 1374 item. Y's net recognized built-in gain for 1996 computed without partnership 1374 items is $75,000 and with partnership 1374 items is $25,000. Thus, Y has a partnership RBIL of $50,000 for the year except as limited under paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section. Because Y's RBIL limitation is $60,000, Y's partnership RBIL for the year is not limited and Y's net recognized built-in gain for the year is $25,000 ($75,000−$50,000 = $25,000). However, if Y had a RBIL limitation of $40,000 instead of $60,000, Y's partnership RBIL would be limited to $40,000 under paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section and Y's net recognized built-in gain for the year would be $35,000 ($75,000−$40,000 = $35,000).

# Example 5. RBIG limitation of $0.
(i) X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. X owns a 50 percent interest in partnership P with a RBIG limitation of $0 and a RBIL limitation of $25,000.
(a) In 1996, P's partnership 1374 items are—
(1) Ordinary income of $25,000; and
(2) Capital gain of $75,000.
(b) X itself has—
(1) Recognized built-in ordinary income of $40,000; and
(2) Recognized built-in capital loss of $90,000.
(ii) X's net recognized built-in gain for 1996 computed without partnership 1374 items is $40,000 and with partnership 1374 items is $65,000 ($40,000 + $25,000 = $65,000). Thus, X's partnership RBIG is $25,000 for the year except as limited under paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section. Because X's RBIG limitation is $0, X's partnership RBIG of $25,000 is limited to $0 and X's net recognized built-in gain for the year is $40,000.

# Example 6. RBIL limitation of $0.
(i) Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. Y owns a 50 percent interest in partnership P with a RBIG limitation of $60,000 and a RBIL limitation of $0.
(a) In 1996, P's partnership 1374 items are—
(1) Ordinary income of $25,000; and
(2) Capital loss of $90,000.
(b) Y itself has—
(1) recognized built-in ordinary income of $40,000; and
(2) recognized built-in capital gain of $75,000.
(ii) Y's net recognized built-in gain for 1996 computed without partnership 1374 items is $115,000 ($40,000 + $75,000 = $115,000) and with partnership 1374 items is $65,000 ($40,000 + $25,000 = $65,000). Thus, Y's partnership RBIL is $50,000 for the year except as limited under paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section. Because Y's RBIL limitation is $0, Y's partnership RBIL of $50,000 is limited to $0 and Y's net recognized built-in gain is $115,000.

# Example 7. Disposition of partnership interest.
X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, X owns a 50 percent interest in partnership P with a RBIG limitation of $200,000 and a RBIL limitation of $0. P owns (among other assets) Blackacre with a basis of $20,000 and a value of $140,000. In 1996, P sells Blackacre for $140,000 and recognizes a gain of $120,000 of which $60,000 is included in X's distributive share and treated as a partnership 1374 item. X's net recognized built-in gain for 1996 computed without partnership 1374 items is $95,000 and with partnership 1374 items is $155,000. Thus, X has a partnership RBIG of $60,000. In 1999, X sells its entire interest in P for $350,000 and recognizes a gain of $250,000. Under paragraph (i)(3) of this section, X's recognized built-in gain on the sale is limited by its RBIG limitation to $140,000 ($200,000−$60,000 = $140,000).

# Example 8. Section 704(c) case.
Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, Y contributes Asset 1, 5-year property with a value of $40,000 and a basis of $0, and an unrelated party contributes $40,000 in cash, each for a 50 percent interest in partnership P. The partnership adopts the traditional method under § 1.704-3(b). If P sold Asset 1 for $40,000 immediately after it was contributed by Y, P's $40,000 gain would be allocated to Y under section 704(c). Instead, Asset 1 is sold by P in 1999 for $36,000 and P recognizes gain of $36,000 ($36,000−$0 = $36,000) on the sale. However, because book depreciation of $8,000 per year has been taken on Asset 1 in 1996, 1997, and 1998, Y is allocated only $16,000 of P's $36,000 gain ($40,000−(3 × $8,000) = ($16,000−$0) = $16,000) under section 704(c). The remaining $20,000 of P's $36,000 gain ($36,000−$16,000 = $20,000) is allocated 50 percent to each partner under section 704(b). Thus, a total of $26,000 ($16,000 + $10,000 = $26,000) of P's $36,000 gain is allocated to Y. However, under paragraph (i)(6) of this section, Y treats $36,000 as a partnership 1374 item on P's sale of Asset 1.

# Example 9. Disposition of distributed partnership asset.
X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, X owns a fifty percent interest in partnership P and P owns (among other
assets) Blackacre with a basis of $20,000 and a value of $40,000. On January 1, 1998, P distributes Blackacre to X, when Blackacre has a basis of $20,000 and a value of $50,000. Under section 732(a)(1), X has a transferred basis of $20,000 in Blackacre. On January 1, 1999, X sells Blackacre for $60,000 and recognizes a gain of $40,000. Under paragraph (i)(7) of this section and section 1374(d)(3), X has recognized built-in gain from the sale of $20,000, the amount of built-in gain in Blackacre on the first day of the recognition period.
[T.D. 8579, 59 FR 66464, Dec. 27, 1994, as amended by T.D. 8995. 67 FR 34610, May 15, 2002]
§ 1.1374-5
Loss carryforwards.
(a)
In general.
The loss carryforwards allowed as deductions against net recognized built-in gain under section 1374(b)(2) are allowed only to the extent their use is allowed under the rules applying to C corporations. Any other loss carryforwards, such as charitable contribution carryforwards under section 170(d)(2), are not allowed as deductions against net recognized built-in gain.
(b)
Example.
The rules of this section are illustrated by the following example.

# Example: Section 382 limitation.
X is a C corporation that has an ownership change under section 382(g)(1) on January 1, 1994. On that date, X has a fair market value of $500,000, NOL carryforwards of $400,000, and a net unrealized built-in gain under section 382(h)(3)(A) of $0. Assume X's section 382 limitation under section 382(b)(1) is $40,000. X elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1998. On that date, X has NOL carryforwards of $240,000 (having used $160,000 of its pre-change net operating losses in its 4 preceding taxable years) and a section 1374 net unrealized built-in gain of $250,000. In 1998, X has net recognized built-in gain of $100,000. X may use $40,000 of its NOL carryforwards as a deduction against its $100,000 net recognized built-in gain, because X's section 382 limitation is $40,000.

§ 1.1374-6
Credits and credit carryforwards.
(a)
In general.
The credits and credit carryforwards allowed as credits against the section 1374 tax under section 1374(b)(3) are allowed only to the extent their use is allowed under the rules applying to C corporations. Any other credits or credit carryforwards, such as foreign tax credits under section 901, are not allowed as credits against the section 1374 tax.
(b)
Limitations.
The amount of business credit carryforwards and minimum tax credit allowed against the section 1374 tax are subject to the limitations described in section 38(c) and section 53(c), respectively, as modified by this paragraph. The tentative tax determined under paragraph (a)(3) of § 1.1374-1 is treated as the regular tax liability described in sections 38(c)(1) and 53(c)(1), and as the net income tax and net regular tax liability described in section 38(c)(1). The tentative minimum tax described in section 55(b) is determined using the rate of tax applicable to corporations and without regard to any alternative minimum tax foreign tax credit described in that section and by treating the net recognized built-in gain determined under § 1.1374-2, modified to take into account the adjustments of sections 56 and 58 applicable to corporations and the preferences of section 57, as the alternative minimum taxable income described in section 55(b)(2).
(c)
Examples.
The rules of this section are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1. Business credit carryforward.
X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. On that date, X has a $500,000 business credit carryforward from a C year and Asset #1 with a fair market value of $400,000, a basis for regular tax purposes of $95,000, and a basis for alternative minimum tax purposes of $150,000. In 1996, X has net recognized built-in gain of $305,000 from selling Asset #1 for $400,000. Thus, X's tentative tax under paragraph (a)(3) of § 1.1374-1 and regular tax liability under paragraph (b) of this section is $106,750 ($400,000−$95,000 = $305,000 × .35= $106,750, assuming a 35 percent tax rate). Also, X's tentative minimum tax determined under paragraph (b) of this section is $47,000 [$400,000−$150,000 = $250,000−$15,000 ($40,000 corporate exemption amount −$25,000 phase-out = $15,000) = $235,000 × .20 = $47,000, assuming a 20 percent tax rate]. Thus, the business credit limitation under section 38(c) is $59,750 [$106,750−$47,000 (the greater of $47,000 or $20,438 (.25 × $81,750 ($106,750−$25,000 = $81,750))) = $59,750]. As a result, X's section 1374 tax is $47,000 ($106,750−$59,750= $47,000) for 1996 and X has $440,250 ($500,000−$59,750 = $440,250) of business credit carryforwards for succeeding taxable years.

# Example 2. Minimum tax credit.
Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. On that date, Asset#1 has a fair market value of $5,000,000, a basis for regular tax purposes of $4,000,000, and a basis for alternative minimum tax purposes of $4,750,000. Y also has a minimum tax credit of $310,000 from 1995. Y has no other assets, no net operating or capital loss carryforwards, and no business credit carryforwards. In 1996, Y's only transaction is the sale of Asset #1 for $5,000,000. Therefore, Y has net recognized built-in gain in 1996 of $1,000,000 ($5,000,000−$4,000,000 = $1,000,000) and a tentative tax under paragraph (a)(3) of § 1.1374-1 of $350,000 ($1,000,000 × .35 = $350,000, assuming a 35 percent tax rate). Also, Y's tentative minimum tax determined under paragraph (b) of this section is $47,000 [$5,000,000−$4,750,000 = $250,000−$15,000 ($40,000 corporate exemption amount −$25,000 phase-out = $15,000) = $235,000 × .20 = $47,000, assuming a 20 percent tax rate]. Thus, Y may use its minimum tax credit in the amount of $303,000 ($350,000−$47,000 = $303,000) to offset its section 1374 tentative tax. As a result, Y's section 1374 tax is $47,000 ($350,000−$303,000 = $47,000) in 1996 and Y has a minimum tax credit attributable to years for which Y was a C corporation of $7,000 ($310,000−$303,000 = $7,000).
[T.D. 8579, 59 FR 66469, Dec. 27, 1994]
§ 1.1374-7
Inventory.
(a)
Valuation.
The fair market value of the inventory of an S corporation on the first day of the recognition period equals the amount that a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for the inventory in a purchase of all the S corporation's assets by a buyer that expects to continue to operate the S corporation's business. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the buyer and seller are presumed not to be under any compulsion to buy or sell and to have reasonable knowledge of all relevant facts.
(b)
Identity of dispositions.
The inventory method used by an S corporation for tax purposes must be used to identify whether the inventory it disposes of during the recognition period is inventory it held on the first day of that period. Thus, a corporation using the LIFO method does not dispose of inventory it held on the first day of the recognition period unless the carrying value of its inventory for a taxable year during that period is less than the carrying value of its inventory on the first day of the recognition period (determined using the LIFO method as described in section 472). However, if a corporation changes its method of accounting for inventory (for example, from the FIFO method to the LIFO method or from the LIFO method to the FIFO method) with a principal purpose of avoiding the tax imposed under section 1374, it must use its former method to identify its dispositions of inventory.
[T.D. 8579, 59 FR 66469, Dec. 27, 1994]
§ 1.1374-8
Section 1374(d)(8) transactions.
(a)
In general.
If any S corporation acquires any asset in a transaction in which the S corporation's basis in the asset is determined (in whole or in part) by reference to a C corporation's basis in the assets (or any other property) (a section 1374(d)(8) transaction), section 1374 applies to the net recognized built-in gain attributable to the assets acquired in any section 1374(d)(8) transaction.
(b)
Effective date of section 1374(d)(8).
Section 1374(d)(8) applies to any section 1374(d)(8) transaction, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, that occurs on or after December 27, 1994, without regard to the date of the corporation's election to be an S corporation under section 1362.
(c)
Separate determination of tax.
For purposes of the tax imposed under section 1374(d)(8), a separate determination of tax is made with respect to the assets the S corporation acquires in one section 1374(d)(8) transaction from the assets the S corporation acquires in another section 1374(d)(8) transaction and from the assets the corporation held when it became an S corporation. Thus, an S corporation's section 1374 attributes when it became an S corporation may only be used to reduce the section 1374 tax imposed on dispositions of assets the S corporation held at that time. Similarly, an S corporation's section 1374 attributes acquired in a section 1374(d)(8) transaction may only be used to reduce a section 1374 tax imposed on dispositions of assets the S corporation acquired in the same transaction. If an S corporation makes QSub elections under section 1361(b)(3)
for a tiered group of subsidiaries effective on the same day, see § 1.1361-4(b)(2).
(d)
Taxable income limitation.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, an S corporation's taxable income limitation under § 1.1374-2(a)(2) for any taxable year is allocated between or among each of the S corporation's separate determinations of net recognized built-in gain for that year (determined without regard to the taxable income limitation) based on the ratio of each of those determinations to the sum of all of those determinations.
(e)
Examples.
The rules of this section are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1. Separate determination of tax.
(i) X is a C corporation that elected to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1986 (before section 1374 was amended in the Tax Reform Act of 1986). X has a net operating loss carryforward of $20,000 arising in 1985 when X was a C corporation. On January 1, 1996, Y (an unrelated C corporation) merges into X in a transaction to which section 368(a)(1)(A) applies. Y has no loss carryforwards, credits, or credit carryforwards. The assets X acquired from Y are subject to tax under section 1374 and have a net unrealized built-in gain of $150,000.
(ii) In 1996, X has a pre-limitation amount of $50,000 on dispositions of assets acquired from Y and a taxable income limitation of $100,000 (because only one group of assets is subject to section 1374, there is no allocation of the taxable income limitation). As a result, X has a net recognized built-in gain on those assets of $50,000. X's $20,000 net operating loss carryforward may not be used as a deduction against its $50,000 net recognized built-in gain on the assets X acquired from Y. Therefore, X has a section 1374 tax of $17,500 ($50,000 × .35 = $17,500, assuming a 35 percent tax rate) for its 1996 taxable year.

# Example 2. Allocation of taxable income limitation.
(i) Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. The assets Y holds when it becomes an S corporation have a net unrealized built-in gain of $5,000. Y has no loss carryforwards, credits, or credit carryforwards. On January 1, 1997, Z (an unrelated C corporation) merges into Y in a transaction to which section 368(a)(1)(A) applies. Z has no loss carryforwards, credits, or credit carryforwards. The assets Y acquired from Z are subject to tax under section 1374 and have a net unrealized built-in gain of $80,000.
(ii) In 1997, Y has a pre-limitation amount on the assets it held when it became an S corporation of $15,000, a pre-limitation amount on the assets Y acquired from Z of $15,000, and a taxable income limitation of $10,000. However, because the assets Y held on becoming an S corporation have a net unrealized built-in gain of $5,000, its net recognized built-in gain on those assets is limited to $5,000 before taking into account the taxable income limitation. Y's taxable income limitation of $10,000 is allocated between the assets Y held on becoming an S corporation and the assets Y acquired from Z for purposes of determining the net recognized built-in gain from each pool of assets. Thus, Y's net recognized built-in gain on the assets Y held on becoming an S corporation is $2,500 [$10,000 × ($5,000/$20,000) = $2,500]. Y's net recognized built-in gain on the assets Y acquired from Z is $7,500 [$10,000 × ($15,000/$20,000) = $7,500]. Therefore, Y has a section 1374 tax of $3,500 [($2,500 + $7,500) × .35 = $3,500, assuming a 35 percent tax rate] for its 1997 taxable year.
[T.D. 8579, 59 FR 66469, Dec. 27, 1994, as amended by T.D. 8869, 65 FR 3856, Jan. 25, 2000; T.D. 9170, 69 FR 76614, Dec. 22, 2004; T.D. 9236, 70 FR 75731, Dec. 21, 2005]
§ 1.1374-9
Anti-stuffing rule.
If a corporation acquires an asset before or during the recognition period with a principal purpose of avoiding the tax imposed under section 1374, the asset and any loss, deduction, loss carryforward, credit, or credit carryforward attributable to the asset is disregarded in determining the S corporation's pre-limitation amount, taxable income limitation, net unrealized built-in gain limitation, deductions against net recognized built-in gain, and credits against the section 1374 tax.
[T.D. 8579, 59 FR 66470, Dec. 27, 1994]
§ 1.1374-10
Effective date and additional rules.
(a)
In general.
Sections 1.1374-1 through 1.1374-9, other than § 1.1374-3(b) and (c)
Examples 2
through
4
, apply for taxable years ending on or after December 27, 1994, but only in cases where the S corporation's return for the taxable year is filed pursuant to an S election or a section 1374(d)(8) transaction occurring on or after December 27, 1994. Section 1.1374-3(b) and (c)
Examples 2
through
4
apply to section 1374(d)(8) transactions that occur in taxable years beginning after February 23, 2005. In addition, an S corporation may apply § 1.1374-3(b) and (c)
Examples 2
through
4
to section 1374(d)(8) transactions that occur in taxable years beginning on or before February 23, 2005, if the S corporation (and any predecessors or successors) and all affected shareholders file original or amended returns that are consistent with these provisions for taxable years of the S corporation during the recognition period of the pool of assets the net unrealized built-in gain of which would be adjusted pursuant to those provisions that are not closed as of the first date after February 23, 2005, that the S corporation files an original or amended return. For purposes of this section, affected shareholders means all shareholders who received distributive shares of S corporation items in such taxable years. However, the Commissioner may, in appropriate circumstances, permit taxpayers to apply these provisions even if all affected shareholders cannot file consistent returns. In addition, for this purpose, a predecessor of an S corporation is a corporation that transfers its assets to the S corporation in a transaction to which section 381 applies. A successor of an S corporation is a corporation to which the S corporation transfers its assets in a transaction to which section 381 applies.
(b)
Additional rules.
This paragraph (b) provides rules applicable to certain S corporations, assets, or transactions to which §§ 1.1374-1 through 1.1374-9 do not apply.
(1)
Certain transfers to partnerships.
If a corporation transfers an asset to a partnership in a transaction to which section 721(a) applies and the transfer is made in contemplation of an S election or during the recognition period, section 1374 applies on a disposition of the asset by the partnership as if the S corporation had disposed of the asset itself. This paragraph (b)(1) applies as of the effective date of section 1374, unless the recognition period with respect to the contributed asset is pursuant to an S election or a section 1374(d)(8) transaction occurring on or after December 27, 1994.
(2)
Certain inventory dispositions.
For purposes of section 1374(d)(2)(A), the inventory method used by the taxpayer for tax purposes (FIFO, LIFO, etc.) must be used to identify whether goods disposed of following conversion to S corporation status were held by the corporation at the time of conversion. Thus, for example, a corporation using the LIFO inventory method will not be subject to the built-in gain tax with respect to sales of inventory except to the extent that a LIFO layer existing prior to the beginning of the first taxable year as an S corporation is invaded after the beginning of that year. This paragraph (b)(2) applies as of the effective date of section 1374, unless the recognition period with respect to the inventory is pursuant to an S election or a section 1374(d)(8) transaction occurring on or after December 27, 1994.
(3)
Certain contributions of built-in loss assets.
If a built-in loss asset (that is, an asset with an adjusted tax basis in excess of its fair market value) is contributed to a corporation within 2 years before the earlier of the beginning of its first taxable year as an S corporation, or the filing of its S election, the loss inherent in the asset will not reduce net unrealized built-in gain, as defined in section 1374(d)(1), unless the taxpayer demonstrates a clear and substantial relationship between the contributed property and the conduct of the corporation's current or future business enterprises. This paragraph (b)(3) applies as of the effective date of section 1374, unless the recognition period with respect to the contributed asset is pursuant to an S election or a section 1374(d)(8) transaction occurring on or after December 27, 1994.
(4)
Certain installment sales
—(i)
In general.
If a taxpayer sells an asset either prior to or during the recognition period and recognizes income either during or after the recognition period from the sale under the installment method, the income will, when recognized, be taxed under section 1374 to the extent it would have been so taxed in prior taxable years if the selling corporation had made the election under section 453(d) not to report the income under the installment method. For purposes of determining the extent to which the income would have been subject to tax if the section 453(d) election had not been made, the taxable income limitation of section 1374(d)(2)(A)(ii) and the built-in gain carryover rule of section 1374(d)(2)(B) will be taken into account.
This paragraph (b)(4) applies for installment sales occurring on or after March 26, 1990, and before December 27, 1994.
(ii)
Examples.
The rules of this paragraph (b)(4) are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
In year 1 of the recognition period under section 1374, a corporation realizes a gain of $100,000 on the sale of an asset with built-in gain. The corporation is to receive full payment for the asset in year 11. Because the corporation does not make an election under section 453(d), all $100,000 of the gain from the sale is reported under the installment method in year 11. If the corporation had made an election under section 453(d) with respect to the sale, the gain would have been recognized in year 1 and, taking into account the corporation's income and gains from other sources, application of the taxable income limitation of section 1374(d)(2)(A)(ii) and the built-in gain carryover rule of section 1374(d)(2)(B) would have resulted in $40,000 of the gain being subject to tax during the recognition period under section 1374. Therefore, $40,000 of the gain recognized in year 11 is subject to tax under section 1374.

# Example 2.
In year 1 of the recognition period under section 1374, a corporation realizes a gain of $100,000 on the sale of an asset with built-in gain. The corporation is to receive full payment for the asset in year 6. Because the corporation does not make an election under section 453(d), all $100,000 of the gain from the sale is reported under the installment method in year 6. If the corporation had made an election under section 453(d) with respect to the sale, the gain would have been recognized in year 1 and, taking into account the corporation's income and gains from other sources, application of the taxable income limitation of section 1374(d)(2)(A)(ii) and the built-in gain carryover rule of section 1374(d)(2)(B) would have resulted in all of the gain being subjected to tax under section 1374 in years 1 through 5. Therefore, notwithstanding that the taxable income limitation of section 1374(d)(2)(A)(ii) might otherwise limit the taxation of the gain recognized in year 6, the entire $100,000 of gain will be subject to tax under section 1374 when it is recognized in year 6.
(c)
Termination and re-election of S corporation status
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 633(d)(8) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, as amended, any reference to an election to be an S corporation under section 1362 shall be treated as a reference to the corporation's most recent election to be an S corporation under section 1362. This paragraph (c) applies for taxable years beginning after December 22, 2004, without regard to the date of the corporation's most recent election to be an S corporation under section 1362.
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (c):

# Example.
(i) Effective January 1, 1988, X, a C corporation that is a qualified corporation under section 633(d) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, as amended, elects to be an S corporation under section 1362. Effective January 1, 1990, X revokes its S status and becomes a C corporation. On January 1, 2004, X again elects to be an S corporation under section 1362. X disposes of assets in 2006, 2007, and 2008, recognizing gain.
(ii) X is not eligible for treatment under the transition rule of section 633(d)(8) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, as amended, with respect to these assets. Accordingly, X is subject to section 1374, as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, and the 10-year recognition period begins on January 1, 2004.
(iii) To the extent the gain that X recognizes on the asset sales in 2006, 2007, and 2008 reflects built-in gain inherent in such assets in X's hands on January 1, 2004, such gain is subject to tax under section 1374 as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988.
[T.D. 8579, 59 FR 66470, Dec. 27, 1994, as amended by T.D. 9170, 69 FR 76614, Dec. 22, 2004; T.D. 9180, 70 FR 8728, Feb. 23, 2005; T.D. 9236, 70 FR 75731, Dec. 21, 2005]
§ 1.1375-1
Tax imposed when passive investment income of corporation having subchapter C earnings and profits exceed 25 percent of gross receipts.
(a)
General rule.
For taxable years beginning after 1981, section 1375(a) imposes a tax on the income of certain S corporations that have passive investment income. In the case of a taxable year beginning during 1982, an electing small business corporation may elect to have the rules under this section not apply. See the regulations under section 1362 for rules on the election. For purposes of this section, the term
S corporation
shall include an electing small business corporation under prior law. This tax shall apply to an S corporation for a taxable year if the S corporation has—
(1) Subchapter C earnings and profits at the close of such taxable year, and
(2) Gross receipts more than 25 percent of which are passive investment income
If the S corporation has no subchapter C earnings and profits at the close of the taxable year (because, for example, such earnings and profits were distributed in accordance with section 1368), the tax shall not be imposed even though the S corporation has passive investment income for the taxable year. If the tax is imposed, the tax shall be computed by multiplying the excess net passive income (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) by the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b).
(b)
Definitions
—(1)
Excess net passive income
—(i)
In general.
The term
excess net passive income
is defined in section 1375(b)(1), and can be expressed by the following formula:
EC14NO91.101
Where:
ENPI = excess net passive income
NPI = net passive income
PII = passive investment income
GR = total gross receipts
(ii)
Limitation.
The amount of the excess net passive income for any taxable year shall not exceed the corporation's taxable income for the taxable year (determined in accordance with section 1374(d) and § 1.1374-1(d)).
(2)
Net passive income.
The term
net passive income
means—
(i) Passive investment income, reduced by
(ii) The deductions allowable under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 which are directly connected (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3) of this section) with the production of such income (other than deductions allowable under section 172 and part VIII of subchapter B).
(3)
Directly connected
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section to be directly connected with the production of income, an item of deduction must have proximate and primary relationship to the income. Expenses, depreciation, and similar items attributable solely to such income qualify for deduction.
(ii)
Allocation of deduction.
If an item of deduction is attributable (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section) inpart to passive investment income and in part to income other than passive investment income, the deduction shall be allocated between the two types of items on a reasonable basis. The portion of any deduction so allocated to passive investment income shall be treated as proximately and primarily related to such income.
(4)
Other definitions.
The terms
subchapter C earnings and profits, passive investment income,
and
gross receipts
shall have the same meaning given these terms in section 1362(d)(3) and the regulations thereunder.
(c)
Special rules
—(1)
Disallowance of credits.
No credit is allowed under part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code (other than section 34) against the tax imposed by section 1375(a) and this section.
(2)
Coordination with section 1374.
If any gain—
(i) Is taken into account in determining passive income for purposes of this section, and
(ii) Is taken into account under section 1374,
the amount of such gain taken into account under section 1374(b) and § 1.1374-1(b) (1) and (2) in determining the amount of tax shall be reduced by the portion of the excess net passive income for the taxable year which is attributable (on a pro rata basis) to such gain. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the portion of excess net passive income for the taxable year which is attributable to such capital gain is equal to the amount determined by multiplying the excess net passive income by the following fraction:
EC14NO91.102
Where:
NCG = net capital gain
NPI = net passive income.
E = Expense attributable to net capital gain.
(d)
Waiver of tax in certain cases
—(1)
In general.
If an S corporation establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that—
(i) It determined in good faith that it had no subchapter C earnings and profits at the close of the taxable year, and
(ii) During a reasonable period of time after it was determined that it did have subchapter C earnings and profits at the close of such taxable year such earnings and profits were distributed,
the Commissioner may waive the tax imposed by section 1375 for such taxable year. The S corporation has the burden of establishing that under the relevant facts and circumsances the Commissioner should waive the tax.
For example, if an S corporation establishes that in good faith and using due diligence it determined that it had no subchapter C earnings and profits at the close of a taxable year, but it was later determined on audit that it did have subchapter C earnings and profits at the close of such taxable year, and if the corporation establishes that it distributed such earnings and profits within a reasonable time after the audit, it may be appropriate for the Commissioner to waive the tax on passive income for such taxable year.
(2)
Corporation's request for a waiver.
A request for waiver of the tax imposed by section 1375 shall be made in writing to the district director and shall contain all relevant facts to establish that the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section are met. Such request shall contain a description of how and on what date the S corporation in good faith and using due diligence determined that it had no subchapter C earnings and profits at the close of the taxable year, a description of how and on what date it was determined that the S corporation had subchapter C earnings and profits at the close of the year and a description (including dates) of any steps taken to distribute such earnings and profits. If the earnings and profits have not yet been distributed, the request shall contain a timetable for distribution and an explanation of why such timetable is reasonable. On the date the waiver is to become effective, all subchapter C earnings and profits must have been distributed.
(e)
Reduction in pass-thru for tax imposed on excess net passive income.
See section 1366(f)(3) for a special rule reducing each item of the corporation's passive investment income for purposes of section 1366(a) if a tax is imposed on the corporation under section 1375.
(f)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this section:

# Example 1.
Assume Corporation M, an S corporation, has for its taxable year total gross receipts of $200,000, passive investment income of $100,000, $60,000 of which is interest income, and expenses directly connected with the production of such interest income in the amount of $10,000. Assume also that at the end of the taxable year Corporation M has subchapter C earnings and profits. Since more than 25 percent of the Corporation M's total gross receipts are passive investment income, and since Corporation M has subchapter C earnings and profits at the end of the taxable year, Corporation M will be subject to the tax imposed by section 1375. The amount of excess net passive investment income is $45,000 ($90,000 × (50,000 / 100,000)). Assume that the other $40,000 of passive investment income is attributable to net capital gain and that there are no expenses directly connected with such gain. Under these facts, $20,000 of the excess net passive income is attributable to the net capital gain ($45,000 × ($40,000 / $90,000)). Accordingly, the amount of gain taken into account under section 1374(b)(1) and the taxable income of Corporation M under section 1374(b)(2) shall be reduced by $20,000.

# Example 2.
Assume an S corporation with subchapter C earnings and profits has tax-exempt income of $400, its only passive income, gross receipts of $1,000 and taxable income of $250 and there are no expenses associated with the tax-exempt income. The corporation's excess net income for the taxable year would total $150 (400 × ((400 − 250 / 400)). This amount is subject to the tax imposed by section 1375, notwithstanding that such amount is otherwise tax-exempt income.

§ 1.1377-1
Pro rata share.
(a)
Computation of pro rata shares
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of subchapter S of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code and this section, each shareholder's pro rata share of any S corporation item described in section 1366(a) for any taxable year is the sum of the amounts determined with respect to the shareholder by assigning an equal portion of the item to each day of the S corporation's taxable year, and then dividing that portion pro rata among the shares outstanding on that day. See paragraph (b) of this section for rules pertaining to the computation of each shareholder's pro rata share when an election is made under section 1377(a)(2) to treat the taxable year of an S corporation as if it consisted of two taxable years in the case of a termination of a shareholder's entire interest in the corporation. See § 1.460-4(k)(3)(iv)(D) for rules relating to the computation of the shareholders' pro rata share of S corporation's income or loss from a contract accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting.
(2)
Special rules
—(i)
Days on which stock has not been issued.
Solely for purposes of determining a shareholder's pro rata share of an item for a taxable year under section 1377(a) and this section, the beneficial owners of the corporation are treated as the shareholders of the corporation for any day on which the corporation has not issued any stock.
(ii)
Determining shareholder for day of stock disposition.
A shareholder who disposes of stock in an S corporation is treated as the shareholder for the day of the disposition. A shareholder who dies is treated as the shareholder for the day of the shareholder's death.
(iii) Shareholder trust conversions. If, during the taxable year of an S corporation, a trust that is an eligible shareholder of the S corporation converts from a trust described in section 1361(c)(2)(A)(i), (ii), (iii), or (v) for the first part of the year to a trust described in a different subpart of section 1361(c)(2)(A)(i), (ii), or (v) for the remainder of the year, the trust's share of the S corporation items is allocated between the two types of trusts. The first day that a qualified subchapter S trust (QSST) or an electing small business trust (ESBT) is treated as an S corporation shareholder is the effective date of the QSST or ESBT election. Upon the conversion, the trust is not treated as terminating its entire interest in the S corporation for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, unless the trust was a trust described in section 1361(c)(2)(A)(ii) or (iii) before the conversion.
(b)
Election to terminate year
—(1)
In general.
If a shareholder's entire interest in an S corporation is terminated during the S corporation's taxable year and the corporation and all affected shareholders agree, the S corporation may elect under section 1377(a)(2) and this paragraph (b) (terminating election) to apply paragraph (a) of this section to the affected shareholders as if the corporation's taxable year consisted of two separate taxable years, the first of which ends at the close of the day on which the shareholder's entire interest in the S corporation is terminated. If the event resulting in
the termination of the shareholder's entire interest also constitutes a qualifying disposition as described in § 1.1368-1(g)(2)(i), the election under § 1.1368-1(g)(2) cannot be made. An S corporation may not make a terminating election if the cessation of a shareholder's interest occurs in a transaction that results in a termination under section 1362(d)(2) of the corporation's election to be an S corporation. (See section 1362(e)(3) for an election to have items assigned to each short taxable year under normal tax accounting rules in the case of a termination of a corporation's election to be an S corporation.) A terminating election is irrevocable and is effective only for the terminating event for which it is made.
(2)
Affected shareholders.
For purposes of the terminating election under section 1377(a)(2) and paragraph (b) of this section, the term
affected shareholders
means the shareholder whose interest is terminated and all shareholders to whom such shareholder has transferred shares during the taxable year. If such shareholder has transferred shares to the corporation, the term
affected shareholders
includes all persons who are shareholders during the taxable year.
(3)
Effect of the terminating election
—(i)
In general.
An S corporation that makes a terminating election for a taxable year must treat the taxable year as separate taxable years for all affected shareholders for purposes of allocating items of income (including tax-exempt income), loss, deduction, and credit; making adjustments to the accumulated adjustments account, earnings and profits, and basis; and determining the tax effect of a distribution. An S corporation that makes a terminating election must assign items of income (including tax-exempt income), loss, deduction, and credit to each deemed separate taxable year using its normal method of accounting as determined under section 446(a).
(ii)
Section 163(j).
If a terminating election is made to treat the S corporation's taxable year as consisting of separate taxable years, for purposes of section 163(j), a separate limitation (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(36)) will apply to each separate taxable year. Any items necessary to determine the amount of business interest expense (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(3)) that are deducted in each separate taxable year must be allocated between the separate taxable years in accordance with an allocation methodology provided in this section.
(iii)
Due date of S corporation return.
A terminating election does not affect the due date of the S corporation's return required to be filed under section 6037(a) for a taxable year (determined without regard to a terminating election).
(iv)
Taxable year of inclusion by shareholder.
A terminating election does not affect the taxable year in which an affected shareholder must take into account the affected shareholder's pro rata share of the S corporation's items of income, loss, deduction, and credit.
(v)
S corporation that is a partner in a partnership.
A terminating election by an S corporation that is a partner in a partnership is treated as a sale or exchange of the corporation's entire interest in the partnership for purposes of section 706(c) (relating to closing the partnership taxable year), if the taxable year of the partnership ends after the shareholder's interest is terminated and within the taxable year of the S corporation (determined without regard to any terminating election) for which the terminating election is made.
(4)
Determination of whether an S shareholder's entire interest has terminated.
For purposes of the terminating election under section 1377(a)(2) and paragraph (b) of this section, a shareholder's entire interest in an S corporation is terminated on the occurrence of any event through which a shareholder's entire stock ownership in the S corporation ceases, including a sale, exchange, or other disposition of all of the stock held by the shareholder; a gift under section 102(a) of all the shareholder's stock; a spousal transfer under section 1041(a) of all the shareholder's stock; a redemption, as defined in section 317(b), of all the shareholder's stock, regardless of the tax treatment of the redemption under section 302; and the death of the shareholder. A shareholder's entire interest in an S corporation is not terminated if the shareholder retains ownership of
any stock (including an interest treated as stock under § 1.1361-1(l)) that would result in the shareholder continuing to be considered a shareholder of the corporation for purposes of section 1362(a)(2). Thus, in determining whether a shareholder's entire interest in an S corporation has been terminated, any interest held by the shareholder as a creditor, employee, director, or in any other non-shareholder capacity is disregarded.
(5)
Time and manner of making a terminating election
—(i)
In general.
An S corporation makes a terminating election by attaching a statement to its timely filed original or amended return required to be filed under section 6037(a) (that is, a Form 1120S) for the taxable year during which a shareholder's entire interest is terminated. A single election statement may be filed by the S corporation for all terminating elections for the taxable year. The election statement must include—
(A) A declaration by the S corporation that it is electing under section 1377(a)(2) and this paragraph (b) to treat the taxable year as if it consisted of two separate taxable years;
(B) Information setting forth when and how the shareholder's entire interest was terminated (for example, a sale or gift);
(C) The signature on behalf of the S corporation of an authorized officer of the corporation under penalties of perjury, except that for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002, the election statement described in § 1.1377-1(b)(5)(i) of this section shall be verified, and the requirement of this paragraph (b)(5)(i)(C) is satisfied, by the signature on the Form 1120S filed by the S corporation.
(D) A statement by the corporation that the corporation and each affected shareholder consent to the S corporation making the terminating election.
(ii)
Affected shareholders required to consent.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(5)(i)(D) of this section, a shareholder of the S corporation for the taxable year is a shareholder as described in section 1362(a)(2). For example, the person who under § 1.1362-6(b)(2) must consent to a corporation's S election in certain special cases is the person who must consent to the terminating election. In addition, an executor or administrator of the estate of a deceased affected shareholder may consent to the terminating election on behalf of the deceased affected shareholder.
(iii)
More than one terminating election.
A shareholder whose entire interest in an S corporation is terminated in an event for which a terminating election was made is not required to consent to a terminating election made with respect to a subsequent termination within the same taxable year unless the shareholder is an affected shareholder with respect to the subsequent termination.
(c)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section:

# Example 1. Shareholder's pro rata share in the case of a partial disposition of stock.
(i) On January 6, 1997, X incorporates as a calendar year corporation, issues 100 shares of common stock to each of A and B, and files an election to be an S corporation for its 1997 taxable year. On July 24, 1997, B sells 50 shares of X stock to C. Thus, in 1997, A owned 50 percent of the outstanding shares of X on each day of X's 1997 taxable year, B owned 50 percent on each day from January 6, 1997, to July 24, 1997 (200 days), and 25 percent from July 25, 1997, to December 31, 1997 (160 days), and C owned 25 percent from July 25, 1997, to December 31, 1997 (160 days).
(ii) Because B's entire interest in X is not terminated when B sells 50 shares to C on July 24, 1997, X cannot make a terminating election under section 1377(a)(2) and paragraph (b) of this section for B's sale of 50 shares to C. Although B's sale of 50 shares to C is a qualifying disposition under § 1.1368-1(g)(2)(i), X does not make an election to terminate its taxable year under § 1.1368-1(g)(2). During its 1997 taxable year, X has nonseparately computed income of $720,000.
(iii) For each day in X's 1997 taxable year, A's daily pro rata share of X's nonseparately computed income is $1,000 ($720,000/360 days × 50%). Thus, A's pro rata share of X's nonseparately computed income for 1997 is $360,000 ($1,000 × 360 days). B's daily pro rata share of X's nonseparately computed income is $1,000 ($720,000/360 × 50%) for the first 200 days of X's 1997 taxable year, and $500 ($720,000/360 × 25%) for the following 160 days in 1997. Thus, B's pro rata share of X's nonseparately computed income for 1997 is $280,000 (($1,000 × 200 days) + ($500 × 160 days)). C's daily pro rata share of X's nonseparately computed income is $500 ($720,000/360 × 25%) for 160 days in 1997. Thus, C's pro rata share of X's nonseparately computed income for 1997 is $80,000 ($500 × 160 days).

# Example 2. Shareholder's pro rata share when an S corporation makes a terminating election under section 1377(a)(2).
(i) On January 6, 1997, X incorporates as a calendar year corporation, issues 100 shares of common stock to each of A and B, and files an election to be an S corporation for its 1997 taxable year. On July 24, 1997, B sells B's entire 100 shares of X stock to C. With the consent of B and C, X makes an election under section 1377(a)(2) and paragraph (b) of this section for the termination of B's entire interest arising from B's sale of 100 shares to C. As a result of the election, the pro rata shares of B and C are determined as if X's taxable year consisted of two separate taxable years, the first of which ends on July 24, 1997, the date B's entire interest in X terminates. Because A is not an affected shareholder as defined by section 1377(a)(2)(B) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the treatment as separate taxable years does not apply to A.
(ii) During its 1997 taxable year, X has nonseparately computed income of $720,000. Under X's normal method of accounting, $200,000 of the $720,000 of nonseparately computed income is allocable to the period of January 6, 1997, through July 24, 1997 (the first deemed taxable year), and the remaining $520,000 is allocable to the period of July 25, 1997, through December 31, 1997 (the second deemed taxable year).
(iii) B's pro rata share of the $200,000 of nonseparately computed income for the first deemed taxable year is determined by assigning the $200,000 of nonseparately computed income to each day of the first deemed taxable year ($200,000/200 days = $1,000 per day). Because B held 50% of X's authorized and issued shares on each day of the first deemed taxable year, B's daily pro rata share for each day of the first deemed taxable year is $500 ($1,000 per day × 50%). Thus, B's pro rata share of the $200,000 of nonseparately computed income for the first deemed taxable year is $100,000 ($500 per day × 200 days). B must report this amount for B's taxable year with or within which X's full taxable year ends (December 31, 1997).
(iv) C's pro rata share of the $520,000 of nonseparately computed income for the second deemed taxable year is determined by assigning the $520,000 of nonseparately computed income to each day of the second deemed taxable year ($520,000/160 days = $3,250 per day). Because C held 50% of X's authorized and issued shares on each day of the second deemed taxable year, C's daily pro rata shares for each day of the second deemed taxable year is $1,625 ($3,250 per day × 50%). Therefore, C's pro rata share of the $520,000 of nonseparately computed income is $260,000 ($1,625 per day × 160 days). C must report this amount for C's taxable year with or within which X's full taxable year ends (December 31, 1997).

# Example 3. Effect of conversion of a qualified subchapter S trust (QSST) to an electing small business trust (ESBT).
(i) On January 1, 2003, Trust receives stock of S corporation. Trust's current income beneficiary makes a timely QSST election under section 1361(d)(2), effective January 1, 2003. Subsequently, the trustee and current income beneficiary of Trust elect, pursuant to § 1.1361-1(j)(12), to terminate the QSST election and convert to an ESBT, effective July 1, 2004. The taxable year of S corporation is the calendar year. In 2004, Trust's pro rata share of S corporation's nonseparately computed income is $100,000.
(ii) For purposes of computing the income allocable to the QSST and to the ESBT, Trust is treated as a QSST through June 30, 2004, and Trust is treated as an ESBT beginning July 1, 2004. Pursuant to section 1377(a)(1), the pro rata share of S corporation income allocated to the QSST is $49,727 ($100,000 × 182 days/366 days), and the pro rata share of S corporation income allocated to the ESBT is $50,273 ($100,000 × 184 days/366 days).

§ 1.1377-2
Post-termination transition period.
(a)
In general.
For purposes of subchapter S of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) and this section, the term

However, if an S corporation acquires the assets of another S corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a)(2) applies, a post-termination transition period does not arise. (See § 1.1368-2(d)(2) for the treatment of the acquisition of the assets of an S corporation by another S corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a)(2) applies.)

[T.D. 9914, 85 FR 66484, Oct. 20, 2020]
§ 1.1378-1
Taxable year of S corporation.
(a)
In general.
The taxable year of an S corporation must be a permitted year. A permitted year is the required taxable year (
i.e.,
a taxable year ending on December 31), a taxable year elected under section 444, a 52-53-week taxable year ending with reference to the required taxable year or a taxable year elected under section 444, or any other taxable year for which the corporation establishes a business purpose to the satisfaction of the Commissioner under section 442.

Adoption of taxable year.
An electing S corporation may adopt, in accordance with § 1.441-1(c), its required taxable year, a taxable year elected under section 444, or a 52-53-week taxable year ending with reference to its required taxable year or a taxable year elected under section 444 without the approval of the Commissioner. See § 1.441-1. An electing S corporation that wants to adopt any other taxable year, must establish a business purpose and obtain the approval of the Commissioner under section 442.
(c)
Change in taxable year
—(1)
Approval required.
An S corporation or electing S corporation that wants to change its taxable year must obtain the approval of the Commissioner under section 442 or make an election under section 444. However, an S corporation or electing S corporation may obtain automatic approval for certain changes, including a change to its required taxable year, pursuant to administrative procedures published by the Commissioner.
(2)
Short period tax return.
An S corporation or electing S corporation that changes its taxable year must make its return for a short period in accordance with section 443, but must not annualize the corporation's taxable income.
(d)
Retention of taxable year.
In certain cases, an S corporation or electing S corporation will be required to change its taxable year unless it obtains the approval of the Commissioner under section 442, or makes an election under section 444, to retain its current taxable year. For example, a corporation using a June 30 fiscal year that elects to be an S corporation and, as a result, is required to use the calendar year must obtain the approval of the Commissioner to retain its current fiscal year.
(e)
Procedures for obtaining approval or making a section 444 election
—(1)
In general.
See § 1.442-1(b) for procedures to obtain the approval of the Commissioner (automatically or otherwise) to adopt, change, or retain a taxable year. See §§ 1.444-1T and 1.444-2T for qualifications, and 1.444-3T for procedures, for making an election under section 444.
(2)
Special rules for electing S corporations.
An electing S corporation that wants to adopt, change to, or retain a taxable year other than its required taxable year must request approval of the Commissioner on Form 2553, “Election by a Small Business Corporation,” when the election to be an S corporation is filed pursuant to section 1362(b) and § 1.1362-6. See § 1.1362-6(a)(2)(i) for the manner of making an election to be an S corporation. If such corporation receives permission to adopt, change to, or retain a taxable year other than its required taxable year, the election to be an S corporation will be effective. Denial of the request renders the election ineffective unless the corporation agrees that, in the event the request to adopt, change to, or retain a taxable year other than its required taxable year is denied, it will adopt, change to, or retain its required taxable year or, if applicable, make an election under section 444.
(f)
Effective date.
The rules of this section are applicable for taxable years ending on or after May 17, 2002.

# Section 1374 Before the Tax Reform Act of 1986
§ 1.1374-1A
Tax imposed on certain capital gains.
(a)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if for a taxable year beginning after 1982 of an S corporation—
(1) The net capital gain of such corporation exceeds $25,000, and
(2) The net capital gain of such corporation exceeds 50 percent of its taxable income (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) for such year, and
(3) The taxable income of such corporation (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) for such year exceeds $25,000,
section 1374 imposes a tax (computed under paragraph (b) of this section) on the income of such corporation. The tax is imposed on the S corporation and not on the shareholders.
(b)
Amount of tax.
The amount of tax shall be the lower of—
(1) An amount equal to the tax, determined as provided in section 1201(a)(2), on the amount by which the net capital gain of the corporation for the taxable year exceeds $25,000, or
(2) An amount equal to the tax which would be imposed by section 11 on the taxable income of the corporation (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) for the taxable year were it not an S corporation.
No credit shall be allowable under part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (other than under section 34) against the tax imposed by section 1374(a) and this section. See section 1375(c)(2) and § 1.1375-1(c)(2) for a special rule that reduces the amount of the net capital gain of the corporation for purposes of this paragraph (b) in cases where a net capital gain is taxed as excess net passive income under section 1375. See section 1374(c)(3) and paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section for a special rule that limits the amount of tax on property with a substituted basis in certain cases.
(c)
Exceptions to taxation
—(1)
New corporations and corporations with election in effect for 3 immediately preceding years
—(i)
In general.
If an S corporation would be subject to the tax imposed by section 1374 for a taxable year pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the corporation shall, nevertheless, not be subject to such tax for such year, if:
(A) The election under section 1362(a) which is in effect with respect to such corporation for such year has been in effect for the corporation's three immediately preceding taxable years, or
(B) An election under section 1362(a) has been in effect with respect to such corporation for each of its taxable years for which it has been in existence, unless there is a net capital gain for the taxable year which is attributable to property with a substituted basis within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Amount of tax on net capital gain attributable to property with a substituted basis.
If for a taxable year of an S corporation either paragraph (c)(1)(i) (A) or (B) of this section is satisfied, but the S corporation has a net capital gain for such taxable year which is attributable to property with a substituted basis (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section), then paragraph (a) of this section shall apply for the taxable year, but the amount of tax determined under paragraph (b) of this section shall not exceed a tax, determined as provided in section 1201 (a), on the net capital gain attributable to property with a substituted basis.
(iii)
Property with substituted basis.
For purposes of this section, the term
property with a substituted basis
means:
(A) Property acquired by a corporation (
the acquiring corporation
) during the period beginning 36 months before the first day of the acquiring corporation's taxable year and ending on the last day of such year;
(B) The basis of such property in the hands of the acquiring corporation is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of any property in the hands of another corporation; and
(C) Such other corporation was not an S corporation throughout the period beginning the later of:
(
1
) 36 months before the first day of the acquiring corporation's taxable year, or
(
2
) The time such other corporation came into existence,
and ending on the date such other corporation transferred the property, the basis of which is used to determine, in whole or in part, the basis of the property in the hands of the acquiring corporation. An S corporation and any predecessor corporation shall not be treated as one corporation for purposes of this paragraph (c) (1).
(iv)
Existence of a corporation.
For purposes of this section, a corporation shall not be considered to be in existence for any month which precedes the first month in which such corporation has shareholders or acquires assets or begins business, whichever is first to occur.
(v)
References to prior law included.
For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term
S corporation
shall include an electing small business corporation under prior subchapter S law, and the term
election under section 1362 (a)
shall include an election under section 1372 of prior subchapter S law.
(iv)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
M Corporation was organized and began business in 1977. M subsequently made an election under section 1362 (a) which was effective for its 1984 taxable year. If such election does not terminate under section 1362 for its taxable years 1984, 1985, and 1986, M is not subject to the tax imposed by section 1374 for its taxable year 1987, or for any subsequent year for which such election remains in effect, unless it has, for any such year, an excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss attributable to property with a substituted basis. If there is such an excess for any such year, and the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are met, M will be subject to the tax for such year. If there is no such excess for any year after 1986, M will not be subject to the tax for any such year even though the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are met.

# Example 2.
N corporation was organized in 1983, and was an S corporation for its first taxable year, N is not subject to the tax imposed by section 1374 for 1983, or for any subsequent year for which its orginal election under section 1362 (a) has not terminated under section 1362(d), unless, for any such year, it has an excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss attributable to property with a substituted basis and the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are met.
(2)
Treatment of certain gains of options and commodities dealers
—(i)
Exclusion of certain capital gains.
For purposes of this section, the net capital gain of any options dealer or commodities dealer shall be determined by not taking into account any gain or loss (in the normal course of the taxpayer's activity of dealing in or trading section 1256 contracts) from any section 1256 contract or property related to such a contract.
(ii)
Definitions.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)—
(A)
Options dealer.
The term
options dealer
has the meaning given to such term by section 1256(g)(8).
(B)
Commodities dealer.
The term
commodities dealer
means a person who is actively engaged in trading section 1256 contracts and is registered with a domestic board of trade which is designated as a contract market by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission.
(C)
Section 1256 contracts.
The term
section 1256 contracts
has the meaning given to such term by section 1256(b).
(iii)
Effective dates
—(A)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(2)(iii), this paragraph (c)(2) shall apply to positions established after July 18, 1984, in taxable years ending after such date.
(B)
Special rule for options on regulated futures contracts.
In the case of any option with respect to a regulated futures contract (within the meaning of section 1256), this paragraph (c)(2) shall apply to positions established after October 31, 1983, in taxable years ending after such date.
(C)
Elections with respect to property held on or before July 18, 1984.
See §§ 1.1256 (h)-1T and 1.1256(h)-2T for rules concerning an election to have this paragraph (c)(2) apply to certain property held on or before July 18, 1984.
(d)
Determination of taxable income
—(1)
General rule.
For purposes of this section, taxable income of the corporation shall be determined under section 63(a) as if the corporation were a C corporation rather than an S corporation, except that the following deductions shall not apply in the computation—
(i) The deduction allowed by section 172 (relating to net operating loss deduction), and
(ii) The deductions allowed by part VIII of subchapter B (other than the deduction allowed by section 248, relating to organization expenditures).
For any taxable year in which a tax under this section is imposed on an S corporation, the S corporation shall attach a Form 1120 completed in accordance with this paragraph (d) and the
instructions to Form 1120S to its tax return filed for such taxable year.
(2)
Special rule for net capital gains taxed as excess net passive income under section 1375.
See section 1375 (c) (2) and § 1.1375-1(c)(2) for a special rule that reduces the taxable income of the corporation for purposes of section 1374(b)(2) and § 1.1374-1(b)(2) in cases where a net capital gain is taxed as excess net passive income under section 1375.
(e)
Reduction in pass-thru for tax imposed on capital gain.
See section 1366(f)(2) for a special rule reducing the S corporation's long-term capital gains and the corporation's gain from sales or exchanges of property described in section 1231 for purposes of section 1366(a) by an amount of tax imposed under section 1374 and this section.
(f)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this section and assume that a tax will not be imposed under section 1375:

# Example 1.
Corporation M is an S corporation for its taxable year beginning January 1, 1983. For 1983, M has an excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss in the amount of $30,000. However, its taxable income for the year is only $20,000 as a result of other deductions in excess of other income. Thus, although the excess of the net long-term capital gain over the net short-term capital loss exceeds $25,000 and also exceeds 50 percent of taxable income, M is not subject to the tax imposed by section 1374 for 1983 because its taxable income does not exceed $25,000.

# Example 2.
Corporation N is an S Corporation for its 1983 taxable year. For 1983, N has an excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss in the amount of $30,000, and taxable income of $65,000. Thus, although N's net capital gain ($30,000) exceeds $25,000, it does not exceed 50 percent of the corporation's taxable income for the year (50 percent of $65,000, or $32,500), and therefore N is not subject to the tax imposed by section 1374 for such year.

# Example 3.
Assume that Corporation O, an S corporation, is subject to the tax imposed by section 1374 for its taxable year 1983. For 1983, O has an excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss in the amount of $73,000, and taxable income within the meaning of section 1374, which includes capital gains and losses, of $100,000. The amount of tax computed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is 28 percent of $48.00 ($73,000—$25,000), or $13,440. Since this is lower than the amount computed under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, which is $25,750 ($3,750 + $4,500 + $7,500 + $10,000), $13,440 is the amount of tax imposed by section 1374.

# Example 4.
Assume that in example (3) the taxable income of O for 1983 is $35,000. This results from an excess of deductions over income with respect to items which were not included in determining the excess of the net long-term capital gain over the net short-term capital loss. In such case, the amount of tax, computed under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, is $5,550. Since this is lower than the amount computed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, $5,550 is the amount of tax imposed by section 1374.

# Example 5.
Corporation P, an S corporation, for its taxable year 1983 has an excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss in the amount of $65,000 and has taxable income of $80,000. P's election under section 1362 has been in effect for its three immediately preceding taxable years, but P, nevertheless, is subject to the tax imposed by section 1374 for 1983 since it has an excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss (in the amount of $20,000) attributable to property with a substituted basis. The tax computed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, $11,200 (28 percent of $40,000 ($65,000−$25,000)), is less than the tax computed under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, $17,750. However, under the limitation provided in paragraph (c) of this section which is applicable in this factual situation, the tax imposed by section 1374 for 1983 may not exceed $5,600 (28 percent of $20,000, the excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss attributable to property with a substituted basis).

# Cooperatives and Their Patrons

# Tax Treatment of Cooperatives
§ 1.1381-1
Organizations to which part applies.
(a)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, part I, subchapter T, chapter 1 of the Code, applies to any corporation operating on a cooperative basis and allocating amounts to patrons on the basis of the business done with or for such patrons.
(b)
Exceptions.
Part I of such subchapter T does not apply to:
(1) Any organization which is exempt from income taxes under chapter 1 of
the Code (other than an exempt farmers' cooperative described in section 521);
(2) Any organization which is subject to the provisions of part II (section 591 and following), subchapter H, chapter 1 of the Code (relating to mutual savings banks, etc.);
(3) Any organization which is subject to the provisions of subchapter L (section 801 and following), chapter 1 of the Code (relating to insurance companies); or
(4) Any organization which is engaged in generating, transmitting, or otherwise furnishing electric energy, or which provides telephone service, to persons in rural areas. The terms
rural areas
and
telephone service
shall have the meaning assigned to them in section 5 of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended (7 U.S.C. 924).
[T.D. 6643, 28 FR 3153, Apr. 2, 1963]
§ 1.1381-2
Tax on certain farmers' cooperatives.
(a)
In general.
(1) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962, farmers', fruit growers', or like associations, organized and operated in compliance with the requirements of section 521 and § 1.521-1, shall be subject to the taxes imposed by section 11 or section 1201. Although such associations are subject to both normal tax and surtax, as in the case of corporations generally, certain special deductions are provided for them in section 1382(c) and § 1.1382-3. For the purpose of any law which refers to organizations exempt from income taxes such an association shall, however, be considered as an organization exempt under section 501. Thus, the provisions of section 243, providing a credit for dividends received from a domestic corporation subject to taxation, are not applicable to dividends received from a cooperative association organized and operated in compliance with the requirements of section 521 and § 1.521-1. The provisions of section 1501, relating to consolidated returns, are likewise not applicable.
(2) Rules governing the manner in which amounts paid as patronage dividends are allowable as deductions in computing the taxable income of such an association are set forth in section 1382(b) and § 1.1382-2. For the tax treatment, as to patrons, of amounts received during the taxable year as patronage dividends, see section 1385 and the regulations thereunder.
(b)
Cross references.
For tax treatment of exempt cooperative associations for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1963, or for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962, with respect to payments attributable to patronage occurring during taxable years beginning before January 1, 1963, see section 522 and the regulations thereunder. For requirements of annual returns by such associations, see sections 6012 and 6072(d) and paragraph (f) of § 1.6012-2.
[T.D. 6643, 28 FR 3153, Apr. 2, 1963]
§ 1.1382-1
Taxable income of cooperatives; gross income.
(a)
Introduction.
Section 1382(b) provides that the amount of certain patronage dividends (and amounts paid in redemption of nonqualified written notices of allocation) shall not be taken into account by a cooperative organization in determining its taxable income. Such section also provides that, for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, an amount not taken into account is to be treated in the same manner as an item of gross income and as a deduction therefrom. Therefore, such an amount is treated as a deduction for purposes of applying the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder and, for simplicity, is referred to as a deduction in the regulations under such Code. However, this should not be regarded as a determination of the character of the amount for other purposes.
(b)
Computation of gross income.
Any cooperative organization to which part I, subchapter T, chapter 1 of the Code, applies shall not, for any purpose under the Code, exclude from its gross income (as a reduction in gross receipts, an increase in cost of goods sold, or otherwise) the amount of any allocation or distribution to a patron out of the net earnings of such organization with respect to patronage occurring during a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1962. See, however, section 1382(b) and § 1.1382-2 for deductions
for certain amounts paid to patrons out of net earnings.
[T.D. 6643, 28 FR 3154, Apr. 2, 1963]
§ 1.1382-2
Taxable income of cooperatives; treatment of patronage dividends.
(a)
In general.
(1) In determining the taxable income of any cooperative organization to which part I, subchapter T, chapter 1 of the Code, applies, there shall be allowed as deductions from gross income, in addition to the other deductions allowable under chapter 1 of the Code, the deductions with respect to patronage dividends provided in section 1382(b) and paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(2) For the definition of terms used in this section see section 1388 and § 1.1388-1; to determine the payment period for a taxable year, see section 1382(d) and § 1.1382-4.
(b)
Deduction for patronage dividends
—(1)
In general.
In the case of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1962, there is allowed as a deduction from the gross income of any cooperative organization to which part I of subchapter T applies, amounts paid to patrons during the payment period for the taxable year as patronage dividends with respect to patronage occurring during such taxable year, but only to the extent that such amounts are paid in money, qualified written notices of allocation, or other property (other than non qualified written notices of allocation). See section 1382 (e) and (f) and §§ 1.1382-5 and 1.1382-6 for special rules relating to the time when patronage is deemed to occur where products are marketed under a pooling arrangement or where earnings are includible in the gross income of the cooperative organization for a taxable year after the year in which the patronage occurred. For purposes of this paragraph, a written notice of allocation is considered paid when it is issued to the patron. A patronage dividend shall be treated as paid in money during the payment period for the taxable year to the extent it is paid by a qualified check which is issued during the payment period for such taxable year and endorsed and cashed on or before the ninetieth day after the close of such payment period. In determining the amount paid which is allowable as a deduction under this paragraph, property (other than written notices of allocation) shall be taken into account at its fair market value when paid, and a qualified written notice of allocation shall be taken into account at its stated dollar amount.
(2)
Special rule for certain taxable years.
No deduction is allowed under this section for amounts paid during taxable years beginning before January 1, 1963, or for amounts paid during taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962, with respect to patronage occurring during taxable years beginning before January 1, 1963. With respect to such amounts, the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (including section 522 and the regulations thereunder) shall be applicable without regard to subchapter T.
(c)
Deduction for amounts paid in redemption of certain nonqualified written notices of allocation.
In the case of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1962, there is allowed as a deduction from the gross income of a cooperative organization to which part I of subchapter T applies, amounts paid by such organization during the payment period for such taxable year in redemption of a nonqualified written notice of allocation which was previously paid as a patronage dividend during the payment period for the taxable year during which the patronage occurred, but only to the extent such amounts (1) are paid in money or other property (other than written notices of allocation) and (2) do not exceed the stated dollar amount of such written notice of allocation. No deduction shall be allowed under this paragraph, however, for amounts paid in redemption of nonqualified written notices of allocation which were paid with respect to patronage occurring during a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1963. For purposes of this paragraph, if an amount is paid within the payment period for two or more taxable years, it will be allowable as a deduction only for the earliest of such taxable years. Thus, if a cooperative which reports its income on a calendar year basis pays an amount in redemption of a nonqualified written notice of allocation on January 15, 1966, it will be allowed a deduction for such amount
only for its 1965 taxable year. In determining the amount paid which is allowable as a deduction under this paragraph, property (other than written notices of allocation) shall be taken into account at its fair market value when paid. Amounts paid in redemption of a nonqualified written notice of allocation in excess of its stated dollar amount shall be treated under the applicable provisions of the Code. For example, if such excess is in the nature of interest, its deductibility will be governed by section 163 and the regulations thereunder.
[T.D. 6643, 28 FR 3154, Apr. 2, 1963]
§ 1.1382-3
Taxable income of cooperatives; special deductions for exempt farmers' cooperatives.
(a)
In general.
(1) Section 1382(c) provides that in determining the taxable income of a farmers', fruit growers', or like association, described in section 1381(a)(1) and organized and operated in compliance with the requirements of section 521 and § 1.521-1, there shall be allowed as deductions from the gross income of such organization, in addition to the other deductions allowable under chapter 1 of the Code (including the deductions allowed by section 1382(b)) the special deductions provided in section 1382(c) and paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
(2) For the definition of terms used in this section, see section 1388 and § 1.1388-1; to determine the payment period for a taxable year, see section 1382(d) and § 1.1382-4.
(b)
Deduction for dividends paid on capital stock.
In the case of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1962, there is allowed as a deduction from the gross income of a cooperative association operated in compliance with the requirements of section 521 and § 1.521-1, amounts paid as dividends during the taxable year on the capital stock of such cooperative association. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, the term
capital stock
includes common stock (whether voting or nonvoting), preferred stock, or any other form of capital represented by capital retain certificates, revolving fund certificates, letters of advice, or other evidence of a proprietary interest in a cooperative association. Such deduction is applicable only to the taxable year in which the dividends are actually or constructively paid to the holder of capital stock or other proprietary interest in the cooperative association. If a dividend is paid by check and the check bearing a date within the taxable year is deposited in the mail, in a cover properly stamped and addressed to the shareholder at his last known address, at such time that in the ordinary handling of the mails the check would be received by such holder within the taxable year, a presumption arises that the dividend was paid to such holder in such year. The determination of whether a dividend has been paid to such holder by the corporation during its taxable year is in no way dependent upon the method of accounting regularly employed by the corporation in keeping its books. For further rules as to the determination of the right to a deduction for dividends paid, under certain specific circumstances, see section 561 and the regulations thereunder.
(c)
Deduction for amounts allocated from income not derived from patronage
—(1)
In general.
In the case of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1962, there is allowed as a deduction from the gross income of a cooperative association operated in compliance with the requirements of section 521 and § 1.521-1, amounts paid to patrons, during the payment period for the taxable year, on a patronage basis with respect to its income derived during such taxable year either from business done with or for the United States or any of its agencies or from sources other than patronage, but only to the extent such amounts are paid in money, qualified written notices of allocation, or other property (other than nonqualified written notices of allocation). For purposes of this subparagraph a written notice of allocation is considered paid when it is issued to the patron. An amount shall be treated as paid in money during the payment period for the taxable year to the extent it is paid by a qualified check which is issued during the payment period for such taxable year and endorsed and cashed on or before the ninetieth day after the close of such payment period. In determining the amount paid which is allowable as
a deduction under this paragraph, property (other than written notices of allocation) shall be taken into account at its fair market value when paid, and a qualified written notice of allocation shall be taken into account at its stated dollar amount.
(2)
Definition.
The term
income derived from sources other than patronage
used in this paragraph (c) means income from nonpatronage sources within the meaning of § 1.1388-1(f)(3).
(3)
Basis of distribution.
In order that the deduction for amounts paid with respect to income derived from business done with or for the United States or any of its agencies or from sources other than patronage may be applicable, it is necessary that the amount sought to be deducted be paid on a patronage basis in proportion, insofar as is practicable, to the amount of business done by or for patrons during the period to which such income is attributable. For example, if capital gains are realized from the sale or exchange of capital assets acquired and disposed of during the taxable year, income realized from such gains must be paid to patrons of such year in proportion to the amount of business done by such patrons during the taxable year. Similarly, if capital gains are realized by the association from the sale or exchange of capital assets held for a period extending into more than one taxable year income realized from such gains must be paid, insofar as is practicable, to the persons who were patrons during the taxable years in which the asset was owned by the association in proportion to the amount of business done by such patrons during such taxable years.
(4)
Special rules for certain taxable years.
No deduction is allowable under this paragraph for amounts paid during taxable years beginning before January 1, 1963, or for amounts paid during taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962, with respect to income derived during taxable years beginning before January 1, 1963. With respect to such amounts, the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (including section 522 and the regulations thereunder) shall be applicable without regard to subchapter T.
(d)
Deduction for amounts paid in redemption of certain nonqualified written notices of allocation.
In the case of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1962, there is allowed as a deduction from the gross income of a cooperative association operated in compliance with the requirements of section 521 and § 1.521-1, amounts paid by such association during the payment period for such taxable year in redemption of certain nonqualified written notices of allocation, but only to the extent such amounts (1) are paid in money or other property (other than written notices of allocation) and (2) do not exceed the stated dollar amount of such nonqualified written notices of allocation. The nonqualified written notices of allocation referred to in the preceding sentence are those which were previously paid to patrons on a patronage basis with respect to earnings derived either from business done with or for the United States or any of its agencies or from sources other than patronage, provided that such nonqualified written notices of allocation were paid during the payment period for the taxable year during which such earnings were derived. No deduction shall be allowed under this paragraph, however, for amounts paid in redemption of nonqualified written notices of allocation which were paid with respect to earnings derived during a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1963. For purposes of this paragraph, if an amount is paid within the payment period for two or more taxable years, it will be allowable as a deduction only for the earliest of such taxable years. In determining the amount paid which is allowable as a deduction under this paragraph, property (other than written notices of allocation) shall be taken into account at its fair market value when paid. Amounts paid in redemption of a nonqualified written notice of allocation in excess of its stated dollar amount shall be treated under the applicable provisions of the Code.
(e)
Applicability date.
Paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies to taxable years beginning after January 19, 2021. For taxable years beginning on or before January 19, 2021, taxpayers, however, may choose to apply the rules of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, provided
the taxpayers apply the rules in their entirety and in a consistent manner.

§ 1.1382-4
Taxable income of cooperatives; payment period for each taxable year.
The payment period for a taxable year is the period beginning with the first day of such taxable year and ending with the fifteenth day of the ninth month following the close of such year.
[T.D. 6643, 28 FR 3156, Nov. 26, 1963]
§ 1.1382-5
Taxable income of cooperatives; products marketed under pooling arrangements.
For purposes of section 1382(b) and § 1.1382-2, in the case of a pooling arrangement for the marketing of products the patronage under such pool shall be treated as occurring during the taxable year in which the pool closes. The determination of when a pool is closed will be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances in each case, but generally the practices and operations of the cooperative organization shall control. This section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
Farmer A delivers to the X Cooperative 100 bushels of wheat on August 15, 1963, at which time he receives a
per bushel
advance. (Both farmer A and the X Cooperative file returns on a calendar year basis.) On October 15, 1963 farmer A receives an additional
per bushel
payment. The pool sells some of its wheat in 1963 and the remainder in January of 1964. The pool is closed on February 15, 1964. For purposes of section 1382(b), A's patronage is considered as occurring in 1964.
[T.D. 6643, 28 FR 3156, Apr. 2, 1963]
§ 1.1382-6
Taxable income of cooperatives; treatment of earnings received after patronage occurred.
If earnings derived from business done with or for patrons are includible in the gross income of the cooperative organization for a taxable year after the taxable year during which the patronage occurred, then, for purposes of determining whether the cooperative is allowed a deduction under section 1382(b) and § 1.1382-2, the patronage to which these earnings relate shall be considered to have occurred during the taxable year for which such earnings are includible in the cooperative's gross income. Thus, if the cooperative organization pays these earnings out as patronage dividends during the payment period for the taxable year for which the earnings are includible in its gross income, it will be allowed a deduction for such payments under section 1382(b)(1) and paragraph (b) of § 1.1382-2, to the extent they are paid in money, qualified written notices of allocation, or other property (other than written notices of allocation).
[T.D. 6643, 28 FR 3156, Apr. 2, 1963]
§ 1.1382-7
Special rules applicable to cooperative associations exempt from tax before January 1, 1952.
(a)
Basis of property.
The adjustments to the cost or other basis provided in sections 1011 and 1016 and the regulations thereunder, are applicable for the entire period since the acquisition of the property. Thus, proper adjustment to basis must be made under section 1016 for depreciation, obsolescence, amortization, and depletion for all taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1952, although the cooperative association was exempt from tax under section 521 or corresponding provisions of prior law for such years. However, no adjustment for percentage or discovery depletion is to be made for any year during which the association was exempt from tax. If a cooperative association has made a proper election in accordance with section 1020 and the regulations prescribed thereunder with respect to a taxable year beginning before 1952 in which the association was not exempt from tax, the adjustment to basis for depreciation for such years shall be limited in accordance with the provisions of section 1016(a)(2).
(b)
Amortization of bond premium.
In the case of tax exempt and partially taxable bonds purchased at a premium and subject to amortization under section 171, proper adjustment to basis must be made to reflect amortization with respect to such premium from the date of acquisition of the bond. (For principles governing the method of computation, see the example in paragraph (b) of § 1.1016-9, relating to mutual savings banks, building and loan associations, and cooperative banks.)
The basis of a fully taxable bond purchased at a premium shall be adjusted from the date of the election to amortize such premium in accordance with the provisions of section 171 except that no adjustment shall be allowable for such portion of the premium attributable to the period prior to the election.
(c)
Amortization of mortgage premium.
In the case of a mortgage acquired at a premium where the principal of such mortgage is payable in installments, adjustments to the basis for the premium must be made for all taxable years (whether or not the association was exempt from tax under section 521 during such years) in which installment payments are received. Such adjustments may be made on an individual mortgage basis or on a composite basis by reference to the average period of payments of the mortgage loans of such association. For the purpose of this adjustment, the term
premium
includes the excess of the acquisition value of the mortgage over its maturity value. The acquisition value of the mortgage is the cost including buying commissions, attorneys' fees, or brokerage fees, but such value does not include amounts paid for accrued interest.
[T.D. 6643, 28 FR 3156, Apr. 2, 1963]
§ 1.1383-1
Computation of tax where cooperative redeems nonqualified written notices of allocation.
(a)
General rule.
(1) If, during the taxable year, a cooperative organization is entitled to a deduction under section 1382 (b)(2) or (c)(2)(B) for amounts paid in redemption of nonqualified written notices of allocation, the tax imposed for the taxable year by chapter 1 of the Code shall be the lesser of:
(i) The tax for the taxable year computed under section 1383(a)(1), that is, with such deduction taken into account, or
(ii) The tax for the taxable year computed under section 1383(a)(2), that is, without taking such deduction into account, minus the decrease in tax (under chapter 1 of the Code) for any prior taxable year (or years) which would result solely from treating all such nonqualified written notices of allocation redeemed during the taxable year as qualified written notices of allocation when paid. For the purpose of this subdivision, the amount of the decrease in tax is not limited to the amount of the tax for the taxable year. See paragraph (c) of this section for rules relating to a refund of tax where the decrease in tax for the prior taxable year (or years) exceeds the tax for the taxable year.
(2) If the cooperative organization computes its tax for the taxable year under the provisions of section 1383(a)(2) and subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, then no deduction under section 1382 (b)(2) or (c)(2)(B) shall be taken into account in computing taxable income or loss for the taxable year, including the computation of any net operating loss carryback or carryover. However, the amount of the deduction shall be taken into account in adjusting earnings and profits for the taxable year.
(3) If the tax determined under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph is the same as the tax determined under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, the tax imposed for the taxable year under chapter 1 of the Code shall be the tax determined under subparagraph (1)(l) of this paragraph, and section 1383 and this section shall not otherwise apply. The tax imposed for the taxable year shall be the tax determined under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph in any case when a credit or refund would be allowable for the taxable year under section 1383(b)(1).
(b)
Determination of decrease in tax for prior taxable years
—(1)
Prior taxable years.
The prior taxable year (or years) referred to in paragraph (a) of this section is the year (or years) within the payment period for which the nonqualified written notices of allocation were paid and, in addition, any other prior taxable year (or years) which is affected by the adjustment to income by reason of treating such nonqualified written notices of allocation as qualified written notices of allocation when paid.
(2)
Adjustment to income in prior taxable years.
The deduction for the prior taxable year (or years) in determining the decrease in tax under section 1383(a)(2)(B) and paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section shall be the amount paid
in redemption of the nonqualified written notices of allocation which, without regard to section 1383, is allowable as a deduction under section 1382 (b)(2) or (c)(2)(B) for the current taxable year.
(3)
Computation of decrease in tax for prior taxable years.
In computing the amount of decrease in tax for a prior taxable year (or years) resulting under this section, there must first be ascertained the amount of tax previously determined for the taxpayer for such prior taxable year (or years). The tax previously determined shall be the sum of the amounts shown as such tax by the taxpayer on his return or returns, plus any amounts which have been previously assessed (or collected without assessment) as deficiencies, reduced by the amount of any rebates which have previously been made. The amount shown as the tax by the taxpayer on his return and the amount of any rebates or deficiencies shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 6211 and the regulations thereunder. After the tax previously determined has been ascertained, a recomputation must then be made to determine the decrease in tax, if any, resulting under this section. In determining the decrease in tax for the prior taxable year (or years), appropriate adjustment shall be made to any item which is dependent upon the amount of gross income or taxable income (such as charitable contributions, net operating losses, the foreign tax credit, and the dividends received credit).
(c)
Refunds.
If the decrease in tax for the prior taxable year (or years) determined under section 1383(a)(2)(B) and paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section exceeds the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code for the taxable year computed without the deduction under section 1382 (b) or (c)(2)(B), the excess shall be considered to be a payment of tax for the taxable year of the deduction. Such payment is deemed to have been made on the last day prescribed by law for the payment of tax for the taxable year and shall be refunded or credited in the same manner as if it were an overpayment of tax for such taxable year. See section 6151 and the regulations thereunder, for rules relating to time and place for paying tax shown on returns.
(d)
Example.
The application of section 1383 may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
The X Cooperative (which reports its income on a calendar year basis) pays patronage dividends of $100,000 in nonqualified written notices of allocation on February 1, 1964, with respect to patronage occurring in 1963. Since the patronage dividends of $100,000 were paid in nonqualified written notices of allocation the X Cooperative is not allowed a deduction for that amount for 1963. On December 1, 1966, the X Cooperative redeems these nonqualified written notices of allocation for $50,000. Under section 1382(b)(2), a deduction of $50,000 is allowable in computing its taxable income for 1966. However, the X Cooperative has a loss for 1966 determined without regard to this deduction. The X Cooperative, therefore, makes the computation under the alternative method provided in section 1383(a)(2). Under this alternative method, it will claim a credit or refund (as an overpayment of tax for 1966) of the decrease in tax for 1963 and for such other years prior to 1966 as are affected which results from recomputing its tax for 1963 and such other years affected) as if patronage dividends of $50,000 had been paid on February 1, 1964, in qualified written notices of allocation. In addition, under this alternative method the X Cooperative cannot use the $50,000 as a deduction for 1966 so as to increase its net operating loss for such year for purposes of computing a net operating loss carryback or carryover. If the X Cooperative also redeems on December 1, 1966, nonqualified written notices of allocation which were paid as patronage dividends on February 1, 1965, with respect to patronage occurring in 1964, it will claim a credit or refund (as an overpayment of tax for 1966) of the decrease in tax for 1964 and for such other years prior to 1966 as are affected. It shall not, however, apply one method for computing the tax with respect to the redemptions in 1966 of the nonqualified written notices of allocation paid in 1964 and the other method with respect to the redemption in 1966 of the nonqualified written notices of allocation paid in 1965.
[T.D. 6643, 28 FR 3156, Apr. 2, 1963]

# Tax Treatment by Patrons of Patronage Dividends
§ 1.1385-1
Amounts includible in patron's gross income.
(a)
General rules.
Section 1385(a) requires every person to include in gross income the following amounts received by him during the taxable year, to the
extent paid by the organization in money, a qualified written notice of allocation, or other property (other than a nonqualified written notice of allocation):
(1) The amount of any patronage dividend received from an organization subject to the provisions of part I, subchapter T, chapter 1 of the Code, unless such amount is excludable from gross income under the provisions of section 1385(b) and paragraph (c) of this section, and
(2) The amount of any distribution received from a farmers', fruit growers', or like association, organized and operated in compliance with the requirements of section 521 and § 1.521-1, which is paid on a patronage basis with respect to earnings derived by such association either from business done with or for the United States or any of its agencies or from sources other than patronage.
The amounts described in subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph are includible in gross income for the taxable year in which they are received even though the cooperative organization was allowed a deduction for such amounts for its preceding taxable year because they were paid during the payment period for such preceding taxable year. Similarly, such amounts are includible in gross income even though the cooperative organization is not permitted any deduction for such amounts under the provisions of section 1382 because such amounts were not paid within the time prescribed by such section.
(b)
Treatment of certain nonqualified written notices of allocation.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, any gain on the redemption, sale, or other disposition of a nonqualified written notice of allocation described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph shall, to the extent that the stated dollar amount of such written notice of allocation exceeds its basis, be considered as gain from the sale or exchange of property which is not a capital asset, whether such gain is realized by the patron who received the nonqualified written notice of allocation initially or by any subsequent holder. Any amount realized on the redemption, sale, or other disposition of such a nonqualified written notice of allocation in excess of its stated dollar amount will be treated under the applicable provisions of the Code. For example, amounts received in redemption of a nonqualified written notice of allocation which are in excess of the stated dollar amount of such written notice of allocation and which, in effect, constitute interest shall be treated by the recipient as interest.
(2) The nonqualified written notices of allocation to which subparagraph (1) of this paragraph applies are the following:
(i) A nonqualified written notice of allocation which was paid as a patronage dividend (within the meaning of section 1388(a) and paragraph (a) of § 1.1388-1), by a cooperative organization subject to the provisions of part I of subchapter T, and
(ii) A nonqualified written notice of allocation which was paid by a farmers', fruit growers', or like association, organized and operated in compliance with the requirements of section 521 and § 1.521-1, to patrons on a patronage basis with respect to earnings derived either from business done with or for the United States or any of its agencies or from sources other than patronage.
(3) The basis of any nonqualified written notice of allocation described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, in the hands of the patron to whom such written notice of allocation was initially paid shall be zero, and the basis of such a written notice of allocation which was acquired from a decedent shall be its basis in the hands of the decedent.
(4) The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
A, a farmer, receives a patronage dividend from the X Cooperative, in the form of a nonqualified written notice of allocation, which is attributable to the sale of his crop to that cooperative organization. The stated dollar amount of the nonqualified written notice of allocation is $100. The basis of the written notice of allocation in the hands of A is zero and he must report any amount up to $100 received by him on its redemption, sale, or other disposition, as ordinary income. If A gives the written notice of allocation to his son B, B takes A's (the donor's) basis which is zero, and any gain up to $100 which B later realizes on its redemption,
sale, or other disposition is ordinary income. Similarly, if A dies before realizing any gain on the nonqualified written notice of allocation, B, his legatee, has a zero basis for such written notice of allocation and any gain up to $100 which he then realizes on its redemption, sale, or other disposition is also ordinary income. Such gain is income in respect of a decedent within the meaning of section 691(a) and § 1.691(a)-1.
(c)
Treatment of patronage dividends received with respect to certain property
—(1)
Exclusions from gross income.
Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, gross income shall not include:
(i) Any amount of a patronage dividend described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section which is received with respect to the purchase of supplies, equipment, or services, which were not used in the trade or business and the cost of which was not deductible under section 212, or which is received with respect to the marketing or purchasing of a capital asset (as defined in section 1221) or property used in the trade or business of a character which is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167; and
(ii) Any amount (to the extent treated as ordinary income under paragraph (b) of this section) received on the redemption, sale, or other disposition of a nonqualified written notice of allocation which was received as a patronage dividend with respect to the purchase of supplies, equipment, or services, which were not used in the trade or business and the cost of which was not deductible under section 212, or which was received as a patronage dividend with respect to the marketing or purchasing of a capital asset (as defined in section 1221) or property used in the trade or business of a character which is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167.
(2)
Special rules.
(i) If an amount described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph relates to the purchase of a capital asset (as defined in section 1221), or property used in the trade or business of a character which is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167, and the person receiving such amount owned such asset or property at any time during the taxable year in which such amount is received, then such amount shall be taken into account as an adjustment to the basis of such property or asset as of the first day of the taxable year in which such amount is received. To the extent that such amount exceeds the adjusted basis of such property it shall be taken into account as ordinary income.
(ii) If an amount described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph relates to the marketing or purchasing of a capital asset (as defined in section 1221), or property used in the trade or business of a character which is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167, and the person receiving such amount did not own the asset or property at any time during the taxable year in which such amount is received, then such amount shall be included in gross income as ordinary income except that:
(
a
) If such amount relates to a capital asset (as defined in section 1221) which was held by the recipient for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) and with respect to which a loss was or would have been deductible under section 165, such amount shall be taken into account as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977);
(
b
) If such amount relates to a capital asset (as defined in section 1221) with respect to which a loss was not or would not have been deductible under section 165, such amount shall not be taken into account.
(iii) If an amount described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph relates to the marketing of a capital asset (as defined in section 1221) or property used in the trade or business of a character which is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167, and such amount is received by the patron in the same taxable year during which he marketed the asset to which it relates, such amount shall be treated as an additional amount received on the sale or other disposition of such asset.
(iv) If a person receiving a patronage dividend or an amount on the redemption, sale, or other disposition of a nonqualified written notice of allocation which was received as a patronage dividend is unable to determine the item to which it relates, he shall include such patronage dividend or such amount in gross income as ordinary income in the manner and to the extent provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, whichever is applicable.
(3) The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On July 1, 1964, P, a patron of a cooperative association, purchases an implement for use in his farming business from such association for $2,900. The implement has an estimated useful life of three years and has an estimated salvage value of $200 which P chooses to take into account in the computation of depreciation. P files his income tax returns on a calendar year basis. For 1964 P claims depreciation of $450 with respect to the implement pursuant to his use of the straight-line method at the rate of $900 per year. On July 1, 1965, the cooperative association pays a patronage dividend to P of $300 in cash with respect to his purchase of the farm implement. P will adjust the basis of the implement and will compute his depreciation deduction for 1965 (and subsequent taxable years) as follows:
Cost of farm implement, July 1, 1964
$2,900
Less:
Salvage value
200
Depreciation for 1964 (6 months)
450
Adjustment as of January 1, 1965 for cash patronage dividend
300
Total
950
Basis for depreciation for the remaining 2
1/2
years of estimated life
1,950
Depreciation deduction for 1965 ($1,950 divided by the 2
1/2
years of remaining life)
700

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that on July 1, 1965, the cooperative association paid a patronage dividend to P with respect to his purchase of the implement in the form of a nonqualified written notice of allocation having a stated dollar amount of $300. Since such written notice of allocation was not qualified, no amount of the patronage dividend was taken into account by P as an adjustment to the basis of the implement, or in computing his depreciation deduction, for the year 1965. In 1968, P receives $300 cash from the association in full redemption of the written notice of allocation. Prior to 1968, he had recovered through depreciation $2,700 of the cost of the implement, leaving an adjusted basis of $200 (the salvage value). For the year 1968, the redemption proceeds of $300 are applied against the adjusted basis of $200, reducing the basis of the implement to zero, and the balance of the redemption proceeds, $100, is includable as ordinary income in P's gross income for the calendar year 1968. If the patronage dividend paid to P on July 1, 1965, had been in the form of $60 cash (20 percent of $300) and a qualified written notice of allocation with a stated dollar amount of $240, then the tax treatment of such patronage dividend would be that illustrated in example (1).

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (2), except that the nonqualified written notice of allocation is redeemed in cash on July 1, 1966. The full $300 received on redemption will reduce the adjusted basis of the implement as of January 1, 1966, and the depreciation allowances for 1966 and 1967 are computed as follows:
Cost of farm implement, July 1, 1964
$2,900
Less:
Salvage value
200
Depreciation for 1964 (6 months)
450
Depreciation for 1965
900
Adjustment as of January 1, 1966 for proceeds of the redemption
300
Total
1,850
Basis for depreciation on Jan. 1, 1966
1,050
If P uses the implement in his business until fully depreciated, he would be entitled to the following depreciation allowances with respect to such implement:
For 1966
700
For 1967
350
Total
1,050
Balance to be depreciated
0

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in example (3), except that P sells the implement in 1965. The entire $300 received in 1966 in redemption of the nonqualified written notice of allocation is includible as ordinary income in P's gross income for the year 1966.
(d)
Determination of amount received.
In determining the amount received for purposes of this section:
(1) Property (other than written notices of allocation) shall be taken into account at its fair market value when received;
(2) A qualified written notice of allocation shall be taken into account at its stated dollar amount; and
(3) The amount of a qualified check shall be considered an amount received in money during the taxable year in which such check is received if the check is endorsed and cashed on or before the ninetieth day after the close of the payment period for the taxable year of the cooperative organization in
which the patronage to which such amount relates occurred.
(e)
Effective date.
This section shall not apply to any distribution or allocation received from a cooperative organization, or to any gain or loss on the redemption, sale, or other disposition of any allocation received from such an organization, if such distribution or allocation was received with respect to patronage occurring in a taxable year of the organization beginning before January 1, 1963. See § 1.61-5 for the tax treatment by patrons of such distributions or allocations.
[T.D. 6643, 28 FR 3157, Apr. 2, 1963, as amended by T.D. 7728, 45 FR 72650, Nov. 3, 1980]

# Definitions; Special Rules
§ 1.1388-1
Definitions and special rules.
(a)
Patronage dividend
—(1)
In general.
The term
patronage dividend
means an amount paid to a patron by a cooperative organization subject to the provisions of part I, subchapter T, chapter 1 of the Code, which is paid:
(i) On the basis of quantity or value of business done with or for such patron,
(ii) Under a valid enforceable written obligation of such organization to the patron to pay such amount, which obligation existed before the cooperative organization received the amount so paid, and
(iii) Which is determined by reference to the net earnings of the cooperative organization from business done with or for its patrons.
For the purpose of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, amounts paid by a cooperative organization are paid under a valid enforceable written obligation if such payments are required by State law or are paid pursuant to provisions of the bylaws, articles of incorporation, or other written contract, whereby the organization is obligated to make such payment. The term
net earnings,
for purposes of subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, includes the excess of amounts retained (or assessed) by the organization to cover expenses or other items over the amount of such expenses or other items. For purposes of such subdivision (iii), net earnings shall not be reduced by any taxes imposed by subtitle A of the Code, but shall be reduced by dividends paid on capital stock or other proprietary capital interests.
(2)
Exceptions.
The term
patronage dividend
does not include the following:
(i) An amount paid to a patron by a cooperative organization to the extent that such amount is paid out of earnings not derived from business done with or for patrons.
(ii) An amount paid to a patron by a cooperative organization to the extent that such amount is paid out of earnings from business done with or for other patrons to whom no amounts are paid, or to whom smaller amounts are paid, with respect to substantially identical transactions. Thus, if a cooperative organization does not pay any patronage dividends to nonmembers, any portion of the amounts paid to members which is out of net earnings from patronage with nonmembers, and which would have been paid to the nonmembers if all patrons were treated alike, is not a patronage dividend.
(iii) An amount paid to a patron by a cooperative organization to the extent that such amount is paid in redemption of capital stock, or in redemption or satisfaction of certificates of indebtedness, revolving fund certificates, retain certificates, letters of advice, or other similar documents, even if such documents were originally paid as patronage dividends.
(iv) An amount paid to a patron by a cooperative organization to the extent that such amount is fixed without reference to the net earnings of the cooperative organization from business done with or for its patrons.
(3)
Examples.
The application of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) Cooperative A, a marketing association operating on a pooling basis, receives the products of patron W on January 5, 1964. On the same day cooperative A advances to W 45 cents per unit for the products so delivered and allocates to him a
retain certificate
having a face value calculated at the rate of 5 cents per unit. During the operation of the pool, and before substantially all the products in the pool are disposed of, cooperative A advances to W an additional 40 cents per unit, the amount being determined
by reference to the market price of the products sold and the anticipated price of the unsold products. At the close of the pool on November 10, 1964, cooperative A determines the excess of its receipts over the sum of its expenses and its previous advances to patrons, and allocates to W an additional 3 cents per unit and shares of the capital stock of A having an aggregate stated dollar amount calculated at the rate of 2 cents per unit. Under the provisions of section 1382(e), W's patronage is deemed to occur in 1964, the year in which the pool is closed.
(ii) The patronage dividend paid to W during 1964 amounts to 5 cents per unit, consisting of the aggregate of the following per-unit allocations: The amount of the cash distribution (3 cents), and the stated dollar amount of the capital stock of A (2 cents), which are fixed with reference to the net earnings of A. The amount of the two distributions in cash (85 cents) and the face amount of the
retain certificate
(5 cents), which are fixed without reference to the net earnings of A, do not constitute patronage dividends.

# Example 2.
Cooperative B, a marketing association operating on a pooling basis, receives the products of patron X on March 5, 1964. On the same day cooperative B pays to X $1.00 per unit for such products, this amount being determined by reference to the market price of the product when received, and issues to him a participation certificate having no face value but which entitles X on the close of the pool to the proceeds derived from the sale of his products less the previous payment of $1.00 and the expenses and other charges attributable to such products. On March 5, 1967, cooperative B, having sold the products in the pool, having deducted the previous payments for such products, and having determined the expenses and other charges of the pool pays to X, in cash, 10 cents per unit pursuant to the participation certificate. Under the provisions of section 1382(e), X's patronage is deemed to occur in 1967, the year in which the pool is closed. The payment made to X during 1967, amounting to 10 cents per unit, is a patronage dividend. Neither the payment to X in 1964 of $1.00 nor the issuance to him of the participation certificate in that year constitutes a patronage dividend.

# Example 3.
Cooperative C, a purchasing association, obtains supplies for patron Y on May 1, 1964, and receives in return therefor $100. On February 1, 1965, cooperative C, having determined the excess of its receipts over its costs and expenses, pays to Y a cash distribution of $1.00 and a revolving fund certificate with a stated dollar amount of $1.00. The amount of patronage dividend paid to Y in 1965 is $2.00, the aggregate of the cash distribution ($1.00) and the stated dollar amount of the revolving fund certificate ($1.00).

# Example 4.
Cooperative D, a service association, sells the products of members on a fee basis. It receives the products of patron Z under an agreement not to pool his products with those of other members, to sell his products, and to deliver to him the proceeds of the sale. Patron Z makes payments to cooperative D during 1964 aggregating $75 for service rendered him by cooperative D during that year. On May 15, 1965, cooperative D, having determined the excess of its receipts over its costs and expenses, pays to Z a cash distribution of $2.00. Such amount is a patronage dividend paid by cooperative D during 1965.
(b)
Written notice of allocation.
The term
written notice of allocation
means any capital stock, revolving fund certificate, retain certificate, certificate of indebtedness, letter of advice, or other written notice, which discloses to the patron the stated dollar amount allocated to him on the books of the cooperative organization, and the portion thereof, if any, which constitutes a patronage dividend. Thus, a mere credit to the account of a patron on the books of the organization without disclosure to the patron, is not a written notice of allocation. A written notice of allocation may disclose to the patron the amount of the allocation which constitutes a patronage dividend either as a dollar amount or as a percentage of the stated dollar amount of the written notice of allocation.
(c)
Qualified written notice of allocation
—(1)
In general.
The term
qualified written notice of allocation
means a written notice of allocation:
(i) Which meets the requirements of subparagraphs (2) or (3) of this paragraph, and
(ii) Which is paid as part of a patronage dividend, or as part of a payment by a cooperative association organized and operated in compliance with the provisions of section 521 and § 1.521-1 to patrons on a patronage basis with respect to earnings derived from business done with or for the United States or any of its agencies or from sources other than patronage, that also includes a payment in money or by qualified check equal to at least 20 percent of such patronage dividend or such payment.
In determining, for purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, whether 20 percent of a patronage dividend or a
payment with respect to nonpatronage earnings is paid in money or by qualified check, any portion of such dividend or payment which is paid in nonqualified written notices of allocation may be disregarded. Thus, if a cooperative pays a patronage dividend of $100 in the form of a nonqualified written notice of allocation with a stated dollar amount of $50, a written notice of allocation with a stated dollar amount of $40, and money in the amount of $10, the written notice of allocation with a stated dollar amount of $40 will constitute a qualified written notice of allocation if it meets the requirements of subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph. A
payment in money,
as that term is used in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, includes a payment by a check drawn on a bank but does not include a credit against amounts owed by the patron to the cooperative organization, a credit against the purchase price of a share of stock or of a membership in such organization, nor does it include a payment by means of a document redeemable by such organization for money.
(2)
Written notice of allocation redeemable in cash.
The term
qualified written notice of allocation
includes a written notice of allocation which meets the requirement of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph and which may be redeemed in cash at its stated dollar amount at any time within a period beginning on the date such written notice of allocation is paid and ending not earlier than 90 days from such date, but only if the distributee receives written notice of the right of redemption at the time he receives such written notice of allocation. The written notice of the right of redemption referred to in the preceding sentence shall be given separately to each patron. Thus, a written notice of the right of redemption which is published in a newspaper or posted at the cooperative's place of business would not be sufficient to qualify a written notice of allocation which is otherwise described in this subparagraph.
(3)
Consent of patron.
The term
qualified written notice of allocation
also includes written notice of allocation which meets the requirement of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph and which the distributee has consented, in a manner provided in this subparagraph, to take into account at its stated dollar amount as provided in section 1385 and § 1.1385-1.
(i)
Consent in writing.
A distributee may consent to take the stated dollar amount of written notices of allocation into account under section 1385 by signing and furnishing a written consent to the cooperative organization. No special form is required for the written consent so long as the document on which it is made clearly discloses the terms of the consent. Thus, the written consent may be made on a signed invoice, sales slip, delivery ticket, marketing agreement, or other document, on which appears the appropriate consent. Unless the written consent specifically provides to the contrary, it shall be effective with respect to all patronage occurring during the taxable year of the cooperative organization in which such consent is received by such organization and, unless revoked under section 1388(c)(3)(B), for all subsequent taxable years. Section 1388(c)(3)(B)(i) provides that a written consent may be revoked by the patron at any time. Thus, any written consent which is, by its terms, irrevocable is not a consent that would qualify a written notice of allocation. A revocation, to be effective, must be in writing, signed by the patron, and furnished to the cooperative organization. Such a revocation shall be effective only with respect to patronage occurring after the close of the taxable year of the cooperative organization during which the revocation is filed with it. In the case of a pooling arrangement described in section 1382(e) and § 1.1382-5, a written consent which is made at any time before the close of the taxable year of the cooperative organization during which the pool closes shall be effective with respect to all patronage under that pool. In addition, any subsequent revocation of such consent by the patron will not be effective for that pool or any other pool with respect to which he has been a patron before such revocation.
(ii)
Consent by membership. (a)
A distributee may consent to take the stated dollar amount of written notices of allocation into account under section
1385 by obtaining or retaining membership in the cooperative organization after such organization has adopted a valid bylaw providing that membership in such cooperative organization constitutes such consent, but such consent shall take effect only after the distributee has received a written notification of the adoption of the bylaw provision and a copy of such bylaw. The bylaw must have been adopted by the cooperative organization after October 16, 1962, and must contain a clear statement that membership in the cooperative organization constitutes the prescribed consent. The written notification from the cooperative organization must inform the patron that this bylaw has been adopted and of its significance. The notification and copy of the bylaw shall be given separately to each member (or prospective member); thus, a written notice and copy of the bylaw which are published in a newspaper or posted at the cooperative's place of business are not sufficient to qualify a written notice of allocation under this subdivision. A member (or prospective member) is presumed to have received the notification and copy of the bylaw if they were sent to his last known address by ordinary mail. A prospective member must receive the notification and copy of the bylaw before he becomes a member of the organization in order to have his membership in the organization constitute consent. A consent made in the manner described in this subdivision shall be effective only with respect to patronage occurring after the patron has received a copy of the bylaw and the prerequisite notice and while he is a member of the organization. Thus, any such consent shall not be effective with respect to any patronage occurring after the patron ceases to be a member of the cooperative organization or after the bylaw provision is repealed by such organization. In the case of a pooling arrangement described in section 1382(e) and § 1.1382-5, a consent made under this subdivision will be effective only with respect to the patron's actual patronage occurring after he receives the notification and copy of the bylaw and while he is a member of the cooperative organization. Thus such a consent shall not be effective with respect to any patronage under a pool after the patron ceases to be a member of the cooperative organization or after the bylaw provisions is repealed by the organization.
(
b
) The following is an example of a bylaw provision which would meet the requirements prescribed in (
a
) of this subdivision.

# Example:
Each person who hereafter applies for and is accepted to membership in this cooperative and each member of this cooperative on the effective date of this bylaw who continues as a member after such date shall, by such act alone, consent that the amount of any distributions with respect to his patronage occurring after _____, which are made in written notices of allocation (as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1388) and which are received by him from the cooperative, will be taken into account by him at their stated dollar amounts in the manner provided in 26 U.S.C. 1385(a) in the taxable year in which such written notices of allocation are received by him.
(
c
) For purposes of this subdivision the term
member
means a person who is entitled to participate in the management of the cooperative organization.
(iii)
Consent by qualified check. (a)
A distributee may consent to take the stated dollar amount of a written notice of allocation into account under section 1385 by endorsing and cashing a qualified check which is paid as a part of the same patronage dividend or payment described in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph of which the written notice of allocation is also a part. In order to constitute an effective consent under this subdivision, however, the qualified check must be endorsed and cashed by the payee on or before the ninetieth day after the close of the payment period for the taxable year of the cooperative organization with respect to which the patronage dividend or payment is paid (or on or before such earlier day as may be prescribed by the cooperative organization). The endorsing and cashing of a qualified check shall be considered a consent only with respect to written notices of allocation which are part of the same patronage dividend or payment as the qualified check and for which a consent under subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph is not in effect. A qualified check is presumed to be endorsed and cashed within the 90-day period if the
earliest bank endorsement which appears thereon bears a date no later than 3 days after the end of such 90-day period (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays).
(
b
) The term
qualified check
means a check, or other instrument redeemable in money, which is paid as a part of a patronage dividend or payment described in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, on which there is clearly imprinted a statement that the endorsement and cashing of the check or other instrument constitutes the consent of the payee to take into account, as provided in the Federal income tax laws, the stated dollar amount of any written notices of allocation which are paid as a part of the patronage dividend or payment of which such check or other instrument is also a part. A qualified check need not be in the form of an ordinary check which is payable through the banking system. It may, for example, be in the form of an instrument which is redeemable in money by the cooperative organization. The term
qualified check
does not include a check or other instrument paid as part of a patronage dividend or payment with respect to which a consent under subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph is in effect. In addition, the term
qualified check
does not include a check or other instrument which is paid as part of a patronage dividend or payment, if such patronage dividend or payment does not also include a written notice of allocation (other than a written notice of allocation that may be redeemed in cash at its stated dollar amount which meets the requirements of section 1388(c)(1)(A) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph). Thus, a check which is paid as part of a patronage dividend is not a qualified check (even though it has the required statement imprinted on it) if the remaining portion of such patronage dividend is paid in cash or if the only written notices of allocation included in the payment are qualified under section 1388(c)(1)(A) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (relating to certain written notices of allocation which are redeemable by the patron within a period of at least 90 days).
(
c
) The provisions of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example.

# Example:
(1) The A Cooperative is a cooperative organization filing its income tax returns on a calendar year basis. None of its patrons have consented in the manner prescribed in section 1388(c)(2) (A) or (B). On August 1, 1964, the A Cooperative pays patronage dividends to its patrons with respect to their 1963 patronage, and the payment to each such patron is partly by a qualified check and partly in the form of a written notice of allocation which is not redeemable for cash. Each patron who endorses and cashes his qualified check on or before December 14, 1964 (the ninetieth day following the close of the 1963 payment period) shall be considered to have consented with respect to the accompanying written notice of allocation and the amount of such check is treated as a patronage dividend paid in money on August 1, 1964.
(
2
) As to any patron who has not endorsed and cashed his qualified check by December 14, 1964, there is no consent and both the written notice of allocation and the qualified check constitute nonqualified written notices of allocation within the meaning of section 1388(d) and paragraph (d) of this section. If such a patron then cashes his check on January 2, 1965, he shall treat the amount received as an amount received on January 2, 1965, in redemption of a nonqualified written notice of allocation. Likewise, the cooperative shall treat the amount of the check as an amount paid on January 2, 1965, in redemption of a nonqualified written notice of allocation.
(
d
)
Nonqualified written notice of allocation.
The term
nonqualified written notice of allocation
means a written notice of allocation which is not a qualified written notice of allocation described in section 1388(c) and paragraph (c) of this section, or a qualified check which is not cashed on or before the ninetieth day after the close of the payment period for the taxable year of the cooperative organization for which the payment of which it is a part is paid.
(
e
)
Patron.
The term
patron
includes any person with whom or for whom the cooperative association does business on a cooperative basis, whether a member or a nonmember of the cooperative association, and whether an individual, a trust, estate, partnership, company, corporation, or cooperative association.
(f)
Patronage and nonpatronage sourced items
—(1)
Directly related use test.
Whether an item of income or deduction is patronage or nonpatronage sourced is determined by applying the directly related use test.
(2)
Patronage sourced income or deductions.
If the income or deduction is produced by a transaction that actually facilitates the accomplishment of the cooperative's marketing, purchasing, or services activities, the income or deduction is from patronage sources.
(3)
Nonpatronage sourced income or deductions.
If the transaction producing the income or deduction does not actually facilitate the accomplishment of the cooperative's marketing, purchasing, or services activities but merely enhances the overall profitability of the cooperative, being merely incidental to the association's cooperative operation, the income or deduction is from nonpatronage sources.
(g)
Applicability date.
Paragraph (f) of this section applies to taxable years beginning after January 19, 2021. Taxpayers, however, may choose to apply the rules of paragraph (f) of this section for taxable years beginning on or before that date, provided the taxpayers apply the rules in their entirety and in a consistent manner.

§ 1.1394-1
Enterprise zone facility bonds.
(a)
Scope.
This section contains rules relating to tax-exempt bonds under section 1394 (enterprise zone facility bonds) to provide enterprise zone facilities in both empowerment zones and enterprise communities (zones). See sections 1394, 1397B, and 1397C for other rules and definitions.
(b)
Period of compliance
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of this section, the requirements under sections 1394 (a) and (b) applicable to enterprise zone facility bonds must be complied with throughout the greater of the following—
(i) The remainder of the period during which the zone designation is in effect under section 1391 (zone designation period); and
(ii) The period that ends on the weighted average maturity date of the enterprise zone facility bonds.
(2)
Compliance after an issue is retired.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)
of this section, the requirements applicable to enterprise zone facility bonds do not apply to an issue after the date on which no enterprise zone facility bonds of the issue are outstanding.
(3)
Deemed compliance
—(i)
General rule.
An issue is deemed to comply with the requirements of sections 1394 (a) and (b) if—
(A) The issuer and the principal user in good faith attempt to meet the requirements of sections 1394 (a) and (b) throughout the period of compliance required under this section; and
(B) Any failure to meet these requirements is corrected within a one-year period after the failure is first discovered.
(ii)
Exception.
The provisions of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section do not apply to the requirements of section 1397B(d)(5)(A) (relating to certain prohibited business activities).
(iii)
Good faith.
In order to satisfy the good faith requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section, the principal user must at least annually demonstrate to the issuer the principal user's monitoring of compliance with the requirements of sections 1394 (a) and (b).
(c)
Special rules for requirements of sections 1397B and 1397C
—(1)
Start of compliance period.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the requirements of sections 1397B (relating to qualification as an enterprise zone business) and 1397C (relating to satisfaction of the rules for qualified zone property) do not apply prior to the
initial testing date
(as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section) if—
(i) The issuer and the principal user reasonably expect on the issue date of the enterprise zone facility bonds that those requirements will be met by the principal user on or before the initial testing date; and
(ii) The issuer and the principal user exercise due diligence to meet those requirements prior to the initial testing date.
(2)
Compliance period for certain prohibited activities.
The requirements of section 1397B(d)(5)(A) (relating to certain prohibited business activities) must be complied with throughout the term of the enterprise zone facility bonds.
(3)
Minimum compliance period.
The requirements of sections 1397B (b) or (c) and 1397C must be satisfied for a continuous period of at least three years after the initial testing date, notwithstanding that—
(i) The period of compliance required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section expires before the end of the three-year period; or
(ii) The enterprise zone facility bonds are retired before the end of the three-year period.
(4)
Initial testing date
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the initial testing date is the date that is 18 months after the later of the issue date of the enterprise zone facility bonds or the date on which the financed property is placed in service; provided, however, it is not later than—
(A) Three years after the issue date; or
(B) Five years after the issue date, if the issue finances a construction project for which both the issuer and a licensed architect or engineer certify on or before the issue date of the enterprise zone facility bonds that more than three years after the issue date is necessary to complete construction of the project.
(ii)
Alternative initial testing date.
If the issuer identifies as the initial testing date a date after the issue date of the enterprise zone facility bonds and prior to the initial testing date that would have been determined under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, that earlier date is treated as the initial testing date.
(d)
Testing on an average basis.
Compliance with each of the requirements of section 1397B (b) or (c) is tested each taxable year. Compliance with any of the requirements may be tested on an average basis, taking into account up to four immediately preceding taxable years plus the current taxable year. The earliest taxable year that may be taken into account for purposes of the preceding sentence is the taxable year that includes the initial testing date. A taxable year is disregarded if the part of the taxable year that falls in a required compliance period does not exceed 90 days.
(e)
Resident employee requirements
—(1)
Determination of employee status.
For purposes of the requirement of section 1397B (b)(6) or (c)(5) that at least 35 percent of the employees are residents of the zone, the issuer and the principal user may rely on a certification, signed under penalties of perjury by the employee, provided—
(i) The certification provides to the principal user the address of the employee's principal residence;
(ii) The employee is required by the certification to notify the principal user of a change of the employee's principal residence; and
(iii) Neither the issuer nor the principal user has actual knowledge that the principal residence set forth in the certification is not the employee's principal residence.
(2)
Employee treated as zone resident.
If an issue fails to comply with the requirement of section 1397B (b)(6) or (c)(5) because an employee who initially resided in the zone moves out of the zone, that employee is treated as still residing in the zone if—
(i) That employee was a bona fide resident of the zone at the time of the certification described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section;
(ii) That employee continues to perform services for the principal user in an enterprise zone business and substantially all of those services are performed in the zone; and
(iii) A resident of the zone meeting the requirements of section 1397B (b)(5) or (c)(4) is hired by the principal user for the next available comparable (or lesser) position.
(3)
Resident employee percentage.
For purposes of meeting the requirement of section 1397B (b)(6) or (c)(5) that at least 35 percent of the employees of an enterprise zone business are residents of a zone, paragraphs (e)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section apply.
(i) The term
employee
includes a self-employed individual within the meaning of section 401(c)(1).
(ii) The resident employee percentage is determined on any reasonable basis consistently applied throughout the period of compliance required under this section. The per-employee fraction (as defined in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section) or the employee actual work hour fraction (as defined in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section) are both reasonable methods.
(A) The term
per-employee fraction
means the fraction, the numerator of which is, during the taxable year, the number of employees who work at least 15 hours a week for the principal user, who reside in the zone, and who are employed for at least 90 days, and the denominator of which is, during the same taxable year, the aggregate number of all employees who work at least 15 hours a week for the principal user and who are employed for at least 90 days.
(B) The term
employee actual work hour fraction
means the fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate total actual hours of work for the principal user of employees who reside in the zone during a taxable year, and the denominator of which is the aggregate total actual hours of work for the principal user of all employees during the same taxable year.
(f)
Application to pooled financing bond and loan recycling programs.
In the case of a pooled financing bond program described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section or a loan recycling program described in paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of this section, the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section apply on a loan-by-loan basis. See also paragraphs (g)(2) (relating to limitation on amount of bonds), (m)(2) (relating to maturity limitations), (m)(3) (relating to volume cap), and (m)(4) (relating to remedial actions) of this section.
(g)
Limitation on amount of bonds
—(1)
Determination of outstanding amount.
Whether an issue satisfies the requirements of section 1394(c) (relating to the $3 million and $20 million aggregate limitations on the amount of outstanding enterprise zone facility bonds) is determined as of the issue date of that issue, based on the issue price of that issue and the adjusted issue price of outstanding enterprise zone facility bonds. Amounts of outstanding enterprise zone facility bonds allocable to any entity are determined under rules contained in section 144(a)(10)(C) and the underlying regulations. Thus, the definition of
principal user
for purposes of section 1394(c) is different from the
definition of principal user for purposes of paragraph (j) of this section.
(2)
Pooled financing bond programs
—(i)
In general.
The limitations of section 1394(c) for an issue for a pooled financing bond program are determined with regard to the amount of the actual loans to enterprise zone businesses rather than the amount lent to
intermediary lenders
as defined in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section. This paragraph (g)(2) applies only to the extent the proceeds of those enterprise zone facility bonds are loaned to one or more enterprise zone businesses within 42 months of the issue date of the enterprise zone facility bonds or are used to redeem enterprise zone facility bonds of the issue within that 42-month period.
(ii)
Pooled financing bond program defined.
For purposes of this section,
a pooled financing bond program
is a program in which the issuer of enterprise zone facility bonds, in order to provide loans to enterprise zone businesses, lends the proceeds of the enterprise zone facility bonds to a bank or similar intermediary (intermediary lender) which must then relend the proceeds to two or more enterprise zone businesses.
(h)
Original use requirement for purposes of qualified zone property.
In general, for purposes of section 1397C(a)(1)(B), the term
original use
means the first use to which the property is put within the zone. For purposes of section 1394, if property is vacant for at least a one-year period including the date of zone designation, use prior to that period is disregarded for purposes of determining original use. For this purpose, de minimis incidental uses of property, such as renting the side of a building for a billboard, are disregarded.
(i)
Land.
The determination of whether land is functionally related and subordinate to qualified zone property is made in a manner consistent with the rules for exempt facilities under section 142.
(j)
Principal user
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, the term
principal user
means the owner of financed property.
(2)
Rental of real property
—(i)
A lessee as the principal user.
If an owner of real property financed with enterprise zone facility bonds is not an enterprise zone business within the meaning of section 1397B, but the rental of the property is a qualified business within the meaning of section 1397B(d)(2), the term
principal user
for purposes of sections 1394 (b) and (e) means the lessee or lessees.
(ii)
Allocation of enterprise zone facility bonds.
If a lessee is the principal user of real property under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, then proceeds of enterprise zone facility bonds may be allocated to expenditures for real property only to the extent of the property allocable to the lessee's leased space, including expenditures for common areas.
(3)
Pooled financing bond program.
An intermediary lender in a pooled financing bond program described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section is not treated as the principal user.
(k)
Treatment as separately incorporated business.
For purposes of section 1394(b)(3)(B), a trade or business may be treated as separately incorporated if allocations of income and activities attributable to the business conducted within the zone are made using a reasonable allocation method and if that trade or business has evidence of those allocations sufficient to establish compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section. Whether an allocation method is reasonable will depend upon the facts and circumstances. An allocation method will not be considered to be reasonable unless the allocation method is applied consistently by the trade or business and is consistent with the purposes of section 1394.
(l)
Substantially all.
For purposes of sections 1397B and 1397C(a), the term
substantially all
means 85 percent.
(m)
Application of sections 142 and 146 through 150
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in this paragraph (m), enterprise zone facility bonds are treated as exempt facility bonds that are described in section 142(a), and all regulations generally applicable to exempt facility bonds apply to enterprise zone facility bonds. For this purpose, enterprise zone businesses are treated as meeting the public use requirement. Sections 147(c)(1)(A) (relating to limitations on financing the acquisition of
land), 147(d) (relating to financing the acquisition of existing property), and 142(b)(2) (relating to limitations on financing office space) do not apply to enterprise zone facility bonds. See also paragraph (n)(4) of this section.
(2)
Maturity limitation
—(i)
Requirements.
An issue of enterprise zone facility bonds, the proceeds of which are to be used as part of a loan recycling program, satisfies the requirements of section 147(b) if—
(A) Each loan satisfies the requirements of section 147(b) (determined by treating each separate loan as a separate issue); and
(B) The term of the issue does not exceed 30 years.
(ii)
Loan recycling program defined.
A
loan recycling program
is a program in which—
(A) The issuer reasonably expects as of the issue date of the enterprise zone facility bonds that loan repayments from principal users will be used to make additional loans during the zone designation period;
(B) Repayments of principal on loans (including prepayments) received during the zone designation period are used within six months of the date of receipt either to make new loans to enterprise zone businesses or to redeem enterprise zone facility bonds that are part of the issue; and
(C) Repayments of principal on loans (including prepayments) received after the zone designation period are used to redeem enterprise zone facility bonds that are part of the issue within six months of the date of receipt.
(3)
Volume cap.
For purposes of applying section 146(f)(5)(A) (relating to elective carryforward of unused volume limitation), issuing enterprise zone facility bonds is a carryforward purpose.
(4)
Remedial actions.
In the case of a pooled financing bond program described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section or a loan recycling program described in paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of this section, if a loan fails to meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, within six months of noncompliance (after taking into account the deemed compliance provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, if applicable), an amount equal to the outstanding loan principal must be prepaid and the issuer must—
(i) Reloan the amount of the prepayment; or
(ii) Use the prepayment to redeem an amount of outstanding enterprise zone facility bonds equal to the outstanding principal amount of the loan that no longer meets those requirements.
(n)
Continuing compliance and change of use penalties
—(1)
In general.
The penalty provisions of section 1394(e) apply throughout the period of compliance required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(2)
Coordination with deemed compliance provisions.
Section 1394(e)(2) does not apply during any period during which the issue is deemed to comply with the requirements of section 1394 under the deemed compliance provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(3)
Application to pooled financing bond and loan recycling programs.
In the case of a pooled financing bond program described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section or a loan recycling program described in paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of this section, section 1394(e) applies on a loan-by-loan basis.
(4)
Section 150(b)(4) inapplicable.
Section 150(b)(4) does not apply to enterprise zone facility bonds.
(o)
Refunding bonds
—(1)
In general.
An issue of bonds issued after the zone designation period to refund enterprise zone facility bonds (other than in an advance refunding) are treated as enterprise zone facility bonds if the refunding issue and the prior issue, if treated as a single combined issue, would meet all of the requirements for enterprise zone facility bonds, except the requirements in section 1394(c). For example, the compliance period described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is calculated taking into account any extension of the weighted average maturity of the refunding issue compared to the remaining weighted average maturity of the prior issue. The proceeds of the refunding issue are allocated to the same expenditures and purpose investments as the prior issue.
(2)
Maturity limitation.
The maturity limitation of section 147(b) is applied
to a refunding issue by taking into account the issuer's reasonable expectations about the economic life of the financed property as of the issue date of the prior issue and the actual weighted average maturity of the combined refunding issue and prior issue.
(p)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate paragraphs (a) through (o) of this section:

# Example 1. Averaging of enterprise zone business requirements.
City C issues enterprise zone facility bonds, the proceeds of which are loaned by C to Corporation B to finance the acquisition of equipment for its existing business located in a zone. On the issue date of the enterprise zone facility bonds, B meets all of the requirements of section 1397B(b), except that only 25% of B's employees reside in the zone. C and B reasonably expect on the issue date to meet all requirements of section 1397B(b) by the date that is 18 months after the equipment is placed in service (the initial testing date). In each of the first, second, and third taxable years after the initial testing date, 35%, 40% and 45%, respectively, of B's employees are zone residents. In the fourth year after the testing date, only 25% of B's employees are zone residents. B continues to meet the 35% resident employee requirement, because the average of zone resident employees for those four taxable years is approximately 36%. The percentage of zone residents employed by B before the initial testing date is not included in determining whether B continues to comply with the 35% resident employee requirement.

# Example 2. Measurement of resident employee percentage.
Authority D issues enterprise zone facility bonds, the proceeds of which are loaned to Sole Proprietor F to establish an accounting business in a zone. In the first year after the initial testing date, the staff working for F includes F, who works 40 hours per week and does not live in the zone, one employee who resides in the zone and works 40 hours per week, one employee who does not reside in the zone and works 20 hours per week, and one employee who does not reside in the zone and works 10 hours per week. F meets the 35% resident employee test by calculating the percentage on the basis of employee actual work hours as described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section. If F uses the per-employee basis as described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section to determine if the resident employee test is met, the percentage of employees who are zone residents on a per-employee basis is only 33% because F must exclude from the numerator and the denominator the employee who works only 10 hours per week. If F calculates the resident employee test as a percentage of employee actual work hours as described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section in the first year, F must calculate the resident employee test as a percentage of employee actual work hours each year.

# Example 3. Active conduct of business within the zone.
State G issues enterprise zone facility bonds and loans the proceeds to Corporation H to finance the acquisition of equipment for H's mail order clothing business, which is located in a zone. H purchases the supplies for its clothing business from suppliers located both within and outside of the zone and expects that orders will be received both from customers who will reside or work within the zone and from others outside the zone. All orders are received and filled at, and are shipped from, H's clothing business located in the zone. H meets the requirement that at least 80% of its gross income is derived from the active conduct of business within the zone.

# Example 4. Enterprise zone business definition.
City J issues enterprise zone facility bonds, the proceeds of which are loaned to Partnership K to finance the acquisition of equipment for its printing operation located in the zone. All orders are taken and completed, and all billing and accounting activities are performed, at the print shop located in the zone. K, on occasion, uses its equipment (including its trucks) and employees to deliver large print jobs to customers who reside outside of the zone. So long as K is able to establish that its trucks are used in the zone at least 85% of the time and its employees perform at least 85% of services for K in the zone, K meets the requirements of sections 1397B(b) (3) and (5).

# Example 5. Treatment as a separately incorporated business.
The facts are the same as in
Example 4
except that six years after the issue date of the enterprise zone facility bonds, K determines to expand its operations to a second location outside of the boundaries of the zone. Although the expansion would result in the failure of K to meet the tests of 1397B(b), K, using a reasonable allocation method, allocates income and activities to its operations within the zone and has evidence of these allocations sufficient to establish compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section. The bonds will not fail to be enterprise zone facility bonds merely because of the expansion.

# Example 6. Treatment of pooled financing bond programs.
Authority L issues bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 and loans the proceeds to Bank M pursuant to a loans-to-lenders program. M does not meet the definition of enterprise zone business contained in section 1397B. Prior to the issue date of the bonds, L held a public hearing regarding issuance of the bonds for the loans-to-lenders program, describing the
projects of identified borrowers to be financed initially with $4,000,000 of the proceeds of the bonds. The applicable elected representative of L approved issuance of the bonds subsequent to the public hearing. The loan agreement between L and M provides that the other proceeds of the bonds will be held by M and loaned to borrowers that qualify as enterprise zone businesses, following a public hearing and approval by the applicable elected representative of L of each loan by M to an enterprise zone business. None of the loans will be in principal amounts in excess of $3,000,000. The loans by M will otherwise meet the requirements of section 1394. The bonds will be enterprise zone facility bonds.

# Example 7. Original use requirement for purposes of qualified zone property.
City N issues enterprise zone facility bonds, the proceeds of which are loaned to Corporation P to finance the acquisition of equipment. P uses the proceeds after the zone designation date to purchase used equipment located outside of the zone and places the equipment in service at its location in the zone. Substantially all of the use of the equipment is in the zone and is in the active conduct of a qualified business by P. The equipment is treated as qualified enterprise zone property under section 1397C because P makes the first use of the property within the zone after the zone designation date.

# Example 8. Principal user.
State R issues enterprise zone facility bonds and loans the proceeds to Partnership S to finance the construction of a small shopping center to be located in a zone. S is in the business of commercial real estate. S is not an enterprise zone business, but has secured one anchor lessee, Corporation T, for the shopping center. T would qualify as an enterprise zone business. S will derive 60% of its gross rental income of the shopping center from T. S does not anticipate that the remaining rental income will come from enterprise zone businesses. T will occupy 60% of the total rentable space in the shopping center. S can use enterprise zone facility bond proceeds to finance the portion of the costs of the shopping center allocable to T (60%) because T is treated as the principal user of the enterprise zone facility bond proceeds.

# Example 9. Remedial actions.
State W issues pooled financing enterprise zone facility bonds, the proceeds of which will be loaned to several enterprise zone businesses in the two enterprise communities and one empowerment zone in W. Proceeds of the pooled financing bonds are loaned to Corporation X, an enterprise zone business, for a term of 10 years. Six years after the date of the loan, X expands its operations beyond the empowerment zone and is no longer able to meet the requirements of section 1394. X does not reasonably expect to be able to cure the noncompliance. The loan documents provide that X must prepay its loan in the event of noncompliance. W does not expect to be able to reloan the prepayment by X within six months of noncompliance. X's noncompliance will not affect the qualification of the pooled financing bonds as enterprise zone facility bonds if W uses the proceeds from the loan prepayment to redeem outstanding enterprise zone facility bonds within six months of noncompliance in an amount comparable to the outstanding amount of the loan immediately prior to prepayment. X will be denied an interest expense deduction for the interest accruing from the first day of the taxable year in which the noncompliance began.

# Empowerment Zone Employment Credit
§ 1.1396-1
Qualified zone employees.
(a)
In general.
A qualified zone employee of an employer is an employee who satisfies the location-of-services requirement and the abode requirement with respect to the same empowerment zone and is not otherwise excluded by section 1396(d).
(1)
Location-of-services requirement.
The location-of-services requirement is satisfied if substantially all of the services performed by the employee for the employer are performed in the empowerment zone in a trade or business of the employer.
(2)
Abode requirement.
The abode requirement is satisfied if the employee's principal place of abode while performing those services is in the empowerment zone.
(b)
Period for applying location-of-services requirement.
In applying the location-of-services requirement, an employer may use either the pay period method described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or the calendar year method described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. For each taxable year of an
employer, the employer must either use the pay period method with respect to all of its employees or use the calendar year method with respect to all of its employees. The employer may change the method applied to all of its employees from one taxable year to the next.
(1)
Pay period method
—(i)
Relevant period.
Under the pay period method, the relevant period for applying the location-of-services requirement is each pay period in which an employee provides services to the employer during the calendar year with respect to which the credit is being claimed (
i.e.,
the calendar year that ends with or within the relevant taxable year). If an employer has one pay period for certain employees and a different pay period for other employees (e.g., a weekly pay period for hourly wage employees and a bi-weekly pay period for salaried employees), the pay period actually applicable to a particular employee is the relevant pay period for that employee under this method.
(ii)
Application of method.
Under this method, an employee does not satisfy the location-of-services requirement during a pay period unless substantially all of the services performed by the employee for the employer during that pay period are performed within the empowerment zone in a trade or business of the employer.
(2)
Calendar year method
—(i)
Relevant period.
Under the calendar year method, the relevant period for an employee is the entire calendar year with respect to which the credit is being claimed. However, for any employee who is employed by the employer for less than the entire calendar year, the relevant period is the portion of that calendar year during which the employee is employed by the employer.
(ii)
Application of method.
Under this method, an employee does not satisfy the location-of-services requirement during any part of a calendar year unless substantially all of the services performed by the employee for the employer during that calendar year (or, if the employee is employed by the employer for less than the entire calendar year, the portion of that calendar year during which the employee is employed by the employer) are performed within the empowerment zone in a trade or business of the employer.
(3)
Examples.
This paragraph (b) may be illustrated by the following examples. In each example, the following assumptions apply. The employees satisfy the abode requirement at all relevant times and all services performed by the employees for their employer are performed in a trade or business of the employer. The employees are not precluded from being qualified zone employees by section 1396(d)(2) (certain employees ineligible). No portion of the employees' wages is precluded from being qualified zone wages by section 1396(c)(2) (only first $15,000 of wages taken into account) or section 1396(c)(3) (coordination with targeted jobs credit and work opportunity credit). The examples are as follows:

# Example 1.
(i) Employer X has a weekly pay period for all its employees. Employee A works for X throughout 1997. During each of the first 20 weekly pay periods in 1997, substantially all of A's work for X is performed within the empowerment zone in which A resides. A also works in the zone at various times during the rest of the year, but there is no other pay period in which substantially all of A's work for X is performed within the empowerment zone. Employer X uses the pay period method.
(ii) For each of the first 20 pay periods of 1997, A is a qualified zone employee, all of A's wages from X are qualified zone wages, and X may claim the empowerment zone employment credit with respect to those wages. X cannot claim the credit with respect to any of A's wages for the rest of 1997.

# Example 2.
(i) Employer Y has a weekly pay period for its factory workers and a bi-weekly pay period for its office workers. Employee B works for Y in various factories and Employee C works for Y in various offices. Employer Y uses the pay period method.
(ii) Y must use B's weekly pay periods to determine the periods (if any) in which B is a qualified zone employee. Y may claim the empowerment zone employment credit with respect to B's wages only for the weekly pay periods for which B is a qualified zone employee, because those are B's only wages that are qualified zone wages. Y must use C's bi-weekly pay periods to determine the periods (if any) in which C is a qualified zone employee. Y may claim the credit with respect to C's wages only for the bi-weekly pay periods for which C is a qualified zone employee, because those are C's only wages that are qualified zone wages.

# Example 3.
(i) Employees D and E work for Employer Z throughout 1997. Although some
of D's work for Z in 1997 is performed outside the empowerment zone in which D resides, substantially all of it is performed within that empowerment zone. E's work for Z is performed within the empowerment zone in which E resides for several weeks of 1997 but outside the zone for the rest of the year so that, viewed on an annual basis, E's work is not substantially all performed within the empowerment zone. Employer Z uses the calendar year method.
(ii) D is a qualified zone employee for the entire year, all of D's 1997 wages from Z are qualified zone wages, and Z may claim the empowerment zone employment credit with respect to all of those wages, including the portion attributable to work outside the zone. Under the calendar year method, E is not a qualified zone employee for any part of 1997, none of E's 1997 wages are qualified zone wages, and Z cannot claim any empowerment zone employment credit with respect to E's wages for 1997. Z cannot use the calendar year method for D and the pay period method for E because Z must use the same method for all employees. For 1998, however, Z can switch to the pay period method for E if Z also switches to the pay period method for D and all of Z's other employees.
(c)
Effective date.
This section applies with respect to wages paid or incurred on or after December 21, 1994.
[T.D. 8747, 62 FR 67727, Dec. 30, 1997]
§ 1.1397E-1
Qualified zone academy bonds.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Overview.
In general, a qualified zone academy bond (QZAB or QZABs) is a taxable bond issued by a state or local government the proceeds of which are used to improve certain eligible public schools. An eligible taxpayer that holds a QZAB generally is allowed annual Federal income tax credits in lieu of periodic interest payments. These credits compensate the eligible taxpayer for lending money to the issuer and function as payments of interest on the bond. Accordingly, this section generally treats the allowance of a credit as if it were a payment of interest on the bond. This section also provides other rules for QZABs, including rules governing the credit rate, the private business contribution requirement, the maximum term, use and expenditure of proceeds, remedial actions, eligible issuers, arbitrage investment restrictions, and information reporting.
(2)
Certain definitions
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section, except as otherwise provided in this section, the following definitions apply: the definitions set forth in this section; the definitions used for general tax-exempt bond purposes in § 1.150-1; and the definitions used for purposes of the arbitrage investment restrictions on tax-exempt bonds in § 1.148-1(b).
(ii)
Applicable definition of proceeds
—(A)
Use and expenditure provisions.
Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(B) and (a)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, for purposes of all applicable requirements regarding use and expenditure of proceeds of QZABs under section 1397E and this section, “proceeds” means “sale proceeds,” as defined in § 1.148-1(b), plus “investment proceeds,” as defined in § 1.148-1(b).
(B)
Private business contribution requirement.
For purposes of the private business contribution requirement of section 1397E(d)(2), “proceeds” means “sale proceeds,” as defined in § 1.148-1(b).
(C)
Arbitrage investment restrictions.
For purposes of the scope of application of the arbitrage investment restrictions under section 1397E(g) and paragraph (i) of this section, “proceeds” generally means gross proceeds, as defined in § 1.148-1(b). In addition, in applying the arbitrage investment restrictions under paragraph (i) of this section and under section 148, the various applicable definitions of the various types of proceeds of tax-exempt bonds under § 1.148-1(b) shall apply.
(b)
Credit rate.
The Secretary shall determine monthly (or more often as deemed necessary by the Secretary) the credit rate the Secretary estimates will generally permit the issuance of a qualified zone academy bond without discount and without interest cost to the issuer. The manner for ascertaining the credit rate for a qualified zone academy bond as determined by the Secretary shall be set forth in procedures, notices, forms, or instructions prescribed by the Commissioner.
(c)
Private business contribution requirement—
(1)
Reasonable discount rate.
To determine the present value (as of the issue date) of qualified contributions from private entities under section 1397E(d)(2), the issuer must use a reasonable discount rate. The credit rate determined under paragraph (b) of
this section is a reasonable discount rate.
(2)
Definition of private entities.
For purposes of section 1397E(d)(2)(A), the term
private entities
includes any person (as defined in section 7701(a)) other than the United States, a State or local government, or any agency or instrumentality thereof or related party with respect thereto. To determine whether a person is related to the United States or a State or local government under this paragraph (c)(2), rules similar to those for determining whether a person is a related party under § 1.150-1(b) shall apply (treating the United States as a governmental unit for purposes of § 1.150-1(b)).
(3)
Qualified contribution.
For purposes of section 1397E(d)(2)(A), the term
qualified contribution
means any contribution (of a type and quality acceptable to the eligible local education agency) of any property or service described in section 1397E(d)(2)(B)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v). In addition, cash received with respect to a qualified zone academy from a private entity (other than cash received indirectly from a person that is not a private entity as part of a plan to avoid the requirements of section 1397E) constitutes a qualified contribution if it is to be used to purchase any property or service described in section 1397E(d)(2)(B)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v). Services of employees of the eligible local education agency do not constitute qualified contributions.
(d)
Maximum term.
The maximum term for a QZAB is determined under section 1397E(d)(3) by using a discount rate equal to 110 percent of the long-term adjusted applicable Federal rate (AFR), compounded semi-annually, for the month in which the bond is sold. The Internal Revenue Service publishes this figure each month in a revenue ruling that is published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. See § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter. A bond is sold on the sale date, as defined in § 1.150-1(c)(6), which is the first day on which there is a binding contract in writing for the sale or exchange of the bond.
(e)
Tax credit
—(1)
Eligible taxpayer.
An eligible taxpayer (within the meaning of section 1397E(d)(6)) that holds a qualified zone academy bond on a credit allowance date is allowed a tax credit against the Federal income tax imposed on the taxpayer for the taxable year that includes the credit allowance date. The amount of the credit is equal to the product of the credit rate and the outstanding principal amount of the bond on the credit allowance date. The credit is subject to a limitation based on the eligible taxpayer's income tax liability. See section 1397E(c).
(2)
Ineligible taxpayer.
A taxpayer that is not an eligible taxpayer is not allowed a credit.
(f)
Treatment of the allowance of the credit as a payment of interest
—(1)
General rule.
The holder of a qualified zone academy bond must treat the bond as if it pays qualified stated interest (within the meaning of § 1.1273-1(c)) on each credit allowance date. The amount of the deemed payment of interest on each credit allowance date is equal to the product of the credit rate and the outstanding principal amount of the bond on that date. Thus, for example, if the holder uses an accrual method of accounting, the holder must accrue as interest income the amount of the credit over the one-year accrual period that ends on the credit allowance date.
(2)
Adjustment if the holder cannot use the credit to offset a tax liability.
If a holder holds a qualified zone academy bond on the credit allowance date but cannot use all or a portion of the credit to reduce its income tax liability (for example, because the holder is not an eligible taxpayer or because the limitation in section 1397E(c) applies), the holder is allowed a deduction for the taxable year that includes the credit allowance date (or, at the option of the holder, the next succeeding taxable year). The amount of the deduction is equal to the amount of the unused credit deemed paid on the credit allowance date.
(g)
Not a tax-exempt obligation.
A qualified zone academy bond is not an obligation the interest on which is excluded from gross income under section 103(a).
(h)
Use of proceeds
—(1)
In general.
Section 1397E(d)(1) provides that a bond issued as part of an issue is a QZAB only if, among other requirements, at least 95 percent of the proceeds of the
issue are to be used for a qualified purpose with respect to a qualified zone academy established by an eligible local education agency (as defined in section 1397E(d)(4)(B)), and the issue meets the requirements of section 1397E(f) and (g). Section 1397E(d)(5) defines
qualified purpose,
with respect to any qualified zone academy, as rehabilitating or repairing the public school facility in which such academy is established, providing equipment for use at such academy, developing course materials for education to be provided at such academy, and training teachers and other school personnel in such academy. Section 1397E(d)(4)(A) defines
qualified zone academy
as any public school (or academic program within a public school) that is established by and operated under the supervision of an eligible local education agency to provide education or training below the postsecondary level and that meets the requirements of section 1397E(d)(4)(A)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv).
(2)
Use of proceeds requirements.
An issue meets the requirements of sections 1397E (d)(1)(A) and (f) only if—
(i) The issuer reasonably expects, as of the issue date of the issue, that—
(A) At least 95 percent of the proceeds from the sale of the issue are to be spent for qualified purposes with respect to qualified zone academies within the 5-year period beginning on the issue date of the QZAB;
(B) A binding commitment with a third party to spend at least 10 percent of the proceeds from the sale of the issue will be incurred within the 6-month period beginning on the issue date of the QZAB;
(C) At least 95 percent of the proceeds from the sale of the issue will be spent for qualified purposes with respect to a qualified zone academy with due diligence (with due diligence measured by the reasonableness standard under § 1.148-1(b)); and
(D) At least 95 percent of the proceeds of the issue will be used for qualified purposes with respect to a qualified zone academy for the entire term of the issue (without regard to any redemption provision); and
(ii) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (h)(8) of this section, at least 95 percent of the proceeds of the issue are actually used for qualified purposes with respect to a qualified academy for the entire term of the issue (without regard to any redemption provision).
(3)
Extension of 5-year period.
The Commissioner may extend the period described in paragraph (h)(2)(i)(A) of this section if the issuer, prior to the end of such period, submits a private ruling request, and establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that—
(i) The failure to satisfy the 5-year spending requirement is due to reasonable cause; and
(ii) The expenditure of at least 95 percent of the proceeds from the sale of the issue for a qualified purpose with respect to a qualified zone academy will continue to proceed with due diligence.
(4)
Unspent proceeds.
For purposes of paragraphs (h)(2)(i)(D) and (h)(2)(ii) of this section, during the period described in paragraph (h)(2)(i)(A) of this section, including any extension under paragraph (h)(3) of this section, unspent proceeds are treated as used for a qualified purpose with respect to a qualified zone academy if the issuer reasonably expects to proceed with due diligence to spend those proceeds for a qualified purpose with respect to a qualified zone academy during that period.
(5)
Proceeds spent for rehabilitation, repair or equipment
—(i)
In general.
Under section 1397E(d)(5)(A) the term
qualified purpose
with respect to any qualified zone academy includes rehabilitating or repairing the public school facility in which such academy is established. For this purpose, in determining whether proceeds are spent for rehabilitation, rules similar to those under section 47(c) (other than sections 47(c)(1)(B) and 47(c)(2)(B)(iv)) shall apply. Under section 1397E(d)(5)(B) the term
qualified purpose
also includes providing equipment for use at such academy. If proceeds of an issue are spent for a purpose described in section 1397E(d)(5)(A) or (B) with respect to a qualified zone academy, then those proceeds are treated as used for a qualified purpose with respect to the academy during any period after such expenditure that—
(A) The property financed with those proceeds is used for the purposes of the academy; and
(B) The academy maintains its status as a qualified zone academy under section 1397E(d)(4).
(ii)
Retirement from service.
The retirement from service of financed property due to normal wear or obsolescence does not cause the property to fail to be used for a qualified purpose with respect to a qualified zone academy.
(6)
Proceeds spent to develop course materials or train teachers.
Section 1397E(d)(5)(C) and (D) provides that the term
qualified purpose
with respect to any qualified zone academy includes developing course materials for education to be provided at such academy, and training teachers and other school personnel in such academy. If proceeds of an issue are spent for a purpose described in section 1397E(d)(5)(C) or (D) with respect to a qualified zone academy, then those proceeds are treated as used for a qualified purpose with respect to the academy during any period after such expenditure.
(7)
Special rule for determining status as qualified zone academy.
Section 1397E(d)(4)(A)(iv) provides that a public school (or academic program within a public school) is a qualified zone academy only if, among other requirements, the public school is located in an empowerment zone or enterprise community (as defined in section 1393), or there is a reasonable expectation (as of the issue date of the issue) that at least 35 percent of the students attending the school or participating in the program (as the case may be) will be eligible for free or reduced-cost lunches under the school lunch program established under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act. For purposes of determining whether an issue complies with section 1397E(d)(4)(A)(iv)—
(i) A public school is treated as located in an empowerment zone or enterprise community for the entire term of the issue if the public school is located in an empowerment zone or enterprise community on the issue date of the issue; and
(ii) The determination of whether there is a reasonable expectation (as of the issue date of the issue) that at least 35 percent of the students attending the school or participating in the program (as the case may be) will be eligible for free or reduced-cost lunches under the school lunch program established under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act is based on expectations regarding the one-year period following the issue date.
(8)
Remedial actions
—(i)
General rule.
If less than 95 percent of the proceeds of an issue are properly used (as determined under paragraph (h)(8)(ii)(D) of this section), the issue will be treated as meeting the requirements of section 1397E(d)(1)(A) if the issue met the requirements of paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section and a remedial action is taken under paragraph (h)(8)(ii) or (iii) of this section.
(ii)

)
In general.
The requirements of this paragraph (h)(8)(ii)(B) are met if—
(
i
) All of the nonqualified bonds of the issue (as determined under § 1.142-2(e)) are redeemed within 90 days after the date on which the failure to properly use proceeds occurs; or
(
ii
) To the extent proceeds of the issue that have been actually spent for a qualified purpose with respect to a qualified zone academy, if any nonqualified bonds of the issue are not redeemed within 90 days after the date on which the failure to properly use such proceeds occurs (the unredeemed nonqualified bonds), a defeasance escrow is established for the unredeemed nonqualified bonds within 90 days after the date on which the failure to properly use proceeds occurs.
(

)
Special rule for dispositions for cash.
If the failure to properly use proceeds occurs because of a disposition of financed property described in section 1397E(d)(5)(A) or (B) and the consideration for the disposition is exclusively cash, the requirements of this paragraph (h)(8)(ii)(B) are met if all of the disposition proceeds (as defined in paragraph (h)(8)(iv) of this section) are used within 90 days after the date of the disposition to redeem, or establish
a defeasance escrow for, the nonqualified bonds (as determined under § 1.142-2(e)).
(

)
Definition of defeasance escrow.
For purposes of this section, a defeasance escrow is an irrevocable escrow established to retire nonqualified bonds on the earliest call date after the date on which the failure to properly use proceeds occurs in an amount that is sufficient to retire nonqualified bonds on that call date. At least 90 percent of the weighted average amount in a defeasance escrow must be invested in investments (as defined in § 1.148-1(b)), except that no amount in a defeasance escrow may be invested in any investment the obligor (or any person that is a related party with respect to the obligor within the meaning of § 1.150-1(b)) of which is a user of proceeds of the bonds. All purchases or sales of an investment in a defeasance escrow must be made at the fair market value of the investment within the meaning of § 1.148-5(d)(6).
(C)
Additional rules
—(

)
Limitation on source of funding.

(
2
)
Rebate requirement.
The issuer must pay to the United States, at the same time and in the same manner as rebate amounts are required to be paid under § 1.148-3 (or at such other time or in such other manner as the Commissioner may prescribe), any investment earnings on amounts in a defeasance escrow established under paragraph (h)(8)(ii)(B) of this section that are in excess of the yield on the issue of QZABs with respect to which the defeasance escrow was established. For this purpose, the first computation period begins on the date on which the defeasance escrow is established.
(
3
)
Notice of defeasance.
The issuer must provide written notice to the Commissioner, at the place designated in § 1.150-5(a), of the establishment of the defeasance escrow within 90 days of the date the defeasance escrow is established.
(D)
When a failure to properly use proceeds occurs
—(

)
Unspent proceeds.
For unspent proceeds, a failure to properly use proceeds occurs on the earliest of—
(
i
) The first date on which the public school (or academic program within the public school) fails to constitute a qualified zone academy;
(
ii
) The first date on which the issuer fails to have a reasonable expectation to proceed with due diligence to spend at least 95 percent of the proceeds of the issue for a qualified purpose with respect to a qualified zone academy; or
(
iii
) The last day of the period described in paragraph (h)(2)(i)(A) of this section, including any extension, if less than 95 percent of the proceeds of the issue are actually spent for a qualified purpose with respect to a qualified zone academy.
(
2
)
Proceeds spent for rehabilitation, repair or equipment.
For proceeds that have been spent for a purpose described in section 1397E(d)(5)(A) or (B) with respect to a qualified zone academy, a failure to properly use proceeds occurs on the earlier of—
(
i
) The first date on which the public school (or academic program within the public school) fails to constitute a qualified zone academy; and
(
ii
) The first date on which an action is taken that causes the issuer to fail actually to use at least 95 percent of the proceeds of the issue for a qualified purpose with respect to a qualified zone academy.
(
3
)
Proceeds spent for course materials or training.
If proceeds have been spent for a purpose described in section 1397E(d)(5)(C) or (D) with respect to a qualified zone academy, no event subsequent to such expenditure shall constitute a failure to properly use such proceeds.
(iii)
Alternative use of disposition proceeds.
A remedial action is taken under this paragraph (h)(8)(iii) if all of the requirements of paragraphs (h)(8)(iii)(A) through (D) of this section are met—
(A) The failure to properly use proceeds (as determined under paragraph (h)(8)(ii)(D) of this section) is a disposition of financed property described in section 1397E(d)(5)(A) or (B) and the consideration for the disposition is exclusively cash;
(B) The issuer reasonably expects as of the date of the disposition that—
(
1
) All of the disposition proceeds will be spent within the two-year period beginning with the date of the disposition for a qualified purpose with respect to a qualified zone academy; or
(
2
) To the extent not expected to be so spent, the disposition proceeds will be used within 90 days after the date of the disposition to redeem or defease bonds in a manner that meets the requirements of paragraph (h)(8)(ii) of this section;
(C) The disposition proceeds are treated as proceeds for purposes of section 1397E; and
(D) If all of the disposition proceeds are not actually used in the manner described in paragraph (h)(8)(iii)(B) of this section, the remainder of such amounts are used within 90 days after the end of the period described in paragraph (h)(8)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section for a remedial action that meets the requirements of paragraph (h)(8)(ii) of this section.
(iv)
Definition of disposition proceeds and allocation among multiple funding sources.
For purposes of this paragraph (h)(8),
disposition proceeds
means disposition proceeds, as defined in § 1.141-12(c)(1), plus amounts derived from investing disposition proceeds. If property has been financed with an issue of QZABs and one or more other funding sources, any disposition proceeds from that property are allocated to the issue under the principles of § 1.141-12(c)(3).
(9)
Payment of principal, interest or redemption price
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (h)(9)(ii) and (h)(9)(iii) of this section, the use of proceeds of a bond to pay principal, interest, or redemption price of the bond or another bond is not a qualified purpose within the meaning of section 1397E(d)(5).
(ii)
Exception for certain eligible reimbursements of interim refinancings.
The use of proceeds of a bond (the refinancing bond) to pay principal, interest, or redemption price of another bond (the prior bond) is a qualified purpose within the meaning of section 1397E(d)(5) to the extent that—
(A) The prior bond was not a QZAB (and, in the case of a series of refinancings, no earlier bond in the series was a QZAB);
(B) The proceeds of the prior bond (or the original bond in the case of a series of refinancings, as applicable) were spent for a qualified purpose under section 1397E(d)(5) with respect to a qualified zone academy (the original expenditure); and
(C) The issuer makes a valid reimbursement allocation to allocate the proceeds of the refinancing bond to the payment of the original expenditure (the reimbursement allocation), which allocation satisfies the requirements for reimbursements under paragraph (h)(10) of this section. For purposes of applying the rules for reimbursement, a refinancing bond which otherwise meets the requirements of this paragraph (h)(9)(ii) is eligible for reimbursement and is not treated as a disqualified refunding under § 1.150-2(g).
(iii)
Reissuance of a QZAB.
For purposes of determining whether the establishing of a defeasance escrow under paragraph (h)(8)(ii)(B)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section results in an exchange under § 1.1001-1(a), the QZAB is treated as a tax-exempt bond under § 1.1001-3(e)(5)(ii)(B)(
1
).
(10)
Reimbursement.
An expenditure for a qualified purpose may be reimbursed with proceeds of a QZAB. For this purpose, rules similar to those on reimbursement of expenditures in § 1.142-4(b) and § 1.150-2 shall apply. In applying these reimbursement rules, expenditures eligible for reimbursement under § 1.150-2(d)(3) shall be deemed to mean any expenditure for a qualified purpose under section 1397E(d)(5).
(i)
Arbitrage investment restrictions
—(1)
In general.
Under section 1397E(g) and this paragraph (i), and except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (i), the arbitrage investment restrictions and rebate requirements under section 148 and §§ 1.148-1 through 1.148-11, inclusive, and the exceptions to those restrictions, apply broadly to gross proceeds of QZABs issued under section 1397E to the same extent and in the same manner as they apply to gross proceeds of tax-exempt state or local governmental bonds. For this purpose, references in those sections to tax-exempt bonds generally shall be deemed to refer to QZABs and, to the extent
that any particular arbitrage restriction depends on whether bonds are private activity bonds under section 141, the determination of whether QZABs are private activity bonds shall be based on the general definition of private activity bonds under section 141. In applying section 148 and the regulations under that section to QZABs, the modifications set forth in paragraphs (i)(2) through (i)(6) of this section shall apply.
(2)
5-year temporary period exception to arbitrage yield restriction.
If an issue of QZABs meets the requirements of section 1397E(f)(1) and paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section, then the proceeds of the issue of QZABs are treated as qualifying for a 5-year temporary period exception to arbitrage yield restriction under § 1.148-2(e)(2) beginning on the issue date of the issue.
(3)
Disregard QZAB credit in QZAB yield for arbitrage purposes.
In determining the yield on an issue of QZABs for arbitrage purposes under § 1.148-4, the QZAB credit allowed under section 1397E(a) is disregarded.
(4)
Non-AMT tax-exempt bond investment exception inapplicable.
The exception to arbitrage yield restriction for investments of gross proceeds of tax-exempt bonds in specified tax-exempt bond investments not subject to section 148(b)(3)(B) (relating to an exception to the definition of “investment property” for specified tax-exempt bonds) and § 1.148-2(d)(2)(v) (relating to a corresponding exception to arbitrage yield limitations) is inapplicable.
(5)
Application of small issuer exception to the arbitrage rebate requirement.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (i)(6) of this section, for purposes of the small issuer exception to the arbitrage rebate requirement under section 148(f)(4)(D) and § 1.148-8, QZABs that are actually issued or reasonably expected to be issued by the QZAB issuer (and applicable entities aggregated under section 148(f)(4)(D)) within a calendar year are taken into account in measuring the applicable size limitation.
(6)
Certain defeasance escrow earnings.
With respect to a defeasance escrow established in a remedial action for an issue of QZABs that meets the special rebate requirement under paragraph (h)(8)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section, the QZAB issuer is treated as ineligible for the small issuer exception to arbitrage rebate under section 148(f)(4)(D) and paragraph (i)(5) of this section and compliance with that special rebate requirement is treated as satisfying applicable arbitrage investment restrictions under section 148 for that defeasance escrow.
(j)
Information reporting requirement.
Under section 1397E(h) and this paragraph (j), issuers of QZABs are required to submit information reporting returns to the IRS similar to the information reporting returns required to be submitted to the IRS under section 149(e) for tax-exempt state or local governmental bonds at the same time and in the same manner as those reports are required to be submitted to the IRS on such forms as shall be prescribed by the Commissioner for such purpose.
(k)
State or local government
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 1397E(d)(1)(B), the term
State or local government
means a State or political subdivision as defined for purposes of section 103(c).
(2)
On behalf of issuer.
A qualified zone academy bond may be issued on behalf of a State or local government under rules similar to those for determining whether a bond issued on behalf of a State or political subdivision constitutes an obligation of that State or political subdivision for purposes of section 103.
(l)
Cross-references.
See section 171 and the regulations thereunder for rules relating to amortizable bond premium. See § 1.61-7(d) for the seller's treatment of a bond sold between interest payment dates (credit allowance dates) and § 1.61-7(c) for the buyer's treatment of a bond purchased between interest payment dates (credit allowance dates).

—(A)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (m), issuers and taxpayers may apply this section in whole, but not in part, to bonds issued under section 1397E that are sold before September 14, 2007.
(B)
Special rule for certain provisions.
For purposes of the permissive retroactive application rule in paragraph (m)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, paragraphs (h)(2), (h)(3), (h)(4), (i), and (j) of this section need not be applied to any bonds issued under section 1397E to which those provisions do not otherwise apply under the general effective date provisions for those provisions in paragraph (m)(2)(i) of this section.
(C)
Definition of proceeds.
Issuers and taxpayers may apply paragraph (h) of this section, without regard to the definition of proceeds in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, to bonds issued under section 1397E that are sold before September 14, 2007.
(D)
Bonds issued before July 1, 1999.
Paragraphs (b) and (h)(10) of this section may not be applied to bonds issued under section 1397E that are issued before July 1, 1999.

Except to the extent inconsistent with the successor statutory provisions for QZABs in sections 54A and 54E or applicable public administrative or regulatory guidance under those provisions and except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (m)(3), issuers and taxpayers may apply these regulations to QZABs issued under sections 54A and 54E that are sold after October 3, 2008. In the case of QZABs that are issued under sections 54A and 54E for which the issuer makes an irrevocable election under section 6431(f) to receive payments with respect to credits under section 6431, issuers and taxpayers may not apply the remedial action provisions under paragraph (h)(8) of this section.

The bankruptcy estate (estate) succeeds to and takes into account, beginning with its first taxable year, the debtor's unused passive activity loss and unused passive activity credit (determined as of the first day of the debtor's taxable year in which the case commences).
(d)
Transfers from estate to debtor
—(1)
Transfer not treated as taxable event.
If, before the termination of the estate, the estate transfers an interest in a passive activity or former passive activity to the debtor (other than by sale or exchange), the transfer is not treated as a disposition for purposes of any provision of the Internal Revenue Code
assigning tax consequences to a disposition. The transfers to which this rule applies include transfers from the estate to the debtor of property that is exempt under section 522 of title 11 of the United States Code and abandonments of estate property to the debtor under section 554(a) of such title.
(2)
Treatment of passive activity loss and credit.
If, before the termination of the estate, the estate transfers an interest in a passive activity or former passive activity to the debtor (other than by sale or exchange)—
(i) The estate must allocate to the transferred interest, in accordance with § 1.469-1(f)(4), part or all of the estate's unused passive activity loss and unused passive activity credit (determined as of the first day of the estate's taxable year in which the transfer occurs); and

This section applies to a case commencing before November 9, 1992, and terminating on or after that date if the debtor and the estate jointly elect its application in the manner prescribed in paragraph (f)(2)(v) of this section (the election). The caption “ELECTION PURSUANT TO § 1.1398-1” must be placed prominently on the first page of each of the debtor's returns that is affected by the election (other than returns for taxable years that begin after the termination of the estate) and on the first page of each of the estate's returns that is affected by the election. In the case of returns that are amended under paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, this requirement is satisfied by placing the caption on the amended return.

The debtor and the estate making the election must amend all returns (except to the extent they are for a year that is a closed year within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(D) of this section) they filed before the date of the election to the extent necessary to provide that no claim of a deduction or credit is inconsistent with the succession under this section to unused losses and credits. The Commissioner may revoke or limit the effect of the election if either the debtor or the estate fails to satisfy the requirement of this paragraph (f)(2)(iii).
(iv)
Rules relating to closed years
—(A) Estate succeeds to debtor's passive activity loss and credit as of the commencement date. If, by reason of an election under this paragraph (f), this section applies to a case that was commenced in a closed year, the estate, nevertheless, succeeds to and takes into account the unused passive activity loss and unused passive activity credit of the debtor (determined as of the first day of the debtor's taxable year in which the case commenced).
(B)
No reduction of unused passive activity loss and credit for passive activity loss and credit not claimed for a closed year.
In determining a taxpayer's carryover of a passive activity loss or credit to its taxable year following a closed year, a deduction or credit that the taxpayer failed to claim in the closed year, if attributable to an unused passive activity loss or credit to which the taxpayer succeeded under this section, is treated as a deduction or credit that was disallowed under section 469.
(C)
Passive activity loss and credit to which taxpayer succeeds reflects deductions of prior holder in a closed year.
A loss or credit to which a taxpayer would otherwise succeed under this section is reduced to the extent the
loss or credit was allowed to its prior holder for a closed year.
(D)

(b)
Definition and rules of general application.
For purposes of this section—
(1)
Section 465 activity
means an activity to which section 465 applies; and
(2) For each section 465 activity, the unused section 465 loss from the activity (determined as of the first day of a taxable year) is the loss (as defined in section 465(d)) that is not allowed under section 465(a)(1) for the previous taxable year.
(c)
Estate succeeds to losses upon commencement of case.
The bankruptcy estate (the estate) succeeds to and takes into account, beginning with its first taxable year, the debtor's unused section 465 losses (determined as of the first day of the debtor's taxable year in which the case commences).
(d)
Transfers from estate to debtor
—(1)
Transfer not treated as taxable event.
If, before the termination of the estate, the estate transfers an interest in a section 465 activity to the debtor (other than by sale or exchange), the transfer is not treated as a disposition for purposes of any provision of the Internal Revenue Code assigning tax consequences to a disposition. The transfers to which this rule applies include transfers from the estate to the debtor of property that is exempt under section 522 of title 11 of the United States Code and abandonments of estate property to the debtor under section 554(a) of such title.
(2)
Treatment of section 465 losses.
If, before the termination of the estate, the estate transfers an interest in a section 465 activity to the debtor (other than by sale or exchange) the debtor succeeds to and takes into account, beginning with the debtor's taxable year in which the transfer occurs, the transferred interest's share of the estate's unused section 465 loss from the activity (determined as of the first day of the estate's taxable year in which the transfer occurs). For this purpose, the transferred interest's share of such loss is the amount, if any, by which such loss would be reduced if the transfer had occurred as of the close of the preceding taxable year of the estate and been treated as a disposition on which gain or loss is recognized.
(e)
Debtor succeeds to losses of the estate upon its termination.
Upon termination of the estate, the debtor succeeds to and takes into account, beginning with the debtor's taxable year in which the termination occurs, the losses not allowed under section 465 for the estate's last taxable year.

In the case of returns that are amended under paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, this requirement is satisfied by placing the caption on the amended return.
(ii)
Scope of election.
This election applies to the section 465 activities and unused losses from section 465 activities of the taxpayers making the election.
(iii)
Amendment of previously filed returns.
The debtor and the estate making the election must amend all returns (except to the extent they are for a year that is a closed year within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(D) of this section) they filed before the date of the election to the extent necessary to provide that no claim of a deduction is inconsistent with the succession under this section to unused losses from section 465 activities. The Commissioner may revoke or limit the effect of the election if either the debtor or the estate fails to satisfy the requirement of this paragraph (f)(2)(iii).
(iv)
Rules relating to closed years

(6)

§ 1.1400Z2(a)-1
Deferring tax on capital gains by investing in opportunity zones.
(a)
Deferring tax on capital gains
—(1)
Overview.
Under section 1400Z-2(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations (as defined in paragraph (b)(41) of this section), an eligible taxpayer may elect to defer recognition of some or all of one or more eligible gains that otherwise would be recognized by the eligible taxpayer in the taxable year to the extent that the eligible taxpayer timely acquires a qualifying investment in a qualified opportunity fund (QOF) within the meaning of section 1400Z-2(d)(1) and § 1.1400Z2(d)-1. Paragraph (a)(2) of this section describes how a taxpayer elects to defer gain. Paragraph (b) of this section defines terms used in the section 1400Z-2 regulations. Paragraph (c) of this section provides operational rules for applying section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations, including special rules regarding the election to defer gain under section 1400Z-2(a) and this section when an eligible taxpayer that is a partnership, S corporation, trust, or decedent's estate recognizes an eligible gain in a taxable year. Paragraph (d) of this section provides the manner in which a deferral election under section 1400Z-2(a) must be made. Paragraph (e) of this section provides the treatment of section 1400Z-2 for purposes of § 1.897-6T. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules for mixed-funds investments. Paragraph (g) of this section provides dates of applicability. See §§ 1.1502-14Z and 1.1504-3 for special rules applicable to consolidated groups that invest in QOFs.
(2)
Procedure for deferring gain.
A taxpayer defers gain, in whole or in part, by making an election on its Federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the gain would be included if not deferred. The election must be made in the manner prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin or in forms and instructions (see §§ 601.601(d)(2) and 601.602 of this chapter).
(b)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations:
(1)
30-month substantial improvement period.
The term
30-month substantial improvement period
means any 30-month period, beginning after the date of acquisition of tangible property, in which additions to the basis of the tangible property in the hands of the QOF or qualified opportunity zone business (see § 1.1400Z2(d)-2(b)(4)) exceed an amount equal to the adjusted basis of such property at the beginning of the 30-month period in the hands of the QOF or qualified opportunity zone business.
(2)
70-percent tangible property standard.
The term
70-percent tangible property standard
means the requirement in section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(i) that a qualified opportunity zone business must satisfy with respect to qualified opportunity zone business property (see § 1.1400Z2(d)-2) that the qualified opportunity zone business holds, whether the qualified opportunity zone business
property is owned by the qualified opportunity zone business or leased by the qualified opportunity zone business from another person.
(3)
70-percent use test.
The term
70-percent use test
means the test described in § 1.1400Z2(d)-2(d)(4)(ii) that is used to determine if a QOF or qualified opportunity zone business satisfies the requirement in sections 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i)(III) and 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(i) that substantially all of the use of tangible property was in a qualified opportunity zone.
(4)
90-percent investment standard.
The term
90-percent investment standard
means the requirement provided in section 1400Z-2(d)(1) that a QOF must hold at least 90 percent of its assets in qualified opportunity zone property, as defined in section 1400Z-2(d)(2) and § 1.1400Z2(d)-1(c)(1), determined by the average of the percentage of qualified opportunity zone property held by the QOF as measured on the last day of the first six-month period and on the last day of the taxable year of the QOF.
(5)
90-percent qualified opportunity zone property holding period.
The term
90-percent qualified opportunity zone property holding period
means the minimum portion of a QOF's holding period in stock of a corporation or interests in a partnership, during which the corporation or partnership qualifies as a qualified opportunity zone business in order for the stock or the partnership interests to meet the substantially all requirement under section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(B)(i)(III) to be treated as qualified opportunity zone stock or the substantially all requirement under section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(C)(iii) to be treated as qualified opportunity zone partnership interests, as applicable, held by the QOF.
(6)
90-percent qualified opportunity zone business property holding period.
The term
90-percent qualified opportunity zone business property holding period
means the minimum portion of a QOF's or qualified opportunity zone business's holding period in tangible property during which the 70-percent use test with respect to the tangible property must be satisfied, in order for the tangible property to meet the requirement under section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i)(III) to be treated as qualified opportunity zone business property held by the QOF or qualified opportunity zone business.
(7)
180-day period
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided elsewhere in this section, the term
180-day period
means the 180-day period referred to in section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(A) with respect to any eligible gain meeting the requirements of paragraph (b)(11) of this section that begins on the day on which the gain would be recognized for Federal income tax purposes if the eligible taxpayer did not elect under section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations to defer recognition of that gain.
(ii)
180-day period for RIC and REIT capital gain dividends
—(A)
General rule.
Unless the shareholder of a regulated investment company (RIC) or real estate investment trust (REIT) chooses to apply paragraph (b)(7)(ii)(B) of this section, the 180-day period for a RIC or REIT capital gain dividend begins on the last day of the shareholder's taxable year in which the capital gain dividend would otherwise be recognized by the shareholder.
(B)
Elective rule.
Notwithstanding the general rule in paragraph (b)(7)(ii)(A) of this section, a shareholder of a RIC or REIT may choose to treat the 180-day period with respect to a capital gain dividend that the shareholder receives from the RIC or REIT as beginning on the date of the dividend distribution; provided, however, that the aggregate amount of the shareholder's eligible gain with respect to capital gain dividends from the RIC or REIT is limited to the aggregate amount of capital gain dividends reported for that shareholder by the RIC for that shareholder's taxable year or designated for that shareholder by the REIT for that shareholder's taxable year.
(C)
Undistributed capital gains.
If section 852(b)(3)(D) or 857(b)(3)(C) (concerning undistributed capital gains) requires the holder of shares in a RIC or REIT to include an amount in the shareholder's long-term capital gains, the rule in paragraph (b)(7)(ii)(B) of this section does not apply to that amount. The 180-day period with respect to the included undistributed capital gain begins, at the shareholder's election, on either the last day of the RIC or REIT's taxable year or
the last day of the shareholder's taxable year in which the amount would otherwise be recognized as long-term capital gains by the shareholder.
(iii)
180-day period for partners, S corporation shareholders, and owners of other passthrough entities.
See paragraph (c)(8) and (9) of this section for rules relating to the determination of the 180-day period for partners, S corporation shareholders, or beneficiaries of a trust or decedent's estate in cases in which a partnership, S corporation, trust, or decedent's estate is not an eligible taxpayer with respect to an eligible gain, or does not make a deferral election with respect to an eligible gain.
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of paragraph (b)(7)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(A)
Example 1. Regular-way trades of stock.
Individual A sells stock at a gain in a regular-way trade on an exchange (that is, in a transaction in which a trade order is placed on the trade date, and settlement of the transaction, including payment and delivery of the stock, occurs a standardized number of days after the trade date). The 180-day period with respect to A's gain on the stock begins on the trade date.
(B)
Example 2. Capital gain dividends received by a REIT shareholder.
REIT and Shareholder are calendar year taxpayers. REIT distributes a dividend to Shareholder on March 1, Year 1. REIT designates the March 1 dividend as a capital gain dividend before 30 days after the close of Year 1. Shareholder's 180-day period with respect to that capital gain dividend begins on December 31, Year 1. However, Shareholder may choose to begin the 180-day period on March 1, Year 1. If so, an equity interest in a QOF received by Shareholder in exchange for an investment of an amount corresponding to that capital gain dividend may be a qualifying investment to the extent that Shareholder's aggregate elected deferrals of dividends from REIT for Year 1 do not exceed Shareholder's aggregate capital gain dividends from REIT for the taxable year.
(C)
Example 3. Multiple capital gain dividends received by a RIC shareholder.
RIC is a calendar year taxpayer. RIC distributes a dividend of $100 to Shareholder, a calendar year taxpayer, on March 1, Year 1 and distributes another dividend of $50 to Shareholder on June 1, Year 1. RIC reports both the March 1 and June 1 dividends as capital gain dividends on Shareholder's Form 1099-DIV for Year 1. Shareholder's 180-day period with respect to both capital gain dividends begins on December 31, Year 1. However, Shareholder may choose to begin the 180-day period for the $100 RIC capital gain dividend on March 1, Year 1, and may choose to begin the 180-day period for the $50 RIC capital gain dividend on June 1, Year 1. Thus, if Shareholder makes a single investment of $200 in a QOF in exchange for an eligible interest (as defined in paragraph (b)(12) of this section) on July 1, Year 1, absent any other eligible gain, Shareholder may treat $150 of the eligible interest as a qualifying investment in the QOF (that is, the amount that corresponds to the aggregate amount of the RIC capital gain dividends in Year 1) and $50 of the eligible interest as a non-qualifying investment therein.
(D)
Example 4. Additional deferral of previously deferred gains
—(
1
)
Facts.
Taxpayer A invested in a QOF and properly elected to defer realized gain. On March 15, 2025, A disposes of its entire investment in the QOF in a transaction that, under sections 1400Z-2(a)(1)(B) and (b), triggers an inclusion of gain in A's gross income. Section 1400Z-2(b) determines the date and amount of the gain included in A's income. That date is March 15, 2025, the date on which A disposed of its entire interest in the QOF. A wants to make a deferral election with respect to A's gain from the disposal of the QOF investment.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section, the 180-day period for making another investment in a QOF begins on the day on which section 1400Z-2(b) requires the prior gain to be included. As prescribed by section 1400Z-2(b)(1)(A), that is March 15, 2025, the date of the inclusion-triggering disposition. Thus, in order to make a deferral election under section 1400Z-2, A must invest the amount of the inclusion in the original QOF or in another QOF during the 180-day period beginning on March 15, 2025, the date when A disposed of its entire investment in the QOF.
(8)
Boot.
The term
boot
means money or other property that section 354 or 355 does not permit to be received without the recognition of gain.
(9)
Consolidated group.
The term
consolidated group
has the meaning provided in § 1.1502-1(h).
(10)
Deferral election.
The term
deferral election
means an election under section 1400Z-2(a) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations made before January 1, 2027, with respect to an eligible gain.
(11)
Eligible gain
—(i)
In general.
An amount of gain is an
eligible gain,
and thus is eligible for deferral under section 1400Z-2(a) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations, if the gain—
(A) Is treated as a capital gain for Federal income tax purposes or is a
qualified 1231 gain within the meaning of paragraph (b)(11)(iii)(A) of this section, determined by—
(
1
) Not taking into account any losses unless otherwise specified in the section 1400Z-2 regulations; and
(
2
) Taking into account any other provision of the Code that requires the character of potential capital gain to be recharacterized or redetermined as ordinary income, as defined in section 64, for purposes of the Code;
(B) Would be recognized for Federal income tax purposes and subject to tax under subtitle A of the Code before January 1, 2027 (subject to Federal income tax), if section 1400Z-2(a)(1) did not apply to defer recognition of the gain; and
(C) Does not arise from a sale or exchange of property with a person that, within the meaning of section 1400Z-2(e)(2), is related to—
(
1
) The eligible taxpayer that would recognize the gain in the taxable year in which the sale or exchange occurs if section 1400Z-2(a)(1) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations did not apply to defer recognition of the gain; or
(
2
) Any passthrough entity or other person recognizing and allocating the gain to the eligible taxpayer described in paragraph (b)(11)(i)(C)(
1
) of this section.
(ii)
Portion of eligible gain not already subject to a deferral election.
In the case of an eligible taxpayer who has made an election under section 1400Z-2(a) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations regarding some but not all of an eligible gain, the portion of that eligible gain with respect to which no election under section 1400Z-2(a) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations has been made remains an eligible gain for which a deferral election may be made.
(iii)
Qualified 1231 gains
—(A)
Definition.
A section 1231 gain (as defined in section 1231(a)(3)(A)) recognized on the sale or exchange of property defined in section 1231(b) (1231(b) property) is a
qualified 1231 gain
to the extent that it exceeds any amount with respect to the 1231(b) property that is treated as ordinary income under section 1245 or section 1250.
(B)
180-day period.
For the applicable 180-day period with respect to a qualified 1231 gain, see paragraph (b)(7) of this section.
(C)
Attributes of included income when deferral ends.
For the Federal income tax treatment of the later inclusion of a qualified 1231 gain deferred under section 1400Z-2(a)(1) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations, see paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(iv)
Gain arising from an inclusion event
—(A)
In general.
Gain that is otherwise required to be included in gross income under § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(e)(1), whether from the disposition of an entire interest in a QOF or a disposition of a partial interest, may be eligible for deferral under section 1400Z-2(a)(1), provided that all of the requirements to elect to defer gain under section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(A) are met. For purposes of determining whether such gain is eligible gain under section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(A) and this paragraph (b)(11)(iv)(A), the eligible taxpayer should treat such inclusion gain as if it was originally realized upon the occurrence of the inclusion event rather than on the sale or exchange that gave rise to the eligible gain to which the inclusion event relates.
(B)
180-day period.
The 180-day period for investing gain from an inclusion event begins on the date of the inclusion event.
(C)
Holding period.
The holding period for a qualifying investment attributable to eligible gain arising from an inclusion event begins on the date that the gain is reinvested in a QOF.
(v)
No deferral for gain realized upon the acquisition of an eligible interest.
Gain is not eligible for deferral under section 1400Z-2(a)(1) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations if such gain is realized upon the contribution, exchange, or other transfer of property to a QOF in exchange for an eligible interest (see paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C) of this section) or the transfer of property to an eligible taxpayer in exchange for an eligible interest (see paragraph (c)(6)(iv) of this section).
(vi)
Gain from section 1256 contracts and from positions in a straddle
—(A)
General rule.
Except as otherwise explicitly provided in paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(B), (C), or (D) of this section, eligible gain for a taxable year does not include—
(
1
) Gain from a section 1256 contract as defined in section 1256(b);
(
2
) Gain from a position that was part of a straddle as defined in section 1092 (straddle) during the taxable year; or
(
3
) Gain from a position that was part of a straddle in a previous taxable year if, under section 1092(a)(1)(B), a loss from any position in that straddle is treated as sustained, subject to the limitations of section 1092(a)(1)(A), during the taxable year.
(B)
Exception for net gain from certain section 1256 contracts.
Paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(A)(
1
) of this section does not apply to the net gain during the taxable year from section 1256 contracts that were not part of a straddle at any time during the taxable year (qualified section 1256 contracts). For purposes of this paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(B), the net gain during the taxable year from qualified section 1256 contracts is determined by taking into account all capital gains and losses from such contracts for the taxable year that are recognized for Federal income tax purposes, determined without regard to section 1400Z-2(a)(1). The 180-day period with respect to any eligible gain described in this paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(B) begins on the last day of the taxable year, and the character of that gain when it is later included under sections 1400Z-2(a)(1)(B) and 1400Z-2(b) is determined under the general rule in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If, under section 1256(a)(4), section 1092 does not apply to a straddle, such straddle is not treated as a straddle for purposes of this paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(B).
(C)
Exception for net gain from certain identified straddles
—(
1
) Paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(A) of this section does not apply to the net gain during the taxable year from positions in a straddle if—
(
i
) During the taxable year, the positions were part of an identified straddle under section 1092(a)(2), part of an identified mixed straddle under § 1.1092(b)-3T (and, as applicable, § 1.1092(b)-6), part of an identified straddle under section 1256(d), or included in a mixed straddle account under § 1.1092(b)-4T;
(
ii
) All gains and losses with respect to the positions that were part of such straddle or included in such mixed straddle account are recognized by the end of the taxable year (other than gain that would be recognized but for deferral under section 1400Z-2(a)(1));
(
iii
) None of the positions in such straddle or mixed straddle account were part of a straddle during the taxable year, other than a straddle described in paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(C)(
1
)(
i
) and (
ii
) of this section; and
(
iv
) None of the positions in such straddle or mixed straddle account were part of a straddle in a previous taxable year if, under section 1092(a)(1)(B), a loss from any position in such straddle is treated as sustained, subject to the limitations of section 1092(a)(1)(A), during the taxable year.
(
2
) For purposes of paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(C)(
1
) of this section, net gain during the taxable year from an identified straddle or mixed straddle account described in paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(C)(
1
)(
i
) through (
iv
) of this section is equal to the excess of the capital gains recognized in the taxable year for Federal income tax purposes, determined without regard to section 1400Z-2(a)(1), from all of the positions that were part of that straddle over the sum of the capital losses and net ordinary loss (if any) from all of the positions that were part of that straddle. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(C)(
2
), capital gains and losses from an identified straddle or mixed straddle account include capital gains and losses from section 1256 contracts and other positions marked to market either upon termination or on the last business day of the taxable year, as well as annual account net gain from positions in a mixed straddle account covered by § 1.1092(b)-4T. In addition, for purposes of this paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(C)(
2
),
net ordinary loss
means the excess of ordinary losses over ordinary gains.
(
3
) If a straddle is an identified straddle described in section 1092(a)(2), the basis adjustment provisions described in sections 1092(a)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii) must be applied in determining the net gain during the taxable year from positions that were part of that straddle.
(
4
) The 180-day period with respect to any eligible gain described in paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(C)(
2
) of this section begins on the earlier of the date when all of the positions that are, or have been, part of the straddle are disposed of (or otherwise terminated) or the last day of the taxable year.
(
5
) If net gain described in paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(C)(
2
) of this section is deferred under section 1400Z-2(a)(1), that gain is not treated as unrecognized gain for purposes of section 1092(a)(3)(A)(ii).
(D)
Additional exceptions to the general rule.
Additional exceptions to the general rule in paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(A) of this section may be prescribed in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
(E)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules described in paragraph (b)(11)(vi) of this section. All of the examples assume that Taxpayer holds the positions described as capital assets and that Taxpayer holds no offsetting positions other than those described in the examples.
(
1
)
Example 1.
Taxpayer owns 100 shares of publicly traded Company X common stock and acquires put options on 100 shares of Company X common stock during the taxable year. Taxpayer does not make any straddle identifications under section 1092. During the taxable year, Taxpayer sells all 100 shares of its Company X common stock and has a $40 capital gain. During the taxable year, Taxpayer also closes out all of its put options on Company X common stock and has a $30 capital loss. That $40 of capital gain is from a position that was part of a straddle during the taxable year because the position in Company X common stock and the position in put options on Company X stock are offsetting positions as defined in section 1092(c). Under paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(A) of this section, none of Taxpayer's $40 of capital gain is eligible gain.
(
2
)
Example 2.
Taxpayer's taxable year is the calendar year. Taxpayer owns 100 shares of publicly traded Company Y common stock and has a basis in each share of $10.00. Taxpayer also owns put options on 100 shares of Company Y common stock. Taxpayer makes a valid and timely identification under section 1092(a)(2) of the 100 shares of Company Y common stock and the put options on the 100 shares of Company Y common stock. On January 10, Year 1, Taxpayer closes out all of the put options and has a $30.00 capital loss. On March 10, Year 1, Taxpayer sells 40 shares of the Company Y common stock for $11.00 per share. At the end of Year 1, the fair market value of each of the 60 remaining shares of Company Y common stock held by Taxpayer is $10.50. Under section 1092(a)(2)(A)(ii), when the put options are closed out at a loss of $30.00, the basis of each of Taxpayer's shares of Company Y common stock is increased by $0.30 ($30.00/100). Thus, Taxpayer has a gain of $28.00 ((40 * $11.00)−(40 * $10.30)) on the sale of the 40 shares of Company Y common stock. Paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(A) of this section applies to all of Taxpayer's gain during the taxable year from the straddle. Because Taxpayer has unrecognized gain from the straddle at the end of the taxable year, paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(C) of this section does not shield any of Taxpayer's gain from that result. The $28 of gain is thus not eligible gain. Taxpayer must recognize and include in taxable income for the taxable year the $28.00 capital gain. Under section 1092(a)(2)(A)(iv), Taxpayer may not deduct the $30.00 loss from the put options.

Example 3.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(E)(
2
) of this section (
Example 2
), except Taxpayer sells the 100 shares of Company Y common stock on March 10, Year 1, for $11.50 per share. Under section 1092(a)(2)(A)(ii), as in paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(E)(
2
) of this section (
Example 2
), when the put options are closed out at a loss of $30.00, the basis of each of Taxpayer's shares of Company Y common stock is increased by $0.30 ($30.00/100). Taxpayer has a gain of $120.00 ((100 * $11.50)−(100 * $10.30)) on the sale of the 100 shares of Company Y common stock. Taxpayer has net gain during the taxable year from the identified straddle of $120.00. Under paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(C) of this section, paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(A) of this section does not apply to prevent the $120.00 net gain
from being eligible gain. As in paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(E)(
2
) of this section (
Example 2
), under section 1092(a)(2)(A)(iv), Taxpayer may not deduct the $30.00 loss from the put options.
(

)
Example 4.
Taxpayer's taxable year is the calendar year. Taxpayer owns 100 shares of publicly traded Company Z common stock and has a basis in each share of $10. Taxpayer also owns put options on 100 shares of Company Z common stock. In Year 1, Taxpayer closes out the put options at a $100 loss. At the end of Year 1, the fair market value of each of the shares of Company Z common stock held by Taxpayer is $15 and, under section 1092(a)(3), Taxpayer has $500 of unrecognized gain. Because Taxpayer's unrecognized gain on the Company Z common stock at the end of Year 1 exceeds Taxpayer's loss on the put options, Taxpayer's loss is deferred under section 1092(a)(1). During Year 2, Taxpayer sells 40 shares of Company Z common stock for $14 per share. Taxpayer has a gain of $160 ((40 * $14)−(40 * $10)) on the sale of the 40 shares of Company Z common stock. Under paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(A) of this section, because Taxpayer's Company Z common stock was part of a straddle in a previous taxable year and a loss from a position in that straddle was deferred under section 1092(a) at the end of Year 1, the preceding taxable year, Taxpayer's $160 Year 2 gain on the sale of the Company Z common stock is not eligible gain. At the end of Year 2, the fair market value of each of the 60 remaining shares of Company Z common stock held by Taxpayer is $10 and Taxpayer has no unrecognized gain on its Company Z common stock. Under section 1092(a)(1)(B), Taxpayer's $100 loss from Year 1 is treated as sustained in Year 2. Because Taxpayer has no unrecognized gain on its Company Z common stock at the end of Year 2, Taxpayer may deduct the $100 loss in Year 2. In Year 3, Taxpayer sells the remaining 60 shares of Company Z common stock for $50 per share. Taxpayer has a gain of $2,400 ((60 * $50)−(60 * $10)) on the sale of the 60 shares of Company Z common stock. Because there was no loss from the straddle deferred under section 1092(a) at the end of Year 2, paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(A) of this section does not apply to prevent the $2,400 of Year 3 net gain from being eligible gain.

)
Example 5.
Taxpayer's taxable year is the calendar year. On October 5, Year 1, Taxpayer buys 100 shares of publicly traded Exchange Traded Fund A (ETF A) and acquires offsetting section 1256 contracts on the index that underlies the ETF A shares. Taxpayer makes a valid and timely identification of all 100 ETF A shares and the offsetting section 1256 contracts under § 1.1092(b)-3T. On December 31, Year 1, the fair market value of the ETF A shares has increased by $500, and the fair market value of the section 1256 contracts has decreased by $450. On December 31, Year 1, Taxpayer sells the ETF shares for a $500 gain. In addition, under section 1256(a)(1), the section 1256 contracts are treated as sold for fair market value on December 31, Year 1, for a $450 loss. Pursuant to § 1.1092(b)-3T(b)(4), Taxpayer has a net short term capital gain from the identified mixed straddle of $50 ($500-$450). Under paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(C) of this section, paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(A) of this section does not apply to prevent the $50 of net short term capital gain from being eligible gain.
(vii) [Reserved]
(viii)
Eligible installment sale gains
—(A)
In general.
The term
eligible gain
includes gains described in this paragraph (b)(11) that would be recognized by an eligible taxpayer under the installment method pursuant to section 453 and with §§ 1.453-1 through 1.453-12 for a taxable year, provided such gain otherwise meets the requirements of this paragraph (b)(11). This includes gains recognized under the installment method under section 453 from an installment sale that occurred before December 22, 2017.
(B)
180-day period for gain from installment sales.
For gains reported on the installment method, an eligible taxpayer may treat the date the payment on the installment sale is received or the last day of the taxable year in which the eligible taxpayer would have recognized the gain under the installment method as the beginning of the 180-day period described in paragraph
(b)(7) of this section. Thus, if an eligible taxpayer receives one or more payments on an installment sale and treats the date the payment on the installment sale is received as the beginning of the 180-day period, each payment will begin a new 180-day period.
(ix)
Additional rules for determining if gain is subject to Federal income tax
—(A)
Application of a treaty
—(
1
)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(11)(i)(B) of this section, whether gain would be subject to Federal income tax is determined after application of any treaty exemption provision that an eligible taxpayer elects to apply under any applicable U.S. income tax convention.
(
2
)
Treaty waiver.
An eligible taxpayer who is not a United States person within the meaning of section 7701(a)(30) (or an eligible taxpayer who is a United States person within the meaning of section 7701(a)(30) but who is treated as a resident of another country under an applicable U.S. income tax convention) may not make an election to defer gain pursuant to section 1400Z-2(a) after the applicability date of this section (see paragraph (g) of this section) unless such eligible taxpayer irrevocably waives, in accordance with forms and instructions (see § 601.602 of this chapter), any treaty benefits that would exempt such gain from being subject to Federal income tax at the time of inclusion pursuant to an applicable U.S. income tax convention. In the event that such forms and instructions that include such waiver have not yet been published when an election pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section is required to be made, such an eligible taxpayer must attach a written statement, signed under penalties of perjury, to any forms on which an election is made pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, which states “With respect to gain deferred pursuant to an election under section 1400Z-2(a), the below signed taxpayer irrevocably waives any treaty benefits that would exempt such gain from being subject to Federal income tax at the time of inclusion pursuant to an applicable U.S. income tax convention.” If such an eligible taxpayer chooses to apply the section 1400Z-2 regulations in a consistent manner for all taxable years (see paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section), the taxpayer must include the signed statement required under this paragraph (b)(11)(ix)(A)(
2
) with the first annual report described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section that is required to be filed on a date that is after March 13, 2020. An eligible taxpayer not described in the first sentence of this paragraph (b)(11)(ix)(A)(
2
) will only be required to make the waiver described in this paragraph (b)(11)(ix)(A)(
2
) if and to the extent required in forms and instructions (see § 601.602 of this chapter).
(
3
)
Non-application to certain entities.
This paragraph (b)(11)(ix)(A) does not apply to an entity described in paragraph (b)(11)(ix)(B) of this section.
(B)
Gain of a partnership.
Subject to § 1.1400Z2(f)-1(c), with respect to a partnership, the requirement in paragraph (b)(11)(i)(B) of this section that a gain be subject to Federal income tax does not apply to an otherwise eligible gain of the partnership, provided the partnership acquires the eligible interest with respect to such gain. See § 1.1400Z2(f)-1(c)(3)(i) and (ii),
Examples 1 and 2,
for illustrations of the application of § 1.1400Z2(f)-1(c) (providing an anti-abuse rule) to a partnership.
(12)
Eligible interest
—(i)
In general.

(ii)
Use as collateral permitted.
Provided that the eligible taxpayer is the owner of the equity interest in the QOF for Federal income tax purposes, status as an eligible interest is not impaired by using the interest as collateral for a loan, whether as part of a purchase-money borrowing or otherwise.
(iii)
Deemed contributions not creating mixed-funds investment.
See paragraph (f)(2) of this section for rules regarding deemed contributions of money to a partnership pursuant to section 752(a).
(13)
Eligible taxpayer.
An
eligible taxpayer

(c)
Operational and special rules
—(1)
Attributes of gains included in income under section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(B).
If section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(B), section 1400Z-2(b), and the section 1400Z-2 regulations require a taxpayer to include in income some or all of a previously deferred gain, the rules of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section apply with respect to such gain.
(i)
Deferral year attributes.
The gain so included per paragraph (c)(1) of this section has the same attributes in the taxable year of inclusion that the gain would have had if recognition of the gain had not been deferred under section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(A). These attributes include those taken into account by sections 1(h), 1222, 1231(b), 1256, and any other applicable provisions of the Code.
(ii)
Inclusion year treatment.
The gain so included per paragraph (c)(1) of this section is subject to the same Federal income tax provisions and rates that would apply to any other gains that are realized and recognized at the same time as the included gain and that have the same attributes as the deferred gain. For example, when a deferred qualified 1231 gain, as defined in paragraph (b)(11)(iii) of this section, is required to be included in income, the included section 1231 gain is treated as if it were a section 1231 gain (within the meaning of section 1231(a)(3)(A)) that was recognized on the date of inclusion.
(iii)
Rules for associating included gain with deferred gains
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, a taxpayer determines
which previously deferred gain is associated with a qualifying investment in accordance with guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin or in forms and instructions (see §§ 601.601(d)(2) and 601.602 of this chapter). The rules of paragraphs (c)(1)(iii)(B) and (C) of this section apply only to the extent a deferred gain is not clearly associated with a particular qualifying investment under this paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A).
(B)
Only one eligible gain associated with a deferral election.
If only one eligible gain could have been deferred with respect to a qualifying investment, that deferred gain is associated with that qualifying investment. For example, if an eligible taxpayer makes a deferral election with respect to an investment in a QOF and only one eligible gain of the taxpayer satisfies the 180-day period with respect to the investment in the QOF, that eligible gain is the gain deferred with respect to the qualifying investment for purposes of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(C)
Multiple eligible gains associated with a deferral election
—(
1
)
In general.
If more than one eligible gain may have been deferred with respect to an investment in a QOF for which a deferral election has been made, then for purposes of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, the eligible taxpayer is treated as making the investment in the QOF first with respect to the earliest realized eligible gain, followed by the next earliest eligible gain and any other eligible gains in order of the date of their realization.
(
2
)
Rule for gains realized on the same day.
If in the application of paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(C)(
1
) of this section, two eligible gains are realized on the same day, such gains are allocated to the investment in the QOF proportionately.
(2)
Identification of which interest in a QOF corporation has been disposed of
—(i)
Need for identification.
If a taxpayer holds shares of QOF stock with identical rights (
fungible interests
), and if the taxpayer disposes of less than all of the fungible interests, it is necessary to identify which interest or interests were disposed of. A taxpayer may effect this identification in accordance with the rules and principles of § 1.1012-1(c). Consistent with § 1.1012-1(c), if a taxpayer does not adequately identify which of the fungible interests are disposed of, the first-in, first-out identification method (
FIFO method
) applies.
(ii)
Consequences of identification.
The identification determines—
(A) Whether an investment disposed of is a qualifying investment or a non-qualifying investment; and
(B) In the case of qualifying investments—
(
1
) The attributes of the gain addressed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and
(
2
) The extent, if any, of an increase under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B) in the basis of an investment interest that is disposed of.
(3)
Pro-rata method.
If, after application of the FIFO method, a taxpayer is treated as having disposed of less than all of the investment interests that the taxpayer acquired on one day, and if the interests acquired on that day vary with respect to the characteristics described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, then a proportionate allocation must be made to determine which interests were disposed of (
pro-rata method
).
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (c)(1) through (3) of this section.
(i)
Example 1. Short-term gain.
For 2018, taxpayer B properly made an election under section 1400Z-2 to defer $100 of eligible gain that, if not deferred, would have been recognized as short-term capital gain, as defined in section 1222(1). In 2022, sections 1400Z-2(a)(1)(B) and (b) require taxpayer B to include the gain in gross income. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the gain included in 2022 is short-term capital gain.
(ii)
Example 2. Collectibles gain.
For 2018, taxpayer C properly made an election under section 1400Z-2 to defer a gain that, if not deferred, would have been collectibles gain as defined in section 1(h)(5). In a later taxable year, section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(B) and (b) requires some or all of that deferred gain to be included in gross income. The gain included is collectibles gain.
(iii)
Example 3. Net capital gain from section 1256 contracts.
For 2019, taxpayer D had $100 of net capital gain realized
from section 1256 contracts that is eligible gain under paragraph (b)(11)(vi)(B) of this section. D timely invested $100 in a QOF and properly made an election under section 1400Z-2 to defer that $100 of gain. In 2023, section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(B) and (b) requires D to include that deferred gain in gross income. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the character of the inclusion is governed by section 1256(a)(3), which requires a 40:60 split between short-term and long-term capital gain. Accordingly, $40 of the inclusion is short-term capital gain and $60 of the inclusion is long-term capital gain.
(iv)
Example 4. FIFO method.
For 2018, taxpayer E properly made an election under section 1400Z-2 to defer $300 of short-term capital gain. For 2020, E properly made a second election under section 1400Z-2 to defer $200 of long-term capital gain. In both cases, E properly invested in QOF corporation Q the amount of the gain to be deferred, resulting in a total investment in Q of $500. The two investments are fungible interests and the price of the interests was the same at the time of the two investments. E did not purchase any additional interest in Q or sell any of its interest in Q until 2024, when E sold for a gain 60 percent of its interest in Q. E did not adequately identify which investment in QOF Q E sold. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, E must apply the FIFO method to identify which investments in Q that E disposed of. 60 percent of E's total investment in Q is $300 (60% × $500), thus under the FIFO method, E sold its entire 2018 initial investment of $300 in Q. Under section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(B) and (b), the sale triggered an inclusion of deferred gain. Because the inclusion has the same character as the gain that had been deferred, the inclusion is short-term capital gain.
(v)
Example 5. FIFO method.
In 2018, before Corporation R became a QOF, Taxpayer F invested $100 to R in exchange for 100 R common shares. Later in 2018, after R was a QOF, F invested $500 to R in exchange for 400 R common shares and properly elected under section 1400Z-2 to defer $500 of realized short-term capital gain from a separate investment. Even later in 2018, on different days, F realized $300 of short-term capital gain and $700 of long-term capital gain. On a single day that fell during the 180-day period for both of those gains, F invested $1,000 in R in exchange for 800 R common shares and properly elected under section 1400Z-2 to defer the two gains. In 2020, F sold 100 R common shares. F did not adequately identify which investment in R F sold. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, F must apply the FIFO method to identify which investments in R F disposed of. As determined by that identification, F sold the initially acquired 100 R common shares, which were not part of a deferral election under section 1400Z-2. R must recognize gain or loss on the sale of its R shares under the generally applicable Federal income tax rules, but the sale does not trigger an inclusion of any deferred gain.
(vi)
Example 6. FIFO method.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section (
Example 5
), except that, in addition, during 2021 F sold an additional 400 R common shares, and, as with the other sale, F did not adequately identify which investment in QOF R F sold. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, F must apply the FIFO method to identify which investments in R were disposed of. As determined by this identification, F sold the 400 common shares which were associated with the deferral of $500 of short-term capital gain. Thus, the deferred gain that must be included upon sale of the 400 R common shares is short-term capital gain.
(vii)
Example 7. Pro-rata method.
The facts are the same as in examples 5 and 6, except that, in addition, during 2022 F sold an additional 400 R common shares. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, F must apply the FIFO method to identify which investments in R were disposed of. In 2022, F is treated as holding only the 800 R common shares purchased on a single day, and the section 1400Z-2 deferral election associated with these shares applies to gain with different characteristics (described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section). Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, therefore, R must use the pro-rata method to determine which of the characteristics pertain to the deferred gain required to be included as a result
of the sale of the 400 R common shares. Under the pro-rata method, $150 of the inclusion is short-term capital gain ($300 × 400/800) and $350 is long-term capital gain ($700 × 400/800).
(5)
Making an investment for purposes of an election under section 1400Z-2(a)
—(i)
Transfer of cash or other property to a QOF.
A taxpayer makes an investment in a QOF by transferring cash or other property to a QOF in exchange for eligible interests in the QOF, regardless of whether the transfer is one in which the transferor would recognize gain or loss on the property transferred.
(ii)
Furnishing services.
Rendering services to a QOF is not a transfer of cash or other property to a QOF. Thus, if a taxpayer receives an eligible interest in a QOF for services rendered to the QOF or to a person in which the QOF holds any direct or indirect equity interest, then the interest in the QOF that the taxpayer receives is a non-qualifying investment.
(iii)
Acquisition of eligible interest from person other than QOF.
An eligible taxpayer may make an investment in a QOF by acquiring an eligible interest in a QOF from a person other than the QOF, provided that all of the requirements of section 1400Z-2(a)(1) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations for making a valid deferral election with respect to that investment are otherwise satisfied with respect to such acquisition. For example, an eligible taxpayer who acquires an eligible interest in a QOF other than from the QOF also must have an eligible gain within the 180-day period prior to the eligible taxpayer's acquisition of the eligible interest in the QOF.
(6)
Amount invested for purposes of section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(A)
—(i)
In general.
In the case of any investments described in this paragraph (c)(6), the amount of a taxpayer's qualifying investment cannot exceed the amount of eligible gain to be deferred under the deferral election. If the amount of an otherwise qualifying investment exceeds the amount of eligible gain to be deferred under the deferral election, the amount of the excess is treated as a non-qualifying investment. See paragraph (c)(6)(iii) of this section for special rules applicable to transfers to QOF partnerships.
(ii)
Transfers to a QOF
—(A)
Cash.
If a taxpayer makes an investment in a QOF by transferring cash to a QOF, the amount of the taxpayer's investment is that amount of cash.
(B)
Property other than cash—Nonrecognition transactions.
This paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(B) applies if a taxpayer makes an investment in a QOF by transferring property other than cash to a QOF and if, but for the application of section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations, the taxpayer's basis in the resulting investment in the QOF would be determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the taxpayer's basis in the transferred property. This paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(B) applies separately to each item of property transferred to a QOF.
(
1
)
Amount of qualifying investment.
If paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(B) of this section applies, the amount of the taxpayer's qualifying investment is the lesser of the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the eligible interest received in the transaction, without regard to section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations, or the fair market value of the eligible interest received in the transaction, both determined immediately after the transfer.
(
2
)
Fair market value of the eligible interest received exceeds its adjusted basis.
If paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(B) of this section applies, and if the fair market value of the eligible interest received is in excess of the eligible taxpayer's adjusted basis in the eligible interest received, without regard to section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations, then the eligible taxpayer's investment in a QOF is a mixed-funds investment to which section 1400Z-2(e)(1) applies. In such a case, an amount equal to the adjusted basis of the eligible interest in the hands of the eligible taxpayer is the eligible taxpayer's qualifying investment, and the excess is the eligible taxpayer's non-qualifying investment.
(
3
)
Transfer of built-in loss property and section 362(e)(2).
If paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(B) of this section and section 362(e)(2) both apply to a transaction, the eligible taxpayer and the QOF are deemed to have made an election under section 362(e)(2)(C).
(C)
Property other than cash—Taxable transactions.
This paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C)
applies if an eligible taxpayer makes an investment in a QOF by transferring property other than cash to a QOF and if, without regard to section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations, the eligible taxpayer's basis in the eligible interest received would not be determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the eligible taxpayer's basis in the transferred property. If this paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C) applies, the amount of the eligible taxpayer's investment in a QOF is the fair market value of the transferred property, as determined immediately before the transfer. This paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C) applies separately to each item of property transferred to a QOF.
(D)
Basis in a mixed-funds investment.
If a taxpayer's investment in a QOF is a mixed-funds investment to which section 1400Z-2(e)(1) applies, the taxpayer's basis in the non-qualifying investment is equal to the taxpayer's basis in all of the eligible interests received, determined without regard to section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations, and reduced by the basis of the taxpayer's qualifying investment, determined without regard to section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations.
(iii)
Special rules for transfers to QOF partnerships.
In the case of an investment in a QOF partnership, the following rules apply:
(A)
Amounts not treated as a qualifying investment
—(
1
)
Non-contributions in general.
To the extent the transfer of property to a QOF partnership is characterized other than as a contribution, such as characterization as a sale under section 707 and the regulations in this part under section 707 of the Code, the transfer is not treated as being made in exchange for a qualifying investment.
(
2
)
Reductions in investments otherwise treated as contributions.
If any transfer of cash or other property to a partnership is not treated as a contribution, in whole or in part, under paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A)(
1
) of this section, the part of the transfer to the partnership that is not disregarded is not a qualifying investment to the extent the partnership makes a distribution to the partner and the transfer to the partnership and the distribution would be recharacterized as a disguised sale under section 707 and the regulations in this part under section 707 of the Code if:
(
i
) Any cash contributed were non-cash property; and
(
ii
) In the case of a distribution by the partnership to which § 1.707-5(b) (relating to debt-financed distributions) applies, the partner's share of liabilities is zero.
(B)
Amount invested in a QOF partnership
—(
1
)
Calculation of amount of qualifying and non-qualifying investments.
To the extent paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A) of this section does not apply, the amount of equity received by an eligible taxpayer in a QOF partnership in exchange for the lesser of the net basis or net value of the property contributed to the QOF partnership by the eligible taxpayer is a qualifying investment. The amount of equity received by an eligible taxpayer in a QOF partnership that is a non-qualifying investment is the excess, if any, of the total equity received by the eligible taxpayer over the amount treated as a qualifying investment.
(
2
)
Net basis.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(B) of this section, net basis is the excess, if any, of—
(
i
) The adjusted basis of the property contributed to the partnership; over
(
ii
) The amount of any debt to which the property is subject or that is assumed by the partnership in the transaction.
(
3
)
Net value.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(B) of this section, net value is the excess of—
(
i
) The gross fair market value of the property contributed to the partnership; over
(
ii
) The amount of the debt described in paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(B)(
2
)(
ii
) of this section.
(
4
)
Basis of qualifying and non-qualifying investments.
The initial basis of a qualifying investment, before application of section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations or any section 752 debt allocation, is the net basis of the property contributed. The basis of a non-qualifying investment, before any section 752 debt allocation, is the remaining net basis. The basis of the qualifying investment is adjusted as provided in section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations. The bases of qualifying and non-qualifying
investments are increased by any debt allocated to those investments under the rules of § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c)(6)(iv)(B).
(
5
)
Rules applicable to mixed-funds investments.
If one portion of an investment in a QOF partnership is a qualifying investment and another portion is a non-qualifying investment, see § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c)(6)(iv) for the rules that apply.
(iv)
Acquisitions from another person.
An eligible taxpayer may make an investment in a QOF by acquiring in a sale or exchange to which § 1.1001-1(a) applies an eligible interest in a QOF from a person other than the QOF. The amount of the eligible taxpayer's investment in the QOF with respect to which the eligible taxpayer may make a deferral election is the amount of the cash, or the net fair market value of the other property, as determined immediately before the exchange, that the eligible taxpayer exchanged for the eligible interest in the QOF.
(v)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (c)(6).
(A)
Example 1. Transfer of built-in gain property with basis less than gain to be deferred
—(
1
)
Facts.
Individual B realizes $100 of eligible gain within the meaning of paragraph (b)(11) of this section. B transfers unencumbered property with a fair market value of $100 and an adjusted basis of $60 to QOF Q, a C corporation, in a transaction that is described in section 351(a).
(
2
)
Analysis.
Paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(B) of this section applies because B transferred property other than cash to Q and, but for the application of section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B), B's basis in the eligible interests in Q would be determined, in whole or in part, by reference to B's basis in the transferred property. The fair market value of the eligible interest B received is $100, and, without regard to section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B), B's basis in the eligible interest received would be $60. Thus, pursuant to paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section, B's investment is a mixed-funds investment to which section 1400Z-2(e)(1) applies. Pursuant to paragraphs (c)(6)(ii)(B)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section, B's qualifying investment is $60 (the lesser of the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the eligible interest, without regard to section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B), of $60 and the $100 fair market value of the eligible interest received). Pursuant to section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(i), B's basis in the qualifying investment is $0. Additionally, B's non-qualifying investment is $40 (the excess of the fair market value of the eligible interest received ($100) over the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the eligible interest, without regard to section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B) ($60)). B's basis in the non-qualifying investment is $0 (B's $60 basis in its investment determined without regard to section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B), reduced by the $60 of adjusted basis allocated to the investment to which section 1400Z-2(e)(1)(A)(i) applies, determined without regard to section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)). See paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(D) of this section. Pursuant to section 362, Q's basis in the transferred property is $60.
(B)
Example 2. Transfer of built-in gain property with basis in excess of eligible gain to be deferred.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(6)(v)(A)(
1
) of this section (
Example 1
), except that B realizes $50 of eligible gain within the meaning of paragraph (b)(11) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, B's qualifying investment cannot exceed the amount of eligible gain to be deferred (that is, the $50 of eligible gain) under the section 1400Z-2(a) election. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section, B's qualifying investment is $50 (the lesser of the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the eligible interest received, without regard to section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B), of $60 and the $100 fair market value of the eligible interest, limited by the amount of eligible gain to be deferred under the section 1400Z-2(a) election). B's qualifying investment has an adjusted basis of $0, as provided in section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(i). Additionally, B's non-qualifying investment is $50 (the excess of the fair market value of the eligible interest received ($100) over the amount ($50) of B's section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(A) investment). B's basis in the non-qualifying investment is $10 (B's $60 basis in its investment determined without regard to section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)), reduced by the $50 of adjusted basis allocated to B's qualifying investment, determined without regard to section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B).
(C)
Example 3. Transfers to QOF partnerships
—(
1
)
Facts.
A and B each realized $100 of eligible gain and each transfers $100 to a QOF partnership. In a subsequent year, the partnership borrows $120 from an unrelated lender and distributes $120 equally to A and B.
(
2
)
Analysis.
If the contributions had been of property other than cash, the contributions and distributions would have been tested under the disguised sale rules of section 707 and the regulations in this part under section 707 of the Code, determining the timing of the distribution and amount of the debt allocated to each partner. Under paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A)(
2
) of this section, the cash of $200 ($100 from A and $100 from B) is treated as property that could be sold in a disguised sale transaction and each partner's share of the debt is zero for purposes of determining the amount of the qualifying investment. To the extent there would have been a disguised sale applying the rule of paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A)(
2
) of this section, the amount of the qualifying investment would be reduced by the amount of the contribution so recharacterized.
(D)
Example 4. Return of capital by QOF partnership
—(
1
)
Facts.
A realized $100 of eligible gain and transfers $100 of cash to a QOF partnership. Later in the partner's tax year, the partnership distributes $20 to A in a distribution that is not recharacterized under paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A)(
2
) of this section. At the time of the distribution, no allocations of income, gain, loss, or deduction had been made to A, and A's share of the partnership's debt was zero under section 752.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Because the contribution and distribution are not recharacterized under paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A)(
2
) of this section, the amount of A's qualifying investment is $100 despite the $20 distribution. At the time the $20 distribution is made to A, A's basis in its qualifying investment is zero, and thus the distribution is an inclusion event under § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c)(6)(iii).
(E)
Example 5. Property contributed has built-in gain.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(6)(v)(C)(
1
) of this section (
Example 3
), except that the property contributed by A had a value of $100 and basis of $20 and the partnership did not borrow money or make a distribution. Under paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section, the amount of A's qualifying investment is $20 (the lesser of the net value or the net basis of the property that A contributed), and the excess of the $100 contribution over the $20 qualifying investment is a non-qualifying investment. Under paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(B)(
4
) of this section, A's basis in the qualifying investment (determined without regard to section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B) or section 752(a)) is $20. After the application of section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B) but before the application of section 752(a), A's basis in the qualifying investment is zero. A's basis in the non-qualifying investment is zero without regard to the application of section 752(a).
(
F
)
Example 6. Property contributed has built-in gain and is subject to debt.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(6)(v)(E) of this section (
Example 5
), except that the property contributed by A has a gross value of $130 and is subject to debt of $30. Under paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section, the amount of A's qualifying investment is zero, the lesser of the property's $100 net value ($130 minus $30) or $0 net basis ($20 minus $30, but limited to zero). The entire contribution constitutes a non-qualifying investment.
(G)
Example 7. Property contributed has built-in loss and is subject to debt.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(6)(v)(F) of this section (
Example 6
), except that the property contributed by A has a basis of $150. Under paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section, the amount of A's qualifying investment is $100, the lesser of the property's $100 net value ($130 minus $30) or $120 net basis ($150 minus $30). The non-qualifying investment is $0, the excess of the net value ($100) over the qualifying investment ($100). A's basis in the qualifying investment (determined without regard to section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B) and section 752(a)) is $120, the net basis. After the application of section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B), A's basis in the qualifying investment is zero, plus its share of partnership debt under section 752(a).
(7)
Eligible gains that a partnership elects to defer.
A partnership generally is an eligible taxpayer under paragraph
(b)(13) of this section and may elect to defer recognition of some or all of its eligible gains under section 1400Z-2(a)(2) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations.
(i)
Partnership deferral election.
If a partnership properly makes a deferral election, then—
(A) The partnership defers recognition of the eligible gain under the rules of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations, that is, the partnership does not recognize gain at the time it otherwise would have in the absence of the deferral election; and
(B) The deferred eligible gain is not included in the distributive shares of the partners under section 702 and is not treated as an item described in section 705(a)(1).
(ii)
Subsequent recognition.
Absent any additional deferral under section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(A) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations, any amount of deferred gain that an electing partnership subsequently must include in income under sections 1400Z-2(a)(1)(B) and (b) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations is recognized by the electing partnership at the time of inclusion, is subject to section 702 and is treated as an item described in section 705(a)(1) in a manner consistent with recognition at that time.
(8)
Eligible gains that the partnership does not defer
—(i)
Federal income tax treatment of the partnership.
If a partnership does not elect to defer some, or all, of its eligible gains, the partnership's treatment of any such amounts is unaffected by the fact that the eligible gains could have been deferred under section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations.
(ii)
Federal income tax treatment by the partners.
If a partnership does not elect to defer some, or all, of the eligible gains—
(A) The gains for which a deferral election are not made are included in the partners' distributive shares under section 702 and are treated as items described in section 705(a)(1);
(B) If a partner's distributive share includes one or more gains that are eligible gains with respect to the partner, the partner may elect under section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(A) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations to defer some or all of such eligible gains; and
(C) A gain in a partner's distributive share is an eligible gain with respect to the partner only if it is an eligible gain with respect to the partnership and it did not arise from a sale or exchange with a person that, within the meaning of section 1400Z-2(e)(2) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations, is related to the partner.
(iii)
180-day period for a partner electing deferral
—(A)
General rule.
If a partner's distributive share includes a gain that is described in paragraph (c)(8)(ii)(C) of this section (gains that are eligible gains with respect to the partner), the 180-day period with respect to the partner's eligible gains in the partner's distributive share generally begins on the last day of the partnership taxable year in which the partner's distributive share of the partnership's eligible gain is taken into account under section 706(a).
(B)
Elective rule.
Notwithstanding the general rule in paragraph (c)(8)(iii)(A) of this section, if a partnership does not elect to defer all of its eligible gain, the partner may elect to treat the partner's own 180-day period with respect to the partner's distributive share of that gain as being—
(
1
) The same as the partnership's 180-day period; or
(
2
) The 180-day period beginning on the due date for the partnership's tax return, without extensions, for the taxable year in which the partnership realized the gain that is described in paragraph (c)(8)(ii)(C) of this section.
(C)
Example.
The following example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (c)(8)(iii).
(
1
)
Facts.
Four individuals, A, B, C, and D, have equal interests in a partnership, P. P has no other partners, and P's taxable year is the calendar year. On January 17, 2019, P realizes a capital gain of $1000
x
that P decides not to elect to defer.
(
2
)
Analysis of A's election.
A is aware of the capital gain realized by P, and decides to defer its distributive shares of P's eligible gain. A invests $250
x
in a QOF during February 2020. Under the general rule in paragraph (c)(8)(iii)(A) of this section, this investment is within the 180-day period for A, which began on December 31, 2019, the last day of P's taxable year in which A's
share of P's eligible gain is taken into account under section 706(a).
(
3
)
Analysis of B's election.
B is also aware of the capital gain realized by P, and decides to defer its distributive shares of P's eligible gain. B decides to make the election provided in paragraph (c)(8)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section, and invests $250
x
in a QOF during February 2019. Under the elective rule in paragraph (c)(8)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section, this investment is within the 180-day period for B, which began on January 17, 2019, the same day as P's 180-day period.
(
4
)
Analysis of C's election.
On March 15, 2020, P provides all of its partners with their Schedules K-1. Upon learning that its distributive share of income from P included eligible gain, C decides to make a deferral election, and also makes the election provided in paragraph (c)(8)(iii)(B)(
2
) of this section. It then invests $250
x
in a QOF during June 2020. Under the elective rule in paragraph (c)(8)(iii)(B)(
2
) of this section, this investment is within the 180-day period for C, which began on March 15, 2020, the 180-day period beginning on the due date for P's tax return without extensions, for the taxable year in which P realized eligible gain.
(9)
Passthrough entities other than partnerships
—(i)
S corporations, nongrantor trusts, and estates.
If an S corporation, a nongrantor trust, or a decedent's estate realizes an eligible gain, then rules analogous to the rules of paragraphs (c)(7) and (8) of this section apply to that entity and to its shareholders or its beneficiaries, as the case may be, to the extent they receive or are deemed to receive an allocable share of the eligible gain.
(ii)
Grantor trusts.
If a grantor trust realizes an eligible gain, either the trust or the deemed owner of the trust may make the election to defer recognition of the gain and make the qualifying investment under rules analogous to the rules of paragraphs (c)(7) and (8) of this section (other than the rule in paragraph (c)(8)(iii) of this section regarding the 180-day period), whether or not the gain is distributed to the deemed owner of the trust.
(d)
Elections
—(1)
Taxable year of deferral election.
For a deferral election with respect to any eligible gain to be valid, an eligible taxpayer must make such election in accordance with guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin or in forms and instructions (see §§ 601.601(d)(2) and 601.602 of this chapter), as to the required time, form, and manner in which an eligible taxpayer (including a partner, S corporation shareholder, or beneficiary applying the elective 180-day period provided in paragraphs (c)(8)(iii)(B) and (c)(9) of this section) may make a deferral election.
(2)
Annual reporting of qualifying investments.
An eligible taxpayer must report any qualifying investment held at any point during the taxable year in accordance with guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin or in forms and instructions (see §§ 601.601(d)(2) and 601.602 of this chapter). A failure to make this report for any given taxable year will result in a rebuttable presumption that the taxpayer has had an inclusion event described in § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c) during that year. The presumption described in the previous sentence may be rebutted by the taxpayer making the report described in the first sentence of this paragraph (d)(2) or by the taxpayer establishing to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that an inclusion event described in § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c) did not occur during that taxable year.
(e)
Interaction of section 1400Z-2 and § 1.897-6T.
Section 1400Z-2 is not a nonrecognition provision, as defined in § 1.897-6T(a)(2), for purposes of § 1.897-6T.
(f)
Treatment of mixed-funds investments
—(1)
Investments to which no election under section 1400Z-2(a) applies.
If a taxpayer invests in a QOF and makes a deferral election with respect to less than all of that investment, the portion of the investment to which the election does not apply is a non-qualifying investment. Similarly, an investment in a QOF with respect to which no deferral election is made is a non-qualifying investment.
(2)
Treatment of deemed contributions of money under section 752(a).
In the case of a QOF partnership, the deemed contribution of money described in section 752(a) does not create or increase an investment in the QOF described in section 1400Z-2(e)(1)(A)(ii). Thus, any
basis increase resulting from a deemed section 752(a) contribution is not taken into account in determining the portion of a partner's investment subject to section 1400Z-2(e)(1)(A)(i) or (ii). See § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c)(6)(iv)(B) for rules relating to the application of section 752 to a mixed-funds investment.
(3)
Treatment of contributions to QOF corporation in which no stock is received.
If a taxpayer with a qualifying investment or a non-qualifying investment in a QOF corporation subsequently makes a non-qualifying investment or a qualifying investment, respectively, and if the taxpayer receives no additional QOF stock in exchange for the subsequent investment, the taxpayer has a mixed-funds investment.
(4)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (f):
(i)
Facts.
Taxpayer A realizes $1 million of eligible gain and on the next day contributes $1 million to a QOF, Partnership P, in exchange for a 50 percent interest in Partnership P. Taxpayer A makes an election under section 1400Z-2(a) with respect to $900,000 of that eligible gain. Under section 1400Z-2(e)(1), 90 percent of A's investment is described in section 1400Z-2(e)(1)(A)(i) (an investment that only includes amounts to which the election under section 1400Z-2(a) applies), and 10 percent is described in section 1400Z-2(e)(1)(A)(ii) (a separate investment consisting of other amounts). Partnership P borrows $8 million. Under § 1.752-3(a), taking into account the terms of the partnership agreement, $4 million of the $8 million liability is allocated to A.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under section 752(a), A is treated as contributing $4 million to Partnership P. Under paragraph (f) of this section, A's deemed $4 million contribution to Partnership P is ignored for purposes of determining the percentage of A's investment in Partnership P subject to the deferral election under section 1400Z-2(a) or the portion not subject to the deferral election under section 1400Z-2(a). As a result, after A's section 752(a) deemed contribution, $900,000, or 90 percent, of A's investment in Partnership P is described in section 1400Z-2(e)(1)(A)(i) and $100,000, or 10 percent, is described in section 1400Z-2(e)(1)(A)(ii).

The provisions of this section are applicable for taxable years beginning after March 13, 2020.
(2)
Prior periods.
With respect to eligible gains that would be recognized (absent the making of a deferral election) during the portion of a taxpayer's first taxable year ending after December 21, 2017, and during taxable years beginning after December 21, 2017, and on or before March 13, 2020, a taxpayer may choose either—
(i) To apply the section 1400Z-2 regulations, if applied in a consistent manner for all such taxable years (reliance by a taxpayer under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(j)(2)(ii), § 1.1400Z2(d)-1(e)(2)(ii), § 1.1400Z2(d)-2(e)(2)(ii), or § 1.1400Z2(f)-1(d)(2)(ii), is disregarded solely for purposes of the consistency requirement under this paragraph (g)(2)(i)); or
(ii) To rely on the rules in proposed § 1.1400Z2(a)-1 contained in the notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-115420-18) published on October 29, 2018, as amplified by the notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-120186-18) published on May 1, 2019, but only if applied in a consistent manner for all such taxable years.

§ 1.1400Z2(b)-1
Inclusion of gains that have been deferred under section 1400Z-2(a).
(a)
Scope.
This section provides rules under section 1400Z-2(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and the section 1400Z-2 regulations (as defined in § 1.1400Z2(a)-1(b)(41)) regarding the inclusion in income of gain deferred by a QOF owner under section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(A) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations. This section applies to a QOF owner only until all of such owner's gain deferred pursuant to a deferral election has been included in income, subject to the limitations described in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, and except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section. Paragraph (b) of this section provides general rules under section 1400Z-2(b)(1) regarding the timing of the inclusion in income of the deferred
gain. Paragraph (c)(1) of this section provides the general rule regarding the determination of the extent to which an event triggers the inclusion in gross income of all, or a portion, of an eligible taxpayer's deferred gain, and paragraphs (c)(2) through (16) of this section provide specific rules for certain events that are or are not treated as inclusion events. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules regarding holding periods for qualifying investments. Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules regarding the amount of deferred gain included in gross income under section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(B) and (b), including special rules for QOF partnerships and QOF S corporations. Paragraph (f) of this section provides examples illustrating the rules of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section. Paragraph (g) of this section provides rules regarding basis adjustments under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B). Paragraph (h) of this section provides special reporting rules applicable to partners, partnerships, and direct or indirect owners of QOF partnerships. Paragraph (i) is reserved. Paragraph (j) of this section provides dates of applicability.
(b)
General inclusion rule.
The gain to which a deferral election applies is included in gross income, to the extent provided in paragraph (e) of this section and in accordance with the rules of § 1.1400Z2(a)-1(c)(1), in the taxable year that includes the earlier of:
(1) The date of an inclusion event; or
(2) December 31, 2026.
(c)
Inclusion events
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), an event is an inclusion event, if, and to the extent that—
(i) The event reduces an eligible taxpayer's direct equity interest for Federal income tax purposes in the qualifying investment;
(ii) An eligible taxpayer receives property in the event with respect to its qualifying investment and the event is treated as a distribution for Federal income tax purposes, whether or not the receipt reduces the eligible taxpayer's ownership of the QOF;
(iii) An eligible taxpayer claims a loss for worthless stock under section 165(g) or otherwise claims a worthlessness deduction with respect to its qualifying investment; or
(iv) A QOF in which an eligible taxpayer holds a qualifying investment loses its status as a QOF.
(2)
Termination or liquidation of QOF or QOF owner
—(i)
Termination or liquidation of QOF.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), an eligible taxpayer has an inclusion event with respect to all of its qualifying investment if the QOF ceases to exist for Federal income tax purposes. For example, if a QOF partnership converts to a QOF C corporation, or if a QOF C corporation converts to a QOF partnership or to an entity disregarded as separate from its owner for Federal income tax purposes, all investors in the QOF have an inclusion event with respect to all of their qualifying investments in the QOF.
(ii)
Liquidation of QOF owner
—(A)
Portion of distribution treated as sale.
A distribution of a qualifying investment in a complete liquidation of a QOF owner is an inclusion event to the extent that section 336(a) treats the distribution as if the qualifying investment were sold to the distributee at its fair market value, without regard to section 336(d).
(B)
Distribution to 80-percent distributee.
A distribution of a qualifying investment in a complete liquidation of a QOF owner is not an inclusion event to the extent section 337(a) applies to the distribution.
(3)
Transfer of an investment in a QOF by gift or incident to divorce
—(i)
Transfer of an investment in a QOF by gift.
Except to the extent provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, a taxpayer's transfer of a qualifying investment by gift, as defined for purposes of chapter 12 of subtitle B of the Code, whether outright or in trust, is an inclusion event, regardless of whether that transfer is a completed gift for Federal gift tax purposes, and regardless of the taxable or tax-exempt status of the donee of the gift.
(ii)
Transfers between spouses incident to divorce.
A transfer between spouses or incident to divorce or otherwise as provided in section 1041 of the Code is an inclusion event.
(4)
Transfer of an investment in a QOF by reason of the taxpayer's death
—(i)
In
general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, a transfer of a qualifying investment by reason of the taxpayer's death is not an inclusion event. Transfers by reason of death include, for example:
(A) A transfer by reason of death to the deceased owner's estate;
(B) A distribution of a qualifying investment by the deceased owner's estate;
(C) A distribution of a qualifying investment by the deceased owner's trust that is made by reason of the deceased owner's death;
(D) The passing of a jointly owned qualifying investment to the surviving co-owner by operation of law; and
(E) Any other transfer of a qualifying investment at death by operation of law.
(ii)
Exceptions.
The following transfers are not included as a transfer by reason of the taxpayer's death, and thus are inclusion events:
(A) A sale, exchange, or other disposition by the deceased taxpayer's estate or trust, other than a distribution described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section;
(B) Any disposition by the legatee, heir, or beneficiary who received the qualifying investment by reason of the taxpayer's death; and
(C) Any disposition by the surviving joint owner or other recipient who received the qualifying investment by operation of law on the taxpayer's death.
(iii)
Liability for deferred Federal income tax.
If the owner of a qualifying investment in a QOF dies before an inclusion event and the deferred gain is not includable in the decedent's gross income, the gain that the decedent elected to defer under section 1400Z-2(a) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations will be includable in the gross income, for the taxable year in which occurs an inclusion event, of the person described in section 691(a)(1).
(iv)
Qualifying investment in the hands of the person described in section 691(a)(1).
A qualifying investment received in a transfer by reason of death listed in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section continues to be a qualifying investment under § 1.1400Z2(a)-1(b)(34).
(5)
Grantor trusts
—(i)
Contributions to grantor trusts.
If the owner of a qualifying investment contributes it to a trust and, under subpart E of part I of subchapter J of chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Code (grantor trust rules), the contributing owner of the investment is the deemed owner of the trust (grantor trust), the contribution to the grantor trust is not an inclusion event. Similarly, a transfer of the investment by the grantor trust to the trust's deemed owner is not an inclusion event. For all purposes of the section 1400Z-2 regulations, references to the term
grantor trust
mean the portion of the trust that holds the qualifying investment in the QOF, and such a grantor trust, or portion of the trust, is a wholly grantor trust as to the deemed owner. Such contributions may include transfers by gift or any other type of transfer between the grantor and the grantor trust that is a nonrecognition event as a result of the application of the grantor trust rules (that is, subpart E of part I of subchapter J of chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Code).
(ii)
Changes in grantor trust status.
In general, a change in the income tax status of an existing trust owning a qualifying investment in a QOF, whether the termination of grantor trust status or the creation of grantor trust status, is an inclusion event. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the termination of grantor trust status as the result of the death of the owner of a qualifying investment is not an inclusion event, but the provisions of paragraph (c)(4) of this section apply to distributions or dispositions by the trust. If a qualifying investment is held in the grantor portion of an electing small business trust (ESBT), as defined in section 1361(e)(1), and the ESBT converts into a qualified subchapter S trust (QSST), as defined in section 1361(d)(3), the beneficiary of which is the deemed owner of the grantor portion of the ESBT, there has been no change in the grantor trust status because the deemed owner continues to be taxable under subtitle A of the Code on the income and gain from the qualifying investment.
(iii)
Conversions of QSSTs and ESBTs.
With regard to conversions of QSSTs and ESBTs, see paragraphs (c)(7)(i)(B)
and (C) of this section. For purposes of paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, if a qualifying investment is held by a QSST that converts to an ESBT, the beneficiary of the QSST is the deemed owner of the grantor portion of the ESBT that then holds the qualifying investment, and the deemed owner is not a nonresident alien for purposes of this section (and thus notwithstanding § 1.1361-1(j)(8)), there has been no change in the grantor trust status because the deemed owner continues to be taxable under subtitle A of the Code on the income and gain from the qualifying investment.
(6)
Special rules for partners and partnerships
—(i)
Scope.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(6), in the case of a partnership that is a QOF or a QOF partner, the inclusion rules of this paragraph (c) apply to transactions involving any direct or indirect partner of the QOF to the extent of that partner's share of any eligible gain of the QOF.
(ii)
Transactions that are not inclusion events
—(A)
In general.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, and except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, no transaction described in paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section is an inclusion event.
(B)
Section 721 contributions.
Subject to paragraph (c)(6)(v) of this section, a contribution by a QOF owner (contributing partner), of its qualifying QOF stock, qualifying QOF partnership interest, or direct or indirect partnership interest in a qualifying investment to a partnership (transferee partnership) to the extent the transaction is governed by section 721(a) is not an inclusion event, provided the interest transfer does not cause a partnership termination of a QOF partnership, or the direct or indirect owner of a QOF, under section 708(b)(1). See paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C) of this section for transactions governed by section 708(b)(2)(A). The inclusion rules in paragraph (c) of this section apply to any part of the transaction to which section 721(a) does not apply. The transferee partnership becomes subject to section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations with respect to the eligible gain associated with the contributed qualifying investment. The transferee partnership must allocate and report the remaining deferred gain that is associated with the contributed qualifying investment to the contributing partner to the same extent that the remaining deferred gain would have been allocated and reported to the contributing partner in the absence of the contribution. Additionally, the transferee partnership must allocate the basis increases described in section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iii) and (iv) to the contributing partner. If a transferee partnership is a direct QOF owner, only the transferee partnership may make the elections under section 1400Z-2(c) and the regulations in this part under section 1400Z-2(c) of the Code with respect to the contributed qualifying investment. See § 1.1400Z2(c)-1(b)(1)(ii) (election by transferee partnership).
(C)
Section 708(b)(2)(A) mergers or consolidations
—(
1
)
Merger of a partnership that is a QOF partner.
Subject to paragraphs (c)(6)(iii) and (v) of this section, a merger or consolidation of a partnership that is a QOF partner (original partnership) with another partnership in a transaction to which section 708(b)(2)(A) applies is not an inclusion event to the extent section 721(a) applies to the merger. To the extent the original partnership terminates in the merger, as determined under § 1.708-1(c)(1), the partnership that is a continuation of the original partnership becomes subject to section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations to the same extent that the original partnership was so subject prior to the transaction, and must allocate and report any gain under section 1400Z-2(b) to the same extent and to the same partners that the original partnership allocated and reported such items prior to the transaction. Notwithstanding the rules in this paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C)(
1
), the general inclusion rules of paragraph (c) of this section apply to the portion of the transaction that is otherwise treated as a sale or exchange under paragraph (c) of this section.
(
2
)
Merger of QOF partnerships.
Subject to paragraph (c)(6)(v) of this section, a merger or consolidation of a QOF partnership with another QOF partnership in a transaction to which
section 708(b)(2)(A) applies is not an inclusion event under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section if, immediately after the merger or consolidation, the resulting partnership is a QOF. The continuing partnership, as determined under § 1.708-1(c)(1), becomes subject to section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations to the same extent that the terminated partnership was so subject prior to the transaction, and must allocate and report any gain under section 1400Z-2(b) to the same extent and to the same partners that the terminated partnership would have allocated and reported such items prior to the transaction. Notwithstanding the rules in this paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C)(
2
), the general inclusion rules of paragraph (c) of this section apply to the portion of the transaction that is otherwise treated as a sale or exchange under paragraph (c) of this section.
(D)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (c)(6)(ii).
(
1
)
Example
—(
i
)
Facts.
In 2019, taxpayer A contributes $100 of eligible gain to a QOF partnership, X, in exchange for a qualifying QOF partnership interest in X, and taxpayer B contributes $100 of eligible gain to another QOF partnership, Y, in exchange for a qualifying QOF partnership interest in Y. In 2021, in transactions governed by section 721(a), A contributes her qualifying QOF partnership interest in X, and B contributes her qualifying QOF partnership interest in Y, to a newly formed partnership, UTP. In 2024, C receives a profits interest in UTP for services that she will provide to UTP. In 2031, X sells a non-inventory asset and allocates X's distributive share of the gain to UTP. No distributions are ever made from X, Y, or UTP.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
On December 31, 2026, UTP recognizes $170 of remaining deferred gain relating to the QOF interests. Of that gain, A is allocated the $85 of gain relating to the $100 of eligible gain that she invested in X, and B is allocated the $85 of gain relating to the $100 of eligible gain that she invested in Y. C recognizes no gain at this time. In 2031, because UTP's holding period in X includes A's holding period in X, UTP has a holding period in X that exceeds 10 years, and may make an election under § 1.1400Z2(c)-1(b)(2)(ii) to exclude the gain from X's asset sale. Even though A was the original investor in X, she may not make the election. If UTP makes the election, UTP will exclude its distributive share of gain from the sale of the X asset.
(
2
) [Reserved]
(iii)
Partnership distributions.
Subject to paragraph (c)(6)(v) of this section, an actual or deemed distribution of property, including cash, by a QOF partnership to a partner with respect to its qualifying investment is an inclusion event only to the extent that the distributed property has a fair market value in excess of the partner's basis in its qualifying investment. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(6)(iii), in the case of a merger or consolidation of a QOF partnership with another QOF partnership in a transaction to which section 708(b)(2)(A) applies, the fair market value of the distributed property is reduced by the fair market value of the QOF partnership interest received in the merger or consolidation. A distribution from a partnership that directly or indirectly owns a QOF is an inclusion event only if the distribution is a liquidating distribution. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(6)(iii), the distribution is not in complete liquidation if the partnership making the distribution is a partnership that terminates in a partnership merger or consolidation under § 1.708-1(c), the continuing partnership in the merger or consolidation continues to directly or indirectly own an interest in the QOF, and the distributee is distributed an interest in the resulting partnership as part of the merger or consolidation. See paragraph (c)(6)(iv) of this section for special rules relating to mixed-funds investments.
(iv)
Special rules for mixed-funds investments
—(A)
In general.
The rules of this paragraph (c)(6)(iv) apply solely for purposes of section 1400Z-2. A partner that holds a mixed-funds investment in a QOF partnership (a mixed-funds partner) shall be treated as holding two separate interests in the QOF partnership, one a qualifying investment and the other a non-qualifying investment (separate interests). The basis of each separate interest is determined under the rules described in paragraphs (c)(6)(iv)(B) and (g) of this section as if each interest were held by different taxpayers.
(B)
Allocations and distributions.
All section 704(b) allocations of income, gain, loss, and deduction, all section 752 allocations of debt, and all distributions made to a mixed-funds partner
will be treated as made to the separate interests based on the allocation percentages of those interests as defined in paragraph (c)(6)(iv)(D) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(6)(iv)(B), in allocating income, gain, loss, or deduction between these separate interests, section 704(c) principles apply to account for any value-basis disparities attributable to the qualifying investment or non-qualifying investment. Any distribution (whether actual or deemed) to the holder of a qualifying investment is subject to the rules of paragraphs (c)(6)(iii) and (v) of this section, without regard to the presence or absence of gain under other provisions of subchapter K of chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code.
(C)
Subsequent contributions.
In the event of an increase in a partner's qualifying or non-qualifying investment, as for example, in the case of an additional contribution for a qualifying investment or for an interest that is a non-qualifying investment or a change in allocations for services rendered, the partner's interest in the separate interests must be valued immediately prior to the event and the allocation percentages adjusted to reflect the relative values of these separate interests and the additional contribution, if any.
(D)
Allocation percentages.
The allocation percentages of the separate interests will be determined based on the relative capital contributions attributable to the qualifying investment and the non-qualifying investment. In the event a partner receives a profits interest in the QOF partnership for services provided to or for the benefit of the QOF partnership, the allocation percentage with respect to the profits interest is based on the share of residual profits the mixed-funds partner would receive with respect to that interest, disregarding any allocation of residual profits for which there is not a reasonable likelihood of application.
(E)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (c)(6)(iv).
(
1
)
Example 1. Allocation of residual profits for which there is no reasonable likelihood of application
—(
i
)
Facts.
A realizes $100 of eligible gain and B realizes $900 of eligible gain. A and B form Q, a QOF partnership. B contributes $900 to Q in exchange for a qualifying QOF partnership interest (B's capital interest). A contributes $100 to Q in exchange for a qualifying QOF partnership interest (A's capital interest and, with B's capital interest, the capital interests) and agrees to provide services to Q in exchange for a profits interest in Q (A's profits interest). Q's partnership agreement provides that Q's profits are first allocated to the capital interests until the capital interest holders receive a 10 percent preferred return with respect to those interests. Next, Q's profits are allocated 15 percent to A with respect to A's profits interest, 10 percent to A with respect to A's capital interest, and 75 percent to B until the capital interests receive a 1,000% preferred return. Thereafter, Q's profits are allocated 1 percent to A's profits interest and 99 percent to the capital interests. There is not a reasonable likelihood that Q's profits will be sufficient to result in an allocation in the last tranche.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (c)(6)(iv)(D) of this section, the allocation percentage with respect to A's profits interest is calculated based on the share of residual profits that A would receive with respect to A's profits interest, disregarding any allocation of residual profits that has no reasonable likelihood of being achieved. Under Q's partnership agreement, A's share of Q's residual profits with respect to A's profits interest is 1 percent. However, there is no reasonable likelihood that this 1 percent allocation will apply because it is unlikely that the capital interests will receive a 1,000% preferred return. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(6)(iv)(D) of this section, A's share of Q's residual profits with respect to A's profits interest is 15 percent, the final allocation of Q's profits to A's profits interest that is reasonably likely to apply. The allocation percentage for A's capital interest in Q is 10 percent under paragraph (c)(6)(iv)(D) of this section. Thus, allocations and distributions made to A are treated as made 60 percent (15/25) to A's non-qualifying profits interest and 40 percent (10/25) to A's qualifying QOF partnership interest.
(
2
)
Example 2. Separate entity holding profits interest
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(6)(iv)(E)(
1
) of this section (
Example 1
), except that A is a partnership that has no eligible gain and P, a partnership that is owned by the same taxpayers who own A, realizes $100 of eligible gain and contributes $100 to Q for its qualifying investment.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (c)(6)(iv)(D) of this section, A's profits interest is a non-qualifying investment in Q. Because P directly holds only a qualifying QOF partnership interest in Q, P is not a mixed-funds
partner in Q, and 100 percent of the allocations and distributions made to P are attributable to P's qualifying QOF partnership interest.
(v)
Remaining deferred gain reduction rule.
An inclusion event occurs when and to the extent that a transaction has the effect of reducing:
(A) The amount of remaining deferred gain of one or more direct or indirect partners; or
(B) The amount of gain that would be recognized by such partner or partners under paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section to the extent that such amount would reduce such gain to an amount that is less than the remaining deferred gain.
(7)
Special rules for S corporations
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(7)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section, none of the following is an inclusion event:
(A) An election, revocation, or termination of a corporation's status as an S corporation under section 1362;
(B) A conversion of a QSST to an ESBT, but only if the QSST beneficiary is the deemed owner of the grantor portion of the ESBT that receives the qualifying investment and if the deemed owner is not a nonresident alien;
(C) A conversion of an ESBT to a QSST, where the qualifying investment is held in the grantor portion of the ESBT and the QSST beneficiary is the deemed owner of the grantor portion of the ESBT; and
(D) A valid modification of a trust agreement of an S-corporation shareholder whether by an amendment, a decanting, a judicial reformation, or a material modification.
(ii)
Distributions by QOF S corporation
—(A)
General rule.
An actual or constructive distribution of property by a QOF S corporation to a QOF shareholder with respect to its qualifying investment is an inclusion event to the extent that the distribution is treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property under section 1368(b)(2) and (c). For the treatment of a distribution by a QOF S corporation to which section 305(a) applies, see paragraph (c)(8)(ii). For the treatment of a distribution to which section 302(d) or section 306(a)(2) applies, see paragraph (c)(9)(ii) of this section.
(B)
Spill-over rule.
For purposes of applying paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section to the adjusted basis of a qualifying investment, or non-qualifying investment, as appropriate, in a QOF S corporation, the second sentence of § 1.1367-1(c)(3) applies—
(
1
) With regard to multiple qualifying investments, solely to the respective bases of such qualifying investments, and does not take into account the basis of any non-qualifying investment; and
(
2
) With regard to multiple non-qualifying investments, solely to the respective bases of such non-qualifying investments, and does not take into account the basis of any qualifying investment.
(iii)
Conversion from S corporation to partnership or disregarded entity
—(A)
General rule.
Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section, and except as provided in paragraph (c)(7)(iii)(B) of this section, a conversion of an S corporation to a partnership or an entity disregarded as separate from its owner under § 301.7701-3(b)(1)(ii) of this chapter is an inclusion event.
(B)
Exception for qualifying section 381 transaction.
A conversion described in paragraph (c)(7)(iii)(A) of this section is not an inclusion event if the conversion comprises a step in a series of related transactions that together qualify as a qualifying section 381 transaction.
(iv)
Treatment of separate blocks of stock in mixed-funds investments.
With regard to a mixed-funds investment in a QOF S corporation, if different blocks of stock are created for separate qualifying investments to track basis in such qualifying investments, the separate blocks are not treated as different classes of stock for purposes of S corporation eligibility under section 1361(b)(1).
(v)
Applicability.
Paragraph (c)(7) of this section applies regardless of whether the S corporation is a QOF or a QOF shareholder.
(8)
Distributions by a QOF corporation
—(i)
General rule for distributions by a QOF C corporation.
If a QOF C corporation distributes property to a QOF
shareholder with respect to a qualifying investment, only the amount of the distribution to which section 301(c)(3) or 1059(a)(2) applies gives rise to an inclusion event. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(8)(i), a distribution of property includes a distribution of stock in the QOF C corporation making the distribution (or rights to acquire such stock) if the distribution is treated as a distribution of property to which section 301 applies pursuant to section 305(b).
(ii)
Section 305(a) distributions.
A distribution with respect to qualifying QOF stock to which section 305(a) applies is not an inclusion event. QOF stock received in such a distribution is qualifying QOF stock. The shareholder's remaining deferred gain is allocated pro rata between the new qualifying QOF stock received and the qualifying QOF stock with respect to which the distribution was made in proportion to the fair market values of each on the date of distribution. See § 1.307-1(a).
(9)
Dividend-equivalent redemptions and redemptions of section 306 stock.
—(i)
Redemptions by QOF C corporations
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(9)(i)(B) of this section, if a QOF C corporation redeems its stock from a QOF shareholder in a transaction described in section 302(d) or section 306(a)(2), the full amount of such redemption gives rise to an inclusion event.
(B)
Redemptions of stock of wholly owned QOF C corporation and pro rata redemptions.
Paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section applies to a redemption described in paragraph (c)(9)(i)(A) of this section if, at the time of such redemption—
(
1
) All stock in the QOF C corporation is held directly by a single shareholder, or directly by members of a single consolidated group; or
(
2
) The QOF C corporation has outstanding only one class of stock, as defined in section 1361 and § 1.1361-1(l), and the redemption is pro rata as to all shareholders of the redeeming QOF C corporation.
(ii)
Redemptions by QOF S corporations.
If a QOF S corporation redeems its stock from a QOF shareholder in a transaction described in section 302(d) or section 306(a)(2), the amount that gives rise to an inclusion event is the amount by which the distribution exceeds basis in the QOF stock as adjusted under paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section.
(10)
Qualifying section 381 transactions
—(i)
Assets of a QOF are acquired
—(A)
In general.
Except to the extent provided in paragraph (c)(10)(i)(C) of this section, if the assets of a QOF corporation are acquired in a qualifying section 381 transaction, and if the acquiring corporation is a QOF immediately after the acquisition, then the transaction is not an inclusion event.
(B)
Determination of acquiring corporation's status as a QOF.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(10)(i)(A) of this section, the acquiring corporation is treated as a QOF immediately after the qualifying section 381 transaction if the acquiring corporation satisfies the certification requirements in § 1.1400Z2(d)-1 immediately after the transaction and holds at least 90 percent of its assets in qualified opportunity zone property on the first testing date after the transaction. See section 1400Z-2(d)(1) and § 1.1400Z2(d)-1.
(C)
Receipt of boot by QOF shareholder in qualifying section 381 transaction.
This paragraph (c)(10)(i)(C) applies if assets of a QOF corporation are acquired in a qualifying section 381 transaction and an eligible taxpayer that is a QOF shareholder receives boot with respect to its qualifying investment. If this paragraph (c)(10)(i)(C) applies, the QOF shareholder has an inclusion event and is treated as disposing of a portion of its qualifying investment that bears the same proportion to the QOF shareholder's total qualifying investment immediately before the inclusion event as the fair market value of the boot received by the QOF shareholder with respect to its qualifying investment in the qualifying section 381 transaction bears to the fair market value of the total consideration received by the QOF shareholder with respect to its qualifying investment in the qualifying section 381 transaction.
(ii)
Assets of a QOF shareholder are acquired
—(A)
In general.
Except to the extent provided in paragraph (c)(10)(ii)(B) of this section, a qualifying section 381 transaction in which the assets of a
QOF shareholder are acquired is not an inclusion event with respect to the qualifying investment and the acquiring corporation succeeds to the target corporation's status as the QOF shareholder with respect to the qualifying investment.
(B)
Qualifying section 381 transaction in which QOF shareholder's qualifying investment is not completely acquired.
If the assets of a QOF shareholder are acquired in a qualifying section 381 transaction in which the acquiring corporation does not acquire all of the QOF shareholder's qualifying investment, the QOF shareholder has an inclusion event and is treated as disposing of the portion of its qualifying investment that is not transferred to the acquiring corporation.
(11)
Section 355 transactions
—(i)
Distribution by a QOF
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(11)(i)(B) of this section, if a QOF corporation distributes stock or securities of a controlled corporation to a QOF shareholder with respect to a qualifying investment in the QOF corporation in a transaction to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applies, the QOF shareholder has an inclusion event and is treated as disposing of a portion of its qualifying investment equal in value to the fair market value of the shares of the controlled corporation and the fair market value of any boot received by the QOF shareholder in the distribution with respect to its qualifying investment.
(B)
Controlled corporation becomes a QOF
—(
1
)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(11)(i)(B)(
3
) of this section, if a QOF corporation distributes stock or securities of a controlled corporation in a transaction to which section 355, or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355, applies, and if both the distributing corporation and the controlled corporation are QOFs immediately after the final distribution (qualifying section 355 transaction), then the distribution is not an inclusion event with respect to a QOF shareholder's qualifying investment in the distributing QOF corporation or the controlled QOF corporation. This paragraph (c)(11)(i)(B) does not apply unless the distributing corporation distributes all of the stock and securities in the controlled corporation held by it immediately before the distribution within a 30-day period. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(11)(i)(B), the term
final distribution
means the last distribution that satisfies the preceding sentence.
(
2
)
Determination of distributing corporation's and controlled corporation's status as QOFs.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(11)(i)(B)(
1
) of this section, each of the distributing corporation and the controlled corporation is treated as a QOF immediately after the final distribution if the corporation satisfies the certification requirements in § 1.1400Z2(d)-1 immediately after the final distribution and holds at least 90 percent of its assets in qualified opportunity zone property on the first testing date after the final distribution. See section 1400Z-2(d)(1) and § 1.1400Z2(d)-1.
(
3
)
Receipt of boot.
If a QOF shareholder receives boot in a qualifying section 355 transaction with respect to its qualifying investment, and if section 356(a) applies to the transaction, paragraph (c)(10)(i)(C) of this section applies. If a QOF shareholder receives boot in a qualifying section 355 transaction with respect to its qualifying investment, and if section 356(b) applies to the transaction, paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section applies.
(
4
)
Treatment of controlled corporation stock as qualified opportunity zone stock.
If stock or securities of a controlled corporation are distributed in a qualifying section 355 transaction, and if the distributing corporation retains a portion of the controlled corporation stock after the initial distribution, the retained stock will not cease to qualify as qualified opportunity zone stock in the hands of the distributing corporation solely as a result of the qualifying section 355 transaction. This paragraph (c)(11)(i)(B)(
4
) does not apply unless the distributing corporation distributes all of the stock and securities in the controlled corporation held by it immediately before the distribution within a 30-day period.
(ii)
Distribution by a QOF shareholder.
If a QOF shareholder distributes stock
or securities of a controlled QOF corporation in a transaction to which section 355 applies, then for purposes of section 1400Z-2(b)(1) and paragraph (b) of this section, the QOF shareholder has an inclusion event and is treated as disposing of the portion of its qualifying QOF stock over which it no longer has direct Federal income tax ownership.
(12)
Recapitalizations and section 1036 transactions
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(12)(ii) of this section, if a QOF corporation engages in a transaction that qualifies as a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(E) (a recapitalization), or if a QOF shareholder engages in a transaction that is described in section 1036 (a section 1036 exchange), the transaction is not an inclusion event.
(ii)
Receipt of property or boot by QOF shareholder.
If a QOF shareholder receives property or boot, or is treated as having received property or boot, with respect to its qualifying investment in a recapitalization, then the property or boot is treated as property or boot to which section 301 or section 356(a) or (c) applies, as determined under general Federal income tax principles. If, in a section 1036 exchange, a QOF shareholder receives property with respect to its qualifying investment that is not permitted to be received without the recognition of gain, then, for purposes of this section, the receipt of the property is treated in a similar manner as the receipt of such property or boot in a recapitalization. Paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section applies to property to which section 301 applies. Paragraph (c)(10)(i)(C) of this section applies to boot to which section 356(a) or (c) applies.
(13)
Section 304 transactions.
If a QOF shareholder transfers its qualifying investment in a transaction described in section 304(a), the full amount of the consideration gives rise to an inclusion event.
(14)
Deduction for worthlessness.
If an eligible taxpayer claims a loss for worthless stock under section 165(g) or otherwise claims a worthlessness deduction with respect to all or a portion of its qualifying investment, then for purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations, the eligible taxpayer has an inclusion event and is treated as having disposed of that portion of its qualifying investment on the date it became worthless. Thus, neither section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iii) or (iv) nor section 1400Z-2(c) applies to that portion of the eligible taxpayer's qualifying investment after the date it became worthless.
(15)
Decertification of a QOF.
The decertification of a QOF, whether a self-decertification pursuant to § 1.1400Z2(d)-1(a)(3) or an involuntary decertification pursuant to § 1.1400Z2(d)-1(a)(4), is an inclusion event.
(16)
Other inclusion and non-inclusion events.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph (c), the Commissioner may determine in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) that a type of transaction is or is not an inclusion event.
(d)
Holding periods
—(1)
Holding period for qualifying investment
—(i)
In general.
Solely for purposes of section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B), section 1400Z-2(c), and the section 1400Z-2 regulations, and except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(1), the length of time a qualifying investment has been held is determined without regard to the period for which the eligible taxpayer had held property exchanged for such investment (even if such period would be relevant for determining the length of time for other Federal income tax purposes).
(ii)
Holding period for qualifying investment received in certain transactions with respect to QOFs.
For purposes of section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B), section 1400Z-2(c), and the section 1400Z-2 regulations, the principles of section 1223(1) or (4) apply to determine the holding period for a qualifying investment received by a QOF owner in—
(A) A distribution described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section;
(B) A distribution to which section 305(a) applies;
(C) A qualifying section 381 transaction described in paragraph (c)(10)(i) or (ii) of this section;
(D) A qualifying section 355 transaction described in paragraph (c)(11)(i)(B) of this section;
(E) A recapitalization or a section 1036 exchange described in paragraph (c)(12) of this section;
(F) A contribution of a QOF interest to a partnership to the extent section 721(a) applies to the transfer; or
(G) A distribution of a QOF interest to the extent the interest was received in a merger of two or more QOF partnerships in a transaction described in section 708(b)(2)(A).
(iii)
Tacking with deceased owner or deemed owner of a grantor trust.
For purposes of section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B), section 1400Z-2(c), and the section 1400Z-2 regulations, the holding period of a qualifying investment held by an eligible taxpayer who received that qualifying investment by reason of the prior owner's death includes the time during which that qualifying investment was held by the deceased owner. The rule in the preceding sentence also applies to allow a grantor trust to tack the holding period of the deemed owner if the grantor trust acquires the qualifying investment from the deemed owner in a transaction that is not an inclusion event.
(2)
Status of QOF assets as qualified opportunity zone property.
For purposes of section 1400Z-2(d) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations, including for purposes of determining whether the original use of qualified opportunity zone business property commences with the acquiring corporation or partnership, qualified opportunity zone property does not lose its status as qualified opportunity zone property solely as a result of—
(i) Its transfer by the transferor corporation to the acquiring corporation in a qualifying section 381 transaction described in paragraph (c)(10)(i) of this section;
(ii) Its transfer by the distributing corporation to the controlled corporation in a qualifying section 355 transaction described in paragraph (c)(11)(i)(B) of this section; or
(iii) Its transfer by the transferor partnership to the acquiring partnership in a transaction to which section 708(b)(2)(A) applies, but only to the extent section 721(a) applies to the transaction.
(e)
Amount includible.
Except as provided in §§ 1.1400Z2(a)-1(b)(7) and 1.1400Z2(f)-1(b), the amount of gain included in gross income under section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(B) and this section on a date described in paragraph (b) of this section is determined under this paragraph (e).
(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(2) and (4) of this section, and subject to paragraph (e)(5) of this section, in the case of an inclusion event, the amount of gain included in gross income is equal to the excess of the amount described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section over the eligible taxpayer's basis in the portion of the qualifying investment that is disposed of in the inclusion event. See paragraph (c) of this section for rules regarding the amount that gave rise to the inclusion event, and see paragraph (g) of this section for applicable ordering rules.
(i) The amount described in this paragraph (e)(1)(i) is equal to the lesser of—
(A) An amount which bears the same proportion to the remaining deferred gain, as—
(
1
) The fair market value of the portion of the qualifying investment that is disposed of in the inclusion event bears to—
(
2
) The fair market value of the total qualifying investment immediately before the inclusion event; or
(B) The fair market value of the portion of the qualifying investment that is disposed of in the inclusion event.
(ii) For purposes of paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the fair market value of the portion of the qualifying investment that is disposed of in the inclusion event is determined by multiplying the fair market value of the eligible taxpayer's entire qualifying investment in the QOF, determined as of the date of the inclusion event, by the percentage of the eligible taxpayer's qualifying investment that is represented by the portion that is disposed of in the inclusion event.
(2)
Property received from a QOF in certain transactions.
In the case of an inclusion event described in paragraph (c)(6)(iii) or (v), (c)(7)(ii), (c)(8)(i), or (c)(9) or (13) of this section (or in paragraph (c)(11) or (12) of this section, to the extent the rules in paragraph
(c)(8)(i) of this section apply to the inclusion event), the amount of gain included in gross income is equal to the lesser of—
(i) The remaining deferred gain; or
(ii) The amount that gave rise to the inclusion event.
(3)
Gain recognized on December 31, 2026.
The amount of gain included in gross income on December 31, 2026 is equal to the excess of—
(i) The lesser of—
(A) The remaining deferred gain; and
(B) The fair market value of the qualifying investment held on December 31, 2026; over
(ii) The eligible taxpayer's basis in the qualifying investment as of December 31, 2026, taking into account only section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B).
(4)
Special amount includible rule for partnerships and S corporations.
For purposes of paragraphs (e)(1) and (3) of this section, in the case of an inclusion event involving a qualifying investment in a QOF partnership or S corporation, or in the case of a qualifying investment in a QOF partnership or S corporation held on December 31, 2026, the amount of gain included in gross income is equal to the lesser of—
(i) The product of—
(A) The percentage of the qualifying investment that gave rise to the inclusion event; and
(B) The remaining deferred gain, less any basis adjustments pursuant to section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iii) and (iv); or
(ii) The gain that would be recognized on a fully taxable disposition at fair market value of the qualifying investment that gave rise to the inclusion event.
(5)
Limitation on amount of gain included after statutory five-year and seven-year basis increases.
The total amount of gain included in gross income under this paragraph (e) is limited to the amount deferred under section 1400Z-2(a)(1) and the section 1400Z-2 regulations, reduced by any increase in the basis of the qualifying investment made pursuant to section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iii) and (iv). See paragraph (g)(2) of this section for limitations on the amount of basis adjustments under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iii) and (iv).
(f)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of this section. For purposes of the following examples: A, B, C, W, X, Y, and Z are C corporations that do not file a consolidated Federal income tax return; Q is a QOF corporation or a QOF partnership, as specified in each example; and each divisive corporate transaction satisfies the requirements of section 355.
(1)
Example 1. Determination of basis, holding period, and qualifying investment
—(i)
Facts.
A wholly and directly owns Q, a QOF corporation. On May 31, 2019, A sells a capital asset to an unrelated party and realizes $500 of capital gain. On October 31, 2019, A transfers unencumbered asset N to Q in exchange for a qualifying investment. Asset N, which A has held for 10 years, has a basis of $500 and a fair market value of $500. A elects to defer the inclusion of $500 in gross income under section 1400Z-2(a) and § 1.1400Z2(a)-1.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under § 1.1400Z2(a)-1(c)(6)(ii)(B)(
1
), A made a qualifying investment of $500. Under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(i), A's basis in its qualifying investment in Q is $0. For purposes of sections 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B) and 1400Z-2(c), A's holding period in its new investment in Q begins on October 31, 2019. See paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section. Other than for purposes of applying section 1400Z-2, A has a 10-year holding period in its new Q investment as of October 31, 2019.
(iii)
Transfer of built-in gain property.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section (this
Example 1
), but A's basis in transferred asset N is $200. Under § 1.1400Z2(a)-1(c)(6)(ii)(B)(
1
), A made a qualifying investment of $200 and a non-qualifying investment of $300.
(2)
Example 2. Transfer of qualifying investment
—(i)
Facts.
On May 31, 2019, taxpayer A sells a capital asset to an unrelated party and realizes $500 of capital gain. On October 31, 2019, A transfers $500 to newly formed Q, a QOF corporation, in exchange for a qualifying investment. On February 29, 2020, A transfers 25 percent of its qualifying investment in Q to newly formed Y in exchange for 100 percent of Y's stock in a transfer to which section 351 applies (Transfer), at a time when the fair market value of A's qualifying investment in Q is $800.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under § 1.1400Z2(a)-1(c)(6)(ii)(A), A made a qualifying investment of $500 on October 31, 2019. In the Transfer, A exchanged 25 percent of its qualifying investment for Federal income tax purposes, which reduced A's direct qualifying investment. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the Transfer is an inclusion event to the extent of the reduction in A's direct qualifying investment. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, A therefore includes in income an amount equal to the excess of the amount
described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section over A's basis in the portion of the qualifying investment that was disposed of, which in this case is $0. The amount described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) is the lesser of $125 ($500 × ($200/$800)) or $200. As a result, A must include $125 of its deferred capital gain in income in 2020. After the Transfer, the Q stock is not qualifying Q stock in Y's hands.
(iii)
Disregarded transfer.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section (this
Example 2
), except that Y elects to be treated as an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for Federal income tax purposes effective prior to the Transfer. Since the Transfer is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes, A's transfer of its qualifying investment in Q is not treated as a reduction in direct tax ownership for Federal income tax purposes, and the Transfer is not an inclusion event with respect to A's qualifying investment in Q for purposes of section 1400Z-2(b)(1) and paragraph (b) of this section. Thus, A is not required to include in income any portion of its deferred capital gain.
(iv)
Election to be treated as a corporation.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section (this
Example 2
), except that Y (a disregarded entity) subsequently elects to be treated as a corporation for Federal income tax purposes. A's deemed transfer of its qualifying investment in Q to Y under § 301.7701-3(g)(1)(iv) of this chapter is an inclusion event for purposes of section 1400Z-2(b)(1) and paragraph (b) of this section.
(3)
Example 3. Part sale of qualifying QOF partnership interest in Year 6 when value of the QOF partnership interest has increased
—(i)
Facts.
In October 2018, A and B each realize $200 of eligible gain, and C realizes $600 of eligible gain. On January 1, 2019, A, B, and C form Q, a QOF partnership. A contributes $200 of cash, B contributes $200 of cash, and C contributes $600 of cash to Q in exchange for qualifying QOF partnership interests in Q. A, B, and C hold 20 percent, 20 percent, and 60 percent interests in Q, respectively. On January 30, 2019, Q obtains a nonrecourse loan from a bank for $1,000. Under section 752, the loan is allocated $200 to A, $200 to B, and $600 to C. On February 1, 2019, Q purchases qualified opportunity zone business property for $2,000. On July 31, 2024, A sells 50 percent of its qualifying QOF partnership interest in Q to B for $400 cash. Prior to the sale, there were no inclusion events, distributions, partner changes, income or loss allocations, or changes in the amount or allocation of debt outstanding. At the time of the sale, the fair market value of Q's qualified opportunity zone business property is $5,000.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because A held its qualifying QOF partnership interest for at least five years, A's basis in its partnership interest at the time of the sale is $220 (the original zero basis with respect to the contribution, plus the $200 debt allocation, plus the 10% increase for interests held for five years). The sale of 50 percent of A's qualifying QOF partnership interest to B requires A to recognize $90 of gain, the lesser of $90, which is 50 percent of $180 (the $200 remaining deferred gain less the $20 five-year basis adjustment), or $390, which is the gain that would be recognized on a taxable sale of 50 percent of the interest. A also recognizes $300 of gain relating to the appreciation of its interest in Q.
(4)
Example 4. Sale of qualifying QOF partnership interest when value of the QOF partnership interest has decreased
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(3) of this section (
Example 3
), except that A sells 50 percent of its qualifying QOF partnership interest in Q to B for cash of $50, and at the time of the sale, the fair market value of Q's qualified opportunity zone business property is $1,500.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because A held its qualifying QOF partnership interest for at least five years, A's basis at the time of the sale is $220. Under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(A), the sale of 50 percent of A's qualifying QOF partnership interest to B requires A to recognize $40 of gain, the lesser of $90 (50 percent of the excess of A's $200 remaining deferred gain over A's $20 five-year adjustment) or $40 (the gain that would be recognized by A on a sale of 50 percent of its QOF interest). A's remaining basis in its qualifying QOF partnership interest is $110.
(5)
Example 5. Amount includible on December 31, 2026
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(3) of this section (
Example 3
), except that no sale of QOF interests takes place in 2024. Prior to December 31, 2026, there were no inclusion events, distributions, partner changes, income or loss allocations, or changes in the amount or allocation of debt outstanding.
(ii)
Analysis.
For purposes of calculating the amount includible on December 31, 2026, each of A's basis and B's basis is increased by $30 to $230, and C's basis is increased by $90 to $690 because they held their qualifying QOF partnership interests for at least seven years. Each of A and B is required to recognize $170 of gain, and C is required to recognize $510 of gain.
(iii)
Sale of qualifying QOF partnership interests.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section (this
Example 5
), except that, on March 2, 2030, C sells its entire qualifying QOF partnership interest in Q to an unrelated buyer for cash of $4,200. Assuming an election under section 1400Z-2(c) is made, the basis of C's Q interest is increased to its fair market value immediately before the sale by C. C is treated as purchasing the interest immediately before the sale and the bases of the partnership's assets are increased in the manner they would be if the
partnership had an election under section 754 in effect.
(6)
Example 6. Mixed-funds investment
—(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 2019, A and B form Q, a QOF partnership. A contributes $200 to Q, $100 of which is in exchange for a qualifying investment, and B contributes $200 to Q in exchange for a qualifying investment. All the cash is used to purchase qualified opportunity zone property. Q has no liabilities. On March 30, 2023, when the values and bases of the qualifying investments remain unchanged, Q distributes $50 to A.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (c)(6)(iv) of this section, A is a mixed-funds partner holding two separate interests, a qualifying investment and a non-qualifying investment. One half of the $50 distribution is treated under that provision as being made with respect to A's qualifying investment. For the $25 distribution made with respect to the qualifying investment, A is required to recognize $25 of gain.
(iii)
Basis adjustments.
Under paragraph (g)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, prior to determining the tax consequences of the distribution, A increases its basis in its qualifying QOF partnership interest by $25 under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(ii). The distribution of $25 results in no gain under section 731. After the distribution, A's basis in its qualifying QOF partnership interest is $0 ($25−$25).
(7)
Example 7. Qualifying section 381 transaction of a QOF corporation
—(i)
Facts.
X wholly and directly owns Q, a QOF corporation. On May 31, 2019, X sells a capital asset to an unrelated party and realizes $500 of capital gain. On October 31, 2019, X contributes $500 to Q in exchange for a qualifying investment. In 2020, Q merges with and into unrelated Y (with Y surviving) in a transaction that qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(A) (Merger). X does not receive any boot in the Merger with respect to its qualifying investment in Q. Immediately after the Merger, Y satisfies the requirements for QOF status under section 1400Z-2(d)(1) (see paragraph (c)(10)(i)(B) of this section).
(ii)
Analysis.
The Merger is not an inclusion event for purposes of section 1400Z-2(b)(1) and paragraph (b) of this section. See paragraph (c)(10)(i)(A) of this section. Accordingly, X is not required to include in income in 2020 its $500 of deferred capital gain as a result of the Merger. For purposes of section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B) and (c), X's holding period for its investment in Y is treated as beginning on October 31, 2019. For purposes of section 1400Z-2(d), Y's holding period in its assets includes Q's holding period in its assets, and Q's qualified opportunity zone business property continues to qualify as such. See paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(iii)
Merger of QOF shareholder.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section (this
Example 7
), except that, in 2020, X (rather than Q) merges with and into Y in a section 381 transaction in which Y acquires all of X's qualifying investment in Q, and Y does not qualify as a QOF immediately after the merger. The merger transaction is not an inclusion event for purposes of section 1400Z-2(b)(1) and paragraph (b) of this section. See paragraph (c)(10)(ii) of this section.
(iv)
Receipt of boot.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section (this
Example 7
), except that the value of X's qualifying investment immediately before the Merger is $1,000, X receives $100 of cash in addition to Y stock with a fair market value of $900 in the Merger in exchange for its qualifying investment, and neither Q nor Y has any earnings and profits. Under paragraph (c)(10)(i)(C) of this section, X is treated as disposing of 10 percent ($100/$1000) of its qualifying investment. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, X is required to include $50 ($500 × ($100/$1000)) of its deferred capital gain in income in 2020.
(8)
Example 8. Section 355 distribution by a QOF
—(i)
Facts.
A wholly and directly owns Q, a QOF corporation, which wholly and directly owns Y, a corporation that is a qualified opportunity zone business. On May 31, 2019, A sells a capital asset to an unrelated party and realizes $500 of capital gain. On October 31, 2019, A contributes $500 to Q in exchange for a qualifying investment. On June 26, 2025, Q distributes all of the stock of Y to A in a transaction in which no gain or loss is recognized under section 355 (Distribution). Immediately after the Distribution, each of Q and Y satisfies the requirements for QOF status. (See paragraph (c)(11)(i)(B)(
2
) of this section.)
(ii)
Analysis.
Because each of Q, the distributing corporation, and Y, the controlled corporation, is a QOF immediately after the Distribution, the Distribution is a qualifying section 355 transaction. Thus, the Distribution is not an inclusion event for purposes of section 1400Z-2(b)(1) and paragraph (b) of this section. See paragraph (c)(11)(i)(B) of this section. Accordingly, A is not required to include in income in 2025 any of its $500 of deferred capital gain as a result of the Distribution. For purposes of section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B) and (c), A's holding period for its qualifying investment in Y is treated as beginning on October 31, 2019. See paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.
(iii)
Section 355 distribution by a QOF shareholder.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(8)(i) of this section (this
Example 8
), except that A distributes 80 percent of the stock of Q, all of which is a qualifying investment in the hands of A, to A's shareholders in a transaction in which no gain or loss is recognized under section 355. At the time of the distribution, the fair market value of A's Q stock exceeds $500. The distribution is an inclusion event for purposes of section 1400Z-2(b)(1) and paragraph (b) of this section, and A is required to include in
income $400 (80 percent of its $500 of deferred capital gain) as a result of the distribution. See paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(11)(ii) of this section.
(iv)
Distribution of boot.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(8)(i) of this section (this
Example 8
), except that A receives boot in the Distribution. Under paragraphs (c)(8)(i) and (c)(11)(i)(B)(
3
) of this section, the receipt of boot in the Distribution is an inclusion event for purposes of section 1400Z-2(b)(1) and paragraph (b) of this section to the extent of gain recognized pursuant to section 301(c)(3).
(v)
Section 355 split-off.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(8)(i) of this section (this
Example 8
), except that Q stock is directly owned by both A and B (each of which has made a qualifying investment in Q), and Q distributes all of the Y stock to B in exchange for B's Q stock in a transaction in which no gain or loss is recognized under section 355. The distribution is a qualifying section 355 transaction and is not an inclusion event for purposes of section 1400Z-2(b)(1) and paragraph (b) of this section. Neither A nor B is required to include its deferred capital gain in income in 2025 as a result of the distribution.
(vi)
Section 355 split-up.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(8)(v) of this section (this
Example 8
), except that Q wholly and directly owns both Y and Z; Q distributes all of the Y stock to A in exchange for A's Q stock and distributes all of the Z stock to B in exchange for B's Q stock in a transaction in which no gain or loss is recognized under section 355; Q then liquidates; and immediately after the Distribution, each of Y and Z satisfies the requirements for QOF status. The distribution is a qualifying section 355 transaction and is not an inclusion event for purposes of section 1400Z-2(b)(1) and paragraph (b) of this section. Neither A nor B is required to include its deferred capital gain in income in 2025 as a result of the transaction.
(vii)
Section 355 split-off with boot.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(8)(v) of this section (this
Example 8
), except that B also receives boot. Under paragraph (c)(11)(i)(B)(
3
) of this section, B has an inclusion event and is treated as disposing of a portion of its qualifying investment that bears the same proportion to B's total qualifying investment immediately before the inclusion event as the fair market value of the boot bears to the fair market value of the total consideration received by B.
(9)
Example 9. Recapitalization
—(i)
Facts.
On May 31, 2019, each of A and B sells a capital asset to an unrelated party and realizes $500 of capital gain. On October 31, 2019, A contributes $500 to newly formed Q in exchange for 50 shares of class A stock of Q (A's qualifying investment) and B contributes $500 to Q in exchange for 60 shares of class B stock of Q (B's qualifying investment). A and B are the sole shareholders of Q. In 2020, B exchanges all of its class B stock of Q for 40 shares of class A stock of Q as well as other property in a transaction that qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(E).
(ii)
Analysis.
Because A did not receive any boot in the transaction, A does not have an inclusion event with respect to its qualifying investment in Q. See paragraph (c)(12)(i) of this section. Therefore, A is not required to include any of its deferred gain in income as a result of this transaction. However, under paragraph (c)(12)(ii) of this section, B has an inclusion event. If section 301 applies to the boot received by B, B has an inclusion event to the extent of its section 301(c)(3) gain. If section 356(a) or (c) applies to the boot received by B, B is treated as disposing of a portion of its qualifying investment that bears the same proportion to B's total qualifying investment immediately before the inclusion event as the fair market value of the boot bears to the fair market value of the total consideration received by B.
(10)
Example 10. Debt financed distribution
—(i)
Facts.
On September 24, 2019, A and B form Q, a QOF partnership, each contributing $200 that is deferred under the section 1400Z-2(a) election to Q in exchange for a qualifying investment. On November 18, 2022, Q obtains a nonrecourse loan from a bank for $300. Under section 752, the loan is allocated $150 to A and $150 to B. On November 30, 2022, when the values and bases of the investments remain unchanged, Q distributes $50 to A.
(ii)
Analysis.
A is not required to recognize gain under paragraph (c) of this section because A's basis in its qualifying investment is $150 (the original zero basis with respect to the contribution, plus the $150 debt allocation). The distribution reduces A's basis to $100.
(11)
Example 11. Debt financed distribution in excess of basis
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(10) of this section (
Example 10
), except that the loan is entirely allocated to B under section 752. On November 30, 2024, when the values of the investments remain unchanged, Q distributes $50 to A.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (c)(6)(iii) of this section, A is required to recognize $30 of eligible gain under paragraph (c) of this section because the $50 distributed to A exceeds A's $20 basis in its qualifying investment (the original zero basis with respect to its contribution, plus $20 with regard to section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iii)).
(g)
Basis adjustments
—(1)
Basis adjustments under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(ii) resulting from the inclusion of deferred gain
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, basis adjustments under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(ii) are made immediately
after the amount of gain determined under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(A) is included in income under section 1400Z-2(b)(1). If the basis adjustment under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(ii) is being made as a result of an inclusion event, then the basis adjustment is made before determining the other Federal income tax consequences of the inclusion event.
(ii)
Specific application to section 301(c)(3) gain, section 1059(a)(2) gain, S corporation shareholder gain, or partner gain
—(A)
Applicability.
This paragraph (g)(1)(ii) applies if a QOF makes a distribution to its owner, and if, without regard to any basis adjustment under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(ii), at least a portion of the distribution would be characterized as gain under section 301(c)(3), section 1059(a)(2), or paragraphs (c)(6)(iii) and (c)(7)(ii) of this section with respect to the owner's qualifying investment in the QOF.
(B)
Ordering rule.
If paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section applies, an eligible taxpayer is treated as having an inclusion event to the extent provided in paragraph (c)(6)(iii), (c)(7)(ii), or (c)(8), (9), (11), (12), or (13) of this section, as applicable. Then, the eligible taxpayer increases its basis under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(ii) before determining the Federal income tax consequences of the distribution.
(iii)
Shares in QOF C corporations to which section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(ii) adjustments are made.
If a shareholder of a QOF C corporation disposes of qualifying QOF stock in an exchange subject to section 1001, basis adjustments under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(ii) are made only to the portion of the qualifying investment that is disposed of in the inclusion event.
(2)
Amount of basis adjustment under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iii) and (iv).
The increases in basis under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iii) and (iv) are limited to 10 percent and 5 percent, respectively, of the remaining deferred gain with respect to a qualifying investment as of the dates on which basis is increased under that section.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section.
(i)
Example 1
—(A)
Facts.
On May 31, 2019, A, a C corporation, sells a capital asset to an unrelated party and realizes $500 of capital gain. On October 31, 2019, A contributes $500 to Q, a newly formed QOF C corporation, in exchange for all of the outstanding Q common stock and elects to defer the recognition of $500 of capital gain under section 1400Z-2(a) and § 1.1400Z2(a)-1. In 2020, when Q has $40 of earnings and profits, Q distributes $100 to A (Distribution).
(B)
Recognition of gain.
Under paragraph (g)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the Distribution is first evaluated without regard to any basis adjustment under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(ii). Of the $100 distribution, $40 is treated as a dividend and $60 is treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property under section 301(c)(3), because A's basis in its Q stock is $0 under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(i). Under paragraphs (c)(8)(i) and (e)(2) of this section, $60 of A's gain that was deferred under section 1400Z-2(a) and § 1.1400Z2(a)-1 is recognized in 2020. Pursuant to § 1.312-6(b), A's earnings and profits increase by $60.
(C)
Basis adjustments.
Under paragraph (g)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, prior to determining the further tax consequences of the Distribution, A increases its basis in its Q stock by $60 in accordance with section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(ii). As a result, the Distribution is characterized as a dividend of $40 under section 301(c)(1) and a return of basis of $60 under section 301(c)(2). Therefore, after the section 301 distribution, A's basis in Q is $0 ($60−$60).
(ii)
Example 2
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section (
Example 1
), except that, instead of receiving a distribution, A sells half of the Q stock for $250 in 2020. A continues to hold the remainder of its Q stock through 2024.
(B)
Recognition of gain and basis adjustments in 2020.
Under paragraphs (c)(1) and (e)(1) of this section, $250 of A's gain that was deferred under section 1400Z-2(a) and § 1.1400Z2(a)-1 is recognized in 2020. Under paragraphs (g)(1)(i) and (iii) of this section, A increases its basis to $250 in the sold shares in accordance with section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(ii) immediately before the sale. Accordingly, A has no gain or loss on the sale ($250−$250). Pursuant to § 1.312-6(b), A's earnings and profits increase by $250. A's basis in its remaining shares of Q stock remains $0.
(C)
Basis adjustment in 2024.
Under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, A increases its basis in its remaining shares of Q stock in accordance with section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iii). Pursuant to § 1.312-6(b), A's earnings and profits are increased by the amount of the basis adjustment.
(4)
Special partnership rules
—(i)
General rule.
The initial basis under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(i) of a qualifying investment in a QOF partnership is zero, as adjusted to take into account the
contributing partner's share of partnership debt under section 752.
(ii)
Treatment of basis adjustments.
Any basis adjustment to a qualifying investment in a QOF partnership described in section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iii) and (iv) and section 1400Z-2(c) is basis for all purposes, including for purposes of suspended losses under section 704(d).
(iii)
Tiered arrangements.
Any basis adjustment described in section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iii) and (iv) and section 1400Z-2(c) (basis adjustment rules) will be treated as an item of income described in section 705(a)(1) and must be reported in accordance with the applicable forms and instructions. Any amount to which the basis adjustment rules or to which section 1400Z-2(b)(1) applies will be allocated to the owners of the QOF, and to the owners of any partnership that directly or indirectly (solely through one or more partnerships) owns the eligible interest, and will track to the owners' interests, based on their shares of the remaining deferred gain to which such amounts relate.
(5)
Basis adjustments in S corporation stock
—(i)
Treatment of basis adjustments.
Any basis adjustment to a qualifying investment in a QOF S corporation described in section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iii) and (iv) and section 1400Z-2(c) is basis for all purposes, including for purposes of suspended losses under section 1366(d).
(ii)
S corporation investor in QOF
—(A)
S corporation.
If an S corporation is an investor in a QOF, the S corporation must adjust the basis of its qualifying investment as set forth in this paragraph (g). The rule in this paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(A) does not affect adjustments to the basis of any other asset of the S corporation.
(B)
S corporation shareholder
—(
1
)
In general.
The S corporation shareholder's pro-rata share of any recognized capital gain that has been deferred at the S corporation level will be separately stated under section 1366 when recognized and will adjust the shareholders' stock bases under section 1367 at that time.
(
2
)
Basis adjustments to qualifying investments.
Any adjustment made to the basis of an S corporation's qualifying investment under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iii) or (iv), or section 1400Z-2(c), will not:
(
i
) Be separately stated under section 1366; or
(
ii
) Until the date on which an inclusion event with respect to the S corporation's qualifying investment occurs, adjust the shareholders' stock bases under section 1367.
(
3
)
Basis adjustments resulting from inclusion events.
If the basis adjustment under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(ii) is being made as a result of an inclusion event, then the basis adjustment is made before determining the tax consequences of the inclusion event other than the computation of the tax on the deferred gain.
(iii)
QOF S corporation
—(A)
Transferred basis of assets received.
If a QOF S corporation receives an asset in exchange for a qualifying investment, the basis of the asset shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor, increased by the amount of the gain recognized by the transferor on such transfer.
(B)
Basis adjustments resulting from inclusion events.
If the basis adjustment under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(ii) for the shareholder of the QOF S corporation is being made as a result of an inclusion event, then the basis adjustment is made before determining the tax consequences of the inclusion event other than the computation of the tax on the deferred gain.
(6)
Basis in the hands of a taxpayer who received a qualifying investment in a QOF by reason of the prior owner's death
—(i)
In general.
The basis of a qualifying investment in a QOF, transferred by reason of a decedent's death in a transfer that is not an inclusion event, is zero under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(i), as adjusted for increases in basis as provided under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(ii) through (iv) and (c). See paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rule of this paragraph (g)(6).
(A)
Example 1.
Taxpayer A, an individual, contributed $50X to a QOF in exchange for a qualifying investment in the QOF in January 2019. This $50X was capital gain that was excluded from A's gross income under section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(A). A's basis in the qualifying investment is zero. As of January 2024, A's basis in the QOF is increased by an amount
equal to 10 percent of the amount of gain deferred by reason of section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(A), so that A's adjusted basis in 2024 is $5X. A dies in 2025 and A's heir inherits this qualifying investment in the QOF. A's death is not an inclusion event for purposes of section 1400Z-2. The heir's basis in the qualifying investment is $5X.
(B)
Example 2.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(6)(ii)(A) of this section (
Example 1
), except that A dies in November 2027, when the fair market value of the qualifying investment was $75X. A was required to pay the tax on the excess of the deferred capital gain over A's basis as part of A's 2026 income. Therefore, at the time of A's death, A's basis in the qualifying investment is the sum of three basis adjustments: The adjustment made in January 2024 described in paragraph (g)(6)(ii)(A) (
Example 1
) ($5X); an additional adjustment made as of January 2026 equal to 5 percent of the amount of gain deferred by reason of section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(A) ($2.5X); and the adjustment as of December 31, 2026, by reason of section 1400Z-2(b)(1)(B) and (b)(2)(B)(ii) ($42.5X). Accordingly, the basis of the qualifying investment in the hands of A's heir is $50X.
(h)
Notifications by partners and partnerships, and shareholders and S corporations
—(1)
Notification of deferral election.
A partnership that makes a deferral election must notify all of its partners of the deferral election and state each partner's distributive share of the deferred gain in accordance with applicable forms and instructions.
(2)
Notification of deferred gain recognition by indirect QOF owner.
If an indirect owner of a QOF partnership sells or otherwise disposes of all or a portion of its indirect interest in the QOF partnership in a transaction that is an inclusion event under paragraph (c) of this section, such indirect owner must provide to the QOF owner notification and information sufficient to enable the QOF owner, in a timely manner, to recognize an appropriate amount of deferred gain.
(3)
Notification of section 1400Z-2(c) election.
A QOF partner or QOF S corporation shareholder must notify the QOF partnership or QOF S corporation, as appropriate, of an election under section 1400Z-2(c) to adjust the basis of the qualifying QOF partnership interest or qualifying QOF stock, as appropriate, that is disposed of in a taxable transaction. Notification of the section 1400Z-2(c) election, and the adjustments to the basis of the qualifying QOF partnership interest(s) or qualifying QOF stock disposed of, or to the QOF partnership asset(s) or QOF S corporation asset(s) disposed of, as appropriate, is to be made in accordance with applicable forms and instructions.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Applicability dates
—(1)
In general.
The provisions of this section are applicable for taxable years beginning after March 13, 2020.
(2)
Prior periods.
With respect to the portion of a taxpayer's first taxable year ending after December 21, 2017, that began on December 22, 2017, and for taxable years beginning after December 21, 2017, and on or before March 13, 2020, a taxpayer may choose either—
(i) To apply section 1400Z-2 regulations, if applied in a consistent manner for all such taxable years; or
(ii) To rely on the rules in proposed § 1.1400Z2(b)-1 contained in the notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-120186-18) published on May 1, 2019, but only if applied in a consistent manner for all such taxable years.

# Editorial Note:
At 85 FR 19083, April 6, 2020, § 1.1400Z2(b)-1 was amended in part by revising paragraphs (j)(2) introductory text and (j)(2)(i); however, the amendment could not be incorporated due to inaccurate amendatory instruction.
§ 1.1400Z2(c)-1
Investments held for at least 10 years.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides rules under section 1400Z-2(c) of the Internal Revenue Code regarding the election to adjust the basis in a qualifying investment in a QOF or in certain eligible property held by the QOF. See § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(d) for rules for determining the holding period of a qualifying investment for purposes of this section.
(b)
Investment for which an election can be made
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Election by taxpayer.
An eligible taxpayer who makes a deferral election with respect to, or acquires by reason of a transaction that is not an inclusion event, a qualifying investment in a QOF, recognizes gain (if any) on December 31, 2026, of an amount determined under § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(e)(3) (and so much of § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(e)(4) as relates to
§ 1.1400Z2(b)-1(e)(3)) with respect to that qualifying investment, and whose holding period in that qualifying investment is at least ten years, is eligible to make an election described in section 1400Z-2(c) on the sale or exchange of that qualifying investment. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(1), to the extent a taxpayer described in the preceding sentence has an inclusion event described in § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c) with respect to any portion of a qualifying investment, that portion is no longer a qualifying investment and the taxpayer is not eligible to make an election pursuant to section 1400Z-2(c) and this section with respect to that portion. See § 1.1400Z2(c)-1(b)(2) for special election rules for QOF partnerships and QOF S corporations.
(ii)
Transferee partnership to make an election under section 1400Z-2(c)
—(A)
In general.
This paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) applies if an eligible taxpayer (transferor) transfers its qualifying investment to a transferee in a transaction described in § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c)(6)(ii) to the extent governed by section 721(a). If this paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) applies, and if the transferee sells or exchanges a qualifying investment that has a holding period of at least 10 years under § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(d)(1)(ii)(F), then the transferee can make an election described in section 1400Z-2(c) on the sale or exchange of the qualifying investment. See § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c)(6)(ii)(B) (transferee partnership makes section 1400Z-2(c) election regarding contributed qualifying investment).
(B)
Conditions for transferee partnership or merged partnership to make an election described in section 1400Z-2(c).
A transferee referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section is eligible to make an election described in section 1400Z-2(c) with respect to a qualifying investment only if the transferee:
(
1
) Files a statement, at the time and in the manner that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue may prescribe by Internal Revenue Service forms and instructions or by publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(ii)(b) of this chapter), providing the name of the transferor, the date of the transfer, and the transferor's holding period in the transferred qualifying investment immediately before the transfer; and
(
2
) Files form 8997,
Initial and Annual Statement of Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF) Investments,
with the transferee's timely filed Federal Tax Return.
(iii)
Limitation on the 10-year rule.
As required by section 1400Z-2(e)(1) (treatment of investments with mixed funds), section 1400Z-2(c) applies only to the portion of an investment in a QOF that is a qualifying investment. For rules governing the application of section 1400Z-2(c) to the portion of an investment in a QOF for which a loss has been claimed under section 165(g) or otherwise, see § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c)(14).
(iv)
Transactions to which section 301(c)(3), section 1059(a)(2), or section 1368(b)(2) or (c)(3) applies.
The receipt of amounts treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property under section 301(c)(3), section 1059(a)(2), or section 1368(b)(2) or (c)(3) with respect to qualifying QOF stock in a transaction treated as an inclusion event under § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c) does not prevent the QOF shareholder from making a subsequent election described in section 1400Z-2(c) with respect to that qualifying QOF stock.
(v)
Partnership distributions in excess of basis.
The occurrence of an inclusion event described in § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c)(6)(iii), which addresses a distribution of property by a QOF partnership to a QOF partner where the distributed property has a fair market value in excess of the QOF partner's basis in its qualifying investment, does not prevent the QOF partner from making a subsequent election described in section 1400Z-2(c) with respect to the QOF partner's qualifying QOF partnership interest.
(2)
Special election rules for QOF partnerships and QOF S corporations
—(i)
Dispositions of qualifying QOF partnership interests.
If a QOF partner's basis in a qualifying QOF partnership interest is adjusted under section 1400Z-2(c) upon the disposition of a qualifying investment, then the basis of the QOF partnership interest is adjusted to an amount equal to the net fair market value of the interest, plus the QOF
partner's share of QOF partnership indebtedness under section 752 with respect to that interest, and immediately prior to the sale or exchange, the bases of the assets of the QOF partnership and of any partnership owned directly or indirectly by the QOF partnership solely through one or more partnerships are also adjusted with respect to the disposed-of qualifying investment. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(i), section 7701(g) will apply in determining the value of a qualifying investment in a QOF partnership. The adjustments in this paragraph (b)(2)(i) are calculated in a manner similar to the section 743(b) adjustments that would have been made if the transferor QOF partner had purchased its interest in the QOF partnership for cash equal to the fair market value of the interest immediately prior to the sale or exchange, assuming that valid section 754 elections had been in place with respect to the QOF partnership and any partnerships directly or indirectly owned by the QOF partnership, whether or not an actual section 754 election is in place for any of the partnerships. This paragraph (b)(2)(i) applies without regard to the amount of deferred gain that was included under section 1400Z-2(b)(1) or the timing of that inclusion.
(ii)
Sales or exchanges of QOF property by QOF partnerships or QOF S corporations
—(A)
Election to exclude gains and losses.
If a taxpayer has held a qualifying investment in a QOF partnership or QOF S corporation for at least 10 years, as determined under § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(d), and the QOF partnership or QOF S corporation or any partnership that is owned directly, or indirectly solely through one or more partnerships, by the QOF partnership or QOF S corporation sells or exchanges property, the taxpayer may make an election under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) to exclude from the taxpayer's income all gains and losses allocable to the qualifying investment that arise from all such sales or exchanges for the QOF partnership's or QOF S corporation's taxable year. In order for the election to be valid, the requirements set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section must be satisfied. For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, gains and losses include all gains and losses other than gains or losses from the sale or exchange of any item of inventory, as defined in section 1221(a)(1), in the ordinary course of business.
(B)

In general.
If any partner of a QOF partnership, or shareholder of a QOF S corporation, makes an election under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the taxpayer is treated as receiving a distribution of cash as calculated under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section, from the QOF partnership or QOF S corporation at the end of the QOF partnership's or QOF S corporation's taxable year and immediately recontributing the cash to the QOF partnership or QOF S corporation in exchange for a non-qualifying investment in the QOF partnership or QOF S corporation. In determining the post-contribution qualifying investment and non-qualifying investment, the QOF will value each interest based on the underlying values of the QOF's assets determined at the end of its taxable year in accordance with the principles of § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) (in the case of a QOF partnership) or fair market value (in the case of a QOF S corporation). If the QOF partner or QOF S corporation shareholder is a mixed-funds partner or shareholder prior to the sale or exchange, the deemed distribution will be treated as made proportionately with respect to the partner's or shareholder's qualifying investment and non-qualifying investment in the QOF partnership in accordance with § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c)(6)(iv)(B), or the QOF S corporation. The distribution and recontribution rule of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section is solely for purposes of determining the taxpayer's interests in the QOF partnership or QOF S corporation that constitute a qualifying investment and a non-qualifying investment, and has no other Federal income tax consequence (for example, the rule does not affect the accumulated adjustments account of an S corporation and cannot be treated as a disproportionate distribution by an S corporation).
(

)
Amount of deemed distribution and re-contribution.
The amount of cash referred to in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section that is deemed distributed
by and recontributed to the QOF partnership or QOF S corporation is equal to—
(
i
) The partner's or shareholder's share of net proceeds from all sales and exchanges of property described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section (other than sales of inventory in the ordinary course of business) for the taxable year for which the election under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) is made (calculated without regard to whether any gain or loss is recognized with regard to such property); less
(
ii
) All actual distributions of cash by the QOF partnership or QOF S corporation with respect to any such sale or exchange that is made within 90 days of the sale or exchange.
(

)
Meaning of net proceeds
—(
i
)
QOF partnerships.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
)(
i
) of this section, with respect to QOF partnerships, the term “net proceeds” means the amount realized from the sale of property described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section less any indebtedness included in the amount realized that would constitute a qualified liability under § 1.707-5(a)(6) if the sold or exchanged property had been contributed to a lower-tier partnership subject to the debt.
(
ii
)
QOF S corporations.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
)(
i
) of this section, with respect to QOF S corporations, the term “net proceeds” means the amount realized from the sale of property described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section less any indebtedness included in the amount realized that would constitute a qualified liability under the principles of § 1.707-5(a)(6).
(C)
Treatment as exempt income
—(
1
)
General rule.
With respect to the taxpayer making an election under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the excess of any gains over losses excluded from income under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section is treated as income of the partnership or S corporation that is exempt from tax under the Internal Revenue Code for purposes of section 705(a)(1)(B) or section 1367(a)(1)(A). Section 265 or any similar provisions do not apply to disallow any deductions otherwise allowable under subtitle A for amounts paid or incurred by a taxpayer that are allocable to any gain excluded from income under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
(
2
)
Special rule regarding accumulated adjustments account.
Solely for purposes of determining whether an adjustment must be made to the accumulated adjustments account of an S corporation, the excess amount described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section is not treated as tax exempt income.
(D)
Time and manner of making the election to exclude gain.
An election under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section is made by filing the applicable form with the taxpayer's timely filed income tax return, without extensions, for its taxable year that includes the taxable year end of the QOF partnership or QOF S corporation. A taxpayer must make the election under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section for each taxable year in which it wishes to exclude gains and losses of a QOF partnership or QOF S corporation.
(3)
Basis adjustments upon sale or exchange of qualifying QOF stock
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, if a QOF shareholder's basis in qualifying QOF stock is adjusted under section 1400Z-2(c), then the basis of the qualifying QOF stock is adjusted to an amount equal to the fair market value of the qualifying QOF stock immediately prior to the sale or exchange. This paragraph (b)(3)(i) applies without regard to the amount of deferred gain that was included under section 1400Z-2(b)(1) or the timing of that inclusion.
(ii)
Specific application to transactions to which section 301(c)(3), section 1059(a)(2), or section 1368(b)(2) or (c)(3) applies
—(A)
Applicability.
This paragraph (b)(3)(ii) applies if a QOF corporation makes a distribution to a QOF shareholder, at least a portion of the distribution would be characterized as gain from a sale or exchange under section 301(c)(3), section 1059(a)(2), or section 1368(b)(2) or (c)(3) with respect to the QOF shareholder's qualifying QOF stock without regard to any basis adjustment under section 1400Z-2(c), and the QOF shareholder elects to adjust the basis of its qualifying QOF stock under section 1400Z-2(c).
(B)
Ordering rule.
If paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section applies with respect to a QOF corporation, the QOF
shareholder increases its basis by the lesser of the amount of the distribution characterized as gain from a sale or exchange or the fair market value of the QOF shareholder's qualifying QOF stock before determining the Federal income tax consequences of the distribution.
(c)
Extension of availability of the election described in section 1400Z-2(c).
The ability to make an election under section 1400Z-2(c) for investments held for at least 10 years is not impaired solely because, under section 1400Z-1(f), the designation of one or more qualified opportunity zones ceases to be in effect. The preceding sentence does not apply to elections under section 1400Z-2(c) that are related to dispositions occurring after December 31, 2047.
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.
(1)
Example 1
—(i)
Facts.
In 2020, taxpayer A invests $100 in QOF S, a QOF S corporation, in exchange for a qualifying investment and defers $100 of gain. At the end of 2028, the qualified opportunity zone designation expires for the population census tract in which QOF S primarily conducts its trade or business. In 2031, A sells all of its QOF S shares, realizes gain, and makes an election to increase the qualifying basis in its QOF S shares to fair market value. But for the expiration of the designated zones in section 1400Z-1(f), QOF S and A's conduct is consistent with continued eligibility to make the election under section 1400Z-2(c).
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (c) of this section, although the designation expired on December 31, 2028, the expiration of the zone's designation does not, without more, invalidate A's ability to make an election under section 1400Z-2(c). Accordingly, pursuant to that election, A's basis in the QOF stock is increased to its fair market value and A recognizes no gain or loss on the sale.
(2)
Example 2
—(i)
Facts.
In 2019, taxpayer A realizes $100 of eligible gain and contributes $100 to a QOF partnership, X, in exchange for a qualifying QOF partnership interest in X, and taxpayer B contributes $100 of eligible gain to another QOF partnership, Y, in exchange for a qualifying QOF partnership interest in Y. In 2021, in transactions governed by section 721(a), A contributes her qualifying QOF partnership interest in X, and B contributes her qualifying QOF partnership interest in Y, to a newly formed partnership, UTP. In 2024, C receives a profits interest in UTP for services that she will provide to UTP. In 2031, X sells a non-inventory asset and allocates X's distributive share of the gain to UTP. No distributions are ever made from X, Y, or UTP.
(ii)
Analysis.
On December 31, 2026, UTP recognizes $170 of remaining deferred gain relating to the QOF interests. Of that gain, A is allocated the $85 of gain relating to the $100 of eligible gain that she invested in X, and B is allocated the $85 of gain relating to the $100 of eligible gain that she invested in Y. C recognizes no gain at this time. In 2031, because UTP's holding period in X includes A's holding period in X, UTP has a holding period in X that exceeds 10 years, and may make an election under § 1.1400Z2(c)-1(b)(2)(ii)(A) to exclude the gain from X's asset sale. Even though A was the original investor in X, she may not make the election. If UTP makes the election, UTP will exclude its distributive share of gain from the sale of the X asset.
(3)
Example 3
—(i)
Facts.
In 2019, taxpayer B invests $100 in P, a QOF partnership, in exchange for a qualifying investment and properly makes an election under section 1400Z-2(a) to defer $100 of eligible gain. B's interest in the partnership is 50 percent. In 2030, when B's interest in P has a value of $130 and a basis of $100, B sells the interest, recognizing $30 of gain, $15 of which is attributable to inventory assets of P. B makes an election under section 1400Z-2(c) with respect to the sale.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because B's election under section 1400Z-2(c) is in effect with respect to the sale, the bases of B's interest in P and of P's assets with respect to the interest sold are adjusted to fair market value immediately before B's sale under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and B recognizes no gain or loss on the sale.
(4)
Example 4
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(3) of this section (
Example 3
), except that P sells qualified opportunity zone property that is not inventory sold in the ordinary course of business and distributes all of the proceeds from the sale to partners within 90 days of the sale (the qualified opportunity zone property was the only property sold by P in the taxable year). The sold property has a value of $60 and a basis of $40. P recognizes $20 of gain, $10 of which is allocable to B, and B makes an election under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section for the year in which B's allocable share of the partnership's recognized gain would be included in B's gross income.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because B's election under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section is in effect, B will exclude its entire $10 allocable share of the partnership's $20 of recognized gain. Because $10 of the sale proceeds were actually distributed to B within 90 days of the sale, P is not treated as making a deemed distribution and receiving a recontribution under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section with respect to B.
(5)
Example 5
—(i)
Facts.
In 2019, taxpayer C invests $100 in Q, a QOF partnership, in exchange for a qualifying investment and properly makes an election under section 1400Z-2(a) to defer $100 of eligible gain. C's interest in Q is 50%. Q's taxable year ends on December 31. In 2025, Q purchases three qualified opportunity zone properties, X, Y, and Z. On January 22, 2031, Q sells property X for $200, recognizing $140 of gain. On July 31, 2031, Q sells property Y for $80, recognizing $20 of loss. Q makes no distributions to its partners in 2031, has no indebtedness, and has no other gain or loss other than from the sales of properties X and Y. Property Z has a value of $280 at all times throughout 2031. C's share of Q's gain and loss is $70 and $10, respectively, for a net gain of $60, and C makes an election under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section to exclude the gains and losses from its income.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because C has made an election under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, C is treated as receiving a cash distribution of $140 from Q, C's share of the net proceeds from the sales of properties X and Y, on December 31, 2031, and immediately recontributing $140 to Q in exchange for a non-qualifying investment in Q. Beginning on January 1, 2032, 50 percent of A's interest in Q is a qualifying investment, and 50 percent of A's investment in Q is a non-qualifying investment. This amount is calculated as a fraction, the numerator of which is $140, the amount deemed distributed and recontributed, and the denominator of which is $280, the value of C's interest prior to the deemed distribution.
(6)
Example 6
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(5) of this section (
Example 5
), except that Q distributes all of the proceeds from the sale of property X to its partners on March 30, 2031. Q does not make any distribution of proceeds from the sale of property Y.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B)(
2
)(
ii
) of this section, the actual distribution of cash to C on March 30, 2031, reduces the amount of the deemed distribution and recontribution with respect to C on December 31, 2031. Accordingly, the amount of C's deemed distribution and recontribution is $40, which increases C's non-qualifying investment to 22 percent. This amount is calculated as a fraction, the numerator of which is $40, the amount deemed distributed and recontributed, and the denominator of which is $180, the value of C's interest.
(7)
Example 7. Section 301(c)(3) gain
—(i)
Facts.
In 2020, taxpayer X makes an investment in Q, a QOF corporation, in exchange for a qualifying investment. In 2031, when X's qualifying Q stock is worth $1000x, Q makes a distribution to X with respect to X's qualifying QOF stock, $500x of which is treated as gain from a sale or exchange under section 301(c)(3). In 2032, X disposes of all of its qualifying QOF stock in Q.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Section 301(c)(3) distribution.
X is eligible to make an election described in section 1400Z-2(c) in 2031 with respect to its $500x gain. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the basis adjustment is $500x, the lesser of $500x, the amount of the distribution treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property, and $1000x, the fair market value of the qualifying QOF stock before the distribution. As a result of the election, X increases its basis in its qualifying QOF stock in Q by $500x immediately before the distribution; consequently, the $500x is treated as a return of basis under section 301(c)(2).
(B)
Disposition of qualifying QOF stock.
X is eligible to make an election described in section 1400Z-2(c) in 2032 with respect to all of its qualifying QOF stock in Q, notwithstanding X's receipt of a section 301(c)(3) distribution in 2031. See paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section.
(e)
Capital gain dividends paid by a QOF RIC or QOF REIT that some shareholders may be able to elect to receive tax free under section 1400Z-2(c)
—(1)
Eligibility.
For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, if a shareholder of a QOF RIC or QOF REIT receives a capital gain dividend identified with a date, as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, then, to the extent that the shareholder's shares in the QOF RIC or QOF REIT paying the capital gain dividend are a qualifying investment in the QOF RIC or QOF REIT—
(i) The shareholder may treat the capital gain dividend, or part thereof, as gain from the sale or exchange of a qualifying investment on the date that the QOF RIC or
QOF REIT identified with the dividend; and
(ii) If, on the date identified, the shareholder had held that qualifying investment in the QOF RIC or QOF REIT for at least 10 years, then the shareholder may exclude that capital gain dividend, or part thereof, from its taxable income for the taxable year.
(2)
Definition of capital gain dividend identified with a date.
A
capital gain dividend identified with a date
means an amount of a capital gain dividend, as defined in section 852(b)(3)(C) or 857(b)(3)(B), or part thereof, and a date that the QOF RIC reports or QOF REIT designates in a notice provided to the shareholder not later than one week after the QOF RIC reports or QOF
REIT designates the capital gain dividend pursuant to section 852(b)(3)(C) or 857(b)(3)(B). The notice must be mailed to the shareholder unless the shareholder has provided the QOF RIC or QOF REIT with an email address to be used for this purpose. In the manner and at the time determined by the Commissioner, the QOF RIC or QOF REIT must provide the Commissioner all data that the Commissioner specifies with respect to the amounts of capital gain dividends and the dates reported or designated by the QOF RIC or QOF REIT for each shareholder.
(3)
General limitations on the amounts of capital gain with which a date may be identified
—(i)
No identification in the absence of any capital gains with respect to qualified opportunity zone property.
If, during its taxable year, the QOF RIC or QOF REIT did not recognize long-term capital gain on any sale or exchange of qualified opportunity zone property, then no date may be identified with any capital gain dividends, or parts thereof, with respect to that year.
(ii)
Proportionality.
Reportings and designations of capital gain dividends identified with a date must be proportional for all capital gain dividends paid with respect to the taxable year. See section 857(g)(2). Greater than
de minimis
violation of proportionality invalidates all of the purported identifications for a taxable year.
(iii)
Undistributed capital
g
ains.
If section 852(b)(3)(D)(i) or 857(b)(3)(C)(i) requires a shareholder of a QOF RIC or QOF REIT to include a reported or designated amount in the shareholder's long-term capital gain for a taxable year, then inclusion of this amount in this manner is treated as receipt of a capital gain for purposes of this paragraph (e) and may be identified with a date.
(iv)
Gross gains.
The amount determined under paragraph (e)(4) of this section is determined without regard to any losses that may have been recognized on other sales or exchanges of qualified opportunity zone property. The losses do, however, limit the total amount of capital gain dividends that may be reported or designated under section 852(b)(3) or section 857(b)(3).
(4)
Determination of the amount of capital gain with which a date may be identified.
A QOF RIC or QOF REIT may choose to identify the date for an amount of capital gain in one of the following manners:
(i)
Simplified determination.
If, during its taxable year, the QOF RIC or QOF REIT recognizes long-term capital gain on one or more sales or exchanges of qualified opportunity zone property, then the QOF RIC or QOF REIT may identify the first day of that taxable year as the date identified with each reported or designated amount with respect to the capital gain dividends for that taxable year. A reported or designated identification is invalid in its entirety if the amount of gains that the QOF RIC or QOF REIT identifies with that date exceeds the aggregate long-term capital gains recognized on those sales or exchanges for that taxable year.
(ii)
Sale date determination
—(A)
In general.
If, during its taxable year, the QOF RIC or QOF REIT recognizes long-term capital gain on one or more sales or exchanges of qualified opportunity zone property, then the QOF RIC or QOF REIT may identify capital gain dividends, or a part thereof, with the latest date on which there was such a recognition. The amount of capital gain dividends so identified must not exceed the aggregate long-term capital gains recognized on that date from sales or exchanges of qualified opportunity zone property. A reported or designated identification is invalid in its entirety if the amount of gains that the QOF RIC or QOF REIT identifies with that date violates the preceding sentence.
(B)
Iterative application.
The process described in paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(A) of this section is applied iteratively to increasingly earlier transaction dates (from latest to earliest) until all capital gain dividends are identified with dates or there are no earlier dates in the taxable year on which the QOF RIC or QOF REIT recognized long-term capital gains with respect to a sale or exchange of qualified opportunity zone property, whichever comes first.
(f)
Applicability dates.
The provisions of this section are applicable for taxable years beginning after March 13, 2020.

§ 1.1400Z2(d)-1
Qualified opportunity funds and qualified opportunity zone businesses.
(a)
Overview.
This section provides rules that an eligible entity (as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) must satisfy to be a qualified opportunity fund (QOF) or a qualified opportunity zone business. Paragraphs (a)(2) through (4) of this section provide rules that eligible entities must follow to be certified as QOFs, as well as rules for the de-certification of QOFs. Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules for determining whether the property held by a QOF satisfies the
90-percent investment standard
of section 1400Z-2(d)(1) or the property held by a qualified opportunity zone business satisfies the
70-percent tangible property standard
of section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(i). Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules regarding qualified opportunity zone property that a QOF must hold to satisfy the 90-percent investment standard. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules that an eligible entity must satisfy to be a qualified opportunity zone business that is owned, in whole or in part, by one or more QOFs. Paragraph (e) of this section provides applicability dates for this section. See § 1.1400Z2(d)-2 for rules that must be satisfied for tangible property of an eligible entity to be treated as qualified opportunity zone business property.
(1)
Eligible entity
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the term
eligible entity
means an entity that is classified as a corporation or partnership for Federal income tax purposes. In order to be treated as a QOF, an eligible entity must self-certify on an annual basis that it satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, as appropriate. An eligible entity is a qualified opportunity zone business if it satisfies the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.
(ii)
Exceptions based on where an entity is created, formed, or organized
—(A)
QOFs.
An entity classified as a corporation or partnership for Federal income tax purposes (an entity) but that is not organized under the law of the United States or the law of one of the 50 states, a government of a federally recognized tribe (Indian tribal government), the District of Columbia, or a U.S. territory, is not an eligible entity and is ineligible to be a QOF. An entity described in the preceding sentence is also ineligible to be a qualified opportunity zone business, and therefore an equity interest in the entity is neither qualified opportunity zone stock nor a qualified opportunity zone partnership interest for purposes of section 1400Z-2(d)(2).
(B)
Entities organized in a U.S. territory
—(
1
)
In general.
If an entity is organized in a U.S. territory but not in one of the 50 States or the District of Columbia, the entity may be a QOF only if the entity is organized for investing in qualified opportunity zone property that relates to a trade or business operated in the U.S. territory in which the entity is organized. If an entity is organized in a U.S. territory but not in one of the 50 States or the District of Columbia, an equity interest in the entity may be qualified opportunity zone stock or a qualified opportunity zone partnership interest, as the case may be, only if the entity conducts a qualified opportunity zone business in the U.S. territory in which the entity is organized. An entity described in the preceding sentence is treated as satisfying the requirement, as applicable, of being a domestic corporation for purposes of section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(B)(i) or of being a domestic partnership for purposes of section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(C).
(
2
)
U.S. territory defined.
For purposes of this paragraph (a)(1), the term
U.S. territory
means American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and any other territory not under the jurisdiction of one of the 50 States, an Indian tribal government, or the District of Columbia where a qualified opportunity zone has been designated under section 1400Z-1.
(iii)
Pre-existing entities.
There is no legal barrier to a pre-existing eligible
entity qualifying as a QOF or a qualified opportunity zone business, but the pre-existing eligible entity must satisfy all of the applicable requirements of section 1400Z-2, this section, and § 1.1400Z2(d)-2.
(2)
Self-certification as a QOF.
The following rules apply to the required self-certification of an eligible entity as a QOF:
(i)
Time, form, and manner.
The self-certification must be timely-filed and effected annually in such form and manner as may be prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner) in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) forms or instructions, or in publications or guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see §§ 601.601(d)(2) and 601.602 of this chapter).
(ii)
First taxable year.
The self-certification must identify the first taxable year for which the self-certification takes effect.
(iii)
First month.
The self-certification may identify the first month (in that initial taxable year) in which the self-certification takes effect.
(A)
Failure to specify first month.
If the self-certification fails to specify the month in the initial taxable year that the self-certification takes effect, then the self-certification is treated as taking effect in the first month of that taxable year.
(B)
Investments before entity's first month as QOF not eligible for deferral.
If an investment in eligible interests of an eligible entity occurs prior to the eligible entity's first month as a QOF, any election under section 1400Z-2(a)(1) made for that investment is invalid and the investment is a non-qualifying investment.
(iv)
Becoming a QOF in a month that is not the first month of the taxable year.
This paragraph (a)(2)(iv) applies to an eligible entity if its self-certification as a QOF is first effective for a month that is not the first month of that entity's taxable year.
(A) For purposes of applying section 1400Z-2(d)(1)(A) and (B) in the first year of the QOF's existence, the phrase
first six-month period of the taxable year of the fund
means the first six months each of which is in the taxable year and in each of which the entity is a QOF. Thus, if an eligible entity becomes a QOF in the seventh or later month of a 12-month taxable year, the 90-percent investment standard in section 1400Z-2(d)(1) takes into account only the QOF's assets on the last day of the QOF's taxable year.
(B) The computation of any penalty under section 1400Z-2(f)(1) does not take into account any months before the first month in which an eligible entity is a QOF.
(3)
Self decertification of a QOF.
If a QOF chooses to decertify as a QOF, the self-decertification must be effected in such form and manner as may be prescribed by the Commissioner in IRS forms or instructions or in publications or guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see §§ 601.601(d)(2) and 601.602 of this chapter.)
(4) [Reserved]
(b)
Valuation of property for purposes of the 90-percent investment standard and the 70-percent tangible property standard
—(1)
In general.
An eligible entity may value its owned or leased property using the valuation methods provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section to determine whether—
(i) In the case of an eligible entity that has self-certified as a QOF, the assets owned or leased by the QOF satisfy the 90-percent investment standard in section 1400Z-2(d)(1); and
(ii) In the case of an eligible entity that has issued qualified opportunity zone partnership interests or qualified opportunity zone stock to a QOF, the tangible property owned or leased by the eligible entity satisfies the
70-percent tangible property standard
in section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(i).
(2)
Special rules
—(i)
QOFs
—(A)
In general.
To meet the
90-percent investment standard
in section 1400Z-2(d)(1), on a semiannual basis, a QOF may value its assets using the applicable financial statement valuation method set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, if the QOF has an applicable financial statement within the meaning of § 1.475(a)-4(h), or the alternative valuation method set forth in paragraph
(b)(4) of this section. During each taxable year, a QOF must apply consistently the valuation method that it selects under paragraph (b) of this section to all assets valued with respect to the taxable year.
(B)
Option for QOFs to disregard recently contributed property.
A QOF may choose to determine compliance with the
90-percent investment standard
by excluding from both the numerator and denominator of the test any property that satisfies all the criteria in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(B)(
1
) through (

) of this section. A QOF need not be consistent from one semiannual test to another in whether it avails itself of the option in this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B).
(
1
) The amount of the property was received by the QOF partnership as a contribution or by the QOF corporation solely in exchange for stock of the corporation;
(
2
) The contribution or exchange occurred not more than 6 months before the test from which it is being excluded; and
(
3
) Between the date of the fifth business day after the contribution or exchange and the date of the semiannual test, the amount was held continuously in cash, cash equivalents, or debt instruments with a term of 18 months or less.
(C)
Safe harbor for QOFs to determine whether equity in an entity is qualified opportunity zone property.
A QOF may choose to determine compliance with the
90-percent investment standard
for each semiannual testing date of the QOF by including in both the numerator and denominator of the test the equity of each entity the QOF holds on that testing date that satisfies all the criteria in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C)(
1
) or (
2
) of this section.
(
1
) The entity was a qualified opportunity zone business for at least 90 percent of the QOF's cumulative holding period for that equity of the entity—
(
i
) Beginning on the date the QOF's self-certification as a QOF is first effective; and
(
ii
) Ending on the last day of the entity's most recent taxable year ending on or before the semiannual testing date of the QOF.
(
2
) An entity that would not be a qualified opportunity zone business as of the end of its last taxable year ending on or before a semiannual testing date of the QOF is a qualified opportunity zone business with respect to the QOF for that taxable year of the entity if—
(
i
) A cure is achieved for the entity under paragraph (d)(6) of this section; and
(
ii
) The QOF files its Federal income tax return for the taxable year of the QOF containing the testing date on a date that is timely (taking extensions into account) and that is not earlier than when that cure is achieved.
(ii)
Qualified opportunity zone businesses
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of the fraction set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the owned or leased tangible property of a qualified opportunity zone business may be valued using the applicable financial statement valuation method set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, if the qualified opportunity zone business has an applicable financial statement within the meaning of § 1.475(a)-4(h), or the alternative valuation method set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. During each taxable year, the valuation method selected under this paragraph (b) must be applied consistently to all tangible property valued with respect to the taxable year.
(B)
Five-percent zone taxpayer.
If a taxpayer both has self-certified as a QOF and holds an equity interest in an eligible entity that is tested as a qualified opportunity zone business, then that taxpayer may value the eligible entity's tangible property for purposes of satisfying the
70-percent tangible property standard
using the same valuation methodology under this paragraph (b) that the taxpayer uses for determining its own compliance with the 90-percent investment standard (compliance methodology), provided that no other equity holder in the eligible entity is a five-percent zone taxpayer. If two or more taxpayers that have self-certified as QOFs hold equity interests in the eligible entity and at least one of them is a five-percent zone taxpayer, then the values of the eligible entity's tangible property may be calculated using the compliance methodology that both is used by a five-percent zone taxpayer and that produces the highest
percentage of qualified opportunity zone business property for the eligible entity for purposes of the
70-percent tangible property standard.
A
five-percent zone taxpayer
is a taxpayer that has self-certified as a QOF and that holds stock in the entity (if it is a corporation) representing at least 5 percent in voting rights and value or holds an interest of at least 5 percent in the profits and capital of the entity (if it is a partnership).
(
1
)
Example.
The example in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section illustrates the principles of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.
(
2
)
Example.
Entity JH is a corporation that has issued only one class of stock and that conducts a trade or business. Taxpayer X holds 94% of the JH stock, and Taxpayer Y holds the remaining 6% of that stock. (Thus, both X and Y are five percent zone taxpayers within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.) JH does not have an applicable financial statement, and, for that reason, a determination of whether JH is conducting a qualified opportunity zone business may employ the compliance methodology of X or Y. X and Y use different compliance methodologies permitted under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section for purposes of satisfying the
90-percent investment standard
of section 1400Z-2(d)(1). Under X's compliance methodology (which is based on X's applicable financial statement), 65% of the tangible property owned or leased by JH's trade or business is qualified opportunity zone business property. Under Y's compliance methodology (which is based on Y's cost), 73% of the tangible property owned or leased by JH's trade or business is qualified opportunity zone business property. Because Y's compliance methodology would produce the higher percentage of qualified opportunity zone business property for JH (73%), both X and Y may use Y's compliance methodology to value JH's owned or leased tangible property. If JH's trade or business satisfies all additional requirements in section 1400Z-2(d)(3), the trade or business is a qualified opportunity zone business. Thus, if all of the additional requirements in section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(B) are satisfied, stock in JH is qualified opportunity zone stock in the hands of a taxpayer that has self-certified as a QOF.
(iii)
Inventory.
In determining whether the
90-percent investment standard
in section 1400Z-2(d)(1) or the
70-percent tangible property standard
in section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(i) is satisfied, an eligible entity may choose to exclude from both the numerator and denominator of the applicable test the value of all inventory (including raw materials) of the trade or business, if applied consistently within a taxable year of the eligible entity.
(3)
Applicable financial statement valuation method
—(i)
In general.
Under the applicable financial statement valuation method set forth in this paragraph (b)(3), the value of each property that is owned or leased by an eligible entity is the value of that asset as reported on the eligible entity's applicable financial statement for the relevant reporting period.
(ii)
Requirement for selection of method.
An eligible entity may select the applicable financial statement valuation method set forth in this paragraph (b)(3) to value an asset leased by the eligible entity only if the applicable financial statement of the eligible entity is prepared according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and requires an assignment of value to the lease of the asset.
(4)
Alternative valuation method
—(i)
In general.
Under the alternative valuation method set forth in this paragraph (b)(4), the value of the property owned by an eligible entity is calculated under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, and the value of the property leased by an eligible entity is calculated under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Property owned by an eligible entity
—(A)
Property purchased or constructed.
The value of each property owned by an eligible entity that is acquired by purchase for fair market value or constructed for fair market value is the eligible entity's unadjusted cost basis of the asset under section 1012 or section 1013. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A), the acquisition by a QOF of qualified opportunity zone stock or a qualified opportunity zone partnership interest is
treated as a purchase of such interest by the QOF.
(iii)
Property leased by an eligible entity
—(A)
In general.
The value of each property that is leased by an eligible entity is equal to the present value of the leased property as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(C) of this section.
(B)
Discount rate.
For purposes of calculating present value under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section, the discount rate is the short-term applicable Federal rate under section 1274(d)(1), based on semiannual compounding, for the month in which the eligible entity enters into the lease. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the three month rule in section 1274(d)(2) does not apply to determine the applicable Federal rate.
(C)
Present value.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section, present value of a leased property—
(
1
) Is equal to the sum of the present values of each payment under the lease for the property;
(
2
) Is calculated at the time the eligible entity enters into the lease for the property; and
(
3
) Once calculated, is used as the value for the property by the eligible entity for all testing dates during the term of the lease for purposes of the
90-percent investment standard
or the
70-perecent tangible property standard.
(D)
Term of a lease.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section, the term of a lease includes periods during which the lessee may extend the lease at a pre-defined market rate rent. For nonresidential real property or residential real property, pre-defined rent does not include the option to renew at fair market value, determined at the time of renewal. The terms of the pre-defined rent must satisfy the following criteria:
(
1
)
General rule.
The terms of the pre-defined rent are market rate (that is, the terms of the pre-defined rent reflect common, arms-length market pricing in the locale that includes the qualified opportunity zone as determined under section 482 and all section 482 regulations in this chapter) at the time the lease is entered into.
(
2
)
Rebuttable presumption regarding leases not between related persons.
There will be a rebuttable presumption that the terms of the extension of the lease are market rate for leases not between related persons (within the meaning of section 1400Z-2(e)(2)), and thus, the parties to the lease are not required to perform a section 482 analysis.
(
3
)
Exception for state, local, and Indian tribal governments.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(D), tangible property acquired by lease from a state or local government, or an Indian tribal government, is not considered tangible property acquired by lease from a related person.
(c)
Qualified opportunity zone property
—(1)
In general.
Pursuant to section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(A), the following property is
qualified opportunity zone property:
(i) Qualified opportunity zone stock as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section;
(ii) Qualified opportunity zone partnership interest as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and
(iii) Qualified opportunity zone business property as defined in § 1.1400Z2(d)-2.
(2)
Qualified opportunity zone stock
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, if an eligible entity is classified as a corporation for Federal income tax purposes (corporation), then an equity interest (stock) in the eligible entity is
qualified opportunity zone stock
if the requirements described in this paragraph (c)(2)(i) are satisfied:
(A)
Date of acquisition.
The stock is acquired by a QOF after December 31, 2017, at its original issue (directly or through an underwriter) from the corporation solely in exchange for cash;
(B)
Qualified opportunity zone business.
As of the time the stock was issued, the corporation was a qualified opportunity zone business as defined in section 1400Z-2(d)(3) and paragraph (d) of this section (or, in the case of a new corporation, the corporation was being organized for purposes of being such a qualified opportunity zone business); and
(C)
90-percent qualified opportunity zone property holding period
—(
1
)
Cumulative holding period test.
During at least 90 percent of the QOF's holding period for the corporation's stock, determined on a cumulative basis in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C)(
2
) of this
section, the corporation qualified as a qualified opportunity zone business.
(
2
)
Semiannual qualified opportunity zone business test.
For purposes of determining satisfaction of the cumulative 90-percent qualified opportunity zone property holding period test described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C)(
1
) of this section, the determination of whether a corporation engaged in a trade or business qualifies as a qualified opportunity zone business may be made by the QOF on a semiannual basis pursuant to section 1400Z-2(d)(1). However, a QOF may choose to apply the safe harbor rule in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section to make this determination.
(ii)
Redemptions of stock.
Pursuant to section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(B)(ii), the following rules apply for purposes of determining whether stock in a corporation qualifies as qualified opportunity zone stock:
(A)
Redemptions from taxpayer or related person.
Stock acquired by a QOF is not treated as qualified opportunity zone stock if, at any time during the 4-year period beginning on the date 2 years before the issuance of the stock, the corporation issuing the stock purchased either directly or indirectly any of its stock from the QOF or from a person related (within the meaning of section 1400Z-2(e)(2)) to the QOF. Even if the purchase occurs after the issuance, the stock was never qualified opportunity zone stock.
(B)
Significant redemptions
—(
1
)
In general.
Stock issued by a corporation is not treated as qualified opportunity zone stock if, at any time during the 2-year period beginning on the date one year before the issuance of the stock, the corporation made one or more purchases of more than a de minimis amount of its stock and the purchased stock has an aggregate value (as of the time of the respective purchases) exceeding 5 percent of the aggregate value of all of its stock as of the beginning of the 2-year period. The aggregate value is determined as of the time of the stock purchases. Even if one or more of the disqualifying purchases occurs after the issuance, the stock was never qualified opportunity zone stock.
(
2
)
De minimis amount.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B), stock acquired from the taxpayer or a related person exceeds a de minimis amount only if the aggregate amount paid for the stock exceeds $10,000 and more than 2 percent of the stock held by the taxpayer and related persons (within the meaning of section 1400Z-2(e)(2)) is acquired. The rules in the following sentences of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) apply for purposes of determining whether the 2-percent limit is exceeded. The percentage of stock acquired in any single purchase is determined by dividing the stock's value (as of the time of purchase) by the value (as of the time of purchase) of all stock held (directly or indirectly) by the taxpayer and related persons immediately before the purchase. The percentage of stock acquired in multiple purchases is the sum of the percentages determined for each separate purchase.
(C)
Treatment of certain transactions.
If any transaction is treated under section 304(a) as a distribution in redemption of the stock of any corporation, for purposes of paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, that corporation is treated as purchasing an amount of its stock equal to the amount that is treated as such a distribution under section 304(a).
(D)
Principles of § 1.1202-2(c) and (d).
The principles of § 1.1202-2(c) and (d) apply in determining whether stock is redeemed or purchased for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
(iii)
Reorganizations of corporations otherwise qualifying as qualified opportunity zone businesses
—(A)
Qualification as qualified opportunity zone stock.
Stock that meets all of the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section except for the requirement in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section is qualified opportunity zone stock if it is received solely in exchange for qualified opportunity zone stock in a transaction described in section 381(a)(2). The requirements in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(B) and (C) of this section must be met with respect to both the stock held before such transaction and the stock for which it is exchanged in such transaction.
(B)
Satisfaction of original use and substantial improvement tests.
The requirements of § 1.1400Z2(d)-2 apply to property of a qualified opportunity zone
business acquired from a qualified opportunity zone business in a transaction described in section 381(a)(2) as if the acquiring corporation had held the property during the period in which the target corporation held the property. For example, an item of property must be substantially improved by the same date by which the target corporation was required to satisfy the substantial improvement test for such property.
(C)
Reorganizations of qualified opportunity zone businesses within a consolidated group.
See §§ 1.1502-14Z and 1.1504-3 for special rules applicable to consolidated groups.
(3)
Qualified opportunity zone partnership interest
—(i)
In general.
If an
eligible
entity is classified as a partnership for Federal tax purposes (partnership), any capital or profits interest (partnership interest) in the eligible entity is a
qualified opportunity zone partnership interest
if—
(A)
Date of acquisition.
The partnership interest is acquired by a QOF after December 31, 2017, from the partnership solely in exchange for cash;
(B)
Qualified opportunity zone business.
As of the time the partnership interest was acquired, the partnership was a qualified opportunity zone business as defined in section 1400Z-2(d)(3) and paragraph (d) of this section (or, in the case of a new partnership, the partnership was being organized for purposes of being a qualified opportunity zone business); and
(C)
90-percent qualified opportunity zone property holding period
—(
1
)
Cumulative holding period test.
During at least 90-percent of the QOF's holding period for the partnership interest, determined on a cumulative basis in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C)(
2
) of this section, the partnership qualified as a qualified opportunity zone business.
(
2
)
Semiannual qualified opportunity zone business test.
For purposes of determining satisfaction of the cumulative 90-percent qualified opportunity zone property holding period test described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C)(
1
) of this section, the determination of whether a partnership engaged in a trade or business qualifies as a qualified opportunity zone business is made by the QOF on a semiannual basis pursuant to section 1400Z-2(d)(1). However, a QOF may choose to apply the safe harbor rule in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section to make this determination.
(ii)
Reorganizations of partnerships otherwise qualifying as qualified opportunity zone businesses
—(A)
Qualification as a qualified opportunity zone partnership interest.
A partnership interest that meets all of the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section except for the requirement in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section is a qualified opportunity zone partnership interest if it is received solely in exchange for a qualified opportunity zone partnership interest in a merger or consolidation transaction described in section 708(b)(2)(A). The requirements in paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(B) and (C) of this section must be met with respect to both the partnership interest held before the transaction and the partnership interest for which it is exchanged in the transaction.
(B)
Satisfaction of original use and substantial improvement tests.
The requirements of § 1.1400Z2(d)-2 apply to property of a qualified opportunity zone business acquired from a qualified opportunity zone business in a transaction described in section 708(b)(2)(A) as if the resulting partnership had held the property during the period in which the merging or consolidating partnership held the property. For example, an item of property must be substantially improved by the same date by which the merging or consolidating partnership was required to satisfy the substantial improvement test for such property.
(d)
Qualified opportunity zone business
—(1)
In general.
An eligible entity engaged in a trade or business within the meaning of section 162 is a
qualified opportunity zone business
if the entity satisfies, as determined at the end of its taxable year, all the criteria in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (
iii
) of this section. An eligible entity's status as a qualified opportunity zone business applies for the entire taxable year of the entity.
(i) Pursuant to section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(i), the eligible entity engaged in the trade or business satisfies the
70-percent tangible property standard
with
respect to its tangible property, as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section;
(ii) Pursuant to section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(ii), the eligible entity engaged in the trade or business satisfies the requirements of section 1397C(b)(2), (4), and (8), as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section; and
(iii) Pursuant to section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(iii), the eligible entity engaged in the trade or business is not described in section 144(c)(6)(B) as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(2)
Satisfaction of 70-percent tangible property standard
—(i)
In general.
A trade or business of an eligible entity satisfies the
70-percent tangible property standard
if at least 70 percent of the tangible property owned or leased by the trade or business is qualified opportunity zone business property (as defined in § 1.1400Z2(d)-2).
(ii)
Calculating percent of tangible property owned or leased in a trade or business
—(A)
In general.
Whether a trade or business of the eligible entity satisfies the
70-percent tangible property standard
set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section is determined by a fraction—
(
1
) The numerator of which is the total value of all tangible property owned or leased by the qualified opportunity zone business that is qualified opportunity zone business property; and
(
2
) The denominator of which is the total value of all tangible property owned or leased by the qualified opportunity zone business, whether located inside or outside of a qualified opportunity zone.
(B)
Valuation.
See paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section for rules regarding the valuation of tangible property for purposes of the
70-percent tangible property standard.
(3)
Operation of section 1397C requirements adopted by reference
—(i)
Gross income requirement.
Section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(ii) incorporates section 1397C(b)(2), requiring that for each taxable year at least 50 percent of the gross income of a qualified opportunity zone business is derived from the active conduct of a trade or business in the qualified opportunity zone (or in multiple qualified opportunity zones). A trade or business meets the 50-percent gross income requirement in the preceding sentence if the trade or business satisfies any one of the four criteria described in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A), (B), (C), or (D) of this section, or any criteria identified in published guidance issued by the Commissioner under § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter.
(A)
Services performed in qualified opportunity zone based on hours.
At least 50 percent of the services performed for the trade or business are performed in a qualified opportunity zone, determined by the fraction described in paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(A)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section. Amounts paid to partners that provide services to the trade or business of a partnership are taken into account in the numerator and denominator set forth in paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(A)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section only to the extent the amounts paid to the partners are guaranteed payments for services provided to the partnership within the meaning of section 707(c).
(
1
) The numerator of the fraction is the total number of hours of services performed for the trade or business in a qualified opportunity zone during the taxable year by employees, partners that provide services to a partnership, independent contractors, and employees of independent contractors; and
(
2
) The denominator of the fraction is the total number of hours of services performed for the trade or business during the taxable year by employees, partners that provide services to a partnership, independent contractors, and employees of independent contractors.
(B)
Services performed in qualified opportunity zone based on amounts paid for services.
At least 50 percent of the services performed for the trade or business are performed in a qualified opportunity zone, determined by the fraction described in paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(B)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section. Amounts paid to partners that provide services to the trade or business of a partnership are taken into account in the numerator and denominator set forth in paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(B)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section only to the extent the amounts paid to the partners are guaranteed payments for services provided to the
partnership within the meaning of section 707(c).
(
1
) The numerator of the fraction is the total amount paid by the entity for services performed in a qualified opportunity zone during the taxable year, whether by employees, partners that provide services to a partnership, independent contractors, or employees of independent contractors; and
(
2
) The denominator of the fraction is the total amount paid by the entity for services performed during the taxable year, whether by employees, partners that provide services to a partnership, independent contractors, or employees of independent contractors.
(C)
Necessary tangible property and business functions.
The tangible property of the trade or business located in a qualified opportunity zone and the management or operational functions performed in a qualified opportunity zone are each necessary for the generation of at least 50 percent of the gross income of the trade or business.
(D)
Facts and circumstances.
Based on all the facts and circumstances, at least 50 percent of the gross income of a qualified opportunity zone business is derived from the active conduct of a trade or business in a qualified opportunity zone.
(E)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(C) and (D) of this section.
(
1
)
Example 1.
A landscaping business has its headquarters in a qualified opportunity zone, its officers and employees manage the daily operations of the business (inside and outside the qualified opportunity zone) from its headquarters, and all its equipment and supplies are stored in the headquarters facilities. The activities occurring and the storage of equipment and supplies in the qualified opportunity zone are, taken together, necessary for the generation of the income of the business.
(
2
)
Example 2.
A trade or business is formed or organized under the laws of the jurisdiction within which a qualified opportunity zone is located, and the business has a P.O. Box located in the qualified opportunity zone. The mail received at that P.O. Box is fundamental to the income of the trade or business, but there is no other basis for concluding that the income of the trade or business is derived from activities in the qualified opportunity zone. The mere location of the P.O. Box is not necessary for the generation of gross income by the trade or business.
(
3
)
Example 3.
In 2019, Taxpayer X realized $w million of capital gains and within the 180-day period invested $w million in QOF Y, a qualified opportunity fund. QOF Y immediately acquired from partnership P a partnership interest in P, solely in exchange for $w million of cash. P is a real estate developer that has written plans to acquire land in a qualified opportunity zone on which it plans to construct a commercial building for lease to other trades or businesses. In 2023, P's commercial building is placed in service and is fully leased up to other trades or businesses. For the 2023 taxable year, at least 50 percent of P's gross income is derived from P's rental of its tangible property in the qualified opportunity zone. Thus, under P's facts and circumstances, P satisfies the gross income test under section 1397C(b)(2).
(ii)
Use of intangible property requirement
—(A)
In general.
Section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(ii) incorporates section 1397C(b)(4), requiring that, with respect to any taxable year, a substantial portion of the intangible property of a qualified opportunity zone business is used in the active conduct of a trade or business in a qualified opportunity zone. For purposes of section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(ii) and the preceding sentence, the term
substantial portion
means at least 40 percent.
(B)
Use of intangible property.
For purposes of section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(ii) and paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, intangible property of a qualified opportunity zone business is used in the active conduct of a trade or business in a qualified opportunity zone if—
(
1
) The use of the intangible property is normal, usual, or customary in the conduct of the trade or business; and
(
2
) The intangible property is used in the qualified opportunity zone in the performance of an activity of the trade or business that contributes to the generation of gross income for the trade or business.
(iii)
Active conduct of a trade or business
—(A)
Operating real property.
Solely for purposes of section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A),
the ownership and operation (including leasing) of real property is the active conduct of a trade or business.
(B)
Lessee is responsible for certain costs.
Merely entering into a triple-net-lease with respect to real property owned by a taxpayer does not constitute the active conduct of a trade or business by such taxpayer.
(C)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section.
(
1
)
Example 1. Mere triple-net-lease not active conduct of trade or business
—(
i
)
Facts.
Company N constructs and places into service a new, three-story office building in a qualified opportunity zone and leases the entire building to tenant X, an unrelated person, which uses the building as office space for its software development firm. This building is the only property owned by Company N. The lease agreement between Company N and tenant X is a triple-net-lease under which tenant X is responsible for all of the costs relating to the office building (for example, paying all taxes, insurance, and maintenance expenses) in addition to paying rent. Company N also maintains an office in the building with staff members to address any issues that may arise with respect to the triple-net-lease.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
Solely for purposes of section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A), Company N is treated as not engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business with respect to the leased office building. Company N leases the building to tenant X under a triple-net-lease, and therefore the employees of Company N do not meaningfully participate in the management or operations of the building. The fact that Company N maintains an office in the leased building with staff members to address any issues that may arise with respect to the triple-net-lease does not alter this result. Therefore, Company N does not conduct an active trade or business in a qualified opportunity zone.
(
2
)
Example 2. Triple-net-lease and managerial and operational activities can constitute active conduct of trade or business
—(
i
)
Facts.
Company N constructs and places into service a new, three-story mixed-use building in a qualified opportunity zone and leases a floor to each of unrelated tenants X, Y, and Z, respectively. This building is the only property owned by Company N. The lease agreement between Company N and tenant X is a triple-net-lease under which tenant X is responsible for all of the costs relating to the third floor of the building (for example, paying all such taxes, insurance, and maintenance expenses) in addition to paying rent. The lease agreement between Company N and tenant Y is not a triple-net-lease and employees of Company N manage and operate the second floor of the building. Likewise, the lease agreement between Company N and tenant Z is not a triple-net-lease and employees of Company N manage and operate the first floor of the building. Company N maintains an office in the building, which the employees regularly use to carry out their managerial and operational duties with respect to the first and second floors, and address any other issues that may arise with respect to the three leases.

Analysis.
Solely for purposes of section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A), Company N is treated as engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business with respect to the leased mixed-use building. While Company N leases the third floor of the building to tenant X merely under a triple-net-lease, and therefore the employees of Company N do not meaningfully participate in the management or operations of that floor, the employees of Company N meaningfully participate in the management and operations of the first and second floors of the leased building. Therefore, in carrying out the overall leasing business of Company N with respect to the mixed-use building, employees of Company N conduct meaningful managerial and operational activities. As a result, Company N conducts an active trade or business in a qualified opportunity zone.
(iv)
Nonqualified financial property limitation.
Section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(ii) incorporates section 1397C(b)(8), which requires that in each taxable year less than 5 percent of the average of the aggregate unadjusted bases of the property of a qualified opportunity zone business is attributable to nonqualified financial property. Section 1397C(e)(1), which defines the term
nonqualified financial property
for purposes of section
1397C(b)(8), excludes from that term reasonable amounts of working capital held in cash, cash equivalents, or debt instruments with a term of 18 months or less (working capital assets) and debt instruments described in section 1221(a)(4).
(v)
Safe harbor for reasonable amount of working capital.
Solely for purposes of applying section 1397C(e)(1) to the definition of a qualified opportunity zone business under section 1400Z-2(d)(3), working capital assets are treated as reasonable in amount for purposes of sections 1397C(b)(2) and 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(ii), if all of the requirements in paragraphs (d)(3)(v)(A) through (C) of this section are satisfied.
(A)
Designated in writing.
These amounts are designated in writing for the development of a trade or business in a qualified opportunity zone (as defined in section 1400Z-1(a)), including when appropriate the acquisition, construction, and/or substantial improvement of tangible property in such a zone.
(B)
Reasonable written schedule.
There is a written schedule consistent with the ordinary start-up of a trade or business for the expenditure of the working capital assets. Under the schedule, the working capital assets must be spent within 31 months of the receipt by the business of the assets.
(C)
Property consumption consistent.
The working capital assets are actually used in a manner that is substantially consistent with the writing and written schedule described in paragraphs (d)(3)(v)(A) and (B) of this section. If consumption of the working capital assets is delayed by waiting for governmental action the application for which is complete, that delay does not cause a failure of this paragraph (d)(3)(v)(C).
(D)
Federally declared disasters.
If the qualified opportunity zone business is located in a qualified opportunity zone within a federally declared disaster (as defined in section 165(i)(5)(A)), the qualified opportunity zone business may receive not more than an additional 24 months to consume its working capital assets, as long as it otherwise meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section.
(E)
Ability of a single business to benefit from more than a single application of the safe harbor.
A business may benefit from multiple overlapping or sequential applications of the working capital safe harbor, provided that each application independently satisfies all of the requirements in paragraphs (d)(3)(v)(A) through (C) of this section.
(vi)
Safe harbor for section 1397C requirements other than “sin business” prohibition
—(A)
Maximum 62-month safe harbor for start-up businesses.
Property described in paragraphs (d)(3)(vi)(B), (C), and (D) of this section may benefit from one or more 31-month periods, for a total of 62 months, in the form of multiple overlapping or a sequential application of the working capital safe harbor if—
(
1
) Each application independently satisfies all of the requirements in paragraphs (d)(3)(v)(A) through (C) of this section;
(
2
) The working capital assets from an expiring 31-month period were expended in accordance with the requirements in paragraphs (d)(3)(v)(A) through (C) of this section;
(
3
) The subsequent infusions of working capital assets form an integral part of the plan covered by the initial working capital safe harbor period; and
(
4
) Each overlapping or sequential application of the working capital safe harbor includes a substantial amount of working capital assets (which may include debt instruments described in section 1221(a)(4)).
(B)
Safe harbor for gross income derived from the active conduct of business.
Solely for purposes of applying the 50-percent test in section 1397C(b)(2) to the definition of a qualified opportunity zone business in section 1400Z-2(d)(3), if any gross income is derived from property that paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section treats as a reasonable amount of working capital, then that gross income is counted toward satisfaction of the 50-percent test.
(C)
Safe harbor for use of intangible property.
Solely for purposes of applying the use requirement in section 1397C(b)(4) to the definition of a qualified opportunity zone business under section 1400Z-2(d)(3), intangible property purchased or licensed by the trade or business, pursuant to the reasonable
written plan with a written schedule for the expenditure of the working capital, satisfies the use requirement during any period in which the business is proceeding in a manner that is substantially consistent with paragraphs (d)(3)(v)(A) through (C) of this section.
(D)
Safe harbor for working capital and property on which working capital is being expended—(1) Working capital for start-up businesses.
For start-up businesses utilizing the working capital safe harbor, if paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section treats property of an entity that would otherwise be nonqualified financial property as being a reasonable amount of working capital because of compliance with the three requirements of paragraphs (d)(3)(v)(A) through (C) of this section, the entity satisfies the requirements of section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(i) only during the working capital safe harbor period(s) for which the requirements of paragraphs (d)(3)(v)(A) through (C) of this section are satisfied; however such property is not qualified opportunity zone business property for any purpose.
(
2
)
Tangible property acquired with covered working capital.
For any eligible entity, if tangible property referred to in paragraph (d)(3)(v)(A) is expected to satisfy the requirements of section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i) as a result of the planned expenditure of working capital described in paragraph (d)(3)(v)(A), and is purchased, leased, or improved by the trade or business, pursuant to the written plan for the expenditure of the working capital, then the tangible property is treated as qualified opportunity zone business property satisfying the requirements of section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i), during that and subsequent working capital periods the property is subject to, for purposes of the
70-percent tangible property standard
in section 1400Z-2(d)(3).
(vii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraphs (d)(3)(v) and (vi) of this section.
(A)
Example 1. General application of working capital safe harbor

Facts.
QOF F creates a domestic C corporation E to open a fast-food restaurant and acquires almost all of the equity of E in exchange for cash. E has a written plan and a 20-month schedule for the use of this cash to establish the restaurant. Among the planned uses for the cash are identification of favorable locations in the qualified opportunity zone, leasing a building suitable for such a restaurant, outfitting the building with appropriate equipment and furniture (both owned and leased), necessary security deposits, obtaining a franchise and local permits, and the hiring and training of kitchen and wait staff. Not-yet-disbursed amounts were held in assets described in section 1397C(e)(1), and these assets were eventually expended in a manner consistent with the plan and schedule.
(

)
Analysis.
E's use of the cash qualifies for the working capital safe harbor described in paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section.
(B)
Example 2. Multiple applications of working capital safe harbor

Facts.
QOF G creates a domestic C corporation H to start a new technology company and acquires equity of H in exchange for cash on Date 1. In addition to H's rapid deployment of capital received from other equity investors, H writes a plan with a 30-month schedule for the use of the Date 1 cash. The plan describes use of the cash to research and develop a new technology (Technology), including paying salaries for engineers and other scientists to conduct the research, purchasing, and leasing equipment to be used in research and furnishing office and laboratory space. Approximately 18 months after Date 1, on Date 2, G acquires additional equity in H for cash, and H writes a second plan. This new plan has a 25-month schedule for the development of a new application of existing software (Application), to be marketed to government agencies. Among the planned uses for the cash received on Date 2 are paying development costs, including salaries for software engineers, other employees, and third-party consultants to assist in developing and marketing the new application to the anticipated customers. Not-yet-disbursed amounts that were scheduled for development of the Technology and the Application were held in assets described in section 1397C(e)(1), and these assets were eventually expended in a manner substantially consistent with the plans and schedules for both the Technology and the Application.
(

)
Analysis.
H's use of both the cash received on Date 1 and the cash received on Date 2 qualifies for the working capital safe harbor described in paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section.

Example 3. General application of working capital safe harbor
—(

)
Facts.
In 2019, Taxpayer H realized $w million of capital gains and within the 180-day period invested $w million in QOF T, a qualified opportunity fund. QOF T immediately acquired from partnership P a partnership interest in P, solely in exchange for $w million of cash. P immediately placed the $w million in working capital assets, which remained in working capital assets until used. P had written plans to acquire land in a qualified opportunity zone on which it planned to construct a commercial building. Of the $w million, $x million was dedicated to the land purchase, $y million to the construction of the building, and $z million to ancillary but necessary expenditures for the project. The written plans provided for purchase of the land within a month of receipt of the cash from QOF T and for the remaining $y and $z million to be spent within the next 30 months on construction of the building and on the ancillary expenditures. All expenditures were made on schedule, consuming the $w million. During the taxable years that overlap with the first 31-month period, P had no gross income other than that derived from the amounts held in those working capital assets. Prior to completion of the building, P's only assets were the land it purchased, the unspent amounts in the working capital assets, and P's work in process as the building was constructed.
(
2
)
Analysis
—P met the three requirements of the safe harbor provided in paragraphs (d)(3)(v)(A) through (C) of this section. P had a written plan to spend the $w received from QOF T for the acquisition, construction, and/or substantial improvement of tangible property in a qualified opportunity zone, as defined in section 1400Z-1(a). P had a written schedule consistent with the ordinary start-up for a business for the expenditure of the working capital assets. And, finally, P's working capital assets were actually used in a manner that was substantially consistent with its written plan and the ordinary start-up of a business. First, the $x million, the $y million, and the $z million are treated as reasonable in amount for purposes of sections 1397C(b)(2) and 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(ii). Second, because P had no other gross income during the 31 months at issue, 100 percent of P's gross income during that time is treated as derived from an active trade or business in the qualified opportunity zone for purposes of satisfying the 50-percent test of section 1397C(b)(2). Third, for purposes of satisfying the requirement of section 1397C(b)(4), during the period of land acquisition and building construction a substantial portion of P's intangible property is treated as being used in the active conduct of a trade or business in the qualified opportunity zone. Fourth, all of the facts described are consistent with QOF T's interest in P being a qualified opportunity zone partnership interest for purposes of satisfying the 90-percent investment standard in section 1400Z-2(d)(1).
(
3
)
Analysis if P had purchased an existing building.
The conclusions would also apply if P's plans had been to buy and substantially improve a pre-existing commercial building. In addition, the fact that P's basis in the building has not yet doubled would not cause the building to fail to satisfy section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i)(III).

Example 4. Multiple applications of working capital safe harbor to tangible property
—(

)
Facts.
QOF A forms a domestic C corporation B to develop a large mixed-use real estate development that will consist of commercial and residential real property, owning almost all of the equity of B in exchange for cash. To raise additional working capital for the mixed-use real estate development, B also will borrow cash under a new revolving credit agreement with an unrelated lender. B has a master written plan for the completion of the commercial and residential real property over a 55-month period. The plan provides that the commercial real property will be completed over a 30 month schedule and subsequently, the residential real property will be completed over a 25 month schedule. The plan further provides that a portion of the commercial real
property is unable to be used in a trade or business after the completion of the commercial real property since that portion of the commercial real property will be unusable during the residential construction phase. Pursuant to B's original master plan for the completion of the real estate development, QOF A acquires additional equity in B for cash after the completion of the commercial development phase, and B commences use of those working capital assets for residential development phase.
(
2
)
Analysis.
B's use of the cash for the commercial and residential phase qualified for the working capital safe harbor described in paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section. In addition, all of B's commercial real property developed pursuant to B's original master plan is treated as qualified opportunity zone business property under paragraph (d)(3)(vi)(D) of this section.
(viii)
Safe harbor for property on which working capital is being expended
—(A)
In general.
If paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section treats property that would otherwise be nonqualified financial property as being a reasonable amount of working capital because of compliance with the three requirements of paragraphs (d)(3)(v)(A) through (C) of this section and if the tangible property referred to in paragraph (d)(3)(v)(A) is expected to satisfy the requirements of section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i) as a result of the planned expenditure of those working capital assets, then tangible property purchased, leased, or improved by the trade or business, pursuant to the written plan for the expenditure of the working capital assets, is treated as qualified opportunity zone business property satisfying the requirements of section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i), during that and subsequent working capital periods the property is subject to, for purposes of the
70-percent tangible property standard
in section 1400Z-2(d)(3).

B also borrows cash and forms a domestic C corporation B to develop a large mixed-use real estate development that will consist of commercial and residential real property, owning almost all of the equity of B in exchange for cash. QOF A has a master written plan for the completion of the commercial and residential real property over a 55 month period. The plan provides that the commercial real property will be completed over a 30 month schedule and subsequently, the residential real property will be completed over a 25 month schedule. The plan further provides that a portion of the commercial real property is unable to be used in a trade or business after the completion of the commercial real property since that portion of the commercial real property will be unusable during the residential construction phase. Pursuant to B's original master plan for the completion of the real estate development, QOF A acquires additional equity in B for cash after the completion of the commercial development phase, and B commences use of those working capital assets for residential development phase.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
B's use of the cash for the commercial and residential phase qualified for the working capital safe harbor described in paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section. In addition, all of B's commercial real property developed pursuant to B's original master plan is treated as qualified opportunity zone business property under paragraph (d)(3)(viii) of this section.
(ix)
Real property straddling a qualified opportunity zone.
For purposes of satisfying the requirements in this paragraph (d)(3) in the case of real property that straddles a qualified opportunity zone, a qualified opportunity zone is the location of services, tangible property, or business functions if—
(A) The trade or business uses the portion of the real property located within a qualified opportunity zone in carrying out its business activities;
(B) The trade or business uses the real property located outside of a qualified opportunity zone in carrying out its business activities;
(C) The amount of the real property located within a qualified opportunity zone is substantial compared to the amount of real property located outside of a qualified opportunity zone; and
(D) The real property located in the qualified opportunity zone is contiguous to part, or all, of the real property located outside of the qualified opportunity zone.
(E) In general, one of the two methods in paragraph (d)(3)(ix)(E)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section may be chosen to determine whether the amount of real property located in the qualified opportunity zone is substantial compared to the amount of real property located outside the qualified opportunity zone.
(
1
)
Square footage test.
If the amount of real property based on square footage located within the qualified opportunity zone is greater than the amount of real property based on square footage outside of the qualified opportunity zone, and the real property outside of the qualified opportunity zone is contiguous to part or all of the real property located inside the qualified opportunity zone, then all of the property is deemed to be located within a qualified opportunity zone. The test in this paragraph (d)(3)(ix)(E)(
1
) is carried out at the time at which the subject real property is acquired.
(
2
)
Unadjusted cost test.
If the unadjusted cost of the real property located inside a qualified opportunity zone is greater than the unadjusted cost of the real property outside the qualified opportunity zone, and the real property outside of the qualified opportunity zone is contiguous to all or part of the real property located inside the qualified opportunity zone, then all of the property is deemed to be located within a qualified opportunity zone. The unadjusted cost basis of property acquired as a single tract is presumed to be allocated on the basis of the square footage of the property. The test in this paragraph (d)(3)(ix)(E)(
2
) is carried out at the time at which the subject real property is acquired.
(F) For purposes of the two tests described in paragraph (d)(3)(ix)(E)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section, two or more tracts or parcels of land are contiguous if they share common boundaries or would share common boundaries but for the interposition of a road, street, railroad, stream or similar property. Tracts or parcels of land which touch only at a common corner are not contiguous.

Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of paragraph (d)(3) of this section—
(A)
Facts.
In 2019, Taxpayer H realized $w million of capital gains and within the 180-day period invested $w million in QOF T, a qualified opportunity fund. QOF T immediately acquired from partnership P a partnership interest in P, solely in exchange for $w million of cash. P immediately placed the $w million in working capital assets, which remained in working capital assets until used. P had written plans to acquire land in a qualified opportunity zone on which it planned to construct a commercial building. Of the $w million, $x million was dedicated to the land purchase, $y million to the construction of the building, and $z million to ancillary but necessary expenditures for the project. The written plans provided for purchase of the land within a month of receipt of the cash from QOF T and for the remaining $y and $z million to be spent within the next 30 months on construction of the building and on the ancillary expenditures. All expenditures were made on schedule, consuming the $w million. During the taxable years that overlap with the first 31-month period, P had no gross income other than that derived from the amounts held in those working capital assets. Prior to completion of the building, P's only assets were the land it purchased, the unspent amounts in the working capital assets, and P's work in process as the building was constructed.
(B)
Analysis
—(
1
) P met the three requirements of the safe harbor provided in paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section. P had a written plan to spend the $w received from QOF T for the acquisition, construction, and/or substantial improvement of tangible property in a qualified opportunity zone, as defined in section 1400Z-1(a). P had a written schedule consistent with the ordinary start-up for a business for the expenditure of the working capital assets. And, finally, P's working capital assets were actually used in a manner that was substantially consistent with its written plan and the ordinary start-up of a business. Therefore, the $x million, the
$y million, and the $z million are treated as reasonable in amount for purposes of sections 1397C(b)(2) and 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(ii).
(
2
) Because P had no other gross income during the 31 months at issue, 100 percent of P's gross income during that time is treated as derived from an active trade or business in the qualified opportunity zone for purposes of satisfying the 50-percent test of section 1397C(b)(2).
(
3
) For purposes of satisfying the requirement of section 1397C(b)(4), during the period of land acquisition and building construction a substantial portion of P's intangible property is treated as being used in the active conduct of a trade or business in the qualified opportunity zone.
(
4
) All of the facts described are consistent with QOF T's interest in P being a qualified opportunity zone partnership interest for purposes of satisfying the
90-percent investment standard
in section 1400Z-2(d)(1).
(C)
Analysis if P had purchased an existing building.
The conclusions in paragraph (d)(3)(x)(B) of this section would also apply if P's plans had been to buy and substantially improve a pre-existing commercial building. In addition, the fact that P's basis in the building has not yet doubled would not cause the building to fail to satisfy section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i)(III).
(4)
Trade or businesses described in section 144(c)(6)(B) not eligible
—(i) Pursuant to section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(iii), the following trades or businesses, and businesses leasing more than a de minimis amount of property to the following trades or businesses, cannot qualify as a qualified opportunity zone business:
(A) Any private or commercial golf course;
(B) Country club;
(C) Massage parlor;
(D) Hot tub facility;
(E) Suntan facility;
(F) Racetrack or other facility used for gambling; or
(G) Any store the principal business of which is the sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption off premises.
(ii) De minimis amounts of gross income attributable to a business described in section 144(c)(6)(B) will not cause a trade or business to fail to be a qualified opportunity zone business.
(iii) The term
de minimis amount of property,
used in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, means less than 5 percent of the net rentable square feet for real property and less than 5 percent of the value for all other tangible property. The term
de minimis amount of gross income,
used in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section, means less than 5 percent of the gross income of the qualified opportunity zone business may be attributable to the types of business described in section 144(c)(6)(B).
(iv) The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (d)(4) of this section:
(A)
Example 1.
Entity A is a QOF that meets the requirements of section 1400Z-2(d)(1). Entity A owns qualified opportunity zone stock in a domestic corporation described in section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(B), which operates a hotel located in a qualified opportunity zone that qualifies as a trade or business. As part of that trade or business, the hotel operates a spa that provides massages and other therapies. Less than 5 percent of the hotel's total gross income is attributable to the spa, and less than 5 percent of the net rentable square feet for real property and less than 5 percent of the value for all other tangible property is attributable to the spa. As a result, the operation of the spa, which is a business described in section 144(c)(6)(B), will not prevent the operation of the hotel from qualifying as a qualified opportunity zone business.
(B)
Example 2
—(
1
)
Facts.
Entity B is a qualified opportunity zone business that meets the requirements of section 1400Z-2(d)(3). Entity B plans to acquire a commercial golf course that consists of land and other related buildings and equipment in a qualified opportunity zone, that will satisfy each requirement for qualified opportunity zone business property set forth in section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D). Instead of directly managing and operating the commercial golf course business, Entity B will lease the land and other related buildings and equipment to a third party to manage and operate the commercial golf course. The leased real property represents more than 5 percent of the net rentable square feet of Entity B's
real property and the leased and other tangible property represents more than 5 percent of the value for all other tangible property of Entity B.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Because a golf course is prohibited from being a qualified trade or business under section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(iii), the leasing arrangement will cause Entity B to fail to be a qualified opportunity zone business regardless of the satisfaction of each requirement set forth in section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D).
(C)
Example 3
—(
1
)
Facts.
Entity B meets the explicit requirements of section 1400Z-2(d)(1) and has certified itself as a QOF. Entity B owns a commercial golf course that consists of land and other related buildings and equipment in a qualified opportunity zone, and the land and buildings satisfy all explicit requirements (in section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)) to be qualified opportunity zone business property. Entity B manages and operates the commercial golf course business, but does not manage or operate any other trade or business not described in section 144(c)(6)(B) (listing businesses not eligible to be a qualified opportunity zone business pursuant to section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(iii)). Entity B chose to operate the commercial golf course through Entity B, rather than through a qualified opportunity zone business, in order to avoid the requirement in section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(iii), which provides that a qualified opportunity zone business cannot operate a commercial golf course due to the inclusion of that trade or business in section 144(c)(6)(B).
(
2
)
Analysis.
The ownership and operation of the golf course at the QOF level will not disqualify the QOF because the prohibition on businesses described in section 144(c)(6)(B) is not applicable at the QOF level. In addition, if each requirement set forth in section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D) is satisfied, the property used in the commercial golf course will qualify as qualified opportunity zone business property held by Entity B for purposes of section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(A).
(5)
Tangible property of a qualified opportunity zone business that ceases to be qualified opportunity zone business property.
For qualified opportunity zone businesses, tangible property that ceases to be qualified opportunity zone business property shall continue to be treated as qualified opportunity zone business property for the lesser of five years after the date on which such tangible property ceases to be so qualified or the date on which such tangible property is no longer held by the qualified opportunity zone business. However, tangible property is not eligible for the benefits provided in this paragraph (d)(5) unless the tangible property ceasing to qualify as qualified opportunity zone business property was qualified opportunity zone business property used by a qualified opportunity zone business in a qualified opportunity zone for two years. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(5), tangible property purchased, leased, or improved by a trade or business, that is treated as satisfying the requirements of section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i) during that working capital safe harbor period pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section or that 30-month substantial improvement period described in § 1.1400Z2(d)-2(b)(4), is not treated as used by a qualified opportunity zone business in a qualified opportunity zone for any portion of the two year period described in this paragraph (d)(5).
(6)
Cure period for qualified opportunity zone businesses.
(i) For purposes of the
90-percent qualified opportunity zone business holding period
requirements set forth in sections 1400Z-2(d)(2)(B)(i)(III), 1400Z-2(d)(2)(C)(iii), and 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i)(III), if a trade or business causes the QOF to fail the
90-percent investment standard
on a semiannual testing date, the QOF may treat the stock or partnership interest in that trade or business as qualified opportunity zone property for that semiannual testing date provided the trade or business corrects the failure within 6 months of the date on which the stock or partnership interest lost its qualification.
(ii) If the failure occurs on the last testing date of the taxable year, the six-month cure period described in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section is available to the QOF only if the QOF files a valid application for an extension of time to file its tax return.
(iii) Each QOF is permitted only one correction for a trade or business pursuant to this paragraph (d)(6). If the
entity, at the end of the additional six-month cure period, fails to qualify as a qualified opportunity zone business, then the QOF becomes subject to the penalty under section 1400Z-2(f)(1) for each month the entity failed to qualify as a qualified opportunity zone business beginning with the first month following the last month that the QOF met the
90-percent investment standard
.

At 85 FR 19083, April 6, 2020, § 1.1400Z2(d)-1 was amended in part by redesignating paragraphs (d)(3)(ix) and (x) as (d)(3)(viii) and (ix); however, the amendment could not be incorporated due to inaccurate amendatory instruction.
§ 1.1400Z2(d)-2
Qualified opportunity zone business property.
(a)
Qualified opportunity zone business property
—(1)
In general.
This section provides rules for determining whether owned or leased tangible property held by an eligible entity (within the meaning of § 1.1400Z2(d)-1(a)(1)) is qualified opportunity zone business property within the meaning of section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D). Paragraph (a)(2) of this section provides general requirements that tangible property must satisfy to be qualified opportunity zone business property. Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules related to owned tangible property. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules related to leased tangible property (that is, tangible property that the eligible entity acquires by lease from a lessor). Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules related to the 90-percent qualified opportunity zone business property holding period requirement and the 70-percent use test of section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i)(III). Paragraph (e) of this section provides the dates of applicability of this section.
(2)
Qualified opportunity zone business property requirements.
The term
qualified opportunity zone business property
means tangible property owned or leased by an eligible entity (as defined in § 1.1400Z2(d)-1(a)(1)) that—
(i) Is used by the eligible entity in a trade or business within the meaning of section 162; and
(ii) Satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, as applicable.
(b)
Tangible property owned by an eligible entity
—(1)
Purchase requirement
—(i)
In general.
In the case of tangible property that is owned by an eligible entity, the tangible property must be acquired by the eligible entity after December 31, 2017, by purchase as defined by section 179(d)(2) from a person that is not a related person within the meaning of section 1400Z-2(e)(2) (providing that persons are related to each other if such persons are described in section 267(b) or section 707(b)(1), determined by substituting “20 percent” for “50 percent” each place it appears in such sections).
(ii)
Plan, intent, or expectation for seller to repurchase acquired property.
In the case of real property that is purchased by an eligible entity, if, at the time of the purchase, there was a plan, intent, or expectation for the acquired real property to be repurchased by the seller of the real property for an amount of consideration other than the fair market value of the real property, determined at the time of the repurchase by
the seller, the purchased real property is not qualified opportunity zone business property.
(iii)
Property manufactured, constructed, or produced for use in a qualified opportunity zone
—(A)
In general.
In the case of tangible property manufactured, constructed, or produced by an eligible entity, if the property is manufactured, constructed, or produced for use by an eligible entity with the intent to use such property in a trade or business in a qualified opportunity zone, then such property satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section if the manufacture, construction, or production begins after December 31, 2017. The materials and supplies used to manufacture, construct, or produce qualified opportunity zone business property by the eligible entity must also be qualified opportunity zone business property.
(B)
Time when manufacture, construction or production considered to begin.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the acquisition date of such property is the date on which the manufacture, construction, or production of property (as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section) begins. The manufacture, construction, or production of property begins when physical work of a significant nature begins. Physical work does not include preliminary activities such as planning or designing, securing financing, exploring or researching. The determination of when physical work of a significant nature begins depends on the facts and circumstances. For example, if a factory is to be constructed on-site, construction begins when physical work of a significant nature commences at the site; this could occur, for example, when work begins on the excavation of footings, or the pourings of pads for the factory. Preliminary work, such as clearing or testing of soil condition, does not constitute the beginning of construction.
(C)
Safe harbor.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, a taxpayer may choose to determine when physical work of a significant nature begins in accordance with this paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(C). Physical work of a significant nature will not be considered to begin before the taxpayer incurs or pays more than 10 percent of the total cost of the property (excluding the cost of any land and preliminary activities such as planning or designing, securing financing, exploring, or researching).
(2)
Original use or substantial improvement requirement
—(i)
In general.
In the case of tangible property owned by the eligible entity either—
(A) The original use of the owned tangible property in the qualified opportunity zone, within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, must commence with the eligible entity; or
(B) The eligible entity must substantially improve the owned tangible property within the meaning of paragraph (b)(4) of this section (which defines substantial improvement in this context).
(ii)
Inventory.
Inventory (including raw materials) of a trade or business produced by an eligible entity after December 31, 2017, is deemed to satisfy the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)(i) of this section.
(3)
Original use of tangible property acquired by purchase
—(i)
Original use
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the original use of tangible property in a qualified opportunity zone commences on the date any person first places the property in service in the qualified opportunity zone for purposes of depreciation or amortization, or first uses it in a manner that would allow depreciation or amortization if that person were the property's owner.
(B)
Commencement of original use of vacant property.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), if real property, including land and buildings, has been vacant for an uninterrupted period of at least one calendar year beginning on a date prior to the date on which the qualified opportunity zone in which the property is located is listed as a designated qualified opportunity zone in a QOZ designation notice and the property has remained vacant through the date on which the property was purchased by the eligible entity, or if the property has been vacant for an uninterrupted three calendar year period beginning on a date after the date of
publication of the QOZ designation notice that lists as designated the qualified opportunity zone in which the property is located and the property has remained vacant through the date on which the property was purchased by the eligible entity, original use in the qualified opportunity zone commences on the date after that period when any person first so uses or places the property in service in the qualified opportunity zone. Such property must satisfy the definition of vacancy under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section.
(C)
Used tangible property.
Used tangible property satisfies the original use requirement if the property has not been previously so used or placed in service in the qualified opportunity zone. If the tangible property had been so used or placed in service in the qualified opportunity zone before it is acquired by purchase, it must be substantially improved in order to satisfy the requirements of section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i)(II).
(D)
Example.
The following example illustrates the principles of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section.
(
1
)
Facts.
On January 1, 2019, QOF A purchases from a developer a newly constructed hotel building located in a qualified opportunity zone for $10 million. The developer purchased a parcel of land in that qualified opportunity zone, and constructed the hotel building thereon, with the intent and expectation to sell the building to a QOF. As of the time of the purchase, the developer had not placed the hotel building in service in the qualified opportunity zone for purposes of depreciation. Other than the original use requirement, assume that the hotel building satisfies all requirements under section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D). In addition, assume that, at the time of the purchase, the developer had no plan, intent, or expectation to repurchase the hotel building.
(
2
)
Analysis.
At the time of QOF A's purchase of the hotel building, the original use of the hotel building had not commenced because the developer had not yet placed the hotel building into service for purposes of depreciation in a qualified opportunity zone. See paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section. Therefore, the original use of the hotel building in the qualified opportunity zone in which the building is located is treated as commencing with QOF A. See paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section. As a result, the hotel building purchased by QOF A is treated as satisfying the original use requirement of section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i)(II).
(ii)
Lessee improvements to leased property.
Improvements made by a lessee to leased property satisfy the original use requirement in section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i)(II) as purchased property for the amount of the unadjusted cost basis under section 1012 of such improvements.
(iii)
Vacancy.
Solely for purposes of meeting the requirements of section 1400Z-2, real property, including land and buildings, is considered to be in a state of vacancy if the property is significantly unused. A building or land will be considered significantly unused if more than 80 percent of the building or land, as measured by the square footage of useable space, is not currently being used.
(iv)
Brownfield sites.
An eligible entity that purchases a parcel of land that is a brownfield site, as defined by section 101 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601) (brownfield site), may treat all property composing the brownfield site (including the land and structures thereon) as satisfying the original use requirement of section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i)(II), if, within a reasonable period, the eligible entity makes investments in the brownfield site to ensure that all property composing the brownfield site meets basic safety standards for both human health and the environment.
(v)
Property involuntarily transferred to local government.
An eligible entity that purchases real property from a local government that the local government holds as the result of an involuntary transfer (including through abandonment, bankruptcy, foreclosure, or receivership) may treat all property composing the real property (including the land and structures thereon) as satisfying the original use requirement of section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i)(II).
(4)
Substantial improvement of tangible property acquired by purchase
—(i)
In
general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section, for purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, tangible property is treated as substantially improved by an eligible entity only if it meets the requirements of section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(ii) during the
30-month substantial improvement period.
The property has been substantially improved when the additions to basis of the property in the hands of the QOF exceed an amount equal to the adjusted basis of such property at the beginning of such 30-month period in the hands of the QOF (substantial improvement requirement).
(ii)
Treatment of property in the 30-month substantial improvement period.
For purposes of the
90-percent investment standard
under section 1400Z-2(d)(1), tangible property purchased, leased, or improved by a trade or business that is undergoing the substantial improvement process but has not yet been placed in service by the eligible entity or used in the eligible entity's trade or business is treated as satisfying the requirements of section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the
30-month substantial improvement period
with respect to that property provided the eligible entity reasonably expects that the property will be substantially improved as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section and used in the eligible entity's trade or business in a qualified opportunity zone by the end of such 30-month period. Tangible property described in the preceding sentence is not considered qualified opportunity zone business property for purposes of the special rule in section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(B) unless the tangible property is qualified opportunity zone business property for at least two years without regard to this paragraph (b)(4)(ii).
(iii)
Aggregation of original use property that improves the functionality of non-original use property
—(A)
General rule.
The cost of purchased property that would otherwise qualify as qualified opportunity zone business property may be taken into account in determining whether additions to the basis of non-original use property acquired by purchase satisfy the substantial improvement requirement under section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(ii), so long as the purchased property is located in the same qualified opportunity zone (or a contiguous qualified opportunity zone) as the non-original use property, is used in the same trade or business as the non-original use property, and improves the functionality of the non-original use property.
(B)
Improvement of non-original use real property.
If an eligible entity chooses to apply this paragraph (b)(4)(iii) to non-original use real property, the eligible entity must improve the non-original use real property by more than an insubstantial amount within the meaning of paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(C) of this section.
(C)
Effect on purchased property.
If an eligible entity chooses to apply this paragraph (b)(4)(iii), the purchased property that would otherwise qualify as qualified opportunity zone business property will not be treated as original use property, and instead the basis of that purchased property will be taken into account in determining whether additions to the basis of the non-original use property satisfy the requirements under section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i)(II) and (d)(2)(D)(ii).
(D)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section.

Example 1
—(

)
Facts.
On January 1, 2019, QOF A purchases the assets of a hotel business located in a qualified opportunity zone for $5 million. The purchased assets include land, a building, linens, furniture and other fixtures attached to the building. $1 million of the purchase price is allocated to land and the remaining $4 million is allocated to the building, furniture and fixtures. During the course of renovations over the 30-month substantial improvement period, the QOF spent $1 million replacing linens, mattresses and furniture, $500,000 on the purchase of new exercise equipment for a gym located in the hotel building, $1 million on renovations for a restaurant (including restaurant equipment) attached to the hotel, and $1.5 million on structural renovations to the hotel. The QOF chooses to apply paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section to determine whether the substantial improvement requirement in section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(ii) is met.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
In order for the hotel to be considered qualified opportunity zone business property, QOF A must substantially improve the hotel as the hotel had previously been placed in service in the qualified opportunity zone. (QOF A was not required to substantially improve the land on which the hotel was located pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section.) Because the amount of basis allocated to the hotel was $4 million, QOF A must expend $4 million to improve the hotel within the 30-month substantial improvement period provided in section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(ii). The new linens, mattresses and furniture, new exercise equipment, and new restaurant equipment all qualify as original use assets under section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i)(II). QOF A also substantially improved the hotel, which was the asset that needed to be improved under section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i)(II). QOF A chose, at the start of the 30-month period, to include the costs of the newly purchased assets that improve the functionality of the hotel to the basis of the hotel. Thus, the cost of these items is eligible to be added to the hotel's basis pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section. Therefore, QOF A has met the substantial improvement requirement under section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i)(II) by doubling its basis in the hotel and its fixtures within the 30-month substantial improvement period. The amounts spent replacing linens, mattresses, furniture, exercise equipment, and new restaurant equipment that were counted toward the substantial improvement requirement for the hotel are not considered original use assets for purposes of the
90-percent investment standard.

Purchase of unrelated property.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(D)(
1
)(
i
) of this section, except that in addition to purchasing the hotel and the related land, QOF A also purchases an apartment building one block away from the hotel for $10 million. The apartment building is located in the same qualified opportunity zone as the hotel.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
QOF A may not include any improvements made to the apartment building, including purchased property that improves the functionality of the apartment building, to the basis of the hotel. QOF A may choose, under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section, to include the purchased property that improves the functionality of the apartment building in the basis of the apartment building for purposes of the substantial improvement requirement under section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i)(II).
(iv)
Special rules for land and improvements on land
—(A)
Buildings located in a qualified opportunity zone.
In accordance with the rules set forth in this paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A), if an eligible entity purchases a building located on a parcel of land within the geographic borders of a qualified opportunity zone, for purposes of section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(ii), a substantial improvement to the building is measured by the eligible entity's additions to the basis of the building, as determined under section 1012.
(B)
Unimproved land.
Unimproved land that is within a qualified opportunity zone and acquired by purchase in accordance with section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i)(I) is not required to be substantially improved within the meaning of section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i)(II) and (d)(2)(D)(ii).
(C)
Exception for insubstantially improved land.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(B) of this section, if the land is unimproved or minimally improved and the eligible entity purchases the land with an expectation or an intention to not improve the land by more than an insubstantial amount within 30 months after the date of purchase, paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(B) of this section does not apply with respect to such land and such land is not considered qualified opportunity zone business property unless it is substantially improved within the meaning of sections 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i)(II) and (d)(2)(D)(ii). In determining whether an eligible entity had an expectation or an intention to improve the land by more than an insubstantial amount, improvements to the land by the eligible entity (including grading, clearing of the land, remediation of the contaminated land, or acquisition of related qualified opportunity zone business property that facilitates the use of the land in a trade or business of the eligible entity) will be taken into account.
(D)
Remediation of contaminated land.
Betterments to land within the meaning of § 1.263(a)-3(j)(1)(i) may be added to the basis of the purchased land and included for purposes of section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(ii) if the betterments are paid for by the eligible entity.
(E)
Separate improvement to underlying land not required.
In determining whether the substantial improvement test under section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D) has been met with respect to a building, there is no requirement that the eligible entity separately substantially improve the land upon which the building is located.
(v)
Aggregation of purchased buildings
—(A)
Substantial improvement requirement for eligible building group.
For purposes of applying the substantial improvement requirement under sections 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i)(II) and 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(ii), an eligible entity may apply paragraph (b)(4)(v)(D) of this section with respect to two or more buildings located within a qualified opportunity zone or a single series of contiguous qualified opportunity zones, as described in paragraph (b)(4)(v)(B) or (C) of this section (eligible building group), respectively.
(B)
Eligible building group located entirely within parcel of land described in single deed.
All buildings comprising an eligible building group may be treated as a single property as that term is used in section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(ii) (single property), if each building comprising the eligible building group is located entirely within the geographic borders of a parcel of land described in a single deed.
(C)
Eligible building group spanning contiguous parcels of land described in separate deeds.
An eligible entity may treat all buildings comprising an eligible building group located entirely within the geographic borders of contiguous parcels of land described in separate deeds as a single property to the extent each building is operated as part of one or more trades or businesses that—
(
1
) Are operated exclusively by the eligible entity;
(
2
) Share facilities or share significant centralized business elements, such as personnel, accounting, legal, manufacturing, purchasing, human resources, or information technology resources; and
(
3
) Are operated in coordination with, or reliance upon, one or more of the trades or businesses (for example, supply chain interdependencies or mixed-use facilities).
(D)
Calculation of aggregate building basis and additions to basis of single property
—(
1
)
In general.
For purposes of the substantial improvement requirement under section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(ii), the amount of basis required to be added to the portion of an eligible building group treated as a single property equals the total amount of basis calculated by adding the basis of each building comprising the single property at the beginning of the 30-month period and additions to the basis of each building comprising the single property are aggregated to determine satisfaction of the substantial improvement requirement.
(
2
)
Aggregation of original use property that improves the functionality of single property.
In applying paragraph (b)(4)(v)(D)(
1
) of this section, purchased property that would otherwise qualify as qualified opportunity zone business property may be taken into account in determining whether additions to the basis of a single property described in paragraph (b)(4)(v)(B) or (C) of this section satisfy the substantial improvement requirement under section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(ii).
(c)
Tangible property leased by an eligible entity.
In the case of tangible property with respect to which an eligible entity is a lessee—
(1)
Qualifying acquisition of possession.
The tangible property must be acquired by the eligible entity under a lease entered into after December 31, 2017.
(2)
Arms-length terms
—(i)
General rule.
The terms of the lease must be market rate (that is, the terms of the lease reflect common, arms-length market pricing in the locale that includes the qualified opportunity zone as determined under section 482 and all section 482 regulations in this chapter) at the time that the lease was entered into.
(ii)
Rebuttable presumption regarding unrelated persons.
There will be a rebuttable presumption that the terms of the lease were market rate for leases between persons not related within the
meaning of section 1400Z-2(e)(2) (unrelated persons), and thus, the parties to the lease are not required to perform a section 482 analysis.
(iii)
Exception for state, local, and Indian tribal governments.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), tangible property acquired by lease from a state or local government, or an Indian tribal government, is not considered tangible property acquired by lease from a related person within the meaning of section 1400Z-2(e)(2) (related person).
(3)
Additional requirements for tangible property leased from a related person.
If the lessor is a related person with respect to an eligible entity that is the lessee of tangible property, the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, as applicable, must be satisfied in order for the tangible property to be treated as qualified opportunity zone business property.
(i)
Prepayments of not more than one year.
The lessee at no time makes any prepayment in connection with the lease relating to a period of use of the tangible property that exceeds 12 months.
(ii)
Purchase of other qualified opportunity zone business property.
In the case of leased tangible property that is personal property, if the original use of the leased tangible personal property in a qualified opportunity zone (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section) does not commence with the lessee, the property is not qualified opportunity zone business property unless, during the relevant testing period (as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section), the lessee becomes the owner of tangible property that is qualified opportunity zone business property having a value not less than the value of that leased tangible personal property. There must be substantial overlap of the qualified opportunity zone(s) in which the owner of the tangible property so acquired uses it and the qualified opportunity zone(s) in which that person uses the leased tangible personal property.
(iii)
Original use of leased tangible property
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the original use of leased tangible property in a qualified opportunity zone commences on the date any person first places the property in service in the qualified opportunity zone for purposes of depreciation (or first uses the property in the qualified opportunity zone in a manner that would allow depreciation or amortization if that person were the property's owner).
(B)
Used leased tangible property.
Used leased tangible personal property can satisfy the original use requirement if the property has not been previously so used or placed in service in the qualified opportunity zone.
(iv)
Relevant testing period.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the
relevant testing period
is the period that begins on the date that the lessee receives possession under the lease of the leased tangible personal property and ends on the earlier of—
(A) The date 30-months after the date the lessee receives possession of the leased tangible personal property under the lease; or
(B) The last day of the term of the lease (within the meaning of § 1.1400Z2(d)-1(b)(4)(iii)(D)).
(4)
Plan, intent, or expectation for purchases not for fair market value.
In the case of real property that is leased by an eligible entity, if, at the time the lease is entered into, there was a plan, intent, or expectation for the real property to be purchased by the eligible entity for an amount of consideration other than the fair market value of the real property determined at the time of the purchase without regard to any prior lease payments, the leased real property is not qualified opportunity zone business property.
(d)
Holding period and use within a qualified opportunity zone of owned or leased tangible property
—(1)
In general.
In the case of tangible property that is owned or leased by an eligible entity, during substantially all of the eligible entity's holding period for the tangible property, substantially all of the use of the tangible property must be in a qualified opportunity zone.
(2)
Valuation of owned and leased property.
For purposes of the 70-percent use test in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the value of owned and leased property is required to be determined in accordance with the valuation methodologies provided in § 1.1400Z2(d)-1(b), and such
value in the case of leased tangible personal property is to be determined on the date the lessee receives possession of the tangible personal property under the lease.
(3)
Substantially all of an eligible entity's holding period for owned or leased tangible property
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of determining whether the holding period requirement in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is satisfied, the term
substantially all
means at least 90 percent. The holding period requirement is applied on a semiannual basis, based on the entire amount of time the eligible entity has owned or leased such property. Thus, on each semiannual testing date of the eligible entity, the tangible property satisfies the 90-percent qualified opportunity zone business property holding period requirement of section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i)(III) only if, during at least 90 percent of the period during which the QOF has owned or leased the property, the property has satisfied the 70-percent use test in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(ii)
Semiannual qualified opportunity zone business test.
For purposes of determining satisfaction of the 90-percent qualified opportunity zone business property holding period test described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section in the case of a QOF, the determination of whether property satisfies the 70-percent use test is made on a semiannual basis pursuant to section 1400Z-2(d)(1) and paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(4)
Substantially all of the use of owned or leased tangible property in a qualified opportunity zone
—(i)
Qualified tangible property.
Tangible property used in a trade or business of an eligible entity satisfies the
substantially all
requirement of paragraph (d)(1) of this section if and only if the tangible property is qualified tangible property. Qualified tangible property is tangible property that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (d)(4)(ii), (iii) (subject to the limitation in paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section), or (v) of this section.
(ii)
70-percent use test.
Tangible property held by a trade or business is qualified tangible property to the extent, based on the number of days between two consecutive semiannual testing dates, not less than 70 percent of the total utilization of the tangible property by the trade or business occurs at a location within the geographic borders of a qualified opportunity zone (that is, the 70-percent use test).
(iii)
Safe harbor for tangible property utilized in rendering services inside and outside of a qualified opportunity zone.
Subject to the limitation described in paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section, tangible property utilized by a trade or business in rendering services both inside and outside of the geographic borders of a qualified opportunity zone may be treated as qualified tangible property if—
(A) The tangible property utilized in rendering the service directly generates gross income for the trade or business both inside and outside of the geographic borders of a qualified opportunity zone;
(B) The trade or business has an office or other facility located within the geographic borders of a qualified opportunity zone (QOZ office);
(C) The tangible property is operated by employees of the trade or business who—
(
1
) Regularly use a QOZ office of the trade or business in the course of carrying out their duties; and
(
2
) Are managed directly, actively, and substantially on a day-to-day basis by one or more employees of the trade or business who carry out their duties at a QOZ office; and
(D) The tangible property is not operated exclusively outside of the geographic borders of a qualified opportunity zone for a period longer than 14 consecutive days for the generation of gross income for the trade or business.
(iv)
Limitation.
For purposes of the
70-percent tangible property standard,
the safe harbor provided in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section may not be used to treat more than 20 percent of the tangible property of the trade or business as qualified tangible property.
(v)
Safe harbor for tangible property owned by leasing businesses with QOZ offices.
Tangible property of a trade or business, the employees of which use a QOZ office of the trade or business to regularly lease such tangible property to customers of the trade or business,
may be treated as qualified tangible property if—
(A) Consistent with the normal, usual, or customary conduct of the trade or business, when not subject to a lease to a customer of the trade or business, the tangible property is parked or otherwise stored at a QOZ office; and
(B) No lease under which a customer of the trade or business acquires possession of the tangible property is for a duration (including extensions) longer than 30 consecutive days.
(vi)
Use of tangible property in one or more qualified opportunity zones.
In accordance with paragraphs (d)(4)(ii) through (v) of this section, if qualified tangible property is utilized by the trade or business in one or more qualified opportunity zones, satisfaction of the 70-percent use test is determined by aggregating the number of days the tangible property is utilized by the trade or business in each qualified opportunity zone.
(vii)
Real property straddling a qualified opportunity zone.
For purposes of satisfying the requirements in this paragraph (d), the rules of § 1.1400Z2(d)-1(d)(3)(ix) apply to a QOF or qualified opportunity zone business for determining whether real property is situated in a qualified opportunity zone.
(viii)
Safe harbor for inventory in transit
—(A)
In general.
In determining whether tangible property is used in a qualified opportunity zone for purposes of applying the 70-percent use test under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, inventory (including raw materials) of a trade or business does not fail to be used in a qualified opportunity zone solely because the inventory is in transit—
(
1
) From a vendor to a facility of the trade or business that is in a qualified opportunity zone; or
(
2
) From a facility of the trade or business that is in a qualified opportunity zone to customers of the trade or business that are not located in a qualified opportunity zone.
(B)
No effect from certain events in transit.
The distance traveled by the inventory while it is in transit, or the fact that the inventory is briefly warehoused while in transit, does not affect the application of the safe harbor described in paragraph (d)(4)(viii) of this section.
(e)
Applicability dates
—(1)
In general.
The provisions of this section are applicable for taxable years beginning after March 13, 2020.
(2)
Prior periods.
With respect to the portion of a taxpayer's first taxable year ending after December 21, 2017, and for taxable years beginning after December 21, 2017, and on or before March 13, 2020, a taxpayer may choose either—
(i) To apply the section 1400Z-2 regulations, if applied in a consistent manner for all such taxable years (reliance by a taxpayer on paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, § 1.1400Z2(a)-1(g)(2)(ii), § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(j)(2)(ii), § 1.1400Z2(d)-1(e)(2)(ii), or § 1.1400Z2(f)-1(d)(2)(ii), is disregarded solely for purposes of the consistency requirement under this paragraph (e)(2)(i)); or
(ii) To rely on the rules in proposed § 1.1400Z2(d)-1 contained in the notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-115420-18) published on October 29, 2018, as amplified by the notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-120186-18) published on May 1, 2019, but only if applied in a consistent manner for all such taxable years.

§ 1.1400Z2(e)-1
[Reserved]
§ 1.1400Z2(f)-1
Administrative rules- penalties, anti-abuse, etc.
(a)
In general.
Except as provided by § 1.1400Z2(d)-1(a)(2)(iv)(B) with respect to a taxpayer's first taxable year as a QOF, if a QOF fails to satisfy the 90-percent investment standard in section 1400Z-2(d)(1), then the QOF must pay the statutory penalty set forth in section 1400Z-2(f) for each month it fails to meet the 90-percent investment standard.
(b)
Time period for a QOF to reinvest certain proceeds
—(1)
In general.
If a QOF receives proceeds from the return of capital or the sale or disposition of some or all of its qualified opportunity zone property within the meaning of section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(A), and if the QOF reinvests some or all of the proceeds in qualified opportunity zone property by
the last day of the 12-month period beginning on the date of the distribution, sale, or disposition, then the proceeds, to the extent that they are so reinvested, are treated as qualified opportunity zone property for purposes of the 90-percent investment standard in section 1400Z-2(d)(1), but only to the extent that prior to the reinvestment in qualified opportunity zone property the proceeds are continuously held in cash, cash equivalents, or debt instruments with a term of 18 months or less. If reinvestment of the proceeds is delayed by waiting for governmental action the application for which is complete, that delay does not cause a failure of the 12-month requirement in this paragraph (b).
(2)
Federally declared disasters.
If the QOF's plan to reinvest some or all of the proceeds described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section in qualified opportunity zone property is delayed due to a federally declared disaster (as defined in section 165(i)(5)(A)), the QOF may receive not more than an additional 12 months to reinvest such proceeds, provided that the QOF invests such proceeds in the manner originally intended before the disaster.
(c)
Anti-abuse rules
—(1)
General anti-abuse rule.
Pursuant to section 1400Z-2(e)(4)(C), the rules of section 1400Z-2 and §§ 1.1400Z2(a)-1 through 1.1400Z2(d)-(2), 1.1400Z2(f)-1, 1.1502-14Z, and 1.1504-3 must be applied in a manner consistent with the purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations (as defined in § 1.1400Z2(a)-1(b)(41)). The purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations are to provide specified Federal income tax benefits to owners of QOFs to encourage the making of longer-term investments, through QOFs and qualified opportunity zone businesses, of new capital in one or more qualified opportunity zones and to increase the economic growth of such qualified opportunity zones. Accordingly, if a significant purpose of a transaction is to achieve a Federal income tax result that is inconsistent with the purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations, a transaction (or series of transactions) will be recast or recharacterized for Federal tax purposes as appropriate to achieve tax results that are consistent with the purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations. This recasting and recharacterization may include, as appropriate, treating an investment as other than a qualifying investment. A determination of whether a Federal income tax result is inconsistent with the purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations must be based on all facts and circumstances.
(2)
Special anti-abuse rule for partnerships
—(i)
In general.
In addition to being subject to the general anti-abuse rule of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the application of the rules of section 1400Z-2 and §§ 1.1400Z2(a)-1 through 1.1400Z2(d)-2, 1.1400Z2(f)-1, 1.1502-14Z, and 1.1504-3 to partnerships is also subject to the special anti-abuse rule set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Special partnership anti-abuse rule.
If a partnership is formed or availed of with a significant purpose of avoiding the requirements of § 1.1400Z2(a)-1(b)(11)(i)(B) that a gain be subject to Federal income tax in order to be an eligible gain, the partnership will be disregarded in whole or in part for purposes of § 1.1400Z2(a)-1(b)(11)(i)(B) and (b)(11)(ix)(B) to prevent the creation of a qualifying investment by the partnership with respect to any partner or partners that would not otherwise satisfy such requirements.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the anti-abuse rule of paragraph (c) of this section.
(i)
Example 1
—(A)
Facts.
Two nonresident alien individuals (collectively, the individuals) plan to sell stock at a gain of $50, to invest the amount of the resulting capital gain in a QOF, and to make a deferral election under section 1400Z-2(a). They make this election with the intent of holding the QOF investment for 10 years and then making an election to increase the qualifying basis to fair market value under section 1400Z-2(c). A gain on a sale of the stock by the individuals, however, would not be subject to Federal income tax, and so the gain would not support their making a deferral election as a result of the requirement in § 1.1400Z2(a)-1(b)(11)(i)(B). Instead of selling the stock themselves, the individuals form a domestic partnership
with a significant purpose of using that partnership to make a deferral election with respect to the stock under the exception in § 1.1400Z2(a)-1(b)(11)(ix)(B). The individuals contribute their stock to the partnership in exchange for partnership interests, after which the partnership sells the stock and invests the $50 gain in a QOF. Had the partnership not made a deferral election, the individuals would not be subject to tax on their allocated portion of the partnership's recognized gain on the sale of the stock.
(B)
Analysis.
Based on these facts, the partnership is formed and availed of with a significant purpose to avoid the requirements of § 1.1400Z2(a)-1(b)(11)(i)(B). Thus, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the partnership is disregarded for purposes of applying § 1.1400Z2(a)-1(b)(11)(ix)(B) to the $50 gain, and therefore the partnership's investment in the QOF is not a qualifying investment.
(ii)
Example 2
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section (
Example 1
), except the individuals contribute their stock to an existing partnership, the sole partners of which are U.S. citizens, with a significant purpose of the individuals' use of the partnership being to make an investment in a QOF and a deferral election under the § 1.1400Z2(a)-1(b)(11)(ix)(B) exception for partnerships. During the year, the partnership sells property it owned before the individuals' contribution, resulting in capital gain of $100, all of which is eligible to be invested in a QOF. It also sells the stock contributed by the individuals, resulting in $50 of capital gain. The partnership invests $150 in a QOF and makes the requisite gain deferral election.
(B)
Analysis.
Based on these facts, the partnership is availed of by the individuals with a significant purpose to avoid the requirements of § 1.1400Z2(a)-1(b)(11)(i)(B). Thus, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the partnership is disregarded for purposes of applying § 1.1400Z2(a)-1(b)(11)(i)(B) and (b)(11)(ix)(B) with respect to the $50 capital gain from the sale of the individuals' contributed stock and that gain fails to be eligible gain. Under § 1.1400Z2(a)-1(b), no section 1400Z-2(a) election is available for that gain and the partnership will have a mixed-funds investment, $100 of which is a qualifying investment and $50 of which is a non-qualifying investment.
(iii)
Example 3
—(A)
Facts.
Entity C is a QOF that meets the requirements of section 1400Z-2(d)(1). Entity C owns qualified opportunity zone stock in a domestic corporation described in section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(B) (Corporation C), which operates a qualified opportunity zone business. Entity C also owns Corporation D stock, which is not qualified opportunity zone stock, which stock is less than 10% of the assets of Entity C. Under section 1400Z-2(e)(2), these stock holdings cause Entity C to be related to both Corporation C and Corporation D. On date 1, under section 1400Z-2(e)(2), Individual S is not a related person with respect to Entity C, Corporation C, or Corporation D. On that date, Individual S sells tangible property to Corporation C (Asset 1) for use in Corporation C's qualified opportunity zone business and sells a second asset to Corporation D (Asset 2). Both items sold were capital assets (as defined in section 1221), and had an adjusted basis of $0. As a result, Individual S realizes gain of $100 from the sale to Corporation C and $75 from the sale to Corporation D. At the time of the sale Individual S has a plan or intent to invest $175 in Entity C and to make deferral elections under section 1400Z-2(a)(1) with respect to the gain from the two sales. On date 2, for $175 Individual S acquired an eligible interest in Entity C, an acquisition that causes Individual S to become a related person with respect to Entity C within the meaning of section 1400Z-2(e)(2).
Analysis.
Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, Individual S's $175 gain is not an eligible gain and cannot be the subject a deferral election under section 1400Z-2(a)(1). The gain fails to satisfy § 1.1400Z2a-1(b)(11)(i)(C) because of Individual S's plan to acquire sufficient equity in Entity C to become related to Corporations C and D. Moreover, for the same reason, the tangible property that Corporation C purchased from Individual S fails to satisfy the requirement that a purchase of qualified opportunity zone business property must
be from an unrelated person.
See
sections 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i)(I) and 179(d)(2)(A).
(B)
Circular movement of consideration.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section (this Example 3), except that Entity C contributes the $100 and $75 (received from Individual S) to Corporations C and D, respectively, as part of a plan that includes each transaction described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) (collectively, the transaction series). Under the step transaction doctrine and circular cash flow principles, this circular movement of consideration is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes, including for purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations. Therefore, the transaction series is treated for Federal income tax purposes as a contribution by Individual S of Assets 1 and 2 to Entity C in exchange for an eligible interest in Entity C, followed by a contribution by Entity C of Assets 1 and 2 to Corporations C and D, respectively. This result also would obtain if Individual S were not related to Entity C immediately following Individual S's acquisition of its eligible interest from Entity C.
See
Rev. Rul. 83-142, 1983-2 C.B. 68; Rev. Rul. 78-397, 1978-2 C.B. 150.
(iv)
Example 4
—(A)
Facts.
Entity D is a QOF that meets the requirements of section 1400Z-2(d)(1). Entity D owns a majority qualified opportunity zone partnership interest in a domestic partnership, Partnership D described in section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(C). Entity D organized Partnership D for the purpose of being a qualified opportunity zone business. Partnership D acquires a tract of land located in a qualified opportunity zone. At the time of the acquisition of that land, there was no plan or intent to develop or otherwise utilize the land in a trade or business that would increase substantially the economic productivity of the land. Instead, there was a plan to pave the land for use as a parking lot. Partnership D planned to install a gate to the paved parking area, a small structure that would serve as an office for a parking attendant, and two self-pay stations for use by customers. The parking lot was not reasonably expected to expand significantly, and the initial small number of employees was not reasonably expected significantly to increase. A significant purpose for the acquisition of the land was to sell the land at a profit and to exclude any gain from appreciation by making an election under section 1400Z-2(c).
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the acquisition of the land is a transaction carried out to achieve a tax result that is inconsistent with the purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations. Consequently, the land is not qualified opportunity zone business property and gain from the sale of the land will not be eligible to be excluded from gross income under section 1400Z-2(c). This recharacterization of the qualification of the land for Federal tax purposes is appropriate to ensure that the tax results of the transaction, including the status of Partnership D as a qualified opportunity zone business, are consistent with the purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations. Partnership D fails to be a qualified opportunity zone business unless other assets that it owns or leases are qualified opportunity zone business property that satisfy section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(i), and the other requirements of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations.
(v)
Example 5
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section, except that Partnership D, in year 1, acquired a tract of land located in a qualified opportunity zone that was previously used for hog and pig farming. On its Form 1065T the previous owner, also a partnership, properly described those activities with the principal business activity code 112210. During the several-year period ending on the date of the acquisition of the land, the value of the land had significantly increased and D projected the land to continue to increase in value by ten-fold during the following 10-year period. At the time of the acquisition, Partnership D intended to conduct sheep and goat farming activities on the land and, accordingly, planned to use principal business activity code 112400 on its Form 1065. According to its plan, Partnership D conducted sheep and goat farming activities on the land during the 10-year period beginning on the date of acquisition of
the land. During the 10-year period, Partnership D made significant capital improvements to the land, including improvements to existing farm structures, construction of new farm structures, and installation of a new irrigation system. As expected, the value of the land substantially increased during the following decade. The owners' entire interest in Partnership D was a qualifying investment, and, after having held it for at least 10 years the owners sold the entire interest at a large gain. As planned the owners made an election under section 1400Z-2(c) in order to avoid tax on the gain from the sale.
(B)
Analysis.
The modification of the land to suit sheep and goat farming activity from its previous use of hog and pig farming, and the significant capital improvements made to land, comprise a significant investment in the business activities on the land. Thus, Partnership D did not hold the land solely for speculative investment. As a result, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the acquisition of the land, the activities conducted on the land, the capital improvements made to the land, and the later disposition of the land for a significant profit are not inconsistent with the purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations.
(vi)
Example 6
—(A)
Facts.
Individuals intend to sell stock at a capital gain and invest the resulting gain in a QOF pursuant to a deferral election under section 1400Z-2(a). The individuals form Entity F and file Form 8996 certifying that Entity F is a QOF organized for the purpose of investing in qualified opportunity zone property. Individuals have no intention of investing in qualified opportunity zone property. Instead individuals intend to invest in property other than qualified opportunity zone property hoping that the property will appreciate substantially in value and the individuals will be able to exclude any appreciation on their investment from gross income by making an election under section 1400Z-2(c). Each year Entity F files Form 8996 and pays the applicable penalty under section 1400Z-2(f). After holding their interests in Entity F for 10 years, individuals sell their interest in Entity F to an unrelated third party for a substantial gain and make an election to exclude the appreciation on their investment under section 1400Z-2(c).
(B)
Analysis.
A significant purpose of the transaction is to achieve a tax result that is inconsistent with the purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations, and the transaction will be recast and recharacterized for Federal tax purposes so that Entity F is not a QOF and the individuals are not eligible for the elections under sections 1400Z-2(a) and (c).
(vii)
Example 7
—(A)
Facts.
Entity E treats itself as a QOF that meets the requirements of section 1400Z-2(d)(1). Entity E owns all of the stock in a domestic corporation, Corporation E, and Entity E treats this stock as qualified opportunity zone stock. Corporation E uses the majority of the cash invested by Entity E to purchase gold bars from unrelated parties within the meaning of section 1400Z-2(e)(2). The aggregate value of the gold bars is $1000. Corporation E rents a safe deposit box in a qualified opportunity zone and hires one employee to manage the purchase and sale of the gold bars. Each year Corporation E purchases a small number of additional gold bars and sells to customers a portion of the gold bars on hand. The aggregate value of both the purchases and sales approximates half the value of the bars held at the beginning of the year. Corporation E seeks to treat the gold bars as qualified opportunity zone business property within the meaning of section 1400Z-2(d)(3). At the time that Corporation E began the gold bar business, it did not reasonably expect the business to expand significantly, nor was the number of employees reasonably expected to increase. Gold, however, was reasonably expected to appreciate. Ten years after the formation of Entity E, the investors in Entity E sell all of their interests in the entity and seek to make an election under section 1400Z-2(c) to exclude any gain from appreciation.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a significant purpose of Corporation E's activities is to achieve a tax result that is inconsistent with the purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations. The gold bar business carried out by Corporation E was merely speculative in nature and
was not expected to increase economic activity in the subject qualified opportunity zone in a manner consistent with the purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations. As a result, Corporation E's activities are carried on to achieve tax results that are inconsistent with the purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations. Consequently, the gold bars are not qualified opportunity zone property. Corporation E fails to be a qualified opportunity zone business unless other assets that it owns or leases are qualified opportunity zone business property that satisfy section 1400Z-2(d)(3)(A)(i) (along with other requirements). If Corporation E fails to be a qualified opportunity zone business, Corporation E's stock fails to be qualified opportunity zone property in the hands of Entity E.
(d)
Applicability date

In general.
The provisions of this section are applicable for taxable years beginning after March 13, 2020.
(2)
Prior periods.
With respect to the portion of a taxpayer's first taxable year ending after December 21, 2017, that began on March 13, 2020, a taxpayer may choose either—
(i) To apply the section 1400Z-2 regulations, if applied in a consistent manner for all such taxable years (reliance by a taxpayer on paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, § 1.1400Z2(a)-1(g)(2)(ii), § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(j)(2)(ii), § 1.1400Z2(d)-1(e)(2)(ii), or § 1.1400Z2(d)-2(e)(2)(ii), is disregarded for purposes of the consistency requirement under this paragraph (d)(2)(i)); or
(ii) To rely on the rules in proposed § 1.1400Z2(f)-1 contained in the notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-115420-18) published on October 29, 2018, as amplified by the notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-120186-18) published on May 1, 2019, but only if applied in a consistent manner for all such taxable years.
