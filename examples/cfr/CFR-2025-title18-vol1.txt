# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

§ 1b.2
Scope.
This part applies to investigations conducted by the Commission but does not apply to adjudicative proceedings.
§ 1b.3
Scope of investigations.
The Commission may conduct investigations relating to any matter subject to its jurisdiction.
§ 1b.4
Types of investigations.
Investigations may be formal or preliminary, and public or private.
§ 1b.5
Formal investigations.
The Commission may, in its discretion, initiate a formal investigation by issuing an Order of Investigation. Orders of Investigation will outline the basis for the investigation, the matters to be investigated, the officer(s) designated to conduct the investigation and their authority. The director of the office responsible for the investigation may add or delete Investigating Officers in the Order of Investigation.
§ 1b.6
Preliminary investigations.
The Commission or its staff may, in its discretion, initiate a preliminary investigation. In such investigations, no process is issued or testimony compelled. Where it appears from the preliminary investigation that a formal investigation is appropriate, the staff will so recommend to the Commission.
§ 1b.7
Procedure after investigation.
Where it appears that there has been or may be a violation of any of the provisions of the acts administered by the Commission or the rules, opinions or orders thereunder, the Commission may institute administrative proceedings, initiate injunctive proceedings in the courts, refer matters, where appropriate, to the other governmental authorities, or take other appropriate action.
§ 1b.8
Requests for Commission investigations.
(a) Any individual, partnership, corporation, association, organization, or other Federal or State governmental entity, may request the Commission to institute an investigation.
(b) Requests for investigations should set forth the alleged violation of law with supporting documentation and information as completely as possible. No particular forms or formal procedures are requested.
(c) It is the Commission's policy not to disclose the name of the person or entity requesting an investigation except as required by law, or where such disclosure will aid the investigation.
§ 1b.9
Confidentiality of investigations.
All information and documents obtained during the course of an investigation, whether or not obtained pursuant to subpoena, and all investigative proceedings shall be treated as nonpublic by the Commission and its staff except to the extent that (a) the Commission directs or authorizes the public disclosure of the investigation; (b) the information or documents are made a matter of public record during the course of an adjudicatory proceeding; or (c) disclosure is required by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Procedures by which persons submitting information to the Commission during the course of an investigation may specifically seek confidential treatment of information for purposes of Freedom of Information Act disclosure are set forth in 18 CFR part 3b and § 1b.20. A request for confidential treatment of information for purposes of Freedom of Information Act disclosure shall not, however, prevent disclosure for law enforcement
purposes or when disclosure is otherwise found appropriate in the public interest and permitted by law.
§ 1b.10
By whom conducted.
Formal Commission investigations are conducted by the Commission or by an individual(s) designated and authorized in the Order of Investigation. Investigating Officers are
officers
within the meaning of the statutes administered by the Commission and are authorized to perform the duties of their office in accordance with the laws of the United States and the regulations of the Commission. Investigating Officers shall have such duties as the Commission may specify in an Order of Investigation.
§ 1b.11
Limitation on participation.
There are no parties, as that term is used in adjudicative proceedings, in an investigation under this part and no person may intervene or participate as a matter of right in any investigation under this part.

In any event, any witness or his counsel, upon proper identification, shall have the right to inspect the official transcript of the witness' own testimony.
[43 FR 27174, June 23, 1978, as amended by Order 225, 47 FR 19054, May 3, 1982; Order 756, 77 FR 4893, Feb. 1, 2012]
§ 1b.13
Powers of persons conducting formal investigations.
Any member of the Commission or the Investigating Officer, in connection with any formal investigation ordered by the Commission, may administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, contracts, agreements or other records relevant or material to the investigation.

§ 1b.15
Non-compliance with compulsory processes.
In cases of failure to comply with Commission compulsory processes, appropriate action may be initiated by the Commission or the Attorney General, including but not limited to actions for enforcement or the imposition of penalties.
§ 1b.16
Rights of witnesses.
(a) Any person who is compelled or requested to furnish documentary evidence or testimony in a formal investigation shall, upon request, be shown the Commission's Order of Investigation. Copies of Orders of Investigation shall not be furnished, for their retention, to such persons requesting the same except with the express approval of the director of the office responsible for the investigation. Such approval shall not be given unless the director of the office responsible for the investigation, in the director's discretion is satisfied that there exist reasons consistent with the protection of privacy of persons involved in the investigation and with the unimpeded conduct of the investigation.
(b) Any person compelled to appear, or who appears in person at a formal investigation by request or permission of the Investigating Officer may be accompanied, represented and advised by counsel, as provided by § 385.2101 of this chapter and these rules, except that all witnesses shall be sequestered and, unless permitted in the discretion of the Investigating Officer, no witness or the counsel accompanying any such witness shall be permitted to be present during the examination of any other witness called in such proceeding. When counsel does represent more than one person in an investigation, for example, where the counsel is counsel to the witness and his employer, said counsel shall inform the Investigating Officer and each client of said counsel's possible conflict of interest in representing that client and, if said counsel appears with a witness giving testimony on the record in an investigation, counsel shall state on the record all persons said counsel represents in the investigation.
(c) Any witness may be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel as follows:
(1) Counsel for a witness may advise the witness, in confidence, upon his initiative or the witness' with respect to any question, and if the witness refuses to answer a question, then the witness or counsel may briefly state on the record the legal grounds for such refusal.
(2) Where it is claimed that the witness has a privilege to refuse to answer a question on the grounds of self-incrimination, the witness must assert the privilege personally.
(3) Following completion of the examination of a witness, such witness may make a statement on the record and his counsel may on the record question the witness to enable the witness to clarify any of the witness' answers or to offer other evidence.
(4) The Investigating Officer shall take all necessary action to regulate the course of the proceeding to avoid delay and prevent or restrain obstructionist or contumacious conduct or contemptuous language. Such officer may report to the Commission any instances where an attorney or representative has refused to comply with his directions, or has engaged in obstructionist or contumacious conduct or has used contemptuous language in the course of the proceeding. The Commission may thereupon take such further action as the circumstances may warrant, including suspension or disbarment of counsel from further appearance or practice before it, in accordance with § 385.2101 of this chapter, or exclusion from further participation in the particular investigation.
(d) Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, in any public formal investigation, if the record shall contain implications of wrongdoing by any person, such person shall have the right to appear on the record; and in addition to the rights afforded other witnesses hereby, he shall have a reasonable opportunity of cross-examination and production of rebuttal testimony or documentary evidence.
Reasonable
shall mean permitting persons as full an opportunity to assert their position as may be granted consistent with administrative efficiency and with avoidance of undue delay. The determinations of reasonableness in each instance shall be made in the discretion of the investigating officer.

Right to submit statements.
Any person may, at any time during the course of an investigation, submit documents, statements of facts or memoranda of law for the purpose of explaining said person's position or furnishing evidence which said person considers relevant regarding the matters under investigation.
§ 1b.19
Submissions.
In the event the Investigating Officer determines to recommend to the Commission that an entity be made the subject of a proceeding governed by part 385 of this chapter, or that an entity be made a defendant in a civil action to be brought by the Commission, the Investigating Officer shall, unless extraordinary circumstances make prompt Commission review necessary in order to prevent detriment to the public interest or irreparable harm, notify the entity that the Investigating Officer intends to make such a recommendation. Such notice shall provide sufficient information and facts to enable the entity to provide a response. Within 30 days of such notice, the entity may submit to the Investigating Officer a non-public response, which may consist of a statement of fact, argument, and/or memorandum of law, with such supporting documentation as the entity chooses, showing why a proceeding governed by part 385 of this chapter should not be instituted against said entity, or why said entity should not be made a defendant in a civil action brought by the Commission. If the response is submitted by the due date, the Investigating Officer shall present it to the Commission together with the Investigating Officer's recommendation. The Commission will consider both the Investigating Officer's recommendation and the entity's timely response in deciding whether to take further action.
[Order 711, 73 FR 29433, May 21, 2008]
§ 1b.20
Request for confidential treatment.
Any person compelled to produce documents in an investigation may claim that some or all of the information contained in a particular document(s) is exempt from the mandatory public disclosure requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), is information referred to in 18 U.S.C. 1905, or is otherwise exempt by law from public disclosure. In such case, the person making such claim shall, at the time said person produces the document to the officer conducting the investigation shall also produce a second copy of the document from which has been deleted the information for which the person wishes to claim confidential treatment. The person shall indicate on the original document that a request for confidential treatment is being made for some or all of the information in the document and shall file a statement specifying the specific statutory justification for non-disclosure of the information for which confidential treatment is claimed. General claims of confidentiality are not sufficient. Sufficient information must be furnished for the officer conducting the investigation, or other appropriate official, to make an informed decision on the request for confidential treatment. If the person states that the information comes within the exception in 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) for trade secrets and commercial or financial information, the person shall include a statement specifying why the information is privileged or confidential. If the person filing a document does not submit a second copy of the document with the confidential information deleted, the Officer conducting the investigation may assume that there is no objection to public disclosure of the document in its entirety. The Commission retains the right to make the determination with regard to any claim of confidentiality. Notice of the decision by the investigating Officer or other appropriate official to deny a claim, in whole or in part, and an opportunity to respond shall be given to a person claiming confidentiality no less than 5 days before its public disclosure.
§ 1b.21
Enforcement hotline.
(a) The Hotline Staff may provide information to the public and give informal staff opinions. The opinions given are not binding on the General Counsel or the Commission.
(b) Except as provided for in paragraph (g) of this section, any person may seek information or the informal resolution of a dispute by calling or writing to the Hotline at the telephone number and address in paragraph (f) of this section.

The Hotline Staff will attempt to resolve disputes without litigation or other formal proceedings. The Hotline Staff may not resolve matters that are before the Commission in docketed proceedings.
(c) All information and documents obtained through the Hotline Staff shall be treated as non-public by the Commission and its staff, consistent with the provisions of section 1b.9 of this part.
(d) Calls to the Hotline may be made anonymously.
(e) Any person who contacts the Hotline is not precluded from filing a formal action with the Commission if discussions assisted by Hotline Staff are unsuccessful at resolving the matter. A caller may terminate use of the Hotline procedure at any time.

[58 FR 38292, July 16, 1993]
§ 2.1c
Policy statement on consultation with Indian tribes in Commission proceedings.
(a) The Commission recognizes the unique relationship between the United States and Indian tribes and Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) Corporations as defined by treaties, statutes, and judicial decisions. Indian tribes have various sovereign authorities, including the power to make and enforce laws, administer justice, and manage and control their lands and resources. Through several Executive Orders and a Presidential Memorandum, departments and agencies of the Executive Branch have been urged to consult with federally-recognized Indian tribes in a manner that recognizes the government-to-government relationship between these agencies and tribes. In essence, this means that consultation should involve direct contact between agencies and tribes and should recognize the status of the tribes as governmental sovereigns.
(b) The Commission acknowledges that, as an independent agency of the federal government, it has a trust responsibility to Indian tribes and this historic relationship requires it to adhere to certain fiduciary standards in its dealings with Indian tribes.
(c) The Commission will endeavor to work with Indian tribes on a government-to-government basis, and with ANCSA Corporations in a similar manner, and will seek to address the effects of proposed projects on tribal rights and resources through consultation pursuant to the Commission's trust responsibility, the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act, the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, section 32 of
the Public Utility Holding Company Act, the Interstate Commerce Act, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, and in the Commission's environmental and decisional documents.
(d) As an independent regulatory agency, the Commission functions as a neutral, quasi-judicial body, rendering decisions on applications filed with it, and resolving issues among parties appearing before it, including Indian tribes. Therefore, the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Commission's rules concerning off-the-record communications, as well as the nature of the Commission's licensing and certificating processes and of the Commission's review of jurisdictional rates, terms and conditions, place some limitations on the nature and type of consultation that the Commission may engage in with any party in a contested case. Nevertheless, the Commission will endeavor, to the extent authorized by law, to reduce procedural impediments to working directly and effectively with tribal governments.
(e) The Commission, in keeping with its trust responsibility, will assure that tribal concerns and interests are considered whenever the Commission's actions or decisions have the potential to adversely affect Indian tribes, Indian trust resources, or treaty rights. The Commission will use the agency's environmental and decisional documents to communicate how tribal input has been considered.
(f) The Commission will seek to engage tribes in high-level meetings to discuss general matters of importance, such as those that uniquely affect the tribes. Where appropriate, these meetings may be arranged for particular tribes, by region, or in some proceedings involving hydroelectric projects, by river basins.
(g) The Commission will strive to develop working relationships with tribes and will seek to establish procedures to educate Commission staff about tribal governments and cultures and to educate tribes about the Commission's various statutory functions and programs. To assist in this effort, the Commission is establishing the position of tribal liaison. The tribal liaison will provide a point of contact and a resource for tribes for any proceeding at the Commission.
(h) Concurrently with this policy statement, the Commission is issuing certain new regulations regarding the licensing of hydroelectric projects. In this connection, the Commission sets forth the following additional policies for the hydroelectric licensing process.
(i) The Commission believes that the hydroelectric licensing process will benefit by more direct and substantial consultation between the Commission staff and Indian tribes. Because of the unique status of Indian tribes in relation to the Federal government, the Commission will endeavor to increase direct communications with tribal representatives in appropriate circumstances, recognizing that different issues and stages of a proceeding may call for different approaches, and there are some limitations that must be observed.
(j) The Commission will seek to notify potentially-affected tribes about upcoming hydroelectric licensing processes, to discuss the consultation process and the importance of tribal participation, to learn more about each tribe's culture, and to establish case-by-case consultation procedures consistent with our
ex parte
rules.
(k) In evaluating a proposed hydroelectric project, the Commission will consider any comprehensive plans prepared by Indian tribes or inter-tribal organizations for improving, developing, or conserving a waterway or waterways affected by a proposed project. The Commission will treat as a comprehensive plan, a plan that:
(1) Is a comprehensive study of one or more of the beneficial uses of a waterway or waterways;
(2) Includes a description of the standards applied, the data relied upon, and the methodology used in preparing the plan; and
(3) Is filed with the Secretary of the Commission.

§ 2.7
Recreational development at licensed projects.
The Commission will evaluate the recreational resources of all projects under Federal license or applications therefor and seek, within its authority, the ultimate development of these resources, consistent with the needs of the area to the extent that such development is not inconsistent with the primary purpose of the project. Reasonable expenditures by a licensee for public recreational development pursuant to an approved plan, including the purchase of land, will be included as part of the project cost. The Commission will not object to licensees and operators of recreational facilities within the boundaries of a project charging reasonable fees to users of such facilities in order to help defray the cost of constructing, operating, and maintaining such facilities. The Commission expects the licensee to assume the following responsibilities:
(a) To acquire in fee and include within the project boundary enough land to assure optimum development of the recreational resources afforded by the project. To the extent consistent with the other objectives of the license, such lands to be acquired in fee for recreational purposes shall include the lands adjacent to the exterior margin of any project reservoir plus all other project lands specified in any approved recreational use plan for the project.
(b) To develop suitable public recreational facilities upon project lands and waters and to make provisions for adequate public access to such project
facilities and waters and to include therein consideration of the needs of persons with disabilities in the design and construction of such project facilities and access.
(c) To encourage and cooperate with appropriate local, State, and Federal agencies and other interested entities in the determination of public recreation needs and to cooperate in the preparation of plans to meet these needs, including those for sport fishing and hunting.
(d) To encourage governmental agencies and private interests, such as operators of user-fee facilities, to assist in carrying out plans for recreation, including operation and adequate maintenance of recreational areas and facilities.
(e) To cooperate with local, State, and Federal Government agencies in planning, providing, operating, and maintaining facilities for recreational use of public lands administered by those agencies adjacent to the project area.
(f)(1) To comply with Federal, State and local regulations for health, sanitation, and public safety, and to cooperate with law enforcement authorities in the development of additional necessary regulations for such purposes.
(2) To provide either by itself or through arrangement with others for facilities to process adequately sewage, litter, and other wastes from recreation facilities including wastes from watercraft, at recreation facilities maintained and operated by the licensee or its concessionaires.
(g) To ensure public access and recreational use of project lands and waters without regard to race, color, sex, religious creed or national origin.
(h) To inform the public of the opportunities for recreation at licensed projects, as well as of rules governing the accessibility and use of recreational facilities.

Conditions in preliminary permits and licenses—list of and citations to “P—” and “L—” forms.
(a) The Commission has approved several sets of standard conditions for normal inclusion in preliminary permits or licenses for hydroelectric developments. In a special situation, of course, the Commission in issuing a permit or license for a project will modify or eliminate a particular article (condition). For reference purposes the sets of conditions are designated as “Forms”—those for preliminary permits are published in Form P-1, and those for licenses are published in Form L's. There are different Form L's for different types of licenses, and the forms have been revised from time to time. Thus at any given time there will be several series of standard forms applicable to the various vintages of different types of licenses. The forms and their revisions are published on the Commission's Web site (

Calculation of taxes for property of public utilities and licensees constructed or acquired after January 1, 1970.
Pursuant to the provisions of section 441(a)(4)(A) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, 83 Stat. 487, 625, public utilities and licensees regulated by the Commission under the Federal Power Act which have exercised the option provided by that section to change from flow through accounting will be permitted by the Commission, with respect to liberalized depreciation, to
employ a normalization method for computing federal income taxes in their accounts and annual reports with respect to property constructed or acquired after January 1, 1970, to the extent with which such property increases the productive or operational capacity of the utility and is not a replacement of existing capacity. Such normalization will also be permitted for ratemaking purposes to the extent such rates are subject to the Commission's ratemaking authority. As to balances in Account 282 of the Uniform System of Accounts, “Accumulated deferred income taxes—Other property,” it will remain the Commission's policy to deduct such balances from rate base in rate proceedings.

Design and construction.
(a) The Commission recognizes the importance of protecting and enhancing natural, historic, scenic, and recreational values at projects licensed or proposed to be licensed under the Federal Power Act.
(b) In furtherance of these policies, the Commission will not (1) permit the amendment of any license for the purpose of construction of additional facilities or (2) authorize the disposition of any interest in project lands for construction of any type, unless a showing is made that the construction will be designed to avoid or minimize conflict with the natural, historic, and scenic values and resources of the project area.

§ 2.15
Specified reasonable rate of return.
(a) Pursuant to section 10(d) of the Federal Power Act, the Commission has determined that the specified reasonable rate of return used in computing amortization reserves for hydroelectric project licenses shall be calculated annually based on current capital ratios developed from an average of 13 monthly balances of amounts properly includible in the licensee's long-term debt and proprietary capital accounts, as listed in the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts. The cost rate for such ratios shall be the weighted average cost of long-term debt and preferred stock for the year, and the cost of common equity shall be the interest rate on 10-year government bonds (reported as the Treasury Department's 10-year constant maturity series) computed on the monthly average for the year in question, plus four percentage points (400 basis points).
(b) The Statement of Policy adopted herein shall be effective upon issuance of this order.
(c) The Secretary shall cause prompt publication of this order to be made in the
Federal Register.
(d) All requests and suggestions not specifically dealt with herein are hereby denied.
(e) The Secretary is hereby authorized to change the appropriate license article upon application by the licensees to reflect the specified reasonable rate of return as adopted herein.

Price discrimination and anticompetitive effect (price squeeze issue).
To implement compliance with the Supreme Court decision in
F.P.C.
v.
Con-Way Corp.,
426 U.S. 271 (1976), aff'g 510 F. 2d 1264 (D.C. Cir. 1975) and to expedite the consideration of price squeeze issues in wholesale electric rate proceedings, the Commission adopts the following procedures for raising price squeeze issues which are to be followed unless they are demonstrated in an individual case to be inadequate:
(a) Any wholesale customer, state commission or other interested person may file petitions to intervene alleging
price discrimination and anticompetitive effects of the wholesale rates. In order to have the issue of price discrimination considered in the rate proceeding, the intervening customer or other interested person must support its allegation by a prima facie case. The elements of the prima facie case shall include at a minimum:
(1) Specification of the filing utility's retail rate schedules with which the intervening wholesale customer is unable to compete due to purchased power costs;
(2) A showing that a competitive situation exists in that the wholesale customer competes in the same market as the filing utility;
(3) A showing that the retail rates are lower than the proposed wholesale rates for comparable service;
(4) The wholesale customer's prospective rate for comparable retail service, i.e. the rate necessary to recover bulk power costs (at the proposed wholesale rate) and distribution costs;
(5) An indication of the reduction in the wholesale rate necessary to eliminate the price squeeze alleged.
(b) Where price squeeze is alleged, the Commission shall, in the order granting intervention, direct the Administrative Law Judge to convene a prehearing conference within 15 days from the date of the order for the purpose of hearing intervenors' request for data required to present their case, including prima facie showing, on price squeeze issues.
(c) Within 30 days from the date of the conference the filing utility shall respond to the data requests authorized by the Administrative Law Judge.
(d) Within 30 days from the filing utility's response, the intervenors shall file their case-in-chief on price squeeze issues, which shall include their prima facie case, unless filed previously.
(e) The burden of proof (i.e. the risk of nonpersuasion) to rebut the allegations of price squeeze and to justify the proposed rates are on the utility proposing the rates under section 205(e) of the Federal Power Act.
(f) In proceedings where price squeeze is an issue, the Secretary shall include the state commission, agency or body which is responsible for regulation of retail rates in the state affected in the service list maintained under § 385.2010(c) of this chapter.

§ 2.18
Phased electric rate increase filings.
(a) In general, when a public utility files a phased rate increase, the Commission will determine the appropriate suspension period based on the total increase requested in all phases. If a utility files a rate increase within sixty days after filing another rate increase, the Commission will consider the filings together to be a phased rate increase request.
(b) This policy will not be applied if the increase is phased:
(1) To coordinate with new facilities coming on line;
(2) To implement a rate moderation plan;
(3) To avoid price squeeze;
(4) To comply with a settlement approved by the Commission; or
(5) If the utility makes a convincing showing that application of the policy would be harsh and inequitable and that, therefore, good cause has been shown not to apply the policy in the case.

State and Federal comprehensive plans.
(a) In determining whether the proposed hydroelectric project is best adapted to a comprehensive plan under section (10)(a)(1) of the Federal Power Act for improving or developing a waterway, the Commission will consider the extent to which the project is consistent with a comprehensive plan (where one exists) for improving, developing, or conserving a waterway or waterways affected by the project that is prepared by:
(1) An agency established pursuant to Federal law that has the authority to prepare such a plan, or
(2) A state agency, of the state in which the facility is or will be located, authorized to conduct such planning pursuant to state law.
(b) The Commission will treat as a state or Federal comprehensive plan a plan that:
(1) Is a comprehensive study of one or more of the beneficial uses of a waterway or waterways;
(2) Includes a description of the standards applied, the data relied upon, and the methodology used in preparing the plan; and
(3) Is filed with the Secretary of the Commission.

§ 2.20
Good faith requests for transmission services and good faith responses by transmitting utilities.
(a)
General Policy.
(1) This Statement of Policy is adopted in furtherance of the goals of sections 211(a) and 213(a) of the Federal Power Act, as amended and added by the Energy Policy Act of 1992.
(2) Under section 211(a), the Commission may issue an order requiring a transmitting utility to provide transmission services (including any enlargement of transmission capacity necessary to provide such services) only if an applicant has made a request for transmission services to the transmitting utility that would be the subject of such order at least 60 days prior to its filing of an application for such order. The requirement in section 211(a) that an applicant make such a request will be met if such an applicant has, pursuant to section 213(a) of the FPA, made a good faith request to a transmitting utility to provide wholesale transmission services and requests specific rates and charges, and other terms and conditions.
(3) It is the Commission's intention to apply the standards of this Statement of Policy when determining whether and when a valid “good faith” request for service was made.
(4) It is the Commission's intention to encourage an open exchange of information that exhibits a reasonable degree of specificity and completeness between the party requesting transmission services and the transmitting utility.
(5) The Commission intends to apply this Statement of Policy so as to carry out Congress' objective that, subject to appropriate terms and conditions and just and reasonable rates, in conformance with section 212 of the FPA, access to the electric transmission system for the purposes of wholesale transactions be more widely available.
(b)
The Components of a good faith request.
The Commission generally considers the following to constitute the minimum components of a good faith request for transmission services:
(1) The identity, address, telephone number, and facsimile number of the party requesting transmission services, and the same information, if different, for the party's contact person or persons.
(2) A statement that the party requesting transmission services is, or will be upon commencement of service, an entity eligible to request transmission under sections 211(a) and 213(a) of the FPA.
(3) A statement that the request for transmission services is intended to satisfy the “request for transmission services” requirement under sections 211(a) and 213(a) of the FPA, and that the request is not a request for mandatory retail wheeling prohibited under section 212(h) of the FPA.
(4) The party requesting transmission services should specify the character and nature of the services requested. Some types of service may require more detailed information than others. Where point-to-point service is requested, the party requesting transmission services should specify the anticipated point(s) of receipt to the transmitting utility's grid and the anticipated point(s) of delivery from the transmitting utility's grid. Where a party requesting transmission services requests additional flexibility to schedule multiple resources to meet its needs (
e.g.,
network service), the request for services should contain a description of the requested services in sufficient detail to permit the transmitting utility to model the additional services on its transmission system.
(5) The names of any other parties likely to provide transmission service to deliver electric energy to, and receive electric energy from, the transmitting utility's grid in connection with the requested transmission services.
(6) The proposed dates for initiating and terminating the requested transmission services.
(7) The total amount of transmission capacity being requested.
(8) To the extent it is known or can be estimated, a description of the “expected transaction profile” including load factor data describing the hourly quantities of power and energy the party requesting transmission services would expect to deliver to the transmitting utility's grid at relevant points of interconnection. In the event delivery is to multiple points within the transmitting utility's electric control area, the requestor should describe, to the extent it is known or can be estimated, the expected load (over a given duration of time) at each such delivery point.
(9) Whether firm or non-firm service is being requested. Where a party requests non-firm service, it should specify the priority of service it is willing to accept, or the conditions under which it is willing to accept interruption or curtailment, if known.
(10) A statement as to whether the request is being made in response to a solicitation and a copy of the solicitation if publicly available. This will help the transmitting utility determine whether requests for transmission service are duplicative or mutually exclusive of requests filed by other parties.
(11) The proposed rates, terms and conditions for the requested transmission services as required by section 213(a). It is not necessary for the requestor to propose a specific numerical rate. Rather, a party requesting transmission services can fulfill the rates, terms and conditions requirement by specifying a rate methodology (
e.g.,
embedded or incremental cost) or by referencing an existing formula rate, transmission tariff, or transmission contract. The validity of the good faith request will not depend on the rates proposed by the party requesting transmission services. This requirement is not intended to allow utilities to delay responses to requests for transmission services, or to deny requests for transmission services on the basis of an overly rigid or technical approach to the “rates, terms and conditions” element of the request.
(12) Any other information to facilitate the expeditious processing of its request. Such information will improve the negotiation process, reduce costs, and will improve chances to arrange the requested transmission without resorting to section 211 application procedures before the Commission.
(c)
Components of a Reply to a Good Faith Request.
The Commission generally considers the following to constitute the minimum components of a reply to a good faith request for transmission services under section 213(a):
(1) Unless the parties agree to a different time frame, the transmitting utility must acknowledge the request within 10 days of receipt. The acknowledgement must include a date by which a response will be sent to the party requesting transmission services and a statement of any fees associated with responding to the request (e.g., initial studies).
(2) The transmitting utility may ask the applicant to provide clarification of only the information needed to evaluate and process a “good faith” request. If the person requesting transmission services believes the transmitting utility is attempting to frustrate the process by making excessive requests for clarification, it may raise this issue if, and when, it files a request for a section 211 order with the Commission.
(3) The transmitting utility must respond to a request within 60 days of receipt or some other mutually agreed upon response date. If both parties agree to an alternative schedule, the agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties.
(4) If the transmitting utility determines that it can provide all the requested services from existing capacity, it should respond by offering the party requesting transmission services an executable service agreement that at a minimum contains the following information:
(i) A description of the proposed transmission rate and any other costs. It is not necessary for the proposed service agreement to contain a fully developed cost-of-service. However, the agreement should explain the basis for the charges for each component of service, including the unbundled components of any transmission rate as well as any other charges.
(ii) The proposed service agreement should explicitly describe all of the applicable terms and conditions of the transmission services provided under the agreement.
(iii) The transmitting utility should accompany the proposed service agreement with a clear statement of the time during which the offer to provide the transmission services will remain open. An open agreement offer may obligate the seller while imposing no countervailing obligation on the purchaser, and an unexecuted contract potentially ties up transmission facilities, thus jeopardizing the availability and price for subsequent requests that would use the same facilities. However, at a minimum, a transmitting utility should permit the party requesting transmission services sufficient time to review service agreements and coordinate multiple stages of joint transactions.
(5) If the transmitting utility determines that it must construct additional facilities or modify existing facilities to provide all or part of the requested services, it must:
(i) Identify the specific constraints and their duration that prevent it from providing all the requested services and explain how these constraints prevent it from providing all the requested services or the desired level of firmness.
(ii) Provide to the applicant all studies, computer input and output data, planning, operating and other documents, work papers, assumptions and any other material that forms the basis for determining the constraints.
(iii) Offer to the applicant an executable agreement under which the applicant agrees to reimburse the transmitting utility for all costs of performing any studies necessary to determine what changes to the transmitting utility's grid are needed to overcome the constraint and provide the requested services, their cost, and the estimated time to complete them. At a minimum, the proposed agreement should contain the following:
(A) An estimate of the cost of the study and the time required to complete it, and
(B) A commitment to supply to the party requesting transmission services all computer input and output data, planning, operating and other documents, work papers, assumptions and any other material used to perform the study.
(iv) If a transmitting utility determines that it can provide part but not all of the requested services without building new facilities, it should inform the applicant of any portion of the requested services that can be performed without constructing additional facilities or modifying existing facilities. In effect, the transmitting utility may be able to treat such a request as two separate transactions—one for service on existing facilities and the other as a request involving expansion decisions. Furthermore, where there are alternative, less expensive means of satisfying all or a portion of a transmission request, the Commission expects the transmitting utility to explore such alternatives (
e.g.
, redispatching certain generating units to alleviate a constraint).
[58 FR 38969, July 21, 1993]
§ 2.21
Regional Transmission Groups.
(a)
General policy.
The Commission encourages Regional Transmission Groups (RTGs) as a means of enabling the market for electric power to operate in a more competitive and efficient way. The Commission believes that RTGs can provide a means of coordinating regional planning of the transmission system and assuring that system capabilities are always adequate to meet system demands. RTG agreements that contain components that satisfy paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section generally will be considered to be just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential under the Federal Power Act (FPA). The Commission encourages RTG agreements that contain as much detail as possible in all of the components listed, particularly if the RTG participants will be seeking Commission deference to decisions reached under an RTG agreement.
(b)
Organizational components.
(1) An RTG agreement should provide for broad membership and, at a minimum, allow any entity that is subject to, or eligible to apply for, an order under section 211 of the FPA to be a member.
An RTG agreement should encompass an area of sufficient size and contiguity to enable members to provide transmission services in a reliable, efficient, and competitive manner.
(2) An RTG agreement should provide a means of adequate consultation and coordination with relevant state regulatory, siting, and other authorities.
(3) An RTG agreement should include fair and nondiscriminatory governance and decision making procedures, including voting procedures.
(c)
Other components.
(1) An RTG agreement should impose on member transmitting utilities an obligation to provide transmission services for other members, including the obligation to enlarge facilities, on a basis that is consistent with sections 205, 206, 211, 212 and 213 of the FPA. To the extent practicable and known, the RTG agreement should specify the terms and conditions under which transmission services will be offered.
(2) An RTG agreement should require, at a minimum, the development of a coordinated transmission plan on a regional basis and the sharing of transmission planning information, with the goal of efficient use, expansion, and coordination of the interconnected electric system on a grid-wide basis. An RTG agreement should provide mechanisms to incorporate the transmission needs of non-members into regional plans. An RTG agreement should include as much detail as possible with regard to operational and planning procedures.
(3) An RTG agreement should include voluntary dispute resolution procedures that provide a fair alternative to resorting in the first instance to section 206 complaints or section 211 proceedings.
(4) An RTG agreement should include an exit provision for RTG members that leave the RTG, specifying the obligations of a departing member.
(d)
Filing procedures.
Any proposed RTG agreement that in any manner affects or relates to the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce by a public utility, or rates or charges for such transmission, must be filed with the Commission. Any public utility member of a proposed RTG may file the RTG agreement with the Commission on behalf of the other public utility members under section 205 of the FPA.

§ 2.22
Pricing policy for transmission services provided under the Federal Power Act.
(a) The Commission has adopted a Policy Statement on its pricing policy for transmission services provided under the Federal Power Act. That Policy Statement can be found at 69 FERC 61,086. The Policy Statement constitutes a complete description of the Commission's guidelines for assessing the pricing proposals. Paragraph (b) of this section is only a brief summary of the Policy Statement.
(b) The Commission endorses transmission pricing flexibility, consistent with the principles and procedures set forth in the Policy Statement. It will entertain transmission pricing proposals that do not conform to the traditional revenue requirement as well as proposals that conform to the traditional revenue requirement. The Commission will evaluate “conforming” transmission pricing proposals using the following five principles, described more fully in the Policy Statement.
(1) Transmission pricing must meet the traditional revenue requirement.
(2) Transmission pricing must reflect comparability.
(3) Transmission pricing should promote economic efficiency.
(4) Transmission pricing should promote fairness.
(5) Transmission pricing should be practical.
(c) Under these principles, the Commission will also evaluate “non-conforming” proposals which do not meet the traditional revenue requirement, and will require such proposals to conform to the comparability principle. Non-conforming proposals must include an open access comparability tariff and will not be allowed to go into effect prior to review and approval by the Commission under procedures described in the Policy Statement.

Use of reserved authority in hydropower licenses to ameliorate cumulative impacts.
The Commission will address and consider cumulative impact issues at original licensing and relicensing to the fullest extent possible consistent with the Commission's statutory responsibility to avoid undue delay in the relicensing process and to avoid undue delay in the amelioration of individual project impacts at relicensing. To the extent, if any, that it is not possible to explore and address all cumulative impacts at relicensing, the Commission will reserve authority to examine and address such impacts after the new license has been issued, but will define that reserved authority as narrowly and with as much specificity as possible, particularly with respect to the purpose of reserving that authority. The Commission intends that such articles will describe, to the maximum extent possible, reasonably foreseeable future resource concerns that may warrant modifications of the licensed project. Before taking any action pursuant to such reserved authority, the Commission will publish notice of its proposed action and will provide an opportunity for hearing by the licensee and all interested parties. Hydropower licenses also contain standard “reopener” articles (see § 2.9 of this part) which reserve authority to the Commission to require, among other things, licensees of projects located in the same river basin to mitigate the cumulative impacts of those projects on the river basin. In light of the policy described above, the Commission will use the standard “reopener” articles to explore and address cumulative impacts only (except in extraordinary circumstances) where such impacts were not known at the time of licensing or are the result of changed circumstances. The Commission has authority under the Federal Power Act to require licensees, during the term of the license, to develop and provide data to the Commission on the cumulative impacts of licensed projects located in the same river basin. In issuing both new and original licenses, the Commission will coordinate the expiration dates of the licenses to the maximum extent possible, to maximize future consideration of cumulative impacts at the same time in contemporaneous proceedings at relicensing. The Commission's intention is to consider to the extent practicable cumulative impacts at the time of licensing and relicensing, and to eliminate the need to resort to the use of reserved authority.

§ 2.25
Ratemaking treatment of the cost of emissions allowances in coordination transactions.
(a)
General Policy.
This Statement of Policy is adopted in furtherance of the goals of Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. 101-549, Title IV, 104 Stat. 2399, 2584 (1990).
(b)
Costing Emissions Allowances in Coordination Sales.
If a public utility's coordination rate on file with the Commission provides for recovery of variable costs on an incremental basis, the Commission will allow recovery of the incremental costs of emissions allowances associated with a coordination sale. If a coordination rate does not reflect incremental costs, the public utility should propose alternative allowance costing methods or demonstrate that the coordination rate does not produce unreasonable results. The Commission finds that the cost to replace an allowance is an appropriate basis to establish the incremental cost.
(c)
Use of Indices.
The Commission will allow public utilities to determine emissions allowance costs on the basis of an index or combination of indices of the current price of emissions allowances, provided that the public utility affords purchasing utilities the option of providing emissions allowances. Public utilities should explain and justify any use of different incremental cost indices for pricing coordination sales and making dispatch decisions.
(d)
Calculation of Amount of Emissions Allowances Associated With Coordination
Transactions.
Public utilities should explain the methods used to compute the amount of emissions allowances included in coordination transactions.
(e)
Timing.
(1) Public utilities should provide information to purchasing utilities regarding the timing of opportunities for purchasers to stipulate whether they will purchase or return emissions allowances. A public utility may require a purchasing utility to declare, no later than the beginning of the coordination transaction:
(i) Whether it will purchase or return emissions allowances; and
(ii) If it will return emissions allowances, the date on which those allowances will be returned.
(2) Public utilities may include in agreements with purchasing utilities non-discriminatory provisions for indemnification if the purchasing utility fails to provide emissions allowances by the date on which it declares that the allowances will be returned.
(f)
Other Costing Methods Not Precluded.
The ratemaking treatment of emissions allowance costs endorsed in this Policy Statement does not preclude other approaches proposed by individual utilities on a case-by-case basis.

§ 2.26
Policies concerning review of applications under section 203.
(a) The Commission has adopted a Policy Statement on its policies for reviewing transactions subject to section 203. That Policy Statement can be found at 77 FERC ¶ 61,263 (1996). The Policy Statement is a complete description of the relevant guidelines. Paragraphs (b)-(e) of this section are only a brief summary of the Policy Statement.
(b)
Factors Commission will generally consider.
In determining whether a proposed transaction subject to section 203 is consistent with the public interest, the Commission will generally consider the following factors; it may also consider other factors:
(1) The effect on competition;
(2) The effect on rates; and
(3) The effect on regulation.
(c)
Effect on competition.
Applicants should provide data adequate to allow analysis under the Department of Justice/Federal Trade Commission Merger Guidelines, as described in the Policy Statement and Appendix A to the Policy Statement.
(d)
Effect on rates.
Applicants should propose mechanisms to protect customers from costs due to the merger. If the proposal raises substantial issues of relevant fact, the Commission may set this issue for hearing.
(e)
Effect on regulation.
(1) Where the affected state commissions have authority to act on the transaction, the Commission will not set for hearing whether the transaction would impair effective regulation by the state commissions. The application should state whether the state commissions have this authority.
(2) Where the affected state commissions do not have authority to act on the transaction, the Commission may set for hearing the issue of whether the transaction would impair effective state regulation.
(f) Under section 203(a)(4) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824b), in reviewing a proposed transaction subject to section 203, the Commission will also consider whether the proposed transaction will result in cross-subsidization of a non-utility associate company or pledge or encumbrance of utility assets for the benefit of an associate company, unless that cross-subsidization, pledge, or encumbrance will be consistent with the public interest.

§ 2.55
Auxiliary installations and replacement facilities.
For the purposes of section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, as amended, the word
facilities
as used therein shall be interpreted to exclude:
(a)
Auxiliary installations.
(1) Installations (excluding gas compressors) which are merely auxiliary or appurtenant to an authorized or proposed transmission pipeline system and which are installations only for the purpose of obtaining more efficient or more economical operation of the authorized or proposed transmission facilities, such as: Valves; drips; pig launchers/receivers; yard and station piping; cathodic protection equipment; gas cleaning, cooling and dehydration equipment; residual refining equipment; water pumping, treatment and cooling equipment; electrical and communication equipment; and buildings. The auxiliary installations must be located within the existing or proposed certificated permanent right-of-way or authorized facility site and must be constructed using the temporary work space used to construct the existing or proposed facility (see Appendix A to this Part 2 for guidelines on what is considered to be the appropriate work area in this context).
(2)
Advance notification.
One of the following requirements will apply to any specified auxiliary installation. If auxiliary facilities are to be installed:
(i) On existing transmission facilities, then no notification is required;
(ii) On, or at the same time as, certificated facilities which are not yet in service (except those authorized under the automatic procedures of part 157 of subpart F of this chapter), then a description of the auxiliary facilities and their locations must be provided to the Commission at least 30 days in advance of their installation; or
(iii) On, or at the same time as facilities that are proposed, then the auxiliary facilities must be described in the environmental report specified in § 380.12 or in a supplemental filing while the application is pending.
(3)
Abandonment or replacement of auxiliary installations.
Authorization to abandon or replace auxiliary facilities that were or could be installed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is pre-granted under section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act, and no reporting is required, provided that:
(i) All activities will be confined to areas, including temporary work space, previously authorized by the Commission for the construction and operation of facilities at that location;
(ii) All activities will comply with applicable conditions on certificate authorizations for the construction and operation of facilities at that location; and
(iii) The abandonment or replacement will have no adverse impact on customers' certificated services.
(b)
Replacement of facilities.

On or before May 1 of each year, a company must file (in accordance with filing procedures posted on the Commission's Web site at
http://www.ferc.gov.
) an annual report that lists for the previous calendar year each replacement project that was completed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section and that was exempt from the advance notification requirement pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. For each such replacement project, the company must include all of the information described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
Exception.
A company does not have to include in this annual report any above-ground replacement project that did not involve compression facilities or the use of earthmoving equipment.
(c)
Landowner notification.
(1)(i) No activity described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section that involves ground disturbance is authorized unless a company makes a good faith effort to notify in writing each affected landowner, as noted in the most recent county/city tax records as receiving the tax notice, whose property will be used and subject to ground disturbance as a result of the proposed activity, at least five days prior to commencing any activity under this section. A landowner may waive the five-day prior notice requirement in writing, so long as the notice has been provided. No landowner notice under this section is required:
(A) If all ground disturbance will be confined entirely to areas within the fence line of an existing above-ground site of facilities operated by the company; or
(B) For activities done for safety, DOT compliance, or environmental or unplanned maintenance reasons that are not foreseen and that require immediate attention by the company.
(ii) The notification shall include at least:
(A) A brief description of the facilities to be constructed or replaced and the effect the activity may have on the landowner's property;
(B) The name and phone number of a company representative who is knowledgeable about the project; and
(C) A description of the Commission's Landowner Helpline, which an affected person may contact to seek an informal resolution of a dispute as explained in § 1b.22(a) of this chapter and the Landowner Helpline number.
(2) “Affected landowners” include owners of interests, as noted in the most recent county/city tax records as receiving tax notice, in properties (including properties subject to rights-of-way and easements for facility sites, compressor stations, well sites, and all above-ground facilities, and access roads, pipe and contractor yards, and temporary work space) that will be directly affected by (
i.e.,
used) and subject to ground disturbance as a result of activity under this section.

§ 2.57
Temporary certificates—pipeline companies.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will exercise the emergency powers set forth in the second proviso of section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act to authorize in appropriate cases, by issuance of temporary certificates, comparatively minor enlargements or extensions of an existing pipeline system. It will not be the policy of the Commission, however, to proceed summarily, i.e., without notice or hearing, in cases where the proposed construction is of major proportions. Pipeline companies are accordingly urged to conduct their planning and to submit their applications for authority sufficiently early so that compliance with the requirements relating to issuance of permanent certificates of public convenience and necessity (when those requirements are deemed applicable by the Commission) will not cause undue delay in the commencement of necessary construction.

§ 2.60
Facilities and activities during an emergency—accounting treatment of defense-related expenditures.
The Commission, cognizant of the need of the natural gas industry for advice with respect to the applicability of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's regulations thereunder regarding activities and operations of natural gas companies taking security measures in preparation for a possible national emergency, sets forth the following interpretation and statement of policy:
(a)
Facilities.
The definition of
auxiliary installations
in § 2.55(a) for which no certificate authority is necessary includes such defense-related facilities as (1) fallout shelters at compressor stations and other operating and maintenance camps; (2) emergency company headquarters or other similar installations; and (3) emergency communication equipment.
(b) The Commission will consider reasonable investment in defense-related facilities, such as those described in paragraph (a) of this section, to be
prudent investment
for ratemaking purposes.
(c) When a person, not otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, files an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction of facilities to be used solely for operation in a national emergency for the delivery of gas to, or receipt of gas from, a person subject to the Commission's jurisdiction, the Commission will consider a request by such applicant for waiver of the requirement to keep and maintain its accounts in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts for Natural Gas Companies (parts 201 and 204 of this chapter) or to file the
annual reports to the Commission required by §§ 260.1 and 260.2 of this chapter.

Calculation of taxes for property of pipeline companies constructed or acquired after January 1, 1970.
Pursuant to the provisions of section 441(a)(4)(A) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, 83 Stat. 487, 625, natural gas pipeline companies which have exercised the option provided by that section to change from flow through accounting will be permitted by the Commission, with respect to liberalized depreciation, to employ a normalization method for computing Federal income taxes in their accounts and annual reports with respect to property constructed or acquired after January 1, 1970, to the extent to which such property increases the productive or operational capacity of the utility and is not a replacement of existing capacity. Such normalization will also be permitted for ratemaking purposes. As to balances in Account No. 282 of the Uniform System of Accounts, “Accumulated deferred income taxes—Other property,” it will remain the Commission's policy to deduct such balances from the rate base of natural gas pipeline companies in rate proceedings.

§ 2.76
Regulatory treatment of payments made in lieu of take-or-pay obligations.
With respect to payments made to a first seller of natural gas as consideration for waiving or revising any agreement for the first sale of natural gas, as defined by section (2)(21) of the Natural Gas Policy Act (NGPA), the Commission sets forth the following statement of general policy and interpretation of law.
(a)
Payments in consideration.
A first seller of natural gas that receives payments as consideration for amending or waiving the take-or-pay or similar minimum payment provisions of a contract for the first sale of natural gas is not in violation of section 504(a) of the NGPA.
(b)
Recovery in rates.
A pipeline that makes any payments referred to under paragraph (a) of this section, to first sellers may file to recover such costs in any section 4(e) rate filing other than a filing to recover purchased gas costs.
(c)
Case-specific review.
A pipeline's method of recovering these costs and how it should apportion them among customers will be addressed on a case-by-case basis in the context of individual rate case filings.
(d)
Customers' rights.
When a pipeline seeks to recover payments referred to under paragraph (a) of this section, its customers will have the full opportunity contemplated by section 4 of the Natural Gas Act to raise questions as to the prudence of such payments, the apportionment of costs among customers proposed by the filing pipeline, and any other reasonably related matters.
(e)
Certificate amendments and abandonment.
With regard to natural gas the sale of which is subject to the Commission's jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act, if any payments referred to under paragraph (a) of this section are accompanied by a change in or a termination of, the first seller's contractual obligation to provide natural gas service, the Commission will, as a general policy under sections 7(c) and 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act, expeditiously grant any certificate amendments or abandonment authorizations,
required to effectuate such contractual or service modifications.
In cases where a producer abandonment application is based on payments made pursuant to this policy statement, the interstate pipeline making the payments will be deemed to have waived any right to oppose the abandonment.

§ 2.78
Utilization and conservation of natural resources—natural gas.
(a)(1) The national interests in the development and utilization of natural gas resources throughout the United States will be served by recognition and implementation of the following priority-of-service categories for use during periods of curtailed deliveries by jurisdictional pipeline companies:
(i) Residential, small commercial (less than 50 Mcf on a peak day).
(ii) Large commercial requirements (50 Mcf or more on a peak day), firm industrial requirements for plant protection, feedstock and process needs, and pipeline customer storage injection requirements.
(iii) All industrial requirements not specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii), or (ix) of this section.
(iv) Firm industrial requirements for boiler fuel use at less than 3,000 Mcf per day, but more than 1,500 Mcf per day, where alternate fuel capabilities can meet such requirements.
(v) Firm industrial requirements for large volume (3,000 Mcf or more per day) boiler fuel use where alternate fuel capabilities can meet such requirements.
(vi) Interruptible requirements of more than 300 Mcf per day, but less than 1,500 Mcf per day, where alternate fuel capabilities can meet such requirements.
(vii) Interruptible requirements of intermediate volumes (from 1,500 Mcf per day through 3,000 Mcf per day), where alternate fuel capabilities can meet such requirements.
(viii) Interruptible requirements of more than 3,000 Mcf per day, but less than 10,000 Mcf per day, where alternate fuel capabilities can meet such requirements.
(ix) Interruptible requirements of more than 10,000 Mcf per day, where alternate fuel capabilities can meet such requirements.
(2) The priorities-of-deliveries set forth above will be applied to the deliveries of all jurisdictional pipeline companies during periods of curtailment on each company's system; except, however, that, upon a finding of extraordinary circumstances after hearing initiated by a petition filed under § 385.207 of this chapter, exceptions to those priorities may be permitted.
(3) The above list of priorities requires the full curtailment of the lower priority category volumes to be accomplished before curtailment of any higher priority volumes is commenced. Additionally, the above list requires both the direct and indirect customers of the pipeline that use gas for similar purposes to be placed in the same category of priority.
(4) The tariffs filed with this Commission should contain provisions that will reflect sufficient flexibility to permit pipeline companies to respond to emergency situations (including environmental emergencies) during periods of curtailment where supplemental deliveries are required to forestall irreparable injury to life or property.
(b) Request for relief from curtailment shall be filed under § 385.1501 of this chapter. Those petitions shall use the priorities set forth in (paragraph (a)(1) of this section) above, the definitions contained in paragraph (b)(3) of this section and shall contain the following minimal information:
(1) The specific amount of natural gas deliveries requested on peak day and monthly basis, and the type of contract under which the deliveries would be made.
(2) The estimated duration of the relief requested.
(3) A breakdown of all natural gas requirements on peak day and monthly bases at the plant site by specific end-uses.
(4) The specific end-uses to which the natural gas requested will be utilized and should also reflect the scheduling within each particular end-use with and without the relief requested.
(5) The estimated peak day and monthly volumes of natural gas which
would be available with and without the relief requested from all sources of supply for the period specified in the request.
(6) A description of existing alternate fuel capabilities on peak day and monthly bases broken down by end-uses as shown in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(7) For the alternate fuels shown in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, provide a description of the existing storage facilities and the amount of present fuel inventory, names and addresses of existing alternate fuel suppliers, and anticipated delivery schedules for the period for which relief is sought.
(8) The current price per million Btu for natural gas supplies and alternate fuels supplies.
(9) A description of efforts to secure natural gas and alternate fuels, including documentation of contacts with the Federal Energy Office and any state or local fuel allocation agencies or public utility commission.
(10) A description of all fuel conservation activities undertaken in the facility for which relief is sought.
(11) If petitioner is a local natural gas distributor, a description of the currently effective curtailment program and details regarding any flexibility which may be available by effectuating additional curtailment to its existing industrial customers. The distributor should also provide a breakdown of the estimated disposition of its natural gas estimated to be available by end-use priorities established in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the period for which relief is sought.
(c) When used in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the following terms will be defined as follows:
(1)
Residential.
Service to customers which consists of direct natural gas usage in a residential dwelling for space heating, air conditioning, cooking, water heating, and other residential uses.
(2)
Commercial.
Service to customers engaged primarily in the sale of goods or services including institutions and local, state, and federal government agencies for uses other than those involving manufacturing or electric power generation.
(3)
Industrial.
Service to customers engaged primarily in a process which creates or changes raw or unfinished materials into another form or product including the generation of electric power.
(4)
Firm service.
Service from schedules or contracts under which seller is expressly obligated to deliver specific volumes within a given time period and which anticipates no interruptions, but which may permit unexpected interruption in case the supply to higher priority customers is threatened.
(5)
Interruptible service.
Service from schedules or contracts under which seller is not expressly obligated to deliver specific volumes within a given time period, and which anticipates and permits interruption on short notice, or service under schedules or contracts which expressly or impliedly require installation of alternate fuel capability.
(6)
Plant protection gas.
Is defined as minimum volumes required to prevent physical harm to the plant facilities or danger to plant personnel when such protection cannot be afforded through the use of an alternate fuel. This includes the protection of such material in process as would otherwise be destroyed, but shall not include deliveries required to maintain plant production. For the purposes of this definition propane and other gaseous fuels shall not be considered alternate fuels.
(7)
Feedstock gas.
Is defined as natural gas used as raw material for its chemical properties in creating an end product.
(8)
Process gas.
Is defined as gas use for which alternate fuels are not technically feasible such as in applications requiring precise temperature controls and precise flame characteristics. For the purposes of this definition propane and other gaseous fuels shall not be considered alternate fuels.
(9)
Boiler fuel.
Is considered to be natural gas used as a fuel for the generation of steam or electricity, including the utilization of gas turbines for the generation of electricity.
(10)
Alternate fuel capabilities.
Is defined as a situation where an alternate fuel could have been utilized whether or not the facilities for such use have
actually been installed;
Provided, however,
Where the use of natural gas is for plant protection, feedstock, or process uses and the only alternate fuel is propane or other gaseous fuel then the consumer will be treated as if he had no alternate fuel capability.

§ 2.80
Detailed environmental statement.
(a) It will be the general policy of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to adopt and to adhere to the objectives and aims of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) in its regulations promulgated for statutes under the jurisdiction of the Commission, including the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 requires, among other things, all Federal agencies to include a detailed environmental statement in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.
(b) Therefore, in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Commission staff will make a detailed environmental statement when the regulatory action taken by the Commission under the statutes under the jurisdiction of the Commission will have a significant environmental impact. The specific regulations implementing NEPA are contained in part 380 of the Commission's regulations.

§ 2.103
Statement of policy respecting take or pay provisions in gas purchase contracts.
(a) Recognizing that take or pay contract obligations may be shielding the prices of deregulated and other higher cost gas from market constraints, the Commission sets forth its general policy regarding prepayments for natural gas pursuant to take or pay provisions in gas contracts and amendments thereto between producers and interstate pipelines which become effective December 23, 1982. The provisions of this policy statement do not establish a binding norm but instead provide general guidance. In particular cases, both the underlying validity of the policy and its application to particular facts may be challenged and are subject to further consideration.
(b) With respect to gas purchase contracts entered into on or after December 23, 1982, the Commission intends to apply a rebuttable presumption in general rate cases that prepayments to producers will not be given rate base treatment if the prepayments are made pursuant to take or pay requirements in such gas purchase contracts or amendments which exceed 75 percent of annual deliverability.

[47 FR 57269, Dec. 23, 1982]
§ 2.104
Mechanisms for passthrough of pipeline take-or-pay buyout and buydown costs.
(a)
General Policy.
The Commission as a matter of policy will provide two distinct mechanisms for passthrough of take-or-pay buyout and buydown costs of interstate natural gas pipelines. The first is pursuant to existing Commission policy and practice. Under this method, pipelines may pass through prudently incurred take-or-pay buyout and buydown costs in their sales commodity rates. The second method is available to pipelines which agree to an equitable sharing of take-or-pay costs and which transport under part 284 of this chapter. Qualifying pipelines may utilize the alternative passthrough mechanisms described in this section. Where a pipeline agrees to absorb from 25 to 50 percent of take-or-pay buyout and buydown costs, the Commission will permit the pipeline to recover through a fixed charge an amount equal to (but not greater than) the amount absorbed. Any remaining costs up to 50 percent of total buyout and buydown costs may be recovered either through a commodity rate surcharge or a volumetric surcharge on total throughput.
(b)
Cost allocation procedures.
A pipeline's volume-based surcharges must be based on the volumes which underlie its most recent Commission-approved rates. Fixed charges must be based on each customer's cumulative deficiency in purchases in recent years (during which the current take-or-pay liabilities of the pipelines were incurred) measured in relation to that customer's purchases during a representative period during which take-or-pay liabilities were not incurred. The allocation formula employed must incorporate the following guidelines:
(1) A representative base period must be selected. The base period must reflect a representative level of purchases by the pipeline's firm customers during a period preceding the onset of changed conditions which resulted in reduced purchases and growth of the take-or-pay problem.
(2) Firm purchases by each customer during the base year under firm rate schedules or contracts for firm service must be determined.
(3) Firm sales purchase deficiency volumes for each subsequent year must be determined.
(4) A fixed charge based on each customer's cumulative deficiencies as compared to total cumulative deficiencies must be derived. The filing pipeline will be free to select for rate calculation and filing purposes a reasonable amortization period for buyout and buydown costs being recovered through fixed charges or volumetric surcharges. The pipeline will be entitled to interest at the rate set forth in part 154 of this chapter on unamortized amounts.
(c)
Implementing procedures.
(1) Pipelines acting pursuant to this section may submit on or before December 31, 1990, a non-PGA rate filing under section 4(e) of the Natural Gas Act. Pipelines may include in their filings a fixed charge and a volumetric surcharge to recover buyout and buydown costs actually paid as of the date of filing plus similar costs which are known and measurable within the following nine months. Detailed support for the amounts claimed and for the calculation of customer surcharges must be provided. In addition, the pipeline must disclose and describe all consideration, both cash and noncash, given to producers in exchange for take-or-pay relief.
(2) In any filings made under this section, pipelines must include proposals for periodic (preferably annual) adjustments to customer surcharges, together with any necessary accounting procedures, designed to assure that revenues recovered by the pipeline remain in balance with buyout and buydown costs covered by the filing and actually incurred by the pipeline.
(d)
Prudence.
(1) The Commission will examine the issue of prudence if it is raised by a party in an individual proceeding. If it is raised, the pipeline will be required to demonstrate the prudence of take-or-pay buyout and buydown costs which it seeks to recover from its customers through both fixed and volume-based charges.
(2) The Commission intends to exercise its authority to the full extent permitted by the Natural Gas Act to approve take-or-pay settlements. The Commission intends to approve
uncontested take-or-pay settlements which are consistent with this section and found to be in the public interest. The Commission will also, if it appears reasonable and permissible to do so, approve contested settlements as to all consenting parties and initiate separate hearings to establish the rates for opposing parties. Alternatively, the Commission will approve contested settlements on the merits if supported by substantial evidence in the record. In any case where hearings are held as to the prudence of take-or-pay buyout and buydown costs, the Commission will permit the pipeline the opportunity to recover all take-or-pay costs found to be prudent from the contesting parties on a proportional basis, even if the amount allowed is greater than the amounts initially sought to be recovered by the pipeline.
(e)
Flowthrough by downstream pipelines.
Downstream pipelines must flow through approved take-or-pay fixed charges based on the cumulative purchase deficiencies of their customers. Volumetrically-based surcharges must be flowed through on a volumetric basis. Customers of downstream pipelines have the right in connection with either PGA or general rate filings to challenge the purchasing practices of such pipelines. Remedies for purchasing practices found by the Commission to be imprudent will be determined on a case-by-case basis.
(f)
Ongoing proceedings.
Pipeline rate proceedings pending September 15, 1987 may be utilized as a forum for implementing the approved cost recovery mechanisms set forth in this section. Permission will be granted in cases where implementation of this policy in pending proceedings appears feasible, will not result in inordinate delay, or can be expected to result in unnecessary or cumulative rate filings with the Commission. In the event permission is granted, the presiding judge(s) will allow pipelines to supplement their filings to the extent necessary to assure compliance with the filing and data requirements set forth herein. The presiding judges shall also establish any procedures necessary to protect the rights of all parties. Any rates established pursuant to this section will be permitted to become effective only prospectively upon Commission approval.
(g)
Scope.
This section does not go beyond the Commission's determination in the April 10, 1985, policy statement (Docket No. PL85-1-000) that take-or-pay buyout and buydown costs do not violate the pricing provision of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA). It is not intended to affect take-or-pay prepayments made by pipelines and included in account 165 and in their rate bases. Nor does it address the issue of whether take-or-pay prepayments to a producer for gas not taken and which cannot be made up violate the Title I pricing provisions of the NGPA. This policy statement applies only to buyout and buydown costs paid by pipelines that are transporting under part 284 of this chapter, under existing contracts, and is not intended to disturb in any way take-or-pay settlements previously entered into between pipelines and their producer suppliers.

§ 2.105
Gas supply charges.
An interstate natural gas pipeline that transports under part 284 of this chapter may include in its tariff a charge, not related to facilities, for standing ready to supply gas to sales customers in accordance with the following principles:
(a) The pipeline may not recover take-or-pay or similar charges from suppliers by any other means.
(b) The pipeline must allow its sales customers to nominate levels of service freely within their firm sales entitlements or otherwise employ a mechanism for the renegotiation of levels of service at regular intervals.
(c) The pipeline must announce prior to nominations by the customers a firm price or pricing formula for the service, and hold that price or pricing formula firm during the interval arranged in paragraph (b) of this section.
(d) By nominating a new level of service lower than its current level, a customer has consented to any abandonment sought by the pipeline commensurate with the difference between
the current level of service and the nominated level.

# Statement of General Policy and Interpretations Under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978
§ 2.300
Statement of policy concerning allegations of fraud, abuse, or similar grounds under section 601(c) of the NGPA.
Recognizing the potential for an increasing number of intervenor complaints predicated on the fraud, abuse, or similar grounds exception to guaranteed passthrough, the Commission sets forth the elements of a cognizable claim under section 601(c)(2) which it expects to apply in cases in which fraud, abuse, or similar grounds is raised. The provisions of this policy statement do not establish a binding norm but instead provide general guidance. In particular cases, both the underlying validity of the policy and its application to particular facts may be challenged and are subject to further consideration. The procedure prescribed conforms with the NGPA's general guarantee of passthrough by placing the burden of pleading the elements and proving the elements of a case on intervenors who would allege fraud, abuse, or similar grounds as a basis for denying passthrough of gas prices incurred by an interstate pipeline.
(a) In order for the issue of fraud, as that term is used in section 601(c) of the NGPA, to be considered in a proceeding, an intervenor or intervenors must file a complaint alleging that:
(1) The interstate pipeline, any first seller who sells natural gas to the interstate pipeline, or both acting together, have made a fraudulent misrepresentation or concealment; and
(2) Because of that fraudulent misrepresentation or concealment, the amount paid by the interstate pipeline to any first seller of natural gas was higher than it would have been absent the fraudulent conduct.
(b) In order for the issue of abuse, as that term is used in section 601(c) of the NGPA, to be considered in a proceeding, an intervenor or intervenors must file a complaint alleging that:
(1) The interstate pipeline, a first seller who sells to the interstate pipeline, or both acting together, have made a negligent misrepresentation or concealment, or other misrepresentation or concealment in disregard of a duty; and
(2) Because of that negligent misrepresentation or concealment, or other misrepresentation or concealment in disregard of a duty, the amount paid by the interstate pipeline to any first seller of natural gas was higher than it would have been absent the negligent misrepresentation or concealment, or other misrepresentation or concealment made in disregard of a duty.
(c) In order for the issue of similar grounds, as that term is used in section 601(c) of the NGPA, to be considered in a proceeding, an intervenor or intervenors must file a complaint alleging that:
(1) The interstate pipeline, any first seller who sells natural gas to the interstate pipeline, or both acting together, have made an innocent misrepresentation of fact; and
(2) Because of that innocent misrepresentation of facts, the amount paid by the interstate pipeline to any first seller of natural gas was higher than it would have been absent the innocent misrepresentation of fact.

# Statement of Interpretation Under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978
§ 2.400
Statement of interpretation of waste concerning natural gas as the primary energy source for qualifying small power production facilities.
For purposes of deciding whether natural gas may be considered as waste as the primary energy source pursuant to § 292.204(b)(1)(i) of this chapter, the
Commission will use the criteria described in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section.
(a)
Category 1.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, natural gas with a heating value of 300 Btu per standard cubic foot (scf) or below will be considered unmarketable.
(b)
Category 2.
In determining whether natural gas with a heating value above 300 Btu but not more than 800 Btu per scf and natural gas produced in the Moxa Arch area is unmarketable, the Commission will consider the following information:
(1) The percentages of the chemical components of the gas, the wellhead pressure, and the flow rate;
(2) Whether the applicant offered the gas to all potential buyers located within 20 miles of the wellhead under terms and conditions commensurate with those prevailing in the region and that such potential buyers refused to buy the gas; and
(3) A study, which may be submitted by an applicant, that evaluates the economics of upgrading the gas for sale and transporting the gas to a pipeline. The study should include estimates of the revenues which could be derived from the sale of the gas and the fixed and variable costs of upgrading.
(c)
Category 3.
In determining whether natural gas with a heating value above 800 Btu per scf is marketable, the Commission will consider the information included in paragraph (b) of this section and whether:
(1) The gas has actually been flared, vented to the atmosphere, or continuously injected into a non-producing zone for a period of one year, pursuant to legal authority; or
(2) The gas has been certified as waste,
i.e.
, suitable for disposal, by an appropriate state authority.

# Statement of Penalty Reduction/Waiver Policy To Comply With the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996
§ 2.500
Penalty reduction/waiver policy for small entities.
(a) It is the policy of the Commission that any small entity is eligible to be considered for a reduction or waiver of a civil penalty if it has no history of previous violations, and the violations at issue are not the product of willful or criminal conduct, have not caused loss of life or injury to persons, damage to property or the environment or endangered persons, property or the environment. An eligible small entity will be granted a waiver if it can also demonstrate that it performed timely remedial efforts, made a good faith effort to comply with the law and did not obtain an economic benefit from the violations. An eligible small entity that cannot meet the criteria for waiver of a civil penalty may be eligible for consideration of a reduced penalty. Upon the request of a small entity, the Commission will consider the entity's ability to pay before assessing a civil penalty.
(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission reserves the right to waive or reduce civil penalties in appropriate individual circumstances where it determines that a waiver or reduction is warranted by the public interest.

Pt. 2, App. A

# Appendix A to Part 2—Guidance for Determining the Acceptable Construction Area for Auxiliary and Replacement Facilities
These guidelines shall be followed to determine what area may be used to construct the auxiliary or replacement facility. Specifically, they address what areas, in addition to the permanent right-of-way, may be used.
An auxiliary or replacement facility must be within the existing right-of-way or facility site as specified by § 2.55(a)(1) or § 2.55(b)(1)(ii). Construction activities for the auxiliary or replacement facility can extend outside the current permanent right-of-way if they are within the temporary and permanent right-of-way and associated work spaces authorized for the construction of the existing installation.
If documentation is not available on the location and width of the temporary and permanent rights-of-way and associated work spaces that were used to construct the existing facility, the company may use the following guidance for the auxiliary installation or replacement, provided the appropriate easements have been obtained:
a. Construction should be limited to no more than a 75-foot-wide right-of-way including the existing permanent right-of-way for large diameter pipeline (pipe greater than 12
inches in diameter) to carry out routine construction. Pipeline 12 inches in diameter and smaller should use no more than a 50-foot-wide right-of-way.
b. The temporary right-of-way (working side) should be on the same side that was used in constructing the existing pipeline.
c. A reasonable amount of additional temporary work space on both sides of roads and interstate highways, railroads, and significant stream crossings and in side-slope areas is allowed. The size should be dependent upon site-specific conditions. Typical work spaces are:
Item
Typical extra area (width/length)
Two lane road (bored)
25-50 by 100 feet.
Four lane road (bored)
50 by 100 feet.
Major river (wet cut)
100 by 200 feet.
Intermediate stream (wet cut)
50 by 100 feet.
Single railroad track
25-50 by 100 feet.
d. The auxiliary or replacement facility must be located within the permanent right-of-way or, in the case of nonlinear facilities, the cleared building site. In the case of pipelines this is assumed to be 50 feet wide and centered over the pipeline unless otherwise legally specified.
However, use of the above guidelines for work space size is constrained by the physical evidence in the area. Areas obviously not cleared during the existing construction, as evidenced by stands of mature trees, structures, or other features that exceed the age of the facility being replaced, should not be used for construction of the auxiliary or replacement facility.
If these guidelines cannot be met, the company should consult with the Commission's staff to determine if the exemption afforded by § 2.55 may be used. If the exemption may not be used, construction authorization must be obtained pursuant to another regulation under the Natural Gas Act.

§ 3a.1
Purpose.
This part 3a describes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission program to govern the classification, downgrading, declassification, and safeguarding of national security information. The provisions and requirements cited herein are applicable to the entire agency except that material pertaining to personnel security shall be safeguarded by the Personnel Security Officer and shall not be considered classified material for the purpose of this part.
[Order 470, 38 FR 5161, Feb. 26, 1973, as amended by Order 756, 77 FR 4893, Feb. 1, 2012]
§ 3a.2
Authority.
Official information or material referred to as classified in this part is expressly exempted from public disclosure by 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1). Wrongful disclosure thereof is recognized in the Federal Criminal Code as providing a basis for prosecution. E.O. 11652, March 8, 1972 (37 FR 5209, March 10, 1972), identifies the information to be protected, prescribes classification, downgrading, declassification, and safeguarding procedures to be followed and establishes a monitoring system to insure its effectiveness. National Security Council Directive Governing the Classification, Downgrading, Declassification and Safeguarding of National Security Information, May 17, 1972 (37 FR 10053, May 19, 1972), implements E.O. 11652.

# Classification
§ 3a.11
Classification of official information.
(a)
Security Classification Categories.
Information or material which requires protection against unauthorized disclosure in the interest of the national defense or foreign relations of the United States (hereinafter collectively termed
national security
) is classified Top Secret, Secret or Confidential, depending upon the degree of its significance to national security. No other categories are to be used to identify official information or material requiring protection in the interest of national security, except as otherwise expressly provided by statute. These classification categories are defined as follows:
(1)
Top Secret.
Top Secret refers to national security information or material which requires the highest degree of protection. The test for assigning Top Secret classification is whether its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally
grave damage to the national security. Examples of
exceptionally grave damage
include armed hostilities against the United States or its allies; disruption of foreign relations vitally affecting the national security; the compromise of vital national defense plans or complex cryptologic and communications intelligence systems; the revelation of sensitive intelligence operations; and the disclosure of scientific or technological developments vital to national security. This classification is to be used with the utmost restraint.
(2)
Secret.
Secret refers to national security information or material which requires a substantial degree of protection. The test for assigning Secret classification shall be whether its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause serious damage to the national security. Examples of
serious damage
include disruption of foreign relations significantly affecting the national security; significant impairment of a program or policy directly related to the national security; revelation of significant military plans or intelligence operations; and compromise of significant scientific or technological developments relating to national security. The classification Secret shall be sparingly used.
(3)
Confidential.
Confidential refers to national security information or material which requires protection, but not to the degree described in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section. The test for assigning Confidential classification shall be whether its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause damage to the national security.
(b) Classified information will be assigned the lowest classification consistent with its proper protection. Documents will be classified according to their own content and not necessarily according to their relationship to other documents.
(c) The overall classification of a file or group of physically connected documents will be at least as high as that of the most highly classified document therein. When put together as a unit or complete file, the classification of the highest classified document contained therein will be marked on a cover sheet, file folder (front and back), or other similar covering, and on any transmittal letters, comments, or endorsements.
(d)
Administrative Control Designations.
These designations are not security classification designations, but are used to indicate a requirement to protect material from unauthorized disclosure. Material identified under the provisions of this subparagraph will be handled and protected in the same manner as material classified Confidential except that it will not be subject to the central control system described in § 3a.71. Administrative Control designations are:
(1)
For Official Use Only.
This designation is used to identify information which does not require protection in the interest of national security, but requires protection in accordance with statutory requirements or in the public interest and which is exempt from public disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b) and § 388.105(n) of this chapter.
(2)
Limited Official Use.
This administrative control designation is used by the Department of State to identify nondefense information requiring protection from unauthorized access. Material identified with this notation must be limited to persons having a definite need to know in order to fulfill their official responsibilities.
(e) A letter or other correspondence which transmits classified material will be classified at a level at least as high as that of the highest classified attachment or enclosure. This is necessary to indicate immediately to persons who receive or handle a group of documents the highest classification involved. If the transmittal document does not contain classified information, or if the information in it is classified lower than in an enclosure, the originator will include a notation to that effect. (See § 3a.31(e).)
[Order 470, 38 FR 5161, Feb. 26, 1973, as amended by Order 225, 47 FR 19055, May 3, 1982]
§ 3a.12
Authority to classify official information.
(a) The authority to classify information or material originally under E.O.
11652 is restricted to those offices within the executive branch which are concerned with matters of national security, and is limited to the minimum number absolutely required for efficient administration.
(b) The authority to classify information or material originally as Top Secret is to be exercised only by such officials as the President may designate in writing and by the heads of the following departments and agencies and such of their principal staff officials as the heads of these departments and agencies may designate in writing;
Such offices in the Executive Office of the President as the President may designate in writing.
Central Intelligence Agency.
Atomic Energy Commission.
Department of State.
Department of the Treasury.
Department of Defense.
Department of the Army.
Department of the Navy.
Department of the Air Force.
U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
Department of Justice.
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
Agency for International Development.
(c) The authority to classify information or material originally as Secret is exercised only by:
(1) Officials who have Top Secret classification authority under § 3a.11(b); and
(2) The heads of the following departments and agencies and such principal staff officials as they may designate in writing:
Department of Transportation.
Federal Communications Commission.
Export-Import Bank of the United States.
Department of Commerce.
U.S. Civil Service Commission.
U.S. Information Agency.
General Services Administration.
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.
Civil Aeronautics Board.
Federal Maritime Commission.
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
National Science Foundation.
Overseas Private Investment Corporation.
(d) The authority to classify information or material originally as Confidential is exercised by officials who have Top Secret or Secret classification authority.
(e) Pursuant to E.O. 11652, the authority to classify information or material originally as Secret or Confidential in the FERC shall be exercised only by the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, and the Executive Director. When an incumbent change occurs in these positions, the name of the new incumbent will be reported to the Interagency Classification Review Committee NSC.
[Order 470, 38 FR 5161, Feb. 26, 1973, as amended by Order 756, 77 FR 4893, Feb. 1, 2012]
§ 3a.13
Classification responsibility and procedure.
(a) Each FERC official who has classifying authority (§ 3a.12) shall be held accountable for the propriety of the classifications attributed to him. Unnecessary classification and overclassification shall be avoided. Classification shall be solely on the basis of national security considerations. In no case shall information be classified in order to conceal inefficiency or administrative error, to prevent embarrassment to the FERC or any of its officials or employees, or to prevent for any other reason the release of information which does not require protection in the interest of national security.
(b) Each classified document shall show on its face its classification and whether it is subject to or exempt from the General Declassification Schedule (§ 3a.22(b)). It also shall show the office of origin, the date of preparation and classification and, to the extent practicable, be so marked as to indicate which portions are classified, at what level, and which portions are not classified in order to facilitate excerpting and other use. Material which merely contains references to classified materials, which references do not reveal classified information, shall not be classified.
(c) Material classified under this part shall indicate on its face the identity of the highest authority authorizing the classification. Where the individual who signs or otherwise authenticates a document or item has also authorized the classification, no further annotation as to his identity is required.
(d) Classified information or material furnished to the United States by a foreign government or international organization shall either retain its original classification or be assigned a U.S. classification. In either case, the classification shall assure a degree of protection equivalent to that required by the government or international organization which furnished the information or material.
(e) Whenever information or material classified by an authorized official is incorporated in another document or other material by any person other than the classifier, the previously assigned security classification category shall be reflected thereon together with the identity of the classifier.
(f) As a holder of classified information or material, the FERC shall observe and respect the classification assigned by the originator. If it is believed that there is unnecessary classification; that the assigned classification is improper, or that the document is subject to declassification under E.O. 11652, the FERC will so inform the originator who is then required by the Executive order to reexamine the classification.
[Order 470, 38 FR 5161, Feb. 26, 1973, as amended by Order 756, 77 FR 4893, Feb. 1, 2012]

# Declassification and Downgrading
§ 3a.21
Authority to downgrade and declassify.
(a) The authority to downgrade and declassify information or material shall be exercised as follows:
(1) Information or material may be downgraded or declassified by the official authorizing the original classification, by a successor or by a supervisory official of either.
(2) Downgrading and declassification authority may also be exercised by an official specifically authorized under regulations issued by the head of the Department listed in sections 2 A and B of E.O. 11652, March 10, 1972.
(3) In the case of classified information or material transferred pursuant to statute or Executive order in conjunction with a transfer of function and not merely for storage purposes, the receiving department or agency shall be deemed to be the originating department or agency for all purposes under E.O. 11652, including downgrading and declassification.
(4) In the case of classified information or material not officially transferred under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, but originated in a department or agency which has since ceased to exist, each department or agency in possession shall be deemed to be the originating department or agency for all purposes. Such information or material may be downgraded and declassified after consulting with any other departments or agencies having an interest in the subject matter.
(5) Classified information or material transferred to the General Services Administration for accession to the Archives of the United States shall be downgraded and declassified by the Archivist of the United States in accordance with E.O. 11652, directives of the President issued through the National Security Council, and pertinent regulations of the departments and agencies.
§ 3a.22
Declassification and downgrading.
(a) When classified information of material no longer requires the level of protection assigned to it, it shall be downgraded or declassified in order to preserve the effectiveness and integrity of the classification system. The Chairman, Vice Chairman, and Executive Director exercise downgrading and declassification authority in the FERC.
(b) Information and material classified prior to June 1, 1972, and assigned to Group 4 under E.O. 10501, as amended by E.O. 10964, unless declassified earlier by the original classifying authority, shall be declassified and downgraded in accordance with the following General Declassification Schedule.
(1)
Top Secret.
Information or material originally classified TOP SECRET becomes automatically downgraded to Secret at the end of the second full calendar year following the year in which it was originated, downgraded to Confidential at the end of the fourth full calendar year following the year in which it was originated, and declassified at the end of the 10th full calendar year following the year in which it was originated.
(2)
Secret.
Information and material originally classified Secret becomes automatically downgraded to Confidential at the end of the second full calendar year following the year in which it was originated, and declassified at the end of the eighth full calendar year following the year in which it was originated.
(3)
Confidential.
Information and material originally classified Confidential becomes automatically declassified at the end of the sixth full calendar year following the year in which it was originated.
(c) To the fullest extent applicable, there shall be indicated on each such FERC originated classified document whether it can be downgraded or declassified at a date earlier than under the above schedule, or after a specified event, or upon the removal of classified attachments or enclosures. Classified information in the possession of the Federal Power Commission, but not bearing a marking for automatic downgrading or declassification, will be marked or designated by the Chairman or the Security Officer designated by § 3a.51 hereof for automatic downgrading or declassification in accordance with the rules and regulations of the department or agency which originally classified the information or material.
(d) When the FERC official having classification authority downgrades or cancels the classification of a document before its classification status changes automatically, each addressee to whom the document was transmitted shall be notified of the change unless the addressee has previously advised that the document was destroyed. Addressees must be notified similarly when it has been determined that a document must be upgraded.
(e) When classified information from more than one source is incorporated into a new document or other material, the document or other material shall be classified, downgraded, or declassified in accordance with the provisions of E.O. 11652 and NSC directives thereunder applicable to the information requiring the greatest protection.
(f) All information or material classified prior to June 1, 1972, other than that described in paragraph (b) of this section, is excluded from the General Classification Schedule. However, at any time after the expiration of 10 years from the date of origin it shall be subject to classification review and disposition by FERC provided:
(1) A department or agency or member of the public requests review;
(2) The request describes the record with sufficient particularity to enable FERC to identify it; and
(3) The record can be obtained with a reasonable amount of effort.
(g) All classified information or material which is 30 years old or more will be declassified under the following conditions:
(1) All information and material classified after June 1, 1972, will, whether or not declassification has been requested, become automatically declassified at the end of 30 full calendar years after the date of its original classification except for such specifically identified information or material which the Chairman personally determines in writing to require continued protection because such continued protection is essential to the national security, or disclosure would place a person in immediate jeopardy. In such case, the Chairman also will specify the period of continued classification.
(2) All information and material classified before June 1, 1972 and more than 30 years old will be systematically reviewed for declassification by the Archivist of the United States by the end of the 30th full calendar year following the year in which it was originated. In his review, the Archivist will separate and keep protected only such information or material as is specifically identified by the Chairman in accordance with paragraph (g) (1) of this section. In such case, the Chairman also will specify the period of continued classification.
(3) The Executive Director, acting for the Chairman, is assigned to assist the Archivist of the United States in the exercise of his responsibilities indicated in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. He will:
(i) Provide guidance and assistance to archival employees in identifying and separating those materials originated in FERC which are deemed to require continued classification; and
(ii) Develop a list for submission to the Chairman which identifies the materials so separated, with recommendations concerning continued classification. The Chairman will then make the determination required under paragraphs (g) (1) and (2) of this section and cause a list to be created which identifies the documents included in the determination, indicates the reason for continued classification, and specifies the date on which such material shall be declassified.
[Order 470, 38 FR 5161, Feb. 26, 1973, as amended by Order 756, 77 FR 4893, Feb. 1, 2012]
§ 3a.23
Review of classified material for declassification purposes.
(a) All information and material classified after June 1, 1972, and determined in accordance with Chapter 21, title 44, United States Code, to be of sufficient historical or other value to warrant preservation shall be systematically reviewed on a timely basis for the purpose of making such information and material publicly available according to the declassification determination at the time of classification. During each calendar year the FPC shall segregate to the maximum extent possible all such information and material warranting preservation and becoming declassified at or prior to the end of such year. Promptly after the end of such year the FERC, or the Archives of the United States if transferred thereto, shall make the declassified information and material available to the public to the extent permitted by law.
(b) Departments and agencies and members of the public may direct requests for review for declassification, as described in § 3a.22(f), to:
Office of the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426.
The Office of the Secretary will assign the request to the appropriate Bureau or Office for action and will acknowledge in writing the receipt of the request. If the request requires the rendering of services for which fair and equitable fees should be charged pursuant to Title 5 of the Independent Offices Appropriations Act, 1952, 31 U.S.C. 483a, the requester shall be so notified. The Bureau or Office which is assigned action will make a determination within 30 days of receipt or explain why further time is necessary. If at the end of 60 days from receipt of the request for review no determination has been made, the requester may apply to the FERC Review Committee (paragraph (g) of this section) for a determination. Should the Bureau or Office assigned the action on a request for review determine that under the criteria set forth in section 5(B) of E.O. 11652 continued classification is required, the requester will be notified promptly and, whenever possible, provided with a brief statement as to why the requested information or material cannot be declassified. The requester may appeal any such determination to the FERC Review Committee and the notice of determination will advise him of this right.
(c) The FERC Review Committee will establish procedures to review and act within 30 days upon all applications and appeals regarding requests for declassification. The chairman, acting through the committee, is authorized to overrule previous determinations in whole or in part when, in its judgment, continued protection is no longer required. If the committee determines that continued classification is required under the criteria of section 5(B) of E.O. 11652, it will promptly so notify the requester and advise him that he may appeal the denial to the Interagency Classification Review Committee.
(d) A request by a department or agency or a member of the public to review for declassification documents more than 30 years old shall be referred directly to the Archivist of the United States, and he shall have the requested documents reviewed for declassification. If the information or material requested has been transferred to the General Services Administration for accession into the Archives, the Archivist shall, together with the chairman, have the requested documents reviewed for declassification. Classification shall be continued in either case only when the chairman makes the personal determination indicated in § 3a.22(g)(1).
The Archivist shall notify the requester promptly of such determination and of his right to appeal the denial to the Interagency Classification Review Committee.
(e) For purposes of administrative determinations under paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section, the burden is on the FERC to show that continued classification is warranted. Upon a determination that the classified material no longer warrants classification, it will be declassified and made available to the requester if not otherwise exempt from disclosure under section 552(b) of Title 5, U.S.C. (Freedom of Information Act) or other provisions of law.
(f) A request for classification review must describe the document with sufficient particularity to enable the FERC to identify it and obtain it with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever a request is deficient in its description of the record sought, the requester will be asked to provide additional identifying information whenever possible. Before denying a request on the ground that it is unduly burdensome, the requester will be asked to limit his request to records that are reasonably obtainable. If the requester then does not describe the records sought with sufficient particularity, or the record requested cannot be obtained with a reasonable amount of effort, the requester will be notified of the reasons why no action will be taken and of his right to appeal such decision.
(g) The FERC Review Committee will consist of the Executive Director, as Committee Chairman, the Secretary, and the Director, Office of Public Information, as members. In addition to the activities described in this paragraph, the Review Committee has authority to act on all suggestions and complaints with respect to administration of E.O. 11652 and this part 3a.
(h) The FERC Review Committee is also responsible for recommending to the chairman appropriate administrative action to correct abuse or violation of any provision of E.O. 11652 or NSC directives thereunder, including notifications by warning letter, formal reprimand, and to the extent permitted by law, suspension without pay and removal.
(i) The Chairman of the Review Committee will submit through the chairman, FERC, a report quarterly to the Interagency Classification Review Committee, NSC, of actions on classification review requests, classification abuses, and unauthorized disclosures.
[Order 470, 38 FR 5161, Feb. 26, 1973, as amended by Order 756, 77 FR 4893, Feb. 1, 2012]

# Classification Markings and Special Notations
§ 3a.31
Classification markings and special notations.
(a) After the chairman, the vice chairman, or the executive director determines that classified information is contained in an original document or other item, the appropriate marking, i.e., Secret or Confidential, will be applied as indicated herein. In addition, each classified document will reflect its date of origin and the Bureau, Office, or Regional Office responsible for its preparation and issuance, and the identity of the highest authority authorizing the classification. Where the individual who signs or otherwise authenticates the document or other item has also authorized the classification, no further annotation as to his identity is required. Each classified document will also show on its face whether it is subject to or exempt from the General Declassification Schedule described in § 3a.22(b).
(1) For marking documents which are subject to the General Declassification Schedule, the following stamp will be used:
(Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential) Classified by ____________. Subject to General Declassification Schedule of E.O. 11652, automatically downgraded at 2-year intervals and declassified on December 31, ____________ (insert year).
(2) For marking documents which are to be automatically declassified on a given event or date earlier than the General Declassification Schedule the following stamp will be used:
(Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential) Classified by ____________. Automatically declassified on ____________________ (effective date or event).
(3) For marking documents which are exempt from the General Declassification Schedule the following stamp will be used:
(Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential) Classified by ____________. Exempt from General Declassification Schedule of E.O. 11652, Exemption Category (section 5B (1), (2), (3), or (4). Automatically declassified on ____________________ (effective date or event, if any).
(b) Should the classifier fail to mark such document with one of the foregoing stamps, the document shall be deemed to be subject to the General Declassification Schedule. The person who signs or finally approves a document or other material containing classified information shall be deemed to be the classifier. If the classifier is other than such person he shall be identified on the stamp as indicated.
(c) On documents, the classification markings Secret and Confidential will be stamped in red ink, printed, or written in letters considerably larger than those used in the text of the document. On documents which are typewritten in elite, pica or executive size type, the above markings should be in letters not less than three-sixteenths inch in height. No markings, other than those indicated above, are authorized to designate that a document or material requires protection in the interests of national security. The overall classification assigned to a document will be conspicuously marked on the top and bottom of each page and on the outside of the front and back covers, if any. Letters of transmittal, endorsements, routing slips, or any other papers of any size which conceal or partially conceal the cover, the title page, or first page, will bear the marking of the overall classification.
(d) Whenever a classified document contains either more than one security classification category or unclassified information, each section, part or paragraph should be marked to the extent practicable to show its classification category or that it is unclassified.
(e) Letters of transmittal or other covering documents which are classified solely because of classified enclosures or attachments, or which are classified in a lower category than such enclosures or attachments, will bear either of the following markings, as appropriate.
(1) If the covering document is classified on its own, but has enclosures or attachments of a higher classification, or is a component (i.e., an endorsement or comment) or a file in which other components bear a higher classification:
Regarded
(appropriate classification)
When separated from
(identify higher classified components)
(2) If unclassified when separated from its classified enclosures or attachments:
When the Attachments Are Removed, This Transmittal Letter Becomes Unclassified.
(f) In addition to the classification category markings prescribed above, the first or title page of each classified document will contain instructions as appropriate, in accordance with the following:
(1)
Regarding instructions.
The declassification and downgrading notation, as described in § 3a.31(g) will be applied to classified documents only. The notation will not be carried forward to unclassified letters of transmittals or other cover documents. When such cover documents are classified by their own content, they will be annotated with the notwithstanding instructions which pertain to the enclosures.
(2)
“Special Handling” notation.
Classified information will not be released or disclosed to any foreign national without proper specific authorization. This applies even when the classified material does not bear the special handling notice described below. The special handling notice indicated only that the material has been reviewed and a specific determination made that the information is not releasable to foreign nationals. If it is anticipated that the handling or distribution of a classified document will make it liable to inadvertent disclosure to foreign nationals it will be marked with a separate special handling notation, which will be carried forward to letters of transmittals or other cover documents. The notation reads:

# Special Handling Required Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals
(g) Whenever classified material is upgraded, downgraded, or declassified, the material will be marked to reflect:
(1) The change in classification.
(2) The authority for the action.

# Warning Notice—Sensitive Intelligence Sources and Methods Involved

# Access to Classified Materials
§ 3a.41
Access requirements.
(a) The Personnel Security Officer, on a continuing current basis, will certify to the Security Officer, the head of each bureau and office and each regional engineer, the names of officers and employees who have been granted a security clearance for access to classified material and the level of such clearance (Top Secret, Secret, Confidential). The Personnel Security Officer will maintain accurate and current listings of personnel who have been granted security clearances in accordance with the standards and criteria of Executive Orders 10450 and 10865 and as prescribed by this part.
(b) In addition to a security clearance, staff members must have a need for access to classified information or material in connection with the performance of duties. The determination for the need-to-know will be made by the official having responsibility for the classified information or material.
(c) When a staff member no longer requires access to classified information or material in connection with performance of official duties, the Personnel Security Officer will administratively withdraw the security clearance. Additionally, when a staff member no longer needs access to a particular security classification category, the security clearance will be
adjusted to the classification category required. In both cases, this action will be without prejudice to the staff member's eligibility for a security clearance or upgrading of category should the need again arise.
(d) Access to classified information or material originated by the FERC may be authorized to persons outside the Executive Branch of the Government engaged in historical research and to former Presidential appointees as provided in paragraphs VI B and C of the NSC directive dated May 17, 1972. The determination of access authorization will be made by the Chairman.
(e) Except as otherwise provided in section 102 of the National Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 495, 50 U.S.C. 403, classified information or material originating in one department or agency shall not be disseminated outside any other department or agency to which it has been made available without the consent of the originating organization.

[Order 470, 38 FR 5161, Feb. 26, 1973, as amended by Order 756, 77 FR 4893, Feb. 1, 2012]

# Storage and Custody of Classified Information
§ 3a.61
Storage and custody of classified information.
(a) Unless specifically authorized by the Chairman or Executive Director, classified information and materials within the Washington office will be stored only in GSA-approved security containers in the Office of Administrative Operations. Such containers will be of steel construction with built-in, three-position, dial-type, manipulation-proof, changeable combination locks.
(b) A custodian and one or more alternate custodians will be assigned responsibility for the security of each container under his jurisdiction in which classified information is stored. Such assignment will be made a matter of record by executing GSA Optional Form 63, Classified Container Registration, and affixing it to the container concerned. Custodians will be responsible for assuring that combinations are changed as required and that locking and checking functions are accomplished daily in compliance with paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.
(c) GSA Optional Form 63 is a 3-sheet form, each sheet having a specific purpose and disposition, as follows:
(1) Sheet 1 records the names, addresses, and home telephone numbers of the custodian and alternate custodians. Sheet 1 is affixed to the outside of the container.
(2) Sheet 2 records the combination of the container and is placed inside Sheet 3, which is an envelope.
(3) Sheet 3, an envelope, is a carbon copy of Sheet 1. When the container combination is recorded on Sheet 2, it is sealed inside Sheet 3 which is then forwarded to the FERC Top Secret Control Officer.
(d) GSA Optional Form 62, Safe or Cabinet Security Record, will be attached conspicuously to the outside of each container used to store classified information. The form is used to certify the opening and locking of a container, and the checking of a container at the end of each working day or whenever it is opened and locked during the day.
(e) Combinations of containers used to store classified materials will be assigned classifications equal to the highest category of classified information stored therein. Active combinations are subject to the safeguarding and receipting requirements of this instruction. Superseded combinations become declassified automatically and certificates of destruction therefore are unnecessary.
(f) Knowledge of or access to the combination of a container used for the storage of classified material will be given only to those appropriately cleared individuals who are authorized access to the information stored therein.
(g) Combinations of containers used to store classified material will be changed at least once a year. A combination will be changed also whenever anyone knowing or having access to it is transferred; when the combination has been subjected to compromise; when the security classification of the container is upgraded; and at any other time as may be deemed necessary. Combinations to locks on security containers will be changed only by individuals having a security clearance equal to the highest category of classified material stored therein. Changing lock combinations is a responsibility of OAO. (See FPC Special Instruction No. AM 2162.2, Periodic Change of Combination on Locks.)
(h) The individual who unlocks a container will indicate the date and time and initial entry on GSA Optional Form 62. At the close of each workday, or when the container is locked at earlier time, the individual locking the container will make the appropriate entry on GSA Optional Form 62. An individual other than the one who locked the container will check to insure that it is properly closed and locked and will make the appropriate entry on GSA Optional Form 62. When a container has not been opened during the day, the checker will enter the date and the notation “Not Opened” and make appropriate entry in the “Checked By” column.
(i) The red and white reversible “Closed-Open” cardboard sign will be used on all classified containers to indicate whether the container is open or locked.
(j) Typewriter ribbons used in the preparation of classified information will be safeguarded in the manner appropriate for the degree of classification involved. Cloth ribbons are considered insecure until both upper and lower lines have been cycled through the typewriter at least twice. Carbon paper or film ribbons are insecure at all times since the imprint thereon cannot be obliterated and such ribbon must be destroyed as classified waste. Insecure ribbons will not be left in typewriters overnight but will be stored in appropriate classified container.
[Order 470, 38 FR 5161, Feb. 26, 1973, as amended by Order 756, 77 FR 4893, Feb. 1, 2012]

# Accountability For Classified Material
§ 3a.71
Accountability for classified material.
(a) The Office of Administrative Operations is the central control registry for the receipt and dispatch of classified material in the Washington office and maintains the accountability register of all classified material. In addition, each Regional Engineer will maintain an accountability register for classified material of which he has custody.
(b) With the exception of the Chairman, Vice Chairman, and Executive Director, no individual, bureau, or office is authorized to receive, open, or dispatch classified material other than the authorized personnel in OAO or the Regional Engineers. Classified material received by other than the OAO or Regional Engineers will be delivered promptly and unopened to the Security Officer or Regional Engineer in order that it may be brought under accountable control.
(c) Each classified document received by or originating in the FERC will be assigned an individual control number by the central control registry, OAO. Control numbers will be assigned serially within a calendar year. The first digit of the four-digit control number will indicate the calendar year in which the document was originated or received in the FERC. Control numbers assigned to top secret material will be separate from the sequence for other classified material and will be prefixed by the letters “TS”. Examples:
9006—Sixth classified document controlled by the central control registry in calendar year 1969.
TS 1006—Sixth Top Secret document controlled by the central control registry in calendar year 1971.
(d) The accounting system for control of classified documents will be effected through the use of FERC Form 55, Classified Document Control Record and Receipt. This form will be used to:
(1) Register an accurate, unclassified description of the document; its assigned control number; and the date it is placed under accountability.
(2) Serve as the accountability register for classified material.
(3) Record all changes in status or custody of the document during its classification life or the period it is retained under accountability in the FERC.
(4) Serve as the principal basis for all classified document inventory and tracer actions.
(5) Serve as a receipt for the central control registry when the document is transferred.
(e) For Top Secret documents only, an access register, FPC Form 1286, Top Secret Access Record, for recording the names of all individuals having access to the document, will be prepared in addition to FPC Form 55. In addition, a physical inventory of all Top Secret documents will be conducted during June of each year by the Top Secret Control Officer and witnessed by a staff member holding a Top Secret clearance.
(f) When classified documents are regraded, declassified, or destroyed, the change in status will be recorded in the file copy of FPC Form 55 in the central control registry.
(g) Classified documents will not be reproduced by any means except on the specific written authority of the FPC Security Officer.
(h) In the Washington Office, classified material will be destroyed by OAO and will be accomplished by burning in the presence of a
destroying official
and a
witnessing official.
Destroying and witnessing officials will be alternate Security Officers from OAO. A record of destruction of each classified document will be maintained on FPC Form 1285. Classified Document Destruction Certificate. In addition, the date of destruction and the destruction certificate number will be recorded on the file copy of FPC Form 55 in the central control registry. The original signed copy of the destruction certificate will be retained in the central control registry. The duplicate copy will be retained by the destroying official. Regional Engineers will follow these instructions for destruction of classified material in their possession, except that the destroying official shall be the Regional Engineer and the witnessing official shall be any other individual having appropriate security clearance.
(i) It is the responsibility of any staff member who has knowledge of the loss or possible compromise of classified information immediately to report the circumstances to the Director, OAO. The Director, OAO, will notify the originating Department and any other interested Department of the loss or possible compromise in order that a damage assessment can be conducted. An immediate inquiry will be initiated by the Director, OAO, for the purpose of taking corrective action and for recommendations to the chairman, through the Review Committee, for appropriate administrative, disciplinary, or legal action.
[Order 470, 38 FR 5161, Feb. 26, 1973, as amended by Order 756, 77 FR 4893, Feb. 1, 2012]

# Transmittal of Classified Material
§ 3a.81
Transmittal of classified material.
(a) A continuous receipting system, using copies of FERC Form 55, will record all transfers of classified items between elements or officials within
the FERC. Receipts for transmittal of classified items from the central registry to the first recipient will be acknowledged on copy number one (original) of FERC Form 55. This copy will be returned to and become part of the central register, where it will remain as an active record until the item is either destroyed or transmitted outside the FERC control registry system. Receipts for subsequent transmittals through the FERC will be recorded on the remaining copies of FERC Form 55.
(b) A recipient will acknowledge receipt and assumption of custody of classified material exactly as it is described on FPC Form 55. If it is determined that parts are missing, it is incorrectly numbered, or otherwise recorded in error on FPC Form 55. The recipient will not sign for the material but will return it promptly to the transmitting element, notifying them accordingly.
(c) Whenever a classified or protected document is being internally transmitted, or is in use, it will be covered by either FERC Label 19, Top Secret Cover Sheet (yellow); FERC Label 20, Secret Cover Sheet (red); FERC Label 21, Confidential Cover Sheet (blue), or FERC Label 22, Official Use Only (Limited Official Use) green. In addition, the red back sheet, FERC Label 23, will be used. With the exception of the FERC Form 55, no transmittal paper or other material will be placed over the label, and no writing will be applied thereon.
(d) The transmission or transfer of custody of classified material outside of the FERC Washington offices or the Regional Offices will be covered by FERC Form 1284, Classified Document Receipt and/or Tracer, prepared in duplicate (one post card and one paper copy). The post card will be enclosed, along with the material being transferred, in the inner envelope, wrapping or container, and the paper copy retained in the central registry pending return of the signed post card.
(e) Classified material transmitted outside of the FERC Washington offices or the Regional Offices will be dispatched in two opaque envelopes or double wrapped in opaque wrapping paper. The outgoing material will be prepared for transmission by:
(1) Preparing and enclosing an appropriate receipt (see paragraph (d) of this section) in the inner envelope or wrapping.
(2) Addressing, return addressing, and sealing or taping the inner envelope or wrapping.
(3) Marking the security classification and other required notations on the front and back of the inner cover. If the nature of the contents deem it necessary or advisable, the inner cover may be marked with the following or a similar notation “To Be Opened By Addressee Only.” When this notation is used, an appropriate “Attention” line must be contained in the address on the outer envelope to insure delivery to the intended recipient.
(4) Enclosing the inner envelope or wrapping in an opaque outer envelope wrapper containing the appropriate address information. These outer covers will not contain any of the markings contained on the inner cover. If the outer cover does not fully conceal the markings on the inner envelope or wrapper, a sheet of plain paper should be folded around the inner wrapper to conceal the markings.
(f) Transmittal of Top Secret information and material shall be effected preferably by oral discussion in person between the officials concerned. Otherwise the transmission of Top Secret information and material shall be by specifically designated personnel, by State Department diplomatic pouch, by a messenger-courier system especially created for that purpose, over authorized communications circuits in encrypted form or by other means authorized by the National Security Council.
(g) Transmittal of material classified Secret or Confidential to any addressee in the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia, the State of Hawaii, the State of Alaska, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and Canadian Government installations by the FERC Washington offices or the Regional offices will be by registered mail only. Transmittal outside these specified areas will be as stated in paragraph
C(2), Appendix B, of the NSC Directive of May 17, 1972.

# Subpart B—Standards for Maintenance and Collection of Records
§ 3b.201
Content of records.
(a) All records which are maintained by the Commission in a system of records will contain only such information about an individual that is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the Commission as required to be accomplished by statute or by executive order of the President. Pursuant to § 3b.3(a)(4) of this part, the Commission will identify in the
Federal Register
the specific provisions in law which authorize it to maintain information in a system of records. In determining the
relevance
and
necessity
of records, the following considerations will govern:
(1) Whether each item of information relates to the purposes, in law, for which the system is maintained;
(2) The adverse consequences, if any, of not collecting the information;
(3) Whether the need for the information could be met through the maintenance of the information in a non-individually identifiable form;
(4) Whether the information in the record is required to be collected on every individual who is the subject of a record in the system or whether a sampling procedure would suffice;
(5) The length of time it is necessary to retain the information;
(6) The financial cost of maintaining the record as compared to the adverse consequences of not maintaining it; and
(7) Whether the information, while generally relevant and necessary to accomplish a statutory purpose, is specifically relevant and necessary only in certain cases.
(b) All records which the Commission maintains in a system of records and which are used to make a determination about an individual will be maintained with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination. Where practicable, in questionable instances, reverification of pertinent information with the individual to whom the record pertains may be appropriate. In pursuit of
completeness
in the collection of information, the Commission will limit its records to those elements of information which clearly bear on the determination for which the records are intended to be used, assuring that all elements necessary to the determination are present before the determination is made.
(c) Prior to disseminating any records in a system of records, the Commission will make reasonable efforts to assure that such records are as accurate, relevant, timely, and complete as appropriate for the purposes for which they are collected and/or maintained, except when they are disclosed to a member of the public under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, or to another agency.
(d) No records of the Commission in a system of records shall describe how any individual exercises his First Amendment rights unless expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained or unless pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity. The exercise of these rights includes, but is not limited to, religious and political beliefs, freedom of speech and of the press, and freedom of
assembly and petition. In determining whether or not a particular activity constitutes the exercise of a right guaranteed by the First Amendment, the Commission will apply the broadest reasonable interpretation.
§ 3b.202
Collection of information from individuals concerned.
(a) Any information collected by the Commission for inclusion in a system of records which may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs, will, to the greatest extent practicable, be collected directly from the subject individual (see paragraph (d) of this section).
(b) The Commission will inform each individual whom it asks to supply information about himself, on the form which it uses to collect the information, or on a separate sheet that can be easily retained by the individual, in language which is explicit, informative, and easily understood, and not so lengthy as to deter an individual from reading it, of:
(1) The specific provision of the statute or executive order of the President, including the brief title or subject of that statute or order which authorizes the solicitation of the information; whether disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary; and whether the Commission is authorized or required to impose penalties for failing to respond;
(2) The principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used;
(3) The routine uses which may be made of the information, as described in the
Federal Register
in the notice of the system of records in which the information is maintained, and which are relatable and necessary to a purpose described pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and
(4) The effects (beneficial and adverse) on the individual if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information.
(c) Social security numbers will not be required from individuals whom the Commission asks to supply information unless the disclosure of the number is required by Federal statute or unless disclosure is to the Commission maintaining a system of records in existence and operating before January 1, 1975, if such disclosure was required pursuant to a statute or regulation adopted prior to such date to verify the identity of an individual. When an individual is requested to disclose his social security number to the Commission, he will be informed under what statutory or other authority such number is solicited, what uses will be made of it, whether disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, and if it is mandatory, under what provisions of law or regulation.
(d) The use of third-party sources to collect information about an individual may be appropriate in certain circumstances. In determining when the use of third-party sources would be appropriate, the following considerations will govern:
(1) When the information needed can only be obtained from a third party;
(2) When the cost of collecting the information directly from the individual concerned far exceeds the cost of collecting it from a third party;
(3) When there is little risk that the information proposed to be collected from the third party, if inaccurate, could result in an adverse determination about the individual concerned.
(4) When there is a need to insure the accuracy of information supplied by an individual by verifying it with a third party, or there is a need to obtain a qualitative assessment of the individual's capabilities or character; or
(5) When there are provisions for verifying any third-party information with the individual concerned before making a determination based on that information.
Third party sources, where feasible, will be informed of the purposes for which information which they are asked to provide will be used. In appropriate circumstances, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) (2), (5), and (7), the Commission may assure a third party that his identity will not be revealed to the subject of the collected information.
§ 3b.203
Rules of conduct.
(a) The Executive Director of the Commission has the overall administrative responsibility for implementing the provisions of the Privacy Act of
1974 and overseeing the conduct of all Commission employees with respect to the act.
(b) It is the responsibility of the Comptroller of the Commission, under the guidance of the Executive Director, to prepare the appropriate internal administrative procedures to assure that all persons involved in the design, development, or operation of any system of records, or in collecting, using, or disseminating any individual record, and who have access to any system of records, are informed of all rules and requirements of the Commission to protect the privacy of the individuals who are the subjects of the records, including the applicable provisions of the FERC Standards of Conduct for Employees, Special Government Employees and Commissioners.
(c) The Director, Human Resources Division, is responsible for establishing and conducting an adequate training program for such persons whose official duties require access to and collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of such records.

(e) Commission employees will be informed of all the implications of their actions in this area, including especially:
(1) That there are criminal penalties for knowing and willful unauthorized disclosure of material within a system of records; for willful failure to publish a public notice of the existence of a system of records; and for knowingly and willfully requesting or obtaining records under false pretenses;
(2) That the Commission may be subject to civil suit due to failure to amend an individual's record in accordance with his request or failure to review his request in conformity with § 3b.224; refusal to comply with an individual's request of access to a record under § 3b.221; willful or intentional failure to maintain a record accurately pursuant to § 3b.201(b) and consequently a determination is made which is adverse to the individual; or willful or intentional failure to comply with any other provision of the Privacy Act of 1974, or any rule promulgated thereunder, in such a way as to have an adverse effect upon an individual.

§ 3b.204
Safeguarding information in manual and computer-based record systems.
(a) The administrative and physical controls to protect the information in the manual and computer-based record systems from unauthorized access or disclosure will be specified for each system in the
Federal Register.
The system managers, who are responsible for providing protection and accountability of such records at all times and for insuring that the records are secured in proper containers whenever they are not in use or under direct control of authorized persons, will be identified for each system of records in the
Federal Register.
(b) Whenever records in the manual or computer-based record systems, including input and output documents, punched cards, and magnetic tapes or disks, are not under the personal control of an authorized person, they will be stored in lockable containers and/or in a secured room, or in alternative storage systems which furnish an equivalent or greater degree of physical security. In this regard, the Commission may refer to security guidelines prepared by the General Services Administration, the Department of Commerce (National Bureau of Standards), or other agencies with appropriate knowledge and expertise.
(c) Access to and use of records will only be permitted to persons pursuant to §§ 3b.221, 3b.224, and 3b.225. Access to areas where records are stored will be limited to those persons whose official duties require work in such areas. Proper control of data, in any form, associated with the manual and computer-based record systems will be maintained at all times, including maintenance of an accounting of removal of the records from the storage area.

# Subpart C—Rules for Disclosure of Records
§ 3b.220
Notification of maintenance of records to individuals concerned.
(a) Upon written request, either in person or by mail, to the appropriate system manager specified for each system of records, an individual will be notified whether a system of records maintained by the Commission and named by the individual contains a record or records pertaining to him and filed under his individual name, or some other identifying particular.
(b) The system manager may require appropriate identification pursuant to § 3b.222, and if necessary, may request from the individual additional information needed to locate the record which the individual should reasonably be expected to know, such as, but not limited to, date of birth, place of birth, and a parent's first name.
(c) When practicable, the system manager will provide a written acknowledgement of the inquiry within ten days of receipt of the inquiry (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) and notification of whether or not a system of records maintained by the Commission and named by the individual contains a record pertaining to him and filed under his individual name or some other identifying particular. If the system manager is unable to provide an answer within the ten-day period, he will so inform the individual in writing, stating the reasons therefor (for good cause shown), and when it is anticipated that notification will be made. Such an extension will not exceed fifteen days from receipt of the inquiry (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays).
(d)
For good cause shown,
as used in all sections of this part, includes circumstances such as the following: Where a search for and/or collection of requested records from inactive storage, field offices, or other establishments is required; where a voluminous amount of data is involved; where information on other individuals must be separated or expunged from the record; or where consultations are required with other agencies or with others having a substantial interest in the determination of the request.
§ 3b.221
Access of records to individuals concerned.
(a) Upon written request, either in person or by mail, to the appropriate system manager specified for each system of records, any individual may gain access to records or information in a system of records pertaining to him and filed under his individual name, or some other identifying particular, to review and to have a copy made of all or any portion thereof in a form comprehensible to him.
(b) A person of his own choosing may accompany the individual to whom the record pertains when the record is disclosed [see § 3b.222(e)].
(c) Before disclosure, the following procedure may apply:
Medical or psychological records will be disclosed directly to the individual to whom they pertain unless, in the judgment of the system manager, in consultation with a medical doctor or a psychologist, access to such records could have an adverse effect upon the individual. When the system manager and a doctor determine that the disclosure of such information could have an adverse effect upon the individual to whom it pertains, the system manager may transmit such information to a medical doctor named by the requesting individual.
(d) The system manager will provide a written acknowledgement of the receipt of a request for access within ten days of receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). Such acknowledgement may, if necessary, request any additional information needed to locate the record which the individual may reasonably be expected to know, and may require appropriate identification pursuant to § 3b.222 of this part. No acknowledgment is required if access can be granted within the ten-day period.
(1) If access can be granted, the system manager will notify the individual, in writing, as to when, and whether access will be granted in person or by mail, so that access will be provided within twenty days of the receipt of the request (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). If the system manager is unable to provide access within twenty days of receipt of the request, he will inform
the individual in writing as to the reasons therefor (for good cause shown), and when it is anticipated that access will be granted. If the expected date of access indicated in the written notification to the individual cannot be met, the system manager will advise the individual in writing of the delay, the reasons therefor (for good cause shown), and of a revised date when access will be granted. Such extensions will not exceed thirty days from receipt of the request (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays).
(2) If access cannot be granted, the system manager will inform the individual, in writing, within twenty days of receipt of the request (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) of the refusal of his request; the reasons for the refusal; the right of the individual, within thirty days of receipt of the refusal, to request in writing a review of the refusal by the Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, or by an officer designated by the Chairman pursuant to § 3b.224(f); and the right of the individual to seek advice or assistance from the system manager in obtaining such a review.
(e) The Chairman, or officer designated pursuant to § 3b.224(f), not later than thirty days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the date of receipt of the individual's request for review will complete such review, unless, for good cause shown, the Chairman, or designated officer, extends the thirty-day period in writing to the individual with reasons for the delay and the approximate date on which the review is expected to be completed. Such an extension will not exceed thirty-five days from receipt of the request for review (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays). The Chairman, or designated officer, will make one of the following determinations:
(1) Grant the individual access to the requested record and notify the individual, in writing, as to when, and whether access will be granted in person or by mail; or
(2) Inform the individual in writing of the refusal, the reasons therefor, and the right of the individual to seek judicial review of the refusal of his request for access.
(f)(1) The Commission will deny an individual access to the following records pertaining to him:
(i) Information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding;
(ii) Records listed in the
Federal Register
as exempt from certain provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, pursuant to subpart D of this part; and
(iii) Records which may be required to be withheld under other statutory provisions.
(2) The Commission will not deny an individual access to a record pertaining to him because that record is permitted to be withheld from members of the public under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended.
(g) Disclosure of an original record will take place in the presence of the Commission representative having physical custody of the record.
[Order 536, 40 FR 44288, Sept. 25, 1975, as amended by Order 737, 75 FR 43402, July 26, 2010]
§ 3b.222
Identification requirements.
The appropriate system manager specified for each system of records will require reasonable identification from individuals to assure that records in a system of records are disclosed to the proper person. Identification requirements will be consistent with the nature of the records being disclosed.
(a) Disclosure of records to the individual to whom the record pertains, or under whose name or some other identifying particular the record is filed, in person, requires that the individual show an identification card. Employee identification, a Medicare card, or a driver's license are examples of acceptable identification. Documents incorporating a picture and signature of the individual are preferred.
(b) For records disclosed by mail, the system manager will require certain minimum identifying information: name, date of birth, or the system's personal identifier if known to the individual. A comparison of the signatures of the requester and those in the record will be used to determine identity.
(c) If the system manager determines that the data in the record is so sensitive that unauthorized access could cause harm or embarrassment to the individual involved, a signed notarized statement asserting identity or some other reasonable means to verify identity will be required.
(d) If an individual can provide no suitable information or documents for identification, the system manager will require a signed statement from the individual asserting his identity and stipulating that the individual understands that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to records about an individual under false pretenses is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $5,000.
(e) The system manager will require an individual who wishes to be accompanied by another person when reviewing his records to furnish a signed written statement authorizing discussion of his records in the presence of the accompanying person.
(f) The appropriate identification requirements of this section may be required by a system manager from an individual to whom a record does not pertain who seeks access to the record pursuant to § 3b.225 of this part.
(g) No individual will be denied notification of maintenance of a record pursuant to § 3b.220 or access to a record pursuant to §§ 3b.221 and 3b.224 for refusing to disclose a social security number.
(h) No verification of identity will be required of individuals seeking notification of or access to records which are otherwise available to a member of the public under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended.
§ 3b.223
Fees.
(a) Fees will be charged for the direct cost of duplication of records in a system of records when copies are requested by the individual seeking access to the records. Any person may obtain a copy of the Commission's schedule of fees by telephone, by mail or by coming in person to the office of the appropriate system manager who is responsible for the protection and accountability of the desired record. Requests for copies of requested records and payment therefor must be made to the system manager. Fees will only be charged for costs of $2 or more.
(b) Where practicable, self-service duplication of requested documents may also be made on duplicating machines by the person requesting the records, on a reimbursable basis to the system manager, in the presence of the Commission representative having physical custody of the record. Where data has been extracted from one of the Commission's systems of records on magnetic tape or disks, or computer files, copies of the records of these files may be secured on a reimbursable basis upon written request to the appropriate system manager. The fee will vary for each requirement, depending on size and complexity.
(c) No fee will be charged in the following instances:
(1) When the system manager determines that he can grant access to records only by providing a copy of the record through the mail because he cannot provide reasonable means for the individual to have access in person;
(2) For search and review of requested records to determine if they fall within the disclosure requirements of this part; and
(3) When the system manager makes a copy of the record as a necessary part of the process of making it available for review.
(d) Except for requests made by Government agencies, certification of copies of any official Commission record shall be accompanied by a fee of $2 per document.
§ 3b.224
Requests to amend records and disputes thereon.
(a) Upon written request, either in person or by mail, to the appropriate system manager specified for each system of records, any individual may amend records in a system of records pertaining to him and filed under his individual name or some other identifying particular. Such requests should contain identifying information needed to locate the record, a brief description of the item or items of information to be amended, and information in support of the request for amendment. The individual may obtain assistance in preparing his request to amend a
record from the appropriate system manager.
(b) The system manager will provide a written acknowledgement of the receipt of a request to amend within ten days of receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). Such an acknowledgement may, if necessary, request any additional information needed to make a determination which the individual may reasonably be expected to know, and verification of identity consistent with § 3b.222. The acknowledgement will clearly describe the request and advise the individual requesting the amendment when he may expect to be notified of action taken on the request. No acknowledgement is required if the request can be reviewed, processed, and the individual notified of compliance or denial within the ten-day period.
(c) The system manager will complete the review and advise the individual in writing of the results within twenty days of the receipt of the request (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). If the system manager is unable to complete the review within twenty days of the receipt of the request, he will inform the individual in writing as to the reasons therefor (for good cause shown) and when it is anticipated that the review will be completed. If the completion date for the review indicated in the acknowledgement cannot be met, the system manager will advise the individual in writing of the delay, the reasons therefor (for good cause shown), and of a revised date when the review may be expected to be completed. Such extensions will not exceed thirty days from receipt of the request (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). The system manager will take one of the following actions:
(1) Make the requested correction or amendment; so advise the individual in writing; and, where an accounting of the disclosure of the record was made pursuant to § 3b.226, advise all previous recipients of the record in writing of the fact that the amendment was made and the substance of the amendment [see § 3b.225(d)]; or
(2) Inform the individual in writing of the refusal to amend the record in accordance with the request; the reasons for the refusal including any of the standards which were employed pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section in conducting the review; the right of the individual, within thirty days of receipt of the refusal, to request in writing a review of the refusal by the Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, or by an officer designated by the Chairman pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section; and the right of the individual to seek advice or assistance from the system manager in obtaining such a review.
(d) In reviewing a record in response to a request to amend, the system manager and the Chairman, or the officer he designates pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, shall assess the accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness of the record. They shall consider the record in terms of the criteria established in § 3b.201 of this part.
(e) The Chairman, or officer designated pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, not later than thirty days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the date of receipt of the individual's request for review, will complete such review, unless, for good cause shown, the Chairman, or designated officer, extends the thirty-day period in a writing to the individual with reasons for the delay and the approximate date on which the review is expected to be completed. Such an extension will not exceed thirty-five days from receipt of the request for review (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). The Chairman, or designated officer, will make one of the following determinations:
(1) Make the correction in accordance with the individual's request and proceed as in paragraph (c)(1) of this section; or
(2) Inform the individual in writing of:
(i) The refusal to amend the record in accordance with the request,
(ii) The reasons therefor, including any of the standards which were employed pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section in conducting the review;
(iii) The right of the individual to file with the Chairman, or designated officer, a concise written statement setting forth the reasons for his disagreement with the decision;
(iv) The fact that the statement of disagreement will be made available to anyone to whom the record is subsequently disclosed, together with the portion of the record which is disputed clearly noted, and, with, at the discretion of the Chairman, or designated officer, a brief statement by the Chairman, or designated officer, summarizing the reasons for refusing to amend the record;
(v) Where an accounting of the disclosure of the record was made pursuant to § 3b.226 of this part, the fact that prior recipients of the disputed record will be provided a copy of the individual's statement of disagreement, with the portion of the record which is disputed clearly noted, and, at the Chairman's or designated officer's discretion, the statement summarizing the refusal to amend [see § 3b.225(d)]; and
(vi) The individual's right to seek judicial review of the refusal to amend.
(f) The Chairman may designate, in writing, another officer of the Commission to act in his capacity for the purposes of this part. The officer will be organizationally independent of or senior to the system manager who made the initial determination and will conduct a review independent of the initial determination.

§ 3b.225
Written consent for disclosure.
(a) The Commission will not disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to any other agency, unless it has the written request by, or the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains and under whose individual name, or some other identifying particular, the record is filed. The written request or consent should include, at a minimum, the general purposes for or the types of recipients to whom disclosure may be made. The fact that an individual is informed of the purposes for which information will be used when information is collected pursuant to § 3b.202(b)(2) will not constitute consent.
(b) A written request or consent is not required if the disclosure is:
(1) To those officers and employees of the Commission who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties;
(2) Required under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended;
(3) For a routine use as defined in § 3b.2(g) of this part and as described in the public notice for each system of records;
(4) To the Bureau of the Census for purposes of planning or carrying out a census or survey or related activity pursuant to the provisions of title 13 of the United States Code;
(5) To a recipient who has provided the appropriate system manager specified for each system of records with advance adequate written assurance that the record will be used solely as a statistical research or reporting record, and the record is to be transferred in a form that is not individually identifiable. The written statement of assurance should include at a minimum:
(i) A statement of the purpose for requesting the record; and
(ii) Certification that the record will only be used for statistical purposes.
In addition to stripping personally identifying information from records released for statistical purposes, the system manager will ensure that the identity of the individual cannot reasonably be deduced or determined by combining various statistical records, or by reference to public records or other available sources of information;
(6) To the National Archives of the United States, pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2103, as a record which has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued preservation by the United States Government, or for the evaluation by the Administrator of General Services or his designee to determine whether the record has such value;
(7) To another agency or to an instrumentality of any governmental jurisdiction within or under the control of
the United States for a civil or criminal law enforcement activity if the activity is authorized by law, and if the head of the agency or instrumentality, or his delegated official, has made a written request to the appropriate system manager specifying the particular portion of the record desired and the law enforcement activity for which the record is being sought;
(8) To a person pursuant to a showing of compelling circumstances affecting the health or safety of an individual (not necessarily the individual to whom the record pertains), if, upon disclosure, notification of such is sent to the last known address of the individual to whom the record pertains;
(9) To either House of Congress, or to any committee or subcommittee thereof, on a matter within its jurisdiction;
(10) To the Comptroller General, or any of his authorized representatives, in the course of the performance of the duties of the General Accounting Office; or
(11) Pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.
(c) When a record is disclosed under compulsory legal process and such process becomes a matter of public record, the system manager will make reasonable efforts to notify the individual to whom the record pertains. A notice will be sent to the individual's last known address noted in the Commission's files.
(d) The appropriate system manager shall notify all prior recipients of records, disclosure to whom an accounting was made pursuant to § 3b.226, of any amendments made to the records, including corrections, amendments and notations of dispute made pursuant to §§ 3b.224(c)(1) and 3b.224(e)(1) and (2)(v), within ten days of receipt of the corrected information or notation of dispute (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays), except under unusual circumstances [see circumstances described in § 3b.220(d)].
(e) The content of the records disclosed under this section shall be maintained pursuant to the standards established in § 3b.201(c).
§ 3b.226
Accounting of disclosures.
(a) The appropriate system manager specified for each system of records will keep an accurate written account of all disclosures of records made to any person or to any other agency with the written consent or at the written request of the individual to whom the record pertains and pursuant to § 3b.225(b)(3) through (11). The account will include the following information:
(1) The date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure;
(2) The name and address of the person or agency to whom the disclosure is made; and
(3) A reference to the justification or basis upon which the release was made, including reference to any written document required as when records are released for statistical or law enforcement purposes pursuant to § 3b.225(b) (5) and (7).
(b) Each system manager will retain the accounting made under paragraph (a) of this section for at least five years from the date of disclosure for which the accounting is made, or the life of the record, which ever is longer.
(c) Except for disclosures made for law enforcement purposes pursuant to § 3b.225(b)(7), and unless the system of records has been exempted from this provision pursuant to subpart D of this part, each system manager will make the accounting made under paragraph (a) of this section available to the individual named in the record at his written request.
(d) The accounting of disclosures is not a system of records under the definition in § 3b.2(e) and no accounting will be maintained for disclosure of the accounting of disclosures.
§ 3b.227
Mailing lists.
An individual's name and address maintained by the Commission will not be sold or rented for commercial or other solicitation purposes not related to the purposes for which the information was collected, unless such sale or rental is specifically authorized by law. This provision shall not be construed to require the withholding of names or addresses otherwise permitted to be made public, as pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended.

(B) The application will be considered deficient under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if the Commission determines it is not patently deficient.
(iii) Any application that is rejected may be resubmitted if the deficiencies are corrected and if, in the case of a competing application, the resubmittal is timely. The date the rejected application is resubmitted will be considered the new filing date for purposes of determining its timeliness under § 4.36 and the disposition of competing applications under § 4.37.
(f) Any application will be considered
accepted for filing
as of the application filing date if the Secretary receives all of the information and documents necessary to conform to the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section and of § 4.38 within the time prescribed by the Commission or its delegate under paragraph (e) of this section.
(g) An applicant may be required to submit any additional information or documents that the Commission or its designee considers relevant for an informed decision on the application.

An applicant may also be required to provide within a specified time additional copies of the complete application, or any of the additional information or documents that are filed, to the Commission or to any person, agency, or other entity that the Commission or its designee specifies. If an applicant fails to provide timely additional information, documents, or copies of submitted materials as required, the Commission or its designee may dismiss the application, hold it in abeyance, or take other appropriate action under this chapter or the Federal Power Act.
(h) A prospective applicant, prior to submitting its application for filing, may seek advice from the Commission staff regarding the sufficiency of the application. For this purpose, five copies of the draft application should be submitted to the Director of the Division of Hydropower Licensing. An applicant or prospective applicant may confer with the Commission staff at any time regarding deficiencies or other matters related to its application. All conferences are subject to the requirements of § 385.2201 of this chapter governing ex parte communications. The opinions or advice of the staff will not bind the Commission or any person delegated authority to act on its behalf.
(i) Intervention in any preliminary permit proceeding will not constitute intervention in any subsequent licensing or exemption proceeding.
(j) Any application, the effectiveness of which is conditioned upon the future occurrence of any event or circumstance, will be rejected.

(3) The procedures contained in §§ 388.112 and 388.113 of this chapter regarding designation of, and access to, CEII, shall apply in the event of a challenge to a CEII designation or a request for access to CEII. If it is determined that information is not CEII or that a requester should be granted access to CEII, the applicant will be directed to make the information available to the requester.
(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit any persons from voluntarily reaching arrangements or agreements calling for the disclosure of CEII.

§ 4.33
Limitations on submitting applications.
(a)
Limitations on submission and acceptance of a preliminary permit application.
The Commission will not accept an application for a preliminary permit for project works that:
(1) Would develop, conserve, and utilize, in whole or in part, the same water resources that would be developed, conserved, and utilized by a project for which there is an unexpired preliminary permit.
(2) Would interfere with a licensed project in a manner that, absent the licensee's consent, would be precluded by Section 6 of the Federal Power Act.
(3) Would develop, conserve, and utilize, in whole or in part, the same water resources that would be developed, conserved, and utilized by a project for which an initial development application has been filed unless the preliminary permit application is filed not later than the time allowed under § 4.36(a) for the filing of applications in competition against an initial application for a preliminary permit that would develop, conserve, and utilize, in whole or in part, the same resources.
(b)
Limitations on submissions and acceptance of a license application.
The Commission will not accept an application for a license or project works that would develop, conserve, or utilize, in whole or part, the same water resources that would be developed, conserved, and utilized by a project for which there is:
(1) An unexpired preliminary permit, unless the permittee has submitted an application for license; or
(2) An unexpired license, except as provided for in Section 15 of the Federal Power Act.
(c)
Limitations on submission and acceptance of an application for a license that would affect an exempted project.
(1) Except as permitted under § 4.33(c)(2), § 4.94(d), or § 4.106 (c), (e) or (f), the Commission will not accept an application for a license for project works that are already exempted from licensing under this part.
(2) If a project is exempted from licensing pursuant to § 4.103 or § 4.109 and real property interests in any non-Federal lands would be necessary to develop or operate the project, any person who is both a qualified license applicant and has any of those real property interests in non-Federal lands may submit a license application for that project. If a license application is submitted under this clause, any other qualified license applicant may submit a competing license application in accordance with § 4.36.
(d)
Limitations on submission and acceptance of exemption applications
—(1)
Unexpired permit or license.
(i) If there is an unexpired permit in effect for a project, the Commission will accept an application for exemption of that project from licensing only if the exemption applicant is the permittee. Upon acceptance for filing of the permittee's application, the permit will be considered to have expired.
(ii) If there is an unexpired license in effect for a project, the Commission
will accept an application for exemption of that project from licensing only if the exemption applicant is the licensee.
(2)
Pending license applications.
If an accepted license application for a project was submitted by a permittee before the preliminary permit expired, the Commission will not accept an application for exemption of that project from licensing submitted by a person other than the former permittee.
(3)
Submitted by qualified exemption applicant.
If the first accepted license application for a project was filed by a qualified exemption applicant, the applicant may request that its license application be treated initially as an application for exemption from licensing by so notifying the Commission in writing and, unless only rights to use or occupy Federal lands would be necessary to develop and operate the project, by submitting documentary evidence showing that the applicant holds the real property interests required under § 4.31. Such notice and documentation must be submitted not later than the last date for filing protests or motions to intervene prescribed in the public notice issued for its license application under § 4.32(d)(2).
(e)
Priority of exemption applicant's earlier permit or license application.
Any accepted preliminary permit or license application submitted by a person who later applies for exemption of the project from licensing will retain its validity and priority under this subpart until the preliminary permit or license application is withdrawn or the project is exempted from licensing.

(iii) A certifying authority is deemed to have waived the certification requirements of section 401(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act if the certifying authority has not denied, expressly waived, or granted certification by one year after the date the certifying authority received a written request for certification. If a certifying authority denies certification, the applicant must file a copy of the denial within 30 days after the applicant received it.
(c)
Additional procedures.
If necessary or appropriate the Commission may require additional procedures (
e.g.,
a pre-hearing conference, further notice and comment on specific issues or oral argument). A party may request additional procedures in a motion that clearly and specifically sets forth the procedures requested and the basis for the request. Replies to such requests may be filed within 15 days of the request.
(d)
Consultation procedures.
Pursuant to the Federal Power Act and the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended, the Commission will coordinate as appropriate with other government agencies responsible for mandatory terms and conditions for exemptions and licenses for hydropower projects. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act and the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Commission will consult with fish and wildlife agencies concerning the impact of a hydropower proposal on fish and wildlife and appropriate terms and conditions for license to adequately and equitably protect, mitigate damages to, and enhance fish and wildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat). Pursuant to the Federal Power Act and the Endangered Species Act, the Commission will consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service, as appropriate, concerning the impact of a hydropower proposal on endangered or threatened species and their critical habitat.
(e)
Consultation on recommended fish and wildlife conditions; Section 10(j) process.
(1) In connection with its environmental review of an application for license, the Commission will analyze all terms and conditions timely recommended by fish and wildlife agencies pursuant to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act for the protection, mitigation of damages to, and enhancement of fish and wildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat) affected by the development, operation, and management of the proposed project. Submission of such recommendations marks the beginning of the process under section 10(j) of the Federal Power Act.
(2) The agency must specifically identify and explain the recommendations and the relevant resource goals and objectives and their evidentiary or legal basis. The Commission may seek clarification of any recommendation from the appropriate fish and wildlife agency. If the Commission's request for clarification is communicated in writing, copies of the request will be sent by the Commission to all parties, affected resource agencies, and Indian tribes, which may file a response to the request for clarification within the time period specified by the Commission. If the Commission believes any fish and wildlife recommendation may be inconsistent with the Federal Power Act or other applicable law, the Commission will make a preliminary determination of inconsistency in the draft environmental document or, if none, the environmental assessment. The preliminary determination, for any recommendations believed to be inconsistent, shall include an explanation why the Commission believes the recommendation is inconsistent with the Federal Power Act or other applicable law, including any supporting analysis and conclusions, and an explanation of how the measures recommended in the environmental document would adequately and equitably protect, mitigate damages to, and enhance, fish and wildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat) affected by the development, operation, and management of the project.
(3) Any party, affected resource agency, or Indian tribe may file comments
in response to the preliminary determination of inconsistency, including any modified recommendations, within the time frame allotted for comments on the draft environmental document or, if none, the time frame for comments on the environmental analysis. In this filing, the fish and wildlife agency concerned may also request a meeting, telephone or video conference, or other additional procedure to attempt to resolve any preliminary determination of inconsistency.
(4) The Commission shall attempt, with the agencies, to reach a mutually acceptable resolution of any such inconsistency, giving due weight to the recommendations, expertise, and statutory responsibilities of the fish and wildlife agency. If the Commission decides, or an affected resource agency requests, the Commission will conduct a meeting, telephone, or video conference, or other procedures to address issues raised by its preliminary determination of inconsistency and comments thereon. The Commission will give at least 15 days' advance notice to each party, affected resource agency, or Indian tribe, which may participate in the meeting or conference. Any meeting, conference, or additional procedure to address these issues will be scheduled to take place within 90 days of the date the Commission issues a preliminary determination of inconsistency. The Commission will prepare a written summary of any meeting held under this subsection to discuss section 10(j) issues, including any proposed resolutions and supporting analysis, and a copy of the summary will be sent to all parties, affected resource agencies, and Indian tribes.
(5) The section 10(j) process ends when the Commission issues an order granting or denying the license application in question. If, after attempting to resolve inconsistencies between the fish and wildlife recommendations of a fish and wildlife agency and the purposes and requirements of the Federal Power Act or other applicable law, the Commission does not adopt in whole or in part a fish and wildlife recommendation of a fish and wildlife agency, the Commission will publish the findings and statements required by section 10(j)(2) of the Federal Power Act.
(f)
Licenses and exemption conditions and required findings
—(1)
License conditions.
(i) All licenses shall be issued on the conditions specified in section 10 of the Federal Power Act and such other conditions as the Commission determines are lawful and in the public interest.
(ii) Subject to paragraph (f)(3) of this section, fish and wildlife conditions shall be based on recommendations timely received from the fish and wildlife agencies pursuant to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act.
(iii) The Commission will consider the timely recommendations of resource agencies, other governmental units, and members of the public, and the timely recommendations (including fish and wildlife recommendations) of Indian tribes affected by the project.
(iv) Licenses for a project located within any Federal reservation shall be issued only after the findings required by, and subject to any conditions that may be timely received pursuant to, section 4(e) of the Federal Power Act.
(v) The Commission will require the construction, maintenance, and operation by a licensee at its own expense of such fishways as may be timely prescribed by the Secretary of Commerce or the Secretary of the Interior, as appropriate, pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Power Act.
(2)
Exemption conditions.
Any exemption from licensing issued for conduit facilities, as provided in section 30(b) of the Federal Power Act, or for small hydroelectric power projects having a proposed installed capacity of 10,000 kilowatts or less, as provided in section 405(d) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended, shall include such terms and conditions as the fish and wildlife agencies may timely determine are appropriate to carry out the responsibilities specified in section 30(c) of the Federal Power Act.
(3)
Required findings.
If, after attempting to resolve inconsistencies between the fish and wildlife recommendations of a fish and wildlife agency and the purposes and requirements of the Federal Power Act or other applicable law, the Commission does not adopt in whole or in part a fish and wildlife recommendation of a
fish and wildlife agency, the Commission will publish the findings and statements required by section 10(j)(2) of the Federal Power Act.
(g)
Application.
The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) and (f) of this section apply only to applications for license or exemption; paragraph (e) applies only to applications for license.
(h) Unless otherwise provided by statute, regulation or order, all filings in hydropower hearings, except those conducted by trial-type procedures, shall conform to the requirements of subpart T of part 385 of this chapter.
(i)
Alternative procedures.
(1) An applicant may submit to the Commission a request to approve the use of alternative procedures for pre-filing consultation and the filing and processing of an application for an original, new or subsequent hydropower license or exemption that is subject to § 4.38 or § 16.8 of this chapter, or for the amendment of a license that is subject to the provisions of § 4.38.
(2) The goal of such alternative procedures shall be to:
(i) Combine into a single process the pre-filing consultation process, the environmental review process under the National Environmental Policy Act and administrative processes associated with the Clean Water Act and other statutes;
(ii) Facilitate greater participation by and improve communication among the potential applicant, resource agencies, Indian tribes, the public and Commission staff in a flexible pre-filing consultation process tailored to the circumstances of each case;
(iii) Allow for the preparation of a preliminary draft environmental assessment by an applicant or its contractor or consultant, or of a preliminary draft environmental impact statement by a contractor or consultant chosen by the Commission and funded by the applicant;
(iv) Promote cooperative efforts by the potential applicant and interested entities and encourage them to share information about resource impacts and mitigation and enhancement proposals and to narrow any areas of disagreement and reach agreement or settlement of the issues raised by the hydropower proposal; and
(v) Facilitate an orderly and expeditious review of an agreement or offer of settlement of an application for a hydropower license, exemption or amendment to a license.
(3) A potential hydropower applicant requesting the use of alternative procedures must:
(i) Demonstrate that a reasonable effort has been made to contact all resource agencies, Indian tribes, citizens' groups, and others affected by the applicant's proposal, and that a consensus exists that the use of alternative procedures is appropriate under the circumstances;
(ii) Submit a communications protocol, supported by interested entities, governing how the applicant and other participants in the pre-filing consultation process, including the Commission staff, may communicate with each other regarding the merits of the applicant's proposal and proposals and recommendations of interested entities; and
(iii) Serve a copy of the request on all affected resource agencies and Indian tribes and on all entities contacted by the applicant that have expressed an interest in the alternative pre-filing consultation process.
(4) As appropriate under the circumstances of the case, the alternative procedures should include provisions for:
(i) Distribution of an initial information package and conduct of an initial information meeting open to the public;
(ii) The cooperative scoping of environmental issues (including necessary scientific studies), the analysis of completed studies and any further scoping; and
(iii) The preparation of a preliminary draft environmental assessment or preliminary draft environmental impact statement and related application.
(5)(i) If the potential applicant's request to use the alternative procedures is filed prior to July 23, 2005, the Commission will give public notice in the
Federal Register
inviting comment on the applicant's request to use alternative procedures. The Commission will consider any such comments in determining whether to grant or deny the applicant's request to use alternative
procedures. Such a decision will not be subject to interlocutory rehearing or appeal.
(ii) If the potential applicant's request to use the alternative procedures is filed on or after July 23, 2005 and prior to the deadline date for filing a notification of intent to seek a new or subsequent license required by § 5.5 of this chapter, the Commission will give public notice and invite comments as provided for in paragraph (i)(5)(i) of this section. Commission approval of the potential applicant's request to use the alternative procedures prior to the deadline date for filing of the notification of intent does not waive the potential applicant's obligation to file the notification of intent required by § 5.5 of this chapter and Pre-Application Document required by § 5.6 of this chapter.
(iii) If the potential applicant's request to use the alternative procedures is filed on or after July 23, 2005 and is at the same time as the notification of intent to seek a new or subsequent license required by § 5.5, the public notice and comment procedures of part 5 of this chapter shall apply.
(6) If the Commission accepts the use of alternative procedures, the following provisions will apply.
(i) To the extent feasible under the circumstances of the proceeding, the Commission will give notice in the
Federal Register
and the applicant will give notice, in a local newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties in which the project is located, of the initial information meeting and the scoping of environmental issues. The applicant will also send notice of these stages to a mailing list approved by the Commission.
(ii) Every six months, the applicant shall file with the Commission a report summarizing the progress made in the pre-filing consultation process and referencing the applicant's public file, where additional information on that process can be obtained. Summaries or minutes of meetings held in the process may be used to satisfy this filing requirement. The applicant must also file with the Commission a copy of its initial information package, each scoping document, and the preliminary draft environmental review document. All filings with the Commission under this section must include the number of copies required by paragraph (h) of this section, and the applicant shall send a copy of these filings to each participant that requests a copy.
(iii) At a suitable location, the applicant will maintain a public file of all relevant documents, including scientific studies, correspondence, and minutes or summaries of meetings, compiled during the pre-filing consultation process. The Commission will maintain a public file of the applicant's initial information package, scoping documents, periodic reports on the pre-filing consultation process, and the preliminary draft environmental review document.
(iv) An applicant authorized to use alternative procedures may substitute a preliminary draft environmental review document and additional material specified by the Commission instead of Exhibit E to its application and need not supply additional documentation of the pre-filing consultation process. The applicant will file with the Commission the results of any studies conducted or other documentation as directed by the Commission, either on its own motion or in response to a motion by a party to the licensing or exemption proceeding.
(v) Pursuant to the procedures approved, the participants will set reasonable deadlines requiring all resource agencies, Indian tribes, citizens' groups, and interested persons to submit to the applicant requests for scientific studies during the pre-filing consultation process, and additional requests for studies may be made to the Commission after the filing of the application only for good cause shown.
(vi) During the pre-filing process the Commission may require the filing of preliminary fish and wildlife recommendations, prescriptions, mandatory conditions, and comments, to be submitted in final form after the filing of the application; no notice that the application is ready for environmental analysis need be given by the Commission after the filing of an application pursuant to these procedures.
(vii) Any potential applicant, resource agency, Indian tribe, citizens' group, or other entity participating in
the alternative pre-filing consultation process may file a request with the Commission to resolve a dispute concerning the alternative process (including a dispute over required studies), but only after reasonable efforts have been made to resolve the dispute with other participants in the process. No such request shall be accepted for filing unless the entity submitting it certifies that it has been served on all other participants. The request must document what efforts have been made to resolve the dispute.
(7) If the potential applicant or any resource agency, Indian tribe, citizens' group, or other entity participating in the alternative pre-filing consultation process can show that it has cooperated in the process but a consensus supporting the use of the process no longer exists and that continued use of the alternative process will not be productive, the participant may petition the Commission for an order directing the use by the potential applicant of appropriate procedures to complete its application. No such request shall be accepted for filing unless the entity submitting it certifies that it has been served on all other participants. The request must recommend specific procedures that are appropriate under the circumstances.
(8) The Commission may participate in the pre-filing consultation process and assist in the integration of this process and the environmental review process in any case, including appropriate cases where the applicant, contractor, or consultant funded by the applicant is not preparing a preliminary draft environmental assessment or preliminary draft environmental impact statement, but where staff assistance is available and could expedite the proceeding.
(9) If this section requires an applicant to reveal Critical Energy Infrastructure Information (CEII), as defined by § 388.113(c) of this chapter, to any person, the applicant shall follow the procedures set out in § 4.32(k).

§ 4.37
Rules of preference among competing applications.
Except as provided in § 4.33(e), the Commission will select among competing applications on the following bases:
(a) If an accepted application for a preliminary permit and an accepted application for a license propose project works that would develop, conserve, and utilize, in whole or in part, the same water resources, and the applicant for a license has demonstrated its ability to carry out its plans, the Commission will favor the license applicant unless the permit applicant substantiates in its filed application that its plans are better adapted to develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region.
(b) If two or more applications for preliminary permits or two or more applications for licenses (not including applications for a new license under section 15 of the Federal Power Act) are filed by applicants for project works that would develop, conserve, and utilize, in whole or in part, the same water resources, and if none of the applicants is a preliminary permittee whose application for license was accepted for filing within the permit period, the Commission will select between or among the applicants on the following bases:
(1) If both or neither of two applicants are either a municipality or a state, the Commission will favor the applicant whose plans are better adapted to develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region, taking into consideration the ability of each applicant to carry out its plans.
(2) If both of two applicants are either a municipality or a state, or neither of them is a municipality or a state, and the plans of the applicants are equally well adapted to develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region, taking into consideration the ability of each applicant to carry out its plans, the Commission will favor the applicant with the earliest application acceptance date.
(3) If one of two applicants is a municipality or a state, and the other is not, and the plans of the municipality or a state are at least as well adapted to develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region, the Commission will favor the municipality or state.
(4) If one of two applicant is a municipality or a state, and the other is not, and the plans of the applicant who is not a municipality or a state are better adapted to develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region, the Commission will inform the municipality or state of the specific reasons why its plans are not as well adapted and afford a reasonable period of time for the municipality or state to render its plans at least as well adapted as the other plans. If the plans of the municipality or state are rendered at least as well adapted within the time allowed, the Commission will favor the municipality or state. If the plans are not rendered at least as well adapted within the time allowed, the Commission will favor the other applicant.
(c) If two or more applications for licenses are filed for project works which would develop, conserve, and utilize, in whole or in part, the same water resources, and one of the applicants was a preliminary permittee whose application was accepted for filing within the permit period (
priority applicant
), the Commission will select between or among the applicants on the following bases:
(1) If the plans of the priority applicant are at least as well adapted as the plans of each other applicant to develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region, taking into consideration the ability of each applicant to carry out its plans, the Commission will favor the priority applicant.
(2) If the plans of an applicant who is not a priority applicant are better adapted than the plans of the priority applicant to develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region, taking into consideration the ability of each applicant to carry out its plans, the Commission will inform the priority applicant of the specific reasons why its plans are not as well adapted and afford a reasonable period of time for the priority
applicant to render its plans at least as well adapted as the other plans. If the plans of the priority applicant are rendered at least as well adapted within the time allowed, then the Commission will favor the priority applicant. If the plans of the priority applicant are not rendered as well adapted within the time allowed, the criteria specified in paragraph (b) will govern.
(3) The criteria specified in paragraph (b) will govern selection among applicants other than the priority applicant.
(d) With respect to a project for which an application for an exemption from licensing has been accepted for filing, the Commission will select among competing applications on the following bases:
(1) If an accepted application for a preliminary permit and an accepted application for exemption from licensing propose to develop mutually exclusive small hydroelectric power projects, the Commission will favor the applicant whose substantiated plans in the application received by the Commission are better adapted to develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region. If the substantiated plans are equally well adapted, the Commission will favor the application for exemption from licensing.
(2) If an application for a license and an application for exemption from licensing, or two or more applications for exemption from licensing are each accepted for filing and each proposes to develop a mutually exclusive project, the Commission will favor the applicant whose plans are better adapted to develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region. If the plans are equally well adapted, the Commission will favor the applicant with the earliest application acceptance date.
(e) A municipal applicant must provide evidence that the municipality is competent under applicable state and local laws to engage in the business of developing, transmitting, utilizing, or distributing power, or such applicant will be considered a non-municipal applicant for the purpose of determining the disposition of competing applications.

§ 4.303
Post-filing procedures.
(a)
Submission of cost statement
—(1)
Accepted applications.
Within 60 days after the last date for filing mandatory terms and conditions pursuant to § 4.32(c)(4) for a new dam or diversion license application seeking PURPA benefits, § 4.93(b) for an application for exemption of a small conduit hydroelectric facility, or § 4.105(b)(1) for an application for case-specific exemption of a small hydroelectric power project, a fish and wildlife agency must file with the Commission a cost statement of the reasonable costs the agency incurred in setting mandatory terms and conditions for the proposed project. An agency may request, in writing, along with any supporting documentation an extension of this 60-day period.
(2)
Rejected, withdrawn or dismissed applications.
The Director of the Office of Energy Projects (Director) will, by letter, notify each fish and wildlife agency if a section 30(c) application is rejected, withdrawn or dismissed. Within 60 days from the date of notification, a fish and wildlife agency must file with the Commission a cost statement of the reasonable costs the agency incurred prior to the date the application was rejected, withdrawn, or dismissed. An agency may submit a written request for an extension of this 60-day period along with any supporting documentation.

(c)
Billing.
After the Commission receives a cost statement from all fish and wildlife agencies as required by paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission will bill the section 30(c) applicant. The bill will show:
(1) The cost statement submitted to the Commission by each fish and wildlife agency;
(2) Any amounts already paid by the applicant pursuant to § 4.302; and
(3)(i) The amount due, if the amount already paid by the applicant pursuant to § 4.302 is less than the total of all the cost statements; or
(ii) The amount to be refunded to the applicant, if the amount already paid by the applicant pursuant to § 4.302 is more than the total of all the cost statements.
(d) Within 45 days from the date of a bill issued under paragraph (b) of this section, a section 30(c) applicant must pay in full to the Commission any remaining amounts due on the cost statements regardless of whether any of these amounts are in dispute.
(e)
Dispute procedures
—(1)
When to dispute.
Any dispute regarding the reasonableness of any fish and wildlife agency cost statement must be made within 45 days from the date of a bill issued under paragraph (b) of this section.
(2)
Assessment of disputed cost statements
The burden of showing that an agency's cost statement is unreasonable is on the applicant. However, a fish and wildlife agency must supply the disputing applicant and the Commission with the documentation necessary to support its cost statement. The Director of the Office of Energy Projects will determine the reasonableness of a disputed fish and wildlife agency cost statement. The Director's decision will be in writing. The Director will notify the disputing applicant and the fish and wildlife agency of the decision by letter. Any decision of the Director may be appealed by either party pursuant to 18 CFR 385.1902. In deciding whether or not a disputed cost statement is reasonable, the Director will review the application, the disputed cost statement and any other documentation relating to the particular environmental problems associated with the disputing applicant's proposed project. The Director will consider such factors as:
(i) The time the fish and wildlife agency spent reviewing the application;
(ii) The proportion of the cost statement to the time the fish and wildlife agency spent reviewing the application;
(iii) Whether the fish and wildlife agency's expenditures conform to Federal expenditure guidelines for such items as travel, per diem, personnel, and contracting; and
(iv) Whether the studies conducted by the agency, if any, are duplicative, limited to the proposed project area, unnecessary to determine the impacts to or mitigation measures for the particular fish and wildlife resources affected by the proposed project, or otherwise unnecessary to set terms and conditions for the proposed project.
(3)
Unreasonable cost statements.
If the Director determines that a disputed fish and wildlife agency cost statement is unreasonable, the disputing applicant and the fish and wildlife agency will be afforded 45 days from the date of notification to attempt to reach an agreement regarding the reimbursable costs of the agency. If the disputing applicant and the fish and wildlife agency fail to reach an agreement on the disputed cost statement within 45 days from the date of notification, the Director will determine the costs that the agency should reasonably have incurred.
(f)
Refunds.
(1) If the amount paid by a section 30(c) applicant under § 4.302 exceeds the total amount of the cost statements submitted by fish and wildlife agencies under paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission will notify the Treasury to refund the difference to the applicant within 45 days from the date of the bill issued to the applicant under paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) If the amount paid by a section 30(c) applicant exceeds the amount determined to be reasonable by the Director pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Commission will notify the Treasury to refund the difference to the applicant within 45 days of the resolution of all dispute proceedings.
[Order 487, 52 FR 48404, Dec. 22, 1987, as amended by Order 647, 69 FR 32438, June 10, 2004]
§ 4.304
Payment.
(a) A payment required under this subpart must be made by check payable to the United States Treasury. The check must indicate that the payment is for
ECPA Fees.
(b) If a payment required under this subpart is not made within the time period prescribed for making such payment, interest and penalty charges will be assessed. Interest and penalty charges will be computed in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717 and 4 CFR part 102.
(c) The Commission will not issue a license or exemption, unless the applicant has made full payments of any fees due under § 4.303(c).
§ 4.305
Enforcement.
(a) The Commission may take any appropriate action permitted by law if a section 30(c) applicant does not make a payment required under this subpart. The Commission will not be liable to any fish and wildlife agency for failure
to collect any amounts under this subpart.
(b) If the Commission is unable to collect the full amount due by a section 30(c) applicant on behalf of more than one agency, the amount the Commission does collect will be distributed to the agencies on a
pro-rata
basis except if an agency's cost statement is greater than its most recent estimate to the applicant under § 4.301(b), then the difference between the estimate and the cost statement will not be reimbursed until any amounts owed to other agencies have been paid.

Submission of such recommendations marks the beginning of the process under section 10(j) of the Federal Power Act.
(b) The agency must specifically identify and explain the recommendations and the relevant resource goals and objectives and their evidentiary or legal basis. The Commission may seek clarification of any recommendation from the appropriate fish and wildlife agency. If the Commission's request for clarification is communicated in writing, copies of the request will be sent by the Commission to all parties, affected resource agencies, and Indian tribes, which may file a response to the
request for clarification within the time period specified by the Commission. If the Commission believes any fish and wildlife recommendation may be inconsistent with the Federal Power Act or other applicable law, the Commission will make a preliminary determination of inconsistency in the draft environmental document or, if none, the environmental assessment. The preliminary determination, for any recommendations believed to be inconsistent, shall include an explanation why the Commission believes the recommendation is inconsistent with the Federal Power Act or other applicable law, including any supporting analysis and conclusions and an explanation of how the measures recommended in the environmental document would adequately and equitably protect, mitigate damages to, and enhance, fish and wildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat) affected by the development, operation, and management of the project.
(c) Any party, affected resource agency, or Indian tribe may file comments in response to the preliminary determination of inconsistency, including any modified recommendations, within the time frame allotted for comments on the draft environmental document or, if none, the time frame for comments on the environmental assessment. In this filing, the fish and wildlife agency concerned may also request a meeting, telephone or video conference, or other additional procedure to attempt to resolve any preliminary determination of inconsistency.
(d) The Commission shall attempt, with the agencies, to reach a mutually acceptable resolution of any such inconsistency, giving due weight to the recommendations, expertise, and statutory responsibilities of the fish and wildlife agency. If the Commission decides, or an affected resource agency requests, the Commission will conduct a meeting, telephone or video conference, or other procedures to address issues raised by its preliminary determination of inconsistency and comments thereon. The Commission will give at least 15 days' advance notice to each party, affected resource agency, or Indian tribe, which may participate in the meeting or conference. Any meeting, conference, or additional procedure to address these issues will be scheduled to take place within 90 days of the date the Commission issues a preliminary determination of inconsistency. The Commission will prepare a written summary of any meeting held under this paragraph to discuss section 10(j) issues, including any proposed resolutions and supporting analysis, and a copy of the summary will be sent to all parties, affected resource agencies, and Indian tribes.
(e) The section 10(j) process ends when the Commission issues an order granting or denying the license application in question. If, after attempting to resolve inconsistencies between the fish and wildlife recommendations of a fish and wildlife agency and the purposes and requirements of the Federal Power Act or other applicable law, the Commission does not adopt in whole or in part a fish and wildlife recommendation of a fish and wildlife agency, the Commission will publish the findings and statements required by section 10(j)(2) of the Federal Power Act.

(i) Whether requests for suspension of the procedural schedule have previously been made or granted;
(ii) Whether the request is supported by a consensus of participants in the proceeding and an explanation of objections to the request expressed by any participant;
(iii) The likelihood that a settlement agreement will be filed within the requested suspension period; and
(iv) Whether the requested suspension is likely to cause any new or subsequent license to be issued after the expiration of the existing license.
(2) The Commission reserves the right to terminate any suspension of the procedural schedule if it concludes that insufficient progress is being made toward the filing of a settlement agreement.
(h)
License conditions and required findings.

(i)
Standards and factors for issuing a new license.
(1) In determining whether a final proposal for a new license under section 15 of the Federal Power Act is best adapted to serve the public interest, the Commission will consider the factors enumerated in sections 15(a)(2) and (a)(3) of the Federal Power Act.
(2) If there are only insignificant differences between the final applications of an existing licensee and a competing Applicant after consideration of the factors enumerated in section 15(a)(2) of the Federal Power Act, the Commission will determine which Applicant will receive the license after considering:
(i) The existing licensee's record of compliance with the terms and conditions of the existing license; and
(ii) The actions taken by the existing licensee related to the project which affect the public.
(iii) An existing licensee that files an application for a new license in conjunction with an entity or entities that
are not currently licensees of all or part of the project will not be considered an existing licensee for the purpose of the insignificant differences provision of section 15(a)(2) of the Federal Power Act.

# Subpart A—Charges for Costs of Administration, Use of Tribal Lands and Other Government Lands, and Use of Government Dams
§ 11.1
Costs of administration.
(a)
Authority.
Pursuant to section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act and section 3401 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, the Commission will assess reasonable annual charges against licensees and exemptees to reimburse the United States for the costs of administration of the Commission's hydropower regulatory program.
(b)
Scope.
The annual charges under this section will be charged to and allocated among:
(1) All licensees of projects of more than 1.5 megawatts of installed capacity; and
(2) All holders of exemptions under either section 30 of the Federal Power Act or sections 405 and 408 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended by section 408 of the Energy Security Act of 1980, but only if the exemption was issued subsequent to April 21, 1995 and is for a project of more than 1.5 megawatts of installed capacity.
(3) If the exemption for a project of more than 1.5 megawatts of installed capacity was issued subsequent to April 21, 1995 but pursuant to an application filed prior to that date, the exemptee may credit against its annual charge any filing fee paid pursuant to § 381.601 of this chapter, which was removed effective April 21, 1995, 18 CFR 381.601 (1994), until the total of all such credits equals the filing fee that was paid.
(c)
Licenses and exemptions other than State or municipal.
For licensees and exemptees, other than State or municipal:
(1) A determination shall be made for each fiscal year of the costs of administration of Part I of the Federal Power Act chargeable to such licensees or exemptees, from which shall be deducted any administrative costs that are stated in the license or exemption or fixed by the Commission in determining headwater benefit payments.
(2) For each fiscal year the costs of administration determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be assessed against such licenses or exemptee in the proportion that the annual charge factor for each such project bears to the total of the annual charge factors under all such outstanding licenses and exemptions.
(3) The annual charge factor for each such project shall be found as follows:
(i) For a conventional project the factor is its authorized installed capacity plus 112.5 times its annual energy output in millions of kilowatt-hours.
(ii) For a pure pumped storage project the factor is its authorized installed capacity.
(iii) For a mixed conventional-pumped storage project the factor is its authorized installed capacity plus 112.5 times its gross annual energy output in millions of kilowatt-hours less 75 times the annual energy used for pumped storage pumping in million of kilowatt-hours.
(iv) For purposes of determining their annual charges factor, projects that are operated pursuant to an exemption will be deemed to have an annual energy output of zero.
(4) To enable the Commission to determine such charges annually, each licensee whose authorized installed capacity exceeds 1.5 megawatts must file with the Commission, on or before November 1 of each year, a statement under oath showing the gross amount of power generated (or produced by nonelectrical equipment) and the amount of power used for pumped storage pumping by the project during the preceding fiscal year, expressed in kilowatt hours. If any licensee does not report the gross energy output of its project within the time specified above, the Commission's staff will estimate the energy output and this estimate may be used in lieu of the filings required by this section made by such licensee after November 1.
(5) For unconstructed projects, the assessments begin on the date by which the licensee or exemptee is required to commence project construction, or as that deadline may be extended. For constructed projects, the assessments begin on the effective date of the license or exemption, except for any new
capacity authorized therein. The assessments for new authorized capacity at licensed or exempted projects begin on the date by which the licensee or exemptee is required to commence construction of the new capacity. In the event that assessments begin during a fiscal year, the charges will be prorated.
(d)
State and municipal licensees and exemptees.
For State or municipal licensees and exemptees:
(1) A determination shall be made for each fiscal year of the cost of administration under Part I of the Federal Power Act chargeable to such licensees and exemptees, from which shall be deducted any administrative costs that are stated in the license or exemption or that are fixed by the Commission in determining headwater benefit payments.
(2) An exemption will be granted to a licensee or exemptee to the extent, if any, to which it may be entitled under section 10(e) of the Act provided the data is submitted as requested in paragraphs (d) (4) and (5) of this section.
(3) For each fiscal year the total actual cost of administration as determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section will be assessed against each such licensee or exemptee (except to the extent of the exemptions granted pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section) in the proportion that the authorized installed capacity of each such project bears to the total such capacity under all such outstanding licenses or exemptions.
(4) To enable the Commission to compute on the bill for annual charges the exemption to which State and municipal licensees and exemptees are entitled because of the use of power by the licensee or exemptee for State or municipal purposes, each such licensee or exemptee must file with the Commission, on or before November 1 of each year, a statement under oath showing the following information with respect to the power generated by the project and the disposition thereof during the preceding fiscal year, expressed in kilowatt-hours:
(i) Gross amount of power generated by the project.
(ii) Amount of power used for station purposes and lost in transmission, etc.
(iii) Net amount of power available for sale or use by licensee or exemptee, classified as follows:
(A) Used by licensee or exemptee.
(B) Sold by licensee or exemptee.
(5) When the power from a licensed or exempted project owned by a State or municipality enters into its electric system, making it impracticable to meet the requirements of this section with respect to the disposition of project power, such licensee or exemptee may, in lieu thereof, furnish similar information with respect to the disposition of the available power of the entire electric system of the licensee or exemptee.
(6) The assessments commence on the date of commencement of project operation. In the event that project operation commences during a fiscal year, the charges will be prorated based on the date on which operation commenced.
(e)
Transmission lines.
For projects involving transmission lines only, the administrative charge will be stated in the license.
(f)
Maximum charge.
No licensed or exempted project's annual charge may exceed a maximum charge established each year by the Commission to equal 2.0 percent of the adjusted Commission costs of administration of the hydropower regulatory program. For every project with an annual charge determined to be above the maximum charge, that project's annual charge will be set at the maximum charge, and any amount above the maximum charge will be reapportioned to the remaining projects. The reapportionment will be computed using the method outlined in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section (but excluding any project whose annual charge is already set at the maximum amount). This procedure will be repeated until no project's annual charge exceeds the maximum charge.
(g)
Commission's costs.
(1) With respect to costs incurred by the Commission, the assessment of annual charges will be based on an estimate of the costs of administration of Part I of the Federal Power Act that will be incurred during the fiscal year in which the annual charges are assessed. After the end of the fiscal year, the assessment will be
recalculated based on the costs of administration that were actually incurred during that fiscal year; the actual costs will be compared to the estimated costs; and the difference between the actual and estimated costs will be carried over as an adjustment to the assessment for the subsequent fiscal year.
(2) The issuance of bills based on the administrative costs incurred by the Commission during the year in which the bill is issued will commence in 1993. The annual charge for the administrative costs that were incurred in fiscal year 1992 will be billed in 1994. At the licensee's option, the charge may be paid in three equal annual installments in fiscal years 1994, 1995, and 1996, plus any accrued interest. If the licensee elects the three-year installment plan, the Commission will accrue interest (at the most recent yield of two-year Treasury securities) on the unpaid charges and add the accrued interest to the installments billed in fiscal years 1995 and 1996.
(h) In making their annual reports to the Commission on their costs in administering Part I of the Federal Power Act, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service are to deduct any amounts that were deposited into their Treasury accounts during that year as reimbursements for conducting studies and reviews pursuant to section 30(e) of the Federal Power Act.
(i)
Definition.
As used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section,
authorized installed capacity
means the lesser of the ratings of the generator or turbine units. The rating of a generator is the product of the continuous-load capacity rating of the generator in kilovolt-amperes (kVA) and the system power factor in kW/kVA. If the licensee or exemptee does not know its power factor, a factor of 1.0 kW/kVA will be used. The rating of a turbine is the product of the turbine's capacity in horsepower (hp) at best gate (maximum efficiency point) opening under the manufacturer's rated head times a conversion factor of 0.75 kW/hp. If the generator or turbine installed has a rating different from that authorized in the license or exemption, or the installed generator is rewound or otherwise modified to change its rating, or the turbine is modified to change its rating, the licensee or exemptee must apply to the Commission to amend its authorized installed capacity to reflect the change.
(j)
Transition.
For a license having the capacity of the project for annual charge purposes stated in horsepower, that capacity shall be deemed to be the capacity stated in kilowatts elsewhere in the license, including any amendments thereto.
[60 FR 15047, Mar. 22, 1995, as amended by Order 584, 60 FR 57925, Nov. 24, 1995; Order 815, 80 FR 63671, Oct. 21, 2015; Order 857, 84 FR 7991, Mar. 6, 2019]
§ 11.2
Use of government lands.
(a) Reasonable annual charges for recompensing the United States for the use, occupancy, and enjoyment of its lands (other than lands adjoining or pertaining to Government dams or other structures owned by the United States Government) or its other property, will be fixed by the Commission.
(b)
General rule.
Annual charges for the use of government lands will be payable in advance, and will be set on the basis of an annual schedule of per-acre rental fees, as set forth in Appendix A of this part. The Executive Director will publish the updated fee schedule in the
Federal Register.
(c) The annual per-acre rental fee is the product of four factors: the adjusted per-acre value multiplied by the encumbrance factor multiplied by the rate of return multiplied by the annual adjustment factor.
(1)
Adjusted per-acre value.
(i) Counties (or other geographical areas) are assigned a per-acre value based on their average per-acre land and building value published in the Census of Agriculture (Census) by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). The adjusted per-acre value is computed by reducing the NASS Census land and building value by the sum of a state-specific modifier and seven percent. A table of state-specific adjustments will be available on the Commission's Web site.
(ii) The state-specific modifier is a percentage reduction applicable to all counties or geographic areas in a state (except Puerto Rico), and represents
the ratio of the total value of irrigated farmland in the state to the total value of all farmland in the state. The state-specific modifier will be recalculated every five years beginning in payment year 2016.
(iii) The state-specific modifier for Puerto Rico is 13 percent.
(iv) For all geographic areas in Alaska except for the Aleutian Islands Area, the Commission will calculate a statewide per-acre value based on the average per-acre land and building values published in the NASS Census for the Kenai Peninsula Area and the Fairbanks Area. This statewide per-acre value will be reduced by the sum of the state-specific modifier and seven percent. The resulting adjusted statewide per-acre value will be applied to all projects located in Alaska, except for projects located in the Aleutian Island Area.
(2)
Encumbrance factor.
The encumbrance factor is 50 percent.
(3)
Rate of return.
The rate of return is 5.77 percent through payment year 2025. The rate of return will be adjusted every 10 years thereafter, and will be based on the 10-year average of the 30-year Treasury bond yield rate immediately preceding the applicable NASS Census. For example, for years 2026 through 2035, the rate of return will be based on the 10-year average (2012-2021) of the 30-year Treasury bond yield rate immediately preceding the 2022 NASS Census. If the 30-year Treasury bond yield rate is not available, the next longest term Treasury bond available should be used in its place.
(4)
Annual adjustment factor.
The annual adjustment factor is 1.9 percent through payment year 2015. For years 2016 through 2025, the annual adjustment factor is the annual change in the Implicit Price Deflator for the Gross Domestic Product (IPD-GDP) for the ten years (2014-2023) preceding issuance (2024) of the most recent NASS Census (2022). Each subsequent ten year adjustment will be made in the same manner.
(d) The annual charge for the use of Government lands for 2013 will be reduced by 25 percent for all licensees subject to this section.
(e) The minimum annual charge for the use of Government lands under any license will be $25.
[Order 774, 78 FR 5265, Jan. 25, 2013, as amended by Order 838, 83 FR 7, Jan. 2, 2018]
§ 11.3
Use of government dams, excluding pumped storage projects.
(a)
General rule.
(1) Any licensee whose non-Federal project uses a Government dam or other structure for electric power generation and whose annual charges are not already specified in final form in the license must pay the United States an annual charge for the use of that dam or other structure as determined in accordance with this section. Payment of such annual charge is in addition to any reimbursement paid by a licensee for costs incurred by the United States as a direct result of the licensee's project development at such Government dam.
(2) Any licensee that is obligated under the terms of a license issued on or before September 16, 1986 to pay specified annual charges for the use of a Government dam must continue to pay the annual charges prescribed in the project license pending any readjustment of the annual charge for the project made pursuant to section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act.
(b)
Graduated flat rates.
Annual charges for the use of Government dams or other structures owned by the United States are 1 mill per kilowatt-hour for the first 40 gigawatt-hours of energy a project produces, 1
1/2
mills per kilowatt-hour for over 40 up to and including 80 gigawatt-hours, and 2 mills per kilowatt-hour for any energy the project produces over 80 gigawatt-hours.
(c)
Information reporting.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, each licensee must file with the Commission, on or before November 1 of each year, a sworn statement showing the gross amount of energy generated during the preceding fiscal year and the amount of energy provided free of charge to the Government. The determination of the annual charge will be based on the gross energy production less the energy provided free of charge to the Government.
(2) A licensee who has filed these data under another section of part 11 or
who has submitted identical data with FERC or the Energy Information Administration for the same fiscal year is not required to file the information described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Referenced filings should be identified by company name, date filed, docket or project number, and form, number.
(d)
Credits.
A licensee may file a request with the Director of the Office of Energy Projects for a credit for contractual payments made for construction, operation, and maintenance of a Government dam at any time before 30 days after receiving a billing for annual charges determined under this section. The Director, or his designee, will grant such a credit only when the licensee demonstrates that a credit is reasonably justified. The Director, or his designee, shall consider, among other factors, the contractual arrangements between the licensee and the Federal agency which owns the dam and whether these arrangements reveal clearly that substantial payments are being made for power purposes, relevant legislation, and other equitable factors.

§ 11.4
Use of government dams for pumped storage projects, and use of tribal lands.
(a)
General Rule.
The Commission will determine on a case-by-case basis under section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act the annual charges for any pumped storage project using a Government dam or other structure and for any project using tribal lands within Indian reservations.
(b)
Information reporting.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section a Licensee whose project includes pumped storage facilities must file with the Commission, on or before November 1 of each year, a sworn statement showing the gross amount of energy generated during the preceding fiscal year, and the amount of energy provided free of charge to the Government, and the amount of energy used for pumped storage pumping.
(2) A licensee who has filed these data under another section of part 11 or who has submitted identical data with FERC or the Energy Information Administration for the same fiscal year is not required to file the information required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Referenced filings should be identified by company name, date filed, docket or project number, and form number.
(c) Commencing in 1993, the annual charges for any project using tribal land within Indian reservations will be billed during the fiscal year in which the land is used, for the use of that land during that year.
[Order 379, 49 FR 22778, June 1, 1984. Redesignated at 51 FR 24318, July 3, 1986; Order 469, 52 FR 18209, May 14, 1987; 52 FR 33802, Sept. 8, 1987; Order 551, 58 FR 15770, Mar. 24, 1993]
§ 11.5
Exemption of minor projects.
No exemption will be made from payment of annual charges for the use of Government dams or tribal lands within Indian reservations but licenses may be issued without charges other than for such use for the development, transmission, or distribution of power for domestic, mining, or other beneficial use in minor projects.
[Order 141, 12 FR 8492, Dec. 19, 1947. Redesignated by Order 379, 49 FR 22778, June 1, 1984. Redesignated at 51 FR 24318, July 3, 1986]
§ 11.6
Exemption of State and municipal licensees and exemptees.
(a)
Bases for exemption.
A State or municipal licensee or exemptee may claim total or partial exemption from the assessment of annual charges upon one or more of the following grounds:
(1) The project was primarily designed to provide or improve navigation;
(2) To the extent that power generated, transmitted, or distributed by the project was sold directly or indirectly to the public (ultimate consumer) without profit;
(3) To the extent that power generated, transmitted, or distributed by the project was used by the licensee for State or municipal purposes.
(b)
Projects primarily for navigation.
No State or municipal licensee shall be
entitled to exemption from the payment of annual charges on the ground that the project was primarily designed to provide or improve navigation unless the licensee establishes that fact from the actual conditions under which the project was constructed and was operated during the calendar year for which the charge is made.
(c)
State or municipal use.
A State or municipal licensee shall be entitled to exemption from the payment of annual charges for the project to the extent that power generated, transmitted, or distributed by the project is used by the licensee itself for State or municipal purposes, such as lighting streets, highways, parks, public buildings, etc., for operating licensee's water or sewerage system, or in performing other public functions of the licensee.
(d)
Sales to public.
No State or municipal licensee shall be entitled to exemption from the payment of annual charges on the ground that power generated, transmitted, or distributed by the project is sold to the public without profit, unless such licensee shall show:
(1) That it maintains an accounting system which segregates the operations of the licensed project and reflects with reasonable accuracy the revenues and expenses of the project;
(2) That an income statement, prepared in accordance with the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts, shows that the revenues from the sale of project power do not exceed the total amount of operating expenses, maintenance, depreciation, amortization, taxes, and interest on indebtedness, applicable to the project property. Periodic accruals or payments for redemption of the principal of bonds or other indebtedness may not be deducted in determining the net profit of the project.
(e)
Sales for resale.
Notwithstanding compliance by a State or municipal licensee with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, it shall be subject to the payment of annual charges to the extent that electric power generated, transmitted, or distributed by the project is sold to another State, municipality, person, or corporation for resale, unless the licensee shall show that the power was sold to the ultimate consumer without profit. The matter of whether or not a profit was made is a question of fact to be established by the licensee.
(f)
Interchange of power.
Notwithstanding compliance by a State or municipal licensee with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, it shall be subject to the payment of annual charges to the extent that power generated, transmitted, or distributed by the project was supplied under an interchange agreement to a State, municipality, person, or corporation for sale at a profit (which power was not offset by an equivalent amount of power received under such interchange agreement) unless the licensee shall show that the power was sold to ultimate consumers without profit.
(g)
Construction period.
During the period when the licensed project is under construction and is not generating power, it will be considered as operating without profit within the meaning of this section, and licensee will be entitled to total exemption from the payment of annual charges, except as to those charges relating to the use of a Government dam or tribal lands within Indian reservations.
(h)
Optional showing.
When the power from the licensed project enters into the electric power system of the State or municipal licensee, making it impracticable to meet the requirements set forth in this section with respect to the operations of the project only, such licensee may, in lieu thereof, furnish the same information with respect to the operations of said electric power system as a whole.
(i)
Application for exemption.
Applications for exemption from payment of annual charges shall be signed by an authorized executive officer or chief accounting officer of the licensee or exemptee and verified under oath. The application must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission in accordance with filing procedures posted on the Commission's Web site at
http://www.ferc.gov
within the time allowed (by § 11.20) for the payment of the annual charges. If the licensee or exemptee, within the time allowed for the payment of the annual charges, files notice that it intends to file an
application for exemption, an additional period of 30 days is allowed within which to complete and file the application for exemption. The filing of an application for exemption does not by itself alleviate the requirement to pay the annual charges, nor does it exonerate the licensee or exemptee from the assessment of penalties under § 11.21. If a bill for annual charges becomes payable after an application for an exemption has been filed and while the application is still pending for decision, the bill may be paid under protest and subject to refund.

# Subpart B—Charges for Headwater Benefits

# Source:
Order 453, 51 FR 24318, July 3, 1986, unless otherwise noted.
§ 11.10
General provision; waiver and exemptions; definitions.
(a)
Headwater benefits charges.
(1) The Commission will assess or approve charges under this subpart for direct benefits derived from headwater projects constructed by the United States, a licensee, or a pre-1920 permittee. Charges under this subpart will amount to an equitable part of the annual costs of interest, maintenance, and depreciation expenses of such headwater projects and the costs to the Commission of determining headwater benefits charges. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the owner of any non-Federal downstream project that receives headwater benefits must pay charges determined under this subpart.
(2) Headwater benefits are the additional electric generation at a downstream project that results from regulation of the flow of the river by the headwater, or upstream, project, usually by increasing or decreasing the release of water from a storage reservoir.
(b)
Waiver and exemptions.
The owner of a downstream project with installed generating capacity of 1.5 MW (2000 horsepower) or less or for which the Commission has granted an exemption from section 10(f) is not required to pay headwater benefits charges.
(c)
Definitions.
For purposes of this subpart:
(1)
Energy gains
means the difference between the number of kilowatt-hours of energy produced at a downstream project with the headwater project and that which would be produced without the headwater project.
(2)
Generation
means gross generation of electricity at a hydroelectric project, including generation needed for station use or the equivalent for direct drive units, measured in kilowatt-hours. It does not include energy used for or derived from pumping in a pumped storage facility.
(3)
Headwater project costs
means the total costs of an upstream project constructed by the United States, a licensee, or pre-1920 permittee.
(4)
Separable cost
means the difference between the cost of a multiple-function headwater project with and without any particular function.
(5)
Remaining benefits
means the difference between the separable cost of a specific function in a multiple-function project and the lesser of:
(i) The benefits of that function in the project, as determined by the responsible Federal agency at the time the project or function was authorized; or
(ii) The cost of the most likely alternative single-function project providing the same benefits.
(6)
Joint-use cost
means the difference between the total project cost and the total separable costs. Joint-use costs
are allocated among the project functions according to each function's percentage of the total remaining benefits.
(7)
Specific power cost
means that portion of the headwater project costs that is directly attributable to the function of power generation at the headwater project, including, but not limited to, the cost of the electric generators, turbines, penstocks, and substation.
(8)
Joint-use power cost
means the portion of the joint-use cost allocated to the power function of the project.
(9)
Section 10(f) costs
means the annual interest, depreciation, and maintenance expense portion of the joint-use power cost, including costs of non-power functions required by statute to be paid by revenues from the power function.
(10)
Party
means:
(i) The owner of a non-Federal downstream hydroelectric project which is directly benefited by a headwater project constructed by the United States, a licensee, or a pre-1920 permittee;
(ii) The owner of a headwater project constructed by the United States, a licensee, or a pre-1920 permittee;
(iii) An operating agency of, or an agency marketing power from, a headwater project constructed by the United States; or
(iv) Any party, as defined in § 385.102(c) of this chapter.
(11)
Final charge
means a charge assessed on an annual basis to recover section 10(f) costs and which represents the final determination of the charge for the period for which headwater benefits are assessed. Final charges may be established retroactively, to finalize an interim charge, or prospectively.
(12)
Interim charge
means a charge assessed to recover section 10(f) costs for a specified period of headwater benefits pending determination of a final charge for that period.
(13)
Investment cost
means the sum of:
(i) Project construction costs, including cost of land, labor and materials, cost of pre- and post-authorization investigations, and cost of engineering, supervision, and administration during construction of the project; and
(ii) Interest during construction.

§ 11.11
Energy gains method of determining headwater benefits charges.
(a)
Applicability.
This section applies to any determination of headwater benefits charges, unless:
(1) The Commission has approved headwater benefits charges pursuant to an existing coordination agreement among the parties;
(2) The parties reach, and the Commission approves, a settlement with respect to headwater benefits charges, pursuant to § 11.14(a) of this subpart; or
(3) Charges may be assessed under § 11.14(b).
(b)
General rule
—(1)
Summary.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a headwater benefits charge for a downstream project is determined under this subpart by apportioning the section 10(f) costs of the headwater project among the headwater project and all downstream projects that are not exempt from or waived from headwater benefits charges under § 11.10(b) of this chapter, according to each project's share of the total energy benefits to those projects resulting from the headwater project.

The annual headwater benefits charge for a downstream project is derived by multiplying the section 10(f) cost by the ratio of the energy gains received by the downstream project to the sum of total energy gains received by all downstream projects (except those projects specified in § 11.10(b) of this chapter) plus the energy generated at the headwater project that is assigned to the joint-use power cost, as follows:
EC14NO91.093
In which:
P = annual payment to be made for headwater benefits received by a downstream project,
C
p
= annual section 10(f) cost of the headwater project,
E
n
= annual energy gains received at a downstream project, or group of projects if owned by one entity,
E
d
= annual energy gains received at all downstream projects (except those specified in § 11.10(b) of this chapter), and
E
j
= portion of the annual energy generated at the headwater project assigned to the joint-use power cost.
(3) If power generation is not a function of the headwater project, section 10(f) costs will be apportioned only among the downstream projects.
(4) If the headwater project is constructed after the downstream project, liability for headwater benefits charges will accrue beginning on the day on which any energy losses at the downstream project due to filling the headwater reservoir have been offset by subsequent energy gains. If the headwater project is constructed prior to the downstream project, liability for headwater benefits charges will accrue beginning on the day on which benefits are first realized by the downstream project.
(5) No final charge assessed by the Commission under this subpart may exceed 85 percent of the value of the energy gains. If a party demonstrates, within the time specified in § 11.17(b)(3) for response to a preliminary assessment, that any final charge assessed under this subpart, not including the cost of the investigation assessed under § 11.17(c), exceeds 85 percent of the value of the energy gains provided to the downstream project for the period for which the charge is assessed, the Commission will reduce the charge to not more than 85 percent of the value. For purposes of this paragraph, the
value of the energy gains
is the cost of obtaining an equivalent amount of electricity from the most likely alternative source during the period for which the charge is assessed.
§ 11.12
Determination of section 10(f) costs.
(a)
for non-Federal headwater projects.
If the headwater project was constructed by a licensee or pre-1920 permittee and a party requests the Commission to determine charges, the Commission will determine on a case-by-case basis what portion of the annual interest, maintenance, and depreciation costs of the headwater project constitutes the section 10(f) costs, for purposes of this subpart.
(b)
For Federal headwater projects.
(1) If the headwater project was constructed or is operated by the United States, and the Commission has not approved a settlement between the downstream project owner and the headwater project owner, the section 10(f) cost will be determined by deriving, from information provided by the headwater project owner pursuant to § 11.16 of this subpart, the joint-use power cost and the portion of the annual joint-use power cost that represents the interest, maintenance, and depreciation costs of the project.
(2) If power is not an authorized function of the headwater project, the section 10(f) cost is the annual interest, maintenance, and depreciation portion of the headwater project costs designated as the joint-use power cost, derived by deeming a power function at the project. The value of the benefits assigned to the deemed power function, for purposes of determining the value of remaining benefits of the joint-use power cost, is the total value of downstream energy gains included in the headwater benefits formula.
(3) For purposes of this paragraph,
total value of downstream energy gains
means the lesser of:
(i) The cost of generating an equivalent amount of electricity at the most likely alternative facility at the time the headwater project became operational; or
(ii) The incremental cost of installing electrical generation at the headwater project at the time the project became operational.
§ 11.13
Energy gains calculations.
(a)
Energy gains at a downstream project.
(1) Energy gains at a downstream project are determined by simulating operation of the downstream project with and without the effects of the headwater project. Except for determinations which are not complex or in which headwater benefits are expected to be small, calculations will be made by application of the Headwater Benefits Energy Gains Model, as presented in
The Headwater Benefits Energy Gains (HWBEG) Model Description and Users Manual,
which is available for the
National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161.
(2) If more than one headwater project provide energy gains to a downstream project, the energy gains at the downstream project are attributed to the headwater projects according to the time sequence of commencement of operation in which each headwater project provided energy gains at the downstream project, by:
(i) Crediting the headwater project that is first in time with the amount of energy gains that it provided to the downstream project prior to operation of the headwater project that is next in time; and
(ii) Crediting any subsequent headwater project with the additional increment of energy gains provided by it to the downstream project.
(3) Annual energy losses at a downstream project, or group of projects owned by the same entity, that are attributable to the headwater project will be subtracted from energy gains for the same annual period at the downstream project or group of projects. A net loss in one calendar year will be subtracted from net gains in subsequent years until no net loss remains.
(b)
Energy generated at the headwater project.
(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the portion of the total annual energy generation at the headwater project that is to be attributed to the joint-use power cost is derived by multiplying the total annual generation at the headwater project and the ratio of the project investment cost assigned to the joint-use power cost to the sum of the investment cost assigned to both the specific power cost and the joint-use power cost of the headwater project, as follows:
EC14NO91.112
In which:
E
j
= annual energy generated at the headwater project to be attributed to the joint-use power cost,
E = total annual generation at the headwater project,
C
j
= project investment costs assigned to the joint-use power cost, and
C
s
= project investment costs assigned to specific power costs.
(2) If the headwater project contains a pumped storage facility, calculation of the portion of the total annual energy generation at the headwater project that is attributable to the joint-use power cost will be determined on a case-by-case basis.
(3) If no power is generated at the headwater project, the amount of energy attributable to the joint-use power cost under this section is the total of all downstream energy gains included in the headwater benefits formula.
§ 11.14
Procedures for establishing charges without an energy gains investigation.
(a)
Settlements.
(1) Owners of downstream and headwater projects subject to this subpart may negotiate a settlement for headwater benefits charges. Settlements must be filed with the Commission for its approval, according to the provisions of § 385.602.
(2) If the headwater project is a Federal project, any settlement under this section must result in headwater benefits payments that approximate those that would result under the energy gains method.
(b)
Continuation of previous headwater benefits determinations.
(1) For any downstream project being assessed headwater benefit charges on or before September 16, 1986, the Commission will continue to assess charges to that project on the same basis until changes occur in the river basin, including hydrology or project development, that affect headwater benefits.
(2) Any procedures that apply to § 11.17(b)(5) of this subpart will apply to any prospectively fixed charges that are continued under this paragraph.
§ 11.15
Procedures for determining charges by energy gains investigation.
(a)
Purpose of investigations; limitation.
Except as permitted under § 11.14, the Commission will conduct an investigation to obtain information for establishing headwater benefits charges under this subpart. The Commission will investigate and determine charges for a project downstream from a non-
Federal headwater project only if the parties are unable to agree to a settlement and one of the parties requests the Commission to determine charges.
(b)
Notification.
The Commission will notify each downstream project owner and each headwater project owner when it initiates an investigation under this section, and the period of project operations to be studied will be specified. An investigation will continue until a final charge has been established for all years studied in the investigation.
(c)
Jurisdictional objections.
If any project owner wishes to object to the assessment of a headwater benefits charge on jurisdictional grounds, such objection must:
(1) Be raised within 30 days after the notice of the investigation is issued; and
(2) State in detail the grounds for its objection.
(d)
Investigations.
(1) For any downstream project for which a final charge pursuant to an investigation has never been established, the Commission will conduct an initial investigation to determine a final charge.
(2) The Commission may, for good cause shown by a party or on its own motion, initiate a new investigation of a river basin to determine whether, because of any change in the hydrology, project development, or other characteristics of the river basin that effects headwater benefits, it should:
(i) Establish a new final charge to replace a final charge previously established under § 11.17(b)(5); or
(ii) Revise any variable of the headwater benefits formula that has become a constant in calculating a final charge.
(3)
Scope of investigations.
(i) The Commission will establish a final charge pursuant to an investigation based on information available to the Commission through the annual data submission requirements of § 11.16, if such information is adequate to establish a reasonably accurate final charge.
(ii) If the information available to the Commission is not sufficient to provide a reasonably accurate calculation of the final charge, the Commission will request additional data and conduct any studies, including studies of the hydrology of the river basin and project operations, that it determines necessary to establish the charge.
§ 11.16

(2) The Commission will notify the project owner that certain data items in paragraphs (b) and (c) are no longer required to be submitted annually if:
(i) A variable in the headwater benefits formula has become a constant; or
(ii) A prospective final charge, as described in § 11.17(b)(5), has been established.
(e)
Additional data.
Owners of headwater projects or downstream projects must furnish any additional data required by the Commission staff under paragraph (a) of this section and may provide other data which they consider relevant.
§ 11.17
Procedures for payment of charges and costs.
(a)
Payment for benefits from a non-Federal headwater project.
Any billing procedures and payments determined between a non-Federal headwater project owner and a downstream project owner will occur according to the agreement of those parties.
(b)
Charges and payment for benefits from a Federal headwater project
—(1)
Interim charges.
(i) If the Commission has not established a final charge and an investigation is pending, the Commission will issue a downstream project owner a bill for the interim charge and costs and a staff report explaining the calculation of the interim charge.
(ii) An interim charge will be a percentage of the estimate by the Commission staff of what the final charge will be, as follows:
(A) 100 percent of the estimated final charge if the Commission previously has completed an investigation of the project for which it is assessed; or
(B) 80 percent of the estimated final charge if the Commission has not completed an investigation of the project for which it is assessed.
(iii) When a final charge is established for a period for which an interim charge was paid, the Commission will apply the amount paid to the final charge.
(2)
Preliminary assessment of a final charge.
Unless the project owner was assessed a final charge in the previous year, the Commission will issue to the downstream project owner a preliminary assessment of any final charge when it is determined. A staff technical
report explaining the basis of the assessment will be enclosed with the preliminary assessment. Copies of the preliminary assessment will be mailed to all parties.
(3)
Opportunity to respond.
After issuance of a preliminary assessment of a final charge, parties may respond in writing within 60 days after the preliminary assessment.
(4)
Order and bill.
(i) After the opportunity for written response by the parties to the preliminary assessment of a final charge, the Commission will issue to the downstream project owner an order establishing the final charge. Copies of the order will be mailed to all parties. A bill will be issued for the amount of the final charge and costs.
(ii) If a final charge is not established prospectively under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the Commission will issue an order and a bill for the final charge and costs each year until prospective final charges are established. After the Commission issues an order establishing a prospective final charge, a bill will be issued annually for the amount of the final charge and costs.
(5)
Prospective final charges.
When the Commission determines that historical data, including the hydrology, development, and other characteristics of the river basin, demonstrate sufficient stability to project average energy gains and section 10(f) costs, the Commission will issue to the downstream project owner an order establishing the final charge from future years. Copies of the order will be mailed to all parties. The prospective final charge will remain in effect until a new investigation is initiated under § 11.15(d)(2).
(6)
Payment under protest.
Any payment of a final charge required by this section may be made under protest if a party is also appealing the final charge pursuant to § 385.1902, or requesting rehearing. If payment is made under protest, that party will avoid any penalty for failure to pay under § 11.21.
(7)
Accounting for payments pending appeal or rehearing.
The Commission will retain any payment received for final charges from bills issued pursuant to this section in a special account. No disbursements to the U.S. Treasury will be made from the account until 31 days after the bill is issued. If an appeal under § 385.1902 or a request for rehearing is filed by any party, no disbursements to the U.S. Treasury will be made until final disposition of the appeal or request for rehearing.
(c)
Charges for costs of determinations of headwater benefits charges.
(1) Any owner of a downstream project that benefits from a Federal headwater project must pay to the United States the cost of making any investigation, study, or determination relating to the assessment of the relevant headwater benefits charge under this subpart.
(2) If any owner of a headwater or downstream project requests that the Commission determine headwater benefits charges for benefits provided by non-Federal headwater projects, the headwater project owners must pay a pro rata share of 50 percent of the cost of making the investigation and determination, in proportion to the benefits provided by their projects, and the downstream project owners must pay a pro rata share of the remaining 50 percent in proportion to the energy gains received by their projects.
(3) Any charge assessed under this paragraph is separate from and will be added to, any final or interim charge under this subpart.

# Subpart C—General Procedures
§ 11.20
Time for payment.
Annual charges must be paid no later than 45 days after rendition of a bill by the Commission. If the licensee or exemptee believes that the bill is incorrect, no later than 45 days after its rendition the licensee or exemptee may file an appeal of the bill with the Chief Financial Officer. No later than 30 days after the date of issuance of the Chief Financial Officer's decision on the appeal, the licensee or exemptee may file a request for rehearing of that decision pursuant to § 385.713 of this chapter. In the event that a timely appeal to the Chief Financial Officer or a timely request to the Commission for rehearing is filed, the payment of the bill may be made under protest, and subject to refund pending the outcome of the appeal or rehearing.
[60 FR 15048, Mar. 22, 1995]
§ 11.21
Penalties.
If any person fails to pay annual charges within the periods specified in § 11.20, a penalty of 5 percent of the total delinquent amount will be assessed and added to the total charges for the first month or part of month in which payment is delinquent. An additional penalty of 3 percent for each full month thereafter will be assessed until the charges and penalties are satisfied in accordance with law. The Commission may, by order, waive any penalty imposed by this subsection, for good cause shown.

Hearings.
A hearing upon such an application may be ordered by the Commission in its discretion and shall be in accordance with the provisions of subpart E of part 385 of this chapter.

# Note 1:
On April 17, 1922, the Commission made the following general determination:
(a) That where lands of the United States have heretofore been, or hereafter may be, reserved or classified as power sites, such reservation or classification being made solely because such lands are either occupied by power transmission lines or their occupancy and use for such purposes has been applied for or authorized under appropriate laws of the United States, and such lands have otherwise no value for power purposes,
and are not occupied in trespass, the Commission determines that the value of such lands so reserved or classified, or so applied for or authorized, will not be injured or destroyed for the purposes of power development by location, entry, or selection under the public land laws, subject to the reservation of section 24 of the Federal Water Power Act (41 Stat. 1075; 16 U.S.C. 818).
(b) That when notice is given to the Secretary of the Interior of reservations made under the provisions of section 24 of the Federal Water Power Act, such notice shall indicate what lands so reserved, if any, may, in accordance with the determination of the preceding paragraph, be declared open to location, entry, or selection, subject to the reservation of said section 24. Second Annual Report, page 128.

# Note 2:
On February 16, 1937, the Commission took the following action:
Consent to Establishment of Grazing Districts, Issuance of Grazing Permits, and Leasing for Grazing Purposes Under the Act of June 28, 1934, as Amended, Government Lands Reserved for Power Purposes
Upon request under date of November 2, 1936, by the acting director, Division of Grazing, Department of the Interior, for consent of the Commission, pursuant to the act of June 28, 1934 (48 Stat. 1269), to the establishment of grazing districts and the issuance of grazing permits on lands of the United States withdrawn, classified, or otherwise reserved for power purposes, except in those instances where grazing will interfere with such purposes; and
Upon request under date of December 7, 1936, by the Acting Secretary of the Interior for consent of the Commission, pursuant to the Act of June 28, 1934 (48 Stat. 1269), as amended by the Act of June 26, 1936 (49 Stat. 1976), to the leasing under section 15 of said Act as amended, of isolated tracts of lands of the United States, withdrawn for power purposes:
The Commission upon consideration of the matter finds and determines: That the establishment of grazing districts, the issuance of grazing permits, and the leasing for grazing purposes, under said Act as amended, of lands of the United States theretofore or thereafter withdrawn, classified or otherwise reserved for power purposes, but not including lands embraced within the project area of any power project theretofore licensed by the Commission or otherwise authorized by the United States, will not injure or destroy the value of such lands for the purposes of power development nor otherwise abridge the jurisdiction of the Commission; Provided, That such grazing districts shall be established and such permits and leases for grazing permits issued subject to the following conditions:
(1) That the establishment of the grazing district or the issuance of the grazing permit or lease for grazing purposes shall in no wise diminish or affect the jurisdiction of the Commission at any time to issue permits or licenses pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Power Act (49 Stat. 838; 16 U.S.C., Sup., 791-819); and that the issuance by the Commission of a license shall immediately and automatically terminate such grazing district, permit, or lease for grazing purposes as to all lands within the project area described in such license;
(2) That the establishment of the grazing district or the issuance of the grazing permit or lease for grazing purposes involving lands withdrawn for power purposes shall in no wise diminish or affect the jurisdiction of the Commission at any time to make further determinations that the value of any such lands for the purposes of power development will not be injured or destroyed by location entry or selection, as provided by section 24 of the Act and none of such lands shall be declared open, otherwise than as hereinbefore provided, to location, entry or selection except upon such further determination by the Commission; and any such further determination shall immediately and automatically terminate such grazing district, permit, or lease for grazing purposes as to any lands involved in such further determination.
Now, therefore, the Commission consents to the establishment of such grazing districts and the issuance of grazing permits and leases for grazing purposes of lands of the United States reserved for power purposes subject to the conditions hereinabove set out;
Provided, however, That this determination and consent shall be effective for lands embraced within grazing districts, as of the date of the establishment of such districts, and for isolated tracts of lands leased for grazing purposes, it shall be in effect when such leases are issued, provided that notice thereof is received by this Commission from the Bureau of Land Management, Department of the Interior, within 30 days thereafter, such notice to include full legal description of the lands, withdrawn for power purposes which are involved.

Order 642, 65 FR 71014, Nov. 28, 2000, unless otherwise noted.
§ 33.1
Applicability, definitions, and blanket authorizations.
(a)
Applicability.
(1) The requirements of this part will apply to any public utility seeking authorization under section 203 of the Federal Power Act to:
(i) Sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of the whole of its facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, or any part thereof of a value in excess of $10 million;
(ii) Merge or consolidate, directly or indirectly, its facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, or any part thereof, with the facilities of any other person, or any part thereof, that are subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission and have a value in excess of $10 million, by any means whatsoever;
(iii) Purchase, acquire, or take any security with a value in excess of $10 million of any other public utility; or
(iv) Purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire an existing generation facility:
(A) That has a value in excess of $10 million; and
(B) That is used in whole or in part for wholesale sales in interstate commerce by a public utility.
(2) The requirements of this part shall also apply to any holding company in a holding company system that includes a transmitting utility or an electric utility if such holding company seeks to purchase, acquire, or take any security with a value in excess of $10 million of, or, by any means whatsoever, directly or indirectly, merge or consolidate with, a transmitting utility, an electric utility company, or a holding company in a holding company system that includes a transmitting utility, or an electric utility company, with a value in excess of $10 million.
(b)
Definitions.
For the purposes of this part, as used in section 203 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824b).
(1)
Existing generation facility
means a generation facility that is operational at or before the time the section 203 transaction is consummated. “The time the transaction is consummated” means the point in time when the transaction actually closes and control of the facility changes hands. “Operational” means a generation facility for which construction is complete (
i.e.
, it is capable of producing power). The Commission will rebuttably presume that section 203(a) applies to the transfer of any existing generation facility unless the utility can demonstrate with substantial evidence that the generator is used exclusively for retail sales.
(2)
Non-utility associate company
means any associate company in a holding company system other than a public utility or electric utility company that has wholesale or retail customers served under cost-based regulation.
(3)
Value
when applied to:
(i) Transmission facilities, generation facilities, transmitting utilities, electric utility companies, and holding companies, means the market value of the facilities or companies for transactions between non-affiliated companies; the Commission will rebuttably presume that the market value is the transaction price. For transactions between affiliated companies, value means original cost undepreciated, as defined in the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts prescribed for public utilities and licensees in part 101 of this chapter, or original book cost, as applicable;
(ii) Wholesale contracts, means the market value for transactions between non-affiliated companies; the Commission will rebuttably presume that the market value is the transaction price. For transactions between affiliated companies, value means total expected nominal contract revenues over the remaining life of the contract; and
(iii) Securities, means market value for transactions between non-affiliated companies; the Commission will rebuttably presume that the market value is the agreed-upon transaction price. For transactions between affiliated companies, value means market value if the securities are widely traded, in which case the Commission will rebuttably presume that market value is the market price at which the securities are being traded at the time the transaction occurs; if the securities are not widely traded, market value is determined by:
(A) Determining the value of the company that is the issuer of the equity securities based on the total undepreciated book value of the company's assets;
(B) Determining the fraction of the securities at issue by dividing the number of equity securities involved in the transaction by the total number of outstanding equity securities for the company; and
(C) Multiplying the value determined in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section by the value determined in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section (
i.e.
, the value of the company multiplied by the fraction of the equity securities at issue).
(4) The terms
associate company, electric utility company, foreign utility company, holding company,
and
holding company system
have the meaning given those terms in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005. The term holding company does not include: A State, any political subdivision of a State, or any agency, authority or instrumentality of a State or political subdivision of a State; or an electric power cooperative.
(5) For purposes of this part, the term captive customers means any wholesale or retail electric energy customers served by a franchised public utility under cost-based regulation.
(c)
Blanket Authorizations.
(1) Any holding company in a holding company system that includes a transmitting utility or an electric utility is granted a blanket authorization under section 203(a)(2) of the Federal Power Act to purchase, acquire, or take any security of:
(i) A transmitting utility or company that owns, operates, or controls only facilities used solely for transmission in intrastate commerce and/or sales of electric energy in intrastate commerce, provided that if any public utility within the holding company system has captive customers, or owns or provides transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities, the holding company must report the acquisition to the Commission, including any state actions or conditions related to the transaction, and shall provide an explanation of why the transaction does not result in cross-subsidization;
(ii) A transmitting utility or company that owns, operates, or controls only facilities used solely for local distribution and/or sales of electric energy at retail regulated by a state commission, provided that if any public utility within the holding company system has captive customers, or owns or provides transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities, the holding company must report the acquisition to the Commission, including any state actions or conditions related to the transaction, and shall provide an explanation of why the transaction does not result in cross-subsidization; or
(iii) An electric utility company that owns generating facilities that total 100 MW or less and are fundamentally used for its own individual load or for sales to affiliated end-users.
(2) Any holding company in a holding company system that includes a transmitting utility or an electric utility is granted a blanket authorization under section 203(a)(2) of the Federal Power Act to purchase, acquire, or take:
(i) Any non-voting security (that does not convey sufficient veto rights over management actions so as to convey control) in a transmitting utility, an electric utility company, or a holding company in a holding company system that includes a transmitting utility or an electric utility company; or
(ii) Any voting security in a transmitting utility, an electric utility company, or a holding company in a holding company system that includes a transmitting utility or an electric utility company if, after the acquisition, the holding company will own less than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities; or
(iii) Any security of a subsidiary company within the holding company system.
(3) The blanket authorizations granted under paragraph (c)(2) of this section are subject to the conditions that the holding company shall not:
(i) Borrow from any electric utility company subsidiary in connection with such acquisition; or
(ii) Pledge or encumber the assets of any electric utility company subsidiary in connection with such acquisition.
(4) A holding company granted blanket authorizations in paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall provide the Commission copies of any Schedule 13D, Schedule 13G and Form 13F, at the same time and on the same basis, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with any securities purchased, acquired or taken pursuant to this section.
(5) Any holding company in a holding company system that includes a transmitting utility or an electric utility is granted a blanket authorization under section 203(a)(2) of the Federal Power Act to acquire a foreign utility company. However, if such holding company or any of its affiliates, its subsidiaries, or associate companies within the holding company system has captive customers in the United States, or owns or provides transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities in the United States, the authorization is conditioned on the holding company, consistent with 18 CFR 385.2005(b), verifying by a duly authorized corporate official of the holding company that the proposed transaction:
(i) Will not have any adverse effect on competition, rates, or regulation; and
(ii) Will not result in, at the time of the transaction or in the future:
(A) Any transfer of facilities between a traditional public utility associate company that has captive customers or that owns or provides transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities, and an associate company;
(B) Any new issuance of securities by a traditional public utility associate company that has captive customers or that owns or provides transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities, for the benefit of an associate company;
(C) Any new pledge or encumbrance of assets of a traditional public utility associate company that has captive customers or that owns or provides transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities, for the benefit of an associate company; or
(D) Any new affiliate contracts between a non-utility associate company and a traditional public utility associate company that has captive customers or that owns or provides transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities, other than non-power goods and services agreements subject to review under sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act.
(iii) A transaction by a holding company subject to the conditions in paragraphs (c)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section will be deemed approved only upon filing the information required in paragraphs (c)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(6) Any public utility or any holding company in a holding company system that includes a transmitting utility or an electric utility is granted a blanket authorization under sections 203(a)(1) or 203(a)(2) of the Federal Power Act, as relevant, for internal corporate reorganizations that do not result in the reorganization of a traditional public utility that has captive customers or that owns or provides transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities, and that do not present cross-subsidization issues.
(7) Any public utility in a holding company system that includes a transmitting utility or an electric utility is granted a blanket authorization under section 203(a)(1) of the Federal Power Act to purchase, acquire, or take any security of a public utility in connection with an intra-system cash management program, subject to safeguards to prevent cross-subsidization or pledges or encumbrances of utility assets.
(8) A person that is a holding company solely with respect to one or more exempt wholesale generators (EWGs), foreign utility companies (FUCOs), or qualifying facilities (QFs) is granted a blanket authorization under section 203(a)(2) of the Federal Power Act to acquire the securities of additional EWGs, FUCOs, or QFs.
(9) A holding company, or a subsidiary of that company, that is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank or by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 as amended by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, is granted a blanket authorization under section 203(a)(2) of the Federal Power Act to acquire and hold an unlimited amount
of the securities of holding companies that include a transmitting utility or an electric utility company if such acquisitions and holdings are in the normal course of its business and the securities are held:
(i) As a fiduciary;
(ii) As principal for derivatives hedging purposes incidental to the business of banking and it commits not to vote such securities to the extent they exceed 10 percent of the outstanding shares;
(iii) As collateral for a loan; or
(iv) Solely for purposes of liquidation and in connection with a loan previously contracted for and owned beneficially for a period of not more than two years, with the following conditions and reporting requirement: The holding does not confer a right to control, positively or negatively, through debt covenants or any other means, the operation or management of the public utility or public utility holding company, except as to customary creditors' rights or as provided under the United States Bankruptcy Code; and the parent holding company files with the Commission on a public basis and within 45 days of the close of each calendar quarter, both its total holdings and its holdings as principal, each by class, unless the holdings within a class are less than one percent of outstanding shares, irrespective of the capacity in which they were held.
(10) Any holding company, or a subsidiary of that company, is granted a blanket authorization under section 203(a)(2) of the Federal Power Act to acquire any security of a public utility or a holding company that includes a public utility:
(i) For purposes of conducting underwriting activities, subject to the condition that holdings that the holding company or its subsidiary are unable to sell or otherwise dispose of within 45 days are to be treated as holdings as principal and thus subject to a limitation of 10 percent of the stock of any class unless the holding company or its subsidiary has within that period filed an application under section 203 of the Federal Power Act to retain the securities and has undertaken not to vote the securities during the pendency of such application; and the parent holding company files with the Commission on a public basis and within 45 days of the close of each calendar quarter, both its total holdings and its holdings as principal, each by class, unless the holdings within a class are less than one percent of outstanding shares, irrespective of the capacity in which they were held;

(11) Any public utility is granted a blanket authorization under section 203(a)(1) of the Federal Power Act to transfer a wholesale market-based rate contract to any other public utility affiliate that has the same ultimate upstream ownership, provided that neither affiliate is affiliated with a traditional public utility with captive customers.
(12) A public utility is granted a blanket authorization under section 203(a)(1) of the Federal Power Act to transfer its outstanding voting securities to:
(i) Any holding company granted blanket authorizations in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section if, after the transfer, the holding company and any of its associate or affiliate companies in aggregate will own less than 10 percent of the outstanding voting interests of such public utility; or
(ii) Any person other than a holding company if, after the transfer, such person and any of its associate or affiliate companies in aggregate will own less than 10 percent of the outstanding voting interests of such public utility, and within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter in which such transfer has occurred the public utility notifies the Commission in accordance with paragraph (c)(17) of this section.

associate or affiliate companies in aggregate will own less than 10 percent of the outstanding voting interests of such public utility.
(14) A public utility is granted a blanket authorization under section 203(a)(1) of the Federal Power Act to transfer its outstanding voting securities to any holding company granted blanket authorization in paragraph (c)(9) of this section.

§ 33.3
Additional information requirements for applications involving horizontal competitive impacts.
(a)(1) The applicant must file the horizontal Competitive Analysis Screen described in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section if, as a result of the proposed transaction, a single corporate entity obtains ownership or control over the generating facilities of previously unaffiliated merging entities (for purposes of this section, merging entities means any party to the proposed transaction or its parent companies, energy subsidiaries or energy affiliates).
(2) A horizontal Competitive Analysis Screen need not be filed if the applicant:
(i) Affirmatively demonstrates that the merging entities do not currently conduct business in the same geographic markets or that the extent of the business transactions in the same geographic markets is
de minimis;
and
(ii) No intervenor has alleged that one of the merging entities is a perceived potential competitor in the same geographic market as the other.
(b) All data, assumptions, techniques and conclusions in the horizontal Competitive Analysis Screen must be accompanied by appropriate documentation and support.
(1) If the applicant is unable to provide any specific data required in this section, it must identify and explain how the data requirement was satisfied and the suitability of the substitute data.
(2) The applicant may provide other analyses for defining relevant markets (
e.g.
the Hypothetical Monopolist Test with or without the assumption of price discrimination) in addition to the delivered price test under the horizontal Competitive Analysis Screen.
(3) The applicant may use a computer model to complete one or more steps in the horizontal Competitive Analysis Screen. The applicant must fully explain, justify and document any model used and provide descriptions of model formulation, mathematical specifications, solution algorithms, as well as the annotated model code in executable form, and specify the software needed to execute the model. The applicant must explain and document how inputs were developed, the assumptions underlying such inputs and any adjustments made to published data that are used as inputs. The applicant must also explain how it tested the predictive value of the model, for example, using historical data.
(c) The horizontal Competitive Analysis Screen must be completed using the following steps:
(1)
Define relevant products.
Identify and define all wholesale electricity products sold by the merging entities during the two years prior to the date of the application, including, but not limited to, non-firm energy, short-term capacity (or firm energy), long-term capacity (a contractual commitment of more than one year), and ancillary services (specifically spinning reserves, non-spinning reserves, and imbalance
energy, identified and defined separately). Because demand and supply conditions for a product can vary substantially over the year, periods corresponding to those distinct conditions must be identified by load level, and analyzed as separate products.
(2)
Identify destination markets.
Identify each wholesale power sales customer or set of customers (destination market) affected by the proposed transaction. Affected customers are, at a minimum, those entities directly interconnected to any of the merging entities and entities that have purchased electricity at wholesale from any of the merging entities during the two years prior to the date of the application. If the applicant does not identify an entity to whom the merging entities have sold electricity during the last two years as an affected customer, the applicant must provide a full explanation for each exclusion.
(3)
Identify potential suppliers.
The applicant must identify potential suppliers to each destination market using the delivered price test described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. A seller may be included in a geographic market to the extent that it can economically and physically deliver generation services to the destination market.
(4)
Perform delivered price test.
For each destination market, the applicant must calculate the amount of relevant product a potential supplier could deliver to the destination market from owned or controlled capacity at a price, including applicable transmission prices, loss factors and ancillary services costs, that is no more than five (5) percent above the pre-transaction market clearing price in the destination market.
(i)
Supplier's presence.
The applicant must measure each potential supplier's presence in the destination market in terms of generating capacity, using economic capacity and available economic capacity measures. Additional adjustments to supplier presence may be presented; applicants must support any such adjustment.
(A)
Economic capacity
means the amount of generating capacity owned or controlled by a potential supplier with variable costs low enough that energy from such capacity could be economically delivered to the destination market. Prior to applying the delivered price test, the generating capacity meeting this definition must be adjusted by subtracting capacity committed under long-term firm sales contracts and adding capacity acquired under long-term firm purchase contracts (
i.e.,
contracts with a remaining commitment of more than one year). The capacity associated with any such adjustments must be attributed to the party that has authority to decide when generating resources are available for operation. Other generating capacity may also be attributed to another supplier based on operational control criteria as deemed necessary, but the applicant must explain the reasons for doing so.
(B)
Available economic capacity
means the amount of generating capacity meeting the definition of economic capacity less the amount of generating capacity needed to serve the potential supplier's native load commitments, as described in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.
(C)
Available transmission capacity.
Each potential supplier's economic capacity and available economic capacity (and any other measure used to determine the amount of relevant product that could be delivered to a destination market) must be adjusted to reflect available transmission capability to deliver each relevant product. The allocation to a potential supplier of limited capability of constrained transmission paths internal to the merging entities' systems or interconnecting the systems with other control areas must recognize both the transmission capability not subject to firm reservations by others and any firm transmission rights held by the potential supplier that are not committed to long-term transactions. For each such instance where limited transmission capability must be allocated among potential suppliers, the applicant must explain the method used and show the results of such allocation.
(D)
Internal interface.
If the proposed transaction would cause an interface that interconnects the transmission systems of the merging entities to become transmission facilities for which the merging entities would have a
“native load” priority under their open access transmission tariff (
i.e.,
where the merging entities may reserve existing transmission capacity needed for native load growth and network transmission customer load growth reasonable forecasted within the utility's current planning horizon), all of the unreserved capability of the interface must be allocated to the merging entities for purposes of the horizontal Competitive Analysis Screen, unless the applicant demonstrates one of the following:
(
1
) The merging entities would not have adequate economic capacity to fully use such unreserved transmission capability;
(
2
) The merging entities have committed a portion of the interface capability to third parties; or
(
3
) Suppliers other than the merging entities have purchased a portion of the interface capability.
(ii) [Reserved]
(5)
Calculate market concentration.
The applicant must calculate the market share, both pre- and post-merger, for each potential supplier, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) statistic for the market, and the change in the HHI statistic. (The HHI statistic is a measure of market concentration and is a function of the number of firms in a market and their respective market shares. The HHI statistic is calculated by summing the squares of the individual market shares, expressed as percentages, of all potential suppliers to the destination market.) To make these calculations, the applicant must use the amounts of generating capacity (
i.e.,
economic capacity and available economic capacity, and any other relevant measure) determined in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, for each product in each destination market.
(6)
Provide historical transaction data.
The applicant must provide historical trade data and historical transmission data to corroborate the results of the horizontal Competitive Analysis Screen. The data must cover the two-year period preceding the filing of the application. The applicant may adjust the results of the horizontal Competitive Analysis Screen, if supported by historical trade data or historical transmission service data. Any adjusted results must be shown separately, along with an explanation of all adjustments to the results of the horizontal Competitive Analysis Screen. The applicant must also provide an explanation of any significant differences between results obtained by the horizontal Competitive Analysis Screen and trade patterns in the last two years.
(d) In support of the delivered price test required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the applicant must provide the following data and information used in calculating the economic capacity and available economic capacity that a potential supplier could deliver to a destination market. The transmission data required by paragraphs (d)(7) through (d)(9) of this section must be supplied for the merging entities' systems. The transmission data must also be supplied for other relevant systems, to the extent data are publicly available.
(1)

(i) These cost components must include at a minimum:
(A) Variable operation and maintenance, including both fuel and non-fuel operation and maintenance; and
(B) Environmental compliance.
(ii) To the extent costs described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section are allocated among units at the same plant, allocation methods must be fully described.

(iii) If data on native load commitments are not available, the applicant must fully explain and justify any estimates of these commitments.
(5)
Transmission and ancillary service prices, and loss factors.
(i) The applicant must use in the horizontal Competitive Analysis Screen the maximum rates stated in the transmission providers' tariffs. If necessary, those rates should be converted to a dollars-per-megawatt hour basis and the conversion method explained.
(ii) If a regional transmission pricing regime is in effect that departs from system-specific transmission rates, the horizontal Competitive Analysis Screen must reflect the regional pricing regime.
(iii) The following data must be provided for each transmission system that would be used to deliver energy from each potential supplier to a destination market:
(A) Supplier name;
(B) Name of transmission system;
(C) Firm point-to-point rate;

(iv) The applicant may present additional alternative analysis using discount prices if the applicant can support it with evidence that discounting is and will be available.
(6)
Destination market price.
The applicant must provide, for each relevant product and destination market, market prices for the most recent two years. The applicant may provide suitable proxies for market prices if actual market prices are unavailable. Estimated prices or price ranges must be supported and the data and approach used to estimate the prices must be included with the application. If the applicant relies on price ranges in the analysis, such ranges must be reconciled with any actual market prices that are supplied in the application.

(ii) Transmission capability data must include the following information:
(A) Transmission path, interface, or facility name;
(B) Total transfer capability (TTC); and
(C) Firm available transmission capability (ATC).
(iii) Any estimated transmission capability must be supported and the data and approach used to make the estimates must be included with the application.
