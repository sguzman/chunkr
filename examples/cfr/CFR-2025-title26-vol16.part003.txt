The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (b):

# Example 1. Modification of allocation of GST exemption,
On December 1, 2003, T transfers $100,000 to an irrevocable GST trust described in section 2632(c)(3)(B). The transfer to the trust is not a direct skip. The date prescribed for filing the gift tax return reporting the taxable gift is April 15, 2004. On February 10, 2004, T files a Form 709 on which T properly elects out of the automatic allocation rules contained in section 2632(c)(1) with respect to the transfer in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, and allocates $50,000 of GST exemption to the trust. On April 13th of the same year, T files an additional Form 709 on which T confirms the election out of the automatic allocation rules contained in section 2632(c)(1) and allocates $100,000 of GST exemption to the trust in a manner that clearly indicates the intention to modify and supersede the prior allocation with respect to the 2003 transfer. The allocation made on the April 13 return supersedes the prior allocation because it is made on a timely-filed Form 709 that clearly identifies the trust and the nature and extent of the modification of GST exemption allocation. The allocation of $100,000 of GST exemption to the trust is effective as of December 1, 2003. The result would be the same if the amended Form 709 decreased the amount of the GST exemption allocated to the trust.

# Example 2. Modification of allocation of GST exemption,
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except, on July 8, 2004, T files a Form 709 attempting to reduce the earlier allocation. The return filed on July 8, 2004, is not a timely filed return. The $100,000 GST exemption allocated to the trust, as amended on April 13, 2004, remains in effect because an allocation, once made, is irrevocable and may not be modified after the last date on which a timely filed Form 709 may be filed.

# Example 3. Effective date of late allocation of GST exemption,
On November 15, 2003, T transfers $100,000 to an irrevocable GST trust described in section 2632(c)(3)(B). The transfer to the trust is not a direct skip. The date prescribed for filing the gift tax return reporting the taxable gift is April 15, 2004. On February 10, 2004, T files a Form 709 on which T properly elects out of the automatic allocation rules contained in section 2632(c)(1) in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section with respect to that transfer. On December 1, 2004, T files a Form 709 and allocates $50,000 to the trust. The allocation is effective as of December 1, 2004.

# Example 4. Effective date of late allocation of GST exemption,
T transfers $100,000 to an irrevocable GST trust on December 1, 2003, in a transfer that is not a direct skip. On April 15, 2004, T files a Form 709 on which T properly elects out of the automatic allocation rules contained in section 2632(c)(1) with respect to the entire transfer in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section and T does not make an allocation of any GST exemption on the Form 709. On September 1, 2004, the trustee makes a taxable distribution from the trust to T's grandchild in the amount of $30,000. Immediately prior to the distribution, the value of the trust assets was $150,000. On the same date, T allocates GST exemption to the trust in the amount of $50,000. The allocation of GST exemption on the date of the transfer is treated as preceding in point of time the taxable distribution. At the time of the GST, the trust has an inclusion ratio of .6667 (1—(50,000/150,000)).

# Example 5. Automatic allocation to split-gift,
On December 1, 2003, T transfers $50,000 to an irrevocable GST Trust described in section 2632(c)(3)(B). The transfer to the trust is not a direct skip. On April 30, 2004, T and T's spouse, S, each files an initial gift tax return for 2003, on which they consent, pursuant to section 2513, to have the gift treated as if one-half had been made by each. In spite of being made on a late-filed gift tax return for 2003, the election under section 2513 is valid because neither spouse had filed a timely gift tax return for that year. Previously, neither T nor S filed a timely gift tax return electing out of the automatic allocation rules contained in section 2632(c)(1). As a result of the election under section 2513, which is retroactive to the date of T's transfer, T and S are each treated as the transferor of one-half of the property transferred in the indirect skip. Thus, $25,000 of T's unused GST exemption and $25,000 of S's unused GST exemption is automatically allocated to the trust. Both allocations are effective on and after the date that T made the transfer. The result would be the same if T's transfer constituted a direct skip subject to the automatic allocation rules contained in section 2632(b).

# Example 6. Partial allocation of GST exemption,
On December 1, 2003, T transfers $100,000 to an irrevocable GST trust described in section 2632(c)(3)(B). The transfer to the trust is not a direct skip. The date prescribed for filing the gift tax return reporting the taxable
gift is April 15, 2004. On February 10, 2004, T files a Form 709 on which T allocates $40,000 of GST exemption to the trust. By filing a timely Form 709 on which a partial allocation is made of $40,000, T effectively elected out of the automatic allocation rules for the remaining value of the transfer for which T did not allocate GST exemption.
(iv)
Example.
The following example illustrates language that may be used in the statement required under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section to elect out of the automatic allocation rules under various scenarios:

# Example 1.
On March 1, 2006, T transfers $100,000 to Trust B, a GST trust described in section 2632(c)(3)(B). Subsequently, on September 15, 2006, T transfers an additional $75,000 to Trust B. No other transfers are made to Trust B in 2006. T attaches an election out statement to a timely filed Form 709 for calendar year 2006. Except with regard to paragraph (v) of this
Example 1,
the election out statement identifies Trust B as required under paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, and contains the following alternative election statements:
(i) “T hereby elects that the automatic allocation rules will not apply to the $100,000 transferred to Trust B on March 1, 2006.” The election out of the automatic allocation rules will be effective only for T's March 1, 2006, transfer and will not apply to T's $75,000 transfer made on September 15, 2006.
(ii) “Thereby elects that the automatic allocation rules will not apply to any transfers to Trust B in 2006.” The election out of the automatic allocation rules will be effective for T's transfers to Trust B made on March 1, 2006, and September 15, 2006.
(iii) “T hereby elects that the automatic allocation rules will not apply to any transfers to Trust B made by T in 2006 or to any additional transfers T may make to Trust B in subsequent years.” The election out of the automatic allocation rules will be effective for T's transfers to Trust B in 2006 and for all future transfers to be made by T to Trust B, unless and until T terminates the election out of the automatic allocation rules.
(iv) “T hereby elects that the automatic allocation rules will not apply to any transfers T has made or will make to Trust B in the years 2006 through 2008.” The election out of the automatic allocation rules will be effective for T's transfers to Trust B in 2006 through 2008. T's transfers to Trust B after 2008 will be subject to the automatic allocation rules, unless T elects out of those rules for one or more years after 2008. T may terminate the election out of the automatic allocation rules for 2007, 2008, or both in accordance with the termination rules of paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(E) of this section. T may terminate the election out for one or more of the transfers made in 2006 only on a later but still timely filed Form 709 for calendar year 2006.
(v) “T hereby elects that the automatic allocation rules will not apply to any current or future transfer that T may make to any trust.” The election out of the automatic allocation rules will be effective for all of T's transfers (current-year and future) to Trust B and to any and all other trusts (whether such trusts exist in 2006 or are created in a later year), unless and until T terminates the election out of the automatic allocation rules. T may terminate the election out with regard to one or more (or all) of the transfers covered by the election out in accordance with the termination rules of paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(E) of this section.
(c)
Special rules during an estate tax inclusion period
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Automatic allocations with respect to direct skips and indirect skips.
A direct skip or an indirect skip that is subject to an estate tax inclusion period (ETIP) is deemed to have been made only at the close of the ETIP. The transferor may prevent the automatic allocation of GST exemption to a direct skip or an indirect skip by electing out of the automatic allocation rules at any time prior to the due date of the Form 709 for the calendar year in which the close of the ETIP occurs (whether or not any transfer was made in the calendar year for which the Form 709 was filed, and whether or not a Form 709 otherwise would be required to be filed for that year). See paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section regarding the automatic allocation of GST exemption to an indirect skip subject to an ETIP.
(ii)
Other allocations.
An affirmative allocation of GST exemption cannot be revoked, but becomes effective as of (and no earlier than) the date of the close of the ETIP with respect to the trust. If an allocation has not been made prior to the close of the ETIP, an allocation of exemption is effective as of the close of the ETIP during the transferor's lifetime if made by the due date for filing the Form 709 for the calendar year in which the close of the ETIP occurs (timely ETIP return). An allocation of exemption is effective in the case of the close of the ETIP by reason of the death of the transferor as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
(iii)
Portion of trust subject to ETIP.
If any part of a trust is subject to an
ETIP, the entire trust is subject to the ETIP. See § 26.2642-1(b)(2) for rules determining the inclusion ratio applicable in the case of GSTs during an ETIP.
(2)
Estate tax inclusion period defined
—(i)
In general.
An ETIP is the period during which, should death occur, the value of transferred property would be includible (other than by reason of section 2035) in the gross estate of—
(A) The transferor; or
(B) The spouse of the transferor.
(ii)
Exceptions.
(A) For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the value of transferred property is not considered as being subject to inclusion in the gross estate of the transferor or the spouse of the transferor if the possibility that the property will be included is so remote as to be negligible. A possibility is so remote as to be negligible if it can be ascertained by actuarial standards that there is less than a 5 percent probability that the property will be included in the gross estate.
(B) For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the value of transferred property is not considered as being subject to inclusion in the gross estate of the spouse of the transferor, if the spouse possesses with respect to any transfer to the trust, a right to withdraw no more than the greater of $5,000 or 5 percent of the trust corpus, and such withdrawal right terminates no later than 60 days after the transfer to the trust.
(C) The rules of this paragraph (c)(2) do not apply to qualified terminable interest property with respect to which the special election under § 26.2652-2 has been made.
(3)
Termination of an ETIP.
An ETIP terminates on the first to occur of—
(i) The death of the transferor;
(ii) The time at which no portion of the property is includible in the transferor's gross estate (other than by reason of section 2035) or, in the case of an individual who is a transferor solely by reason of an election under section 2513, the time at which no portion would be includible in the gross estate of the individual's spouse (other than by reason of section 2035);
(iii) The time of a GST, but only with respect to the property involved in the GST; or
(iv) In the case of an ETIP arising by reason of an interest or power held by the transferor's spouse under subsection (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section, at the first to occur of—
(A) The death of the spouse; or
(B) The time at which no portion of the property would be includible in the spouse's gross estate (other than by reason of section 2035).
(4)
Treatment of direct skips.
If property transferred to a skip person is subject to an ETIP, the direct skip is treated as occurring on the termination of the ETIP.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section as they apply to the termination of an ETIP during the lifetime of the transferor. In each example assume that T transfers $100,000 to an irrevocable trust:

# Example 1. Allocation of GST exemption during ETIP,
The trust instrument provides that trust income is to be paid to T for 9 years or until T's prior death. The trust principal is to be paid to T's grandchild on the termination of T's income interest. If T dies within the 9-year period, the value of the trust principal is includible in T's gross estate under section 2036(a). Thus, the trust is subject to an ETIP. T files a timely Form 709 reporting the transfer and allocating $100,000 of GST exemption to the trust. The allocation of GST exemption to the trust is not effective until the termination of the ETIP.

# Example 2. Effect of prior allocation on termination of ETIP,
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except the trustee has the power to invade trust principal on behalf of T's grandchild, GC, during the term of T's income interest. In year 4, when the value of the trust is $200,000, the trustee distributes $15,000 to GC. The distribution is a taxable distribution. The ETIP with respect to the property distributed to GC terminates at the time of the taxable distribution. See paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section. Solely for purposes of determining the trust's inclusion ratio with respect to the taxable distribution, the prior $100,000 allocation of GST exemption (as well as any additional allocation made on a timely ETIP return) is effective immediately prior to the taxable distribution. See § 26.2642-1(b)(2). The trust's inclusion ratio with respect to the taxable distribution is therefore .50 (1−(100,000/200,000)).

# Example 3. Split-gift transfers subject to ETIP,
The trust instrument provides that trust income is to be paid to T for 9 years or until T's prior death. The trust principal is
to be paid to T's grandchild on the termination of T's income interest. T files a timely Form 709 reporting the transfer. T's spouse, S, consents to have the gift treated as made one-half by S under section 2513. Because S is treated as transferring one-half of the property to T's grandchild, S becomes the transferor of one-half of the trust for purposes of chapter 13. Because the value of the trust would be includible in T's gross estate if T died immediately after the transfer, S's transfer is subject to an ETIP. If S should die prior to the termination of the trust, S's executor may allocate S's GST exemption to the trust, but only to the portion of the trust for which S is treated as the transferor. However, the allocation does not become effective until the earlier of the expiration of T's income interest or T's death.

# Example 4. Transfer of retained interest as ETIP termination,
The trust instrument provides that trust income is to be paid to T for 9 years or until T's prior death. The trust principal is to be paid to T's grandchild on the termination of T's income interest. Four years after the initial transfer, T transfers the income interest to T's sibling. The ETIP with respect to the trust terminates on T's transfer of the income interest because, after the transfer, the trust property would not be includible in T's gross estate (other than by reason of section 2035) if T died at that time.

# Example 5. Election out of automatic allocation of GST exemption for trust subject to an ETIP,
On December 1, 2003, T transfers $100,000 to Trust A, an irrevocable GST trust described in section 2632(c)(3) that is subject to an estate tax inclusion period (ETIP). T made no other gifts in 2003. The ETIP terminates on December 31, 2008. T timely files a gift tax return (Form 709) reporting the gift on April 15, 2004. On May 15, 2006, T files a Form 709 on which T properly elects out of the automatic allocation rules contained in section 2632(c)(1) with respect to the December 1, 2003, transfer to Trust A in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section. Because the indirect skip is not deemed to occur until December 31, 2008, T's election out of automatic GST allocation filed on May 15, 2006, is timely, and will be effective as of December 31, 2008 (unless revoked on a Form 709 filed on or before the due date of a Form 709 for calendar year 2008).
(d)
Allocations after the transferor's death
—(1)
Allocation by executor.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d), an allocation of a decedent's unused GST exemption by the executor of the decedent's estate is made on the appropriate United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return (Form 706 or Form 706NA) filed on or before the date prescribed for filing the return by section 6075(a) (including any extensions actually granted (the due date)). An allocation of GST exemption with respect to property included in the gross estate of a decedent is effective as of the date of death. A timely allocation of GST exemption by an executor with respect to a lifetime transfer of property that is not included in the transferor's gross estate is made on a Form 709. A late allocation of GST exemption by an executor, other than an allocation that is deemed to be made under section 2632(b)(1) or (c)(1), with respect to a lifetime transfer of property is made on Form 706, Form 706NA, or Form 709 (filed on or before the due date of the transferor's estate tax return) and applies as of the date the allocation is filed. An allocation of GST exemption to a trust (whether or not funded at the time the Form 706 or Form 706NA is filed) is effective if the notice of allocation clearly identifies the trust and the amount of the decedent's GST exemption allocated to the trust. An executor may allocate the decedent's GST exemption by use of a formula. For purposes of this section, an allocation is void if the allocation is made for a trust that has no GST potential with respect to the transferor for whom the allocation is being made, as of the date of the transferor's death. For this purpose, a trust has GST potential even if the possibility of a GST is so remote as to be negligible.
(2)
Automatic allocation after death.
A decedent's unused GST exemption is automatically allocated on the due date for filing Form 706 or Form 706NA to the extent not otherwise allocated by the decedent's executor on or before that date. The automatic allocation occurs whether or not a return is actually required to be filed. Unused GST exemption is allocated pro rata (subject to the rules of § 26.2642-2(b)), on the basis of the value of the property as finally determined for purposes of chapter 11 (chapter 11 value), first to direct skips treated as occurring at the transferor's death. The balance, if any, of unused GST exemption is allocated pro rata (subject to the rules of § 26.2642-2(b)) on the basis of the chapter 11 value of the nonexempt portion of the trust property (or in the case of trusts
that are not included in the gross estate, on the basis of the date of death value of the trust) to trusts with respect to which a taxable termination may occur or from which a taxable distribution may be made. The automatic allocation of GST exemption is irrevocable, and an allocation made by the executor after the automatic allocation is made is ineffective. No automatic allocation of GST exemption is made to a trust that will have a new transferor with respect to the entire trust prior to the occurrence of any GST with respect to the trust. In addition, no automatic allocation of GST exemption is made to a trust if, during the nine month period ending immediately after the death of the transferor—
(i) No GST has occurred with respect to the trust; and
(ii) At the end of such period no future GST can occur with respect to the trust.
(e)
Effective dates.
This section is applicable as provided in § 26.2601-1(c), with the following exceptions:
(1) Paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3), the third sentence of paragraph (b)(4)(i), the fourth sentence of paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A)(
1
), paragraphs (b)(4)(iii) and (b)(4)(iv), and the fourth sentence of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, which will apply to elections made on or after July 13, 2004; and
(2) Paragraph (c)(1), and
Example 5
of paragraph (c)(5), which will apply to elections made on or after June 29, 2005.
[T.D. 8644, 60 FR 66903, Dec. 27, 1995; 61 FR 29654, June 12, 1996, as amended by T.D. 9208, 70 FR 37260, June 29, 2005]
§ 26.2641-1
Applicable rate of tax.
The rate of tax applicable to any GST (applicable rate) is determined by multiplying the maximum Federal estate tax rate in effect at the time of the GST by the inclusion ratio (as defined in § 26.2642-1). For this purpose, the maximum Federal estate tax rate is the maximum rate set forth under section 2001(c) (without regard to section 2001(c)(2)).
§ 26.2642-1
Inclusion ratio.
(a)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the inclusion ratio is determined by subtracting the applicable fraction (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth (.001)) from 1. In rounding the applicable fraction to the nearest one-thousandth, any amount that is midway between one one-thousandth and another one-thousandth is rounded up to the higher of those two amounts. For generation-skipping transfer tax rules related to an ABLE account established under section 529A, see § 1.529A-4 of this chapter.
(b)
Numerator of applicable fraction
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b), and in §§ 26.2642-3 (providing a special rule for charitable lead annuity trusts) and 26.2642-4 (providing rules for the redetermination of the applicable fraction), the numerator of the applicable fraction is the amount of GST exemption allocated to the trust (or to the transferred property in the case of a direct skip not in trust).
(2)
GSTs occurring during an ETIP
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of determining the inclusion ratio with respect to a taxable termination or a taxable distribution that occurs during an ETIP, the numerator of the applicable fraction is the sum of—
(A) The GST exemption previously allocated to the trust (including any allocation made to the trust prior to any taxable termination or distribution) reduced (but not below zero) by the nontax amount of any prior GSTs with respect to the trust; and
(B) Any GST exemption allocated to the trust on a timely ETIP return filed after the termination of the ETIP. See § 26.2632-1(c)(5)
Example 2.
(ii)
Nontax amount of a prior GST.
(
1
) The nontax amount of a prior GST with respect to the trust is the amount of the GST multiplied by the applicable fraction attributable to the trust at the time of the prior GST.
(
2
) For rules regarding the allocation of GST exemption to property during an ETIP, see § 26.2632-1(c).
(c)
Denominator of applicable fraction
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c) and in §§ 26.2642-3 and 26.2642-4, the denominator of the applicable fraction is the value of the property transferred to the trust (or transferred in a direct skip
not in trust) (as determined under § 26.2642-2) reduced by the sum of—
(i) Any Federal estate tax and any State death tax incurred by reason of the transfer that is chargeable to the trust and is actually recovered from the trust;
(ii) The amount of any charitable deduction allowed under section 2055, 2106, or 2522 with respect to the transfer; and
(iii) In the case of a direct skip, the value of the portion of the transfer that is a nontaxable gift. See paragraph (c)(3) of this section for the definition of nontaxable gift.
(2)
Zero denominator.
If the denominator of the applicable fraction is zero, the inclusion ratio is zero.
(3)
Nontaxable gifts.
Generally, for purposes of chapter 13, a transfer is a nontaxable gift to the extent the transfer is excluded from taxable gifts by reason of section 2503(b) (after application of section 2513) or section 2503(e). However, a transfer to a trust for the benefit of an individual is not a nontaxable gift for purposes of this section unless—
(i) Trust principal or income may, during the individual's lifetime, be distributed only to or for the benefit of the individual; and
(ii) The assets of the trust will be includible in the gross estate of the individual if the individual dies before the trust terminates.
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section. See § 26.2652-2(d)
Examples 2
and
3
for illustrations of the computation of the inclusion ratio where the special (reverse QTIP) election may be applicable.

# Example 1. Computation of the inclusion ratio,
T transfers $100,000 to a newly-created irrevocable trust providing that income is to be accumulated for 10 years. At the end of 10 years, the accumulated income is to be distributed to T's child, C, and the trust principal is to be paid to T's grandchild. T allocates $40,000 of T's GST exemption to the trust on a timely-filed gift tax return. The applicable fraction with respect to the trust is .40 ($40,000 (the amount of GST exemption allocated to the trust) over $100,000 (the value of the property transferred to the trust)). The inclusion ratio is .60 (1 − .40). If the maximum Federal estate tax rate is 55 percent at the time of a GST, the rate of tax applicable to the transfer (applicable rate) will be .333 (55 percent (the maximum estate tax rate) × .60 (the inclusion ratio)).

# Example 2. Gift entirely nontaxable,
On December 1, 1996, T transfers $10,000 to an irrevocable trust for the benefit of T's grandchild, GC. GC possesses a right to withdraw any contributions to the trust such that the entire transfer qualifies for the annual exclusion under section 2503(b). Under the terms of the trust, the income is to be paid to GC for 10 years or until GC's prior death. Upon the expiration of GC's income interest, the trust principal is payable to GC or GC's estate. The transfer to the trust is a direct skip. T made no prior gifts to or for the benefit of GC during 1996. The entire $10,000 transfer is a nontaxable transfer. For purposes of computing the tax on the direct skip, the denominator of the applicable fraction is zero, and thus, the inclusion ratio is zero.

# Example 3. Gift nontaxable in part,
T transfers $12,000 to an irrevocable trust for the benefit of T's grandchild, GC. Under the terms of the trust, the income is to be paid to GC for 10 years or until GC's prior death. Upon the expiration of GC's income interest, the trust principal is payable to GC or GC's estate. Further, GC has the right to withdraw $10,000 of any contribution to the trust such that $10,000 of the transfer qualifies for the annual exclusion under section 2503(b). The amount of the nontaxable transfer is $10,000. Solely for purposes of computing the tax on the direct skip, T's transfer is divided into two portions. One portion is equal to the amount of the nontaxable transfer ($10,000) and has a zero inclusion ratio; the other portion is $2,000 ($12,000 − $10,000). With respect to the $2,000 portion, the denominator of the applicable fraction is $2,000. Assuming that T has sufficient GST exemption available, the numerator of the applicable fraction is $2,000 (unless T elects to have the automatic allocation provisions not apply). Thus, assuming T does not elect to have the automatic allocation not apply, the applicable fraction is one ($2,000/$2,000 = 1) and the inclusion ratio is zero (1 − 1 = 0).

# Example 4. Gift nontaxable in part,
Assume the same facts as in
Example 3,
except T files a timely Form 709 electing that the automatic allocation of GST exemption not apply to the $12,000 transferred in the direct skip. T's transfer is divided into two portions, a $10,000 portion with a zero inclusion ratio and a $2,000 portion with an applicable fraction of zero (0/$2,000 = 0) and an inclusion ratio of one (1 − 0 = 1).
[T.D. 8644, 60 FR 66903, Dec. 27, 1995, as amended by T.D. 9923, 85 FR 74047, Nov. 19, 2020]
§ 26.2642-2
Valuation.
(a)
Lifetime transfers
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of determining the denominator of the applicable fraction, the value of property transferred during life is its fair market value on the effective date of the allocation of GST exemption. In the case of a timely allocation under § 26.2632-1(b)(2)(ii), the denominator of the applicable fraction is the fair market value of the property as finally determined for purposes of chapter 12.

Special rule for late allocations during life.
If a transferor makes a late allocation of GST exemption to a trust, the value of the property transferred to the trust is the fair market value of the trust assets determined on the effective date of the allocation of GST exemption. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(2), if a transferor makes a late allocation of GST exemption to a trust, the transferor may, solely for purposes of determining the fair market value of the trust assets, elect to treat the allocation as having been made on the first day of the month during which the late allocation is made (valuation date). An election under this paragraph (a)(2) is not effective with respect to a life insurance policy or a trust holding a life insurance policy, if the insured individual has died. An allocation subject to the election contained in this paragraph (a)(2) is not effective until it is actually filed with the Internal Revenue Service. The election is made by stating on the Form 709 on which the allocation is made—
(i) That the election is being made;
(ii) The applicable valuation date; and
(iii) The fair market value of the trust assets on the valuation date.
(b)
Transfers at death
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of this section, in determining the denominator of the applicable fraction, the value of property included in the decedent's gross estate is its value for purposes of chapter 11. In the case of qualified real property with respect to which the election under section 2032A is made, the value of the property is the value determined under section 2032A provided the recapture agreement described in section 2032A(d)(2) filed with the Internal Revenue Service specifically provides for the signatories' consent to the imposition of, and personal liability for, additional GST tax in the event an additional estate tax is imposed under section 2032A(c). See § 26.2642-4(a)(4). If the recapture agreement does not contain these provisions, the value of qualified real property as to which the election under section 2032A is made is the fair market value of the property determined without regard to the provisions of section 2032A.
(2)
Special rule for pecuniary payments
—(i)
In general.
If a pecuniary payment is satisfied with cash, the denominator of the applicable fraction is the pecuniary amount. If property other than cash is used to satisfy a pecuniary payment, the denominator of the applicable fraction is the pecuniary amount only if payment must be made with property on the basis of the value of the property on—
(A) The date of distribution; or
(B) A date other than the date of distribution, but only if the pecuniary payment must be satisfied on a basis that fairly reflects net appreciation and depreciation (occurring between the valuation date and the date of distribution) in all of the assets from which the distribution could have been made.
(ii)
Other pecuniary amounts payable in kind.
The denominator of the applicable fraction with respect to any property used to satisfy any other pecuniary payment payable in kind is the date of distribution value of the property.
(3)
Special rule for residual transfers after payment of a pecuniary payment
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(3), the denominator of the applicable fraction with respect to a residual transfer of property after the satisfaction of a pecuniary payment is the estate tax value of the assets available to satisfy the pecuniary payment reduced, if the pecuniary payment carries appropriate interest (as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section), by the pecuniary amount. The denominator of the applicable fraction with respect to a residual transfer of property after the satisfaction of a pecuniary payment that
does not carry appropriate interest is the estate tax value of the assets available to satisfy the pecuniary payment reduced by the present value of the pecuniary payment. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(i), the present value of the pecuniary payment is determined by using—
(A) The interest rate applicable under section 7520 at the death of the transferor; and
(B) The period between the date of the transferor's death and the date the pecuniary amount is paid.
(ii)
Special rule for residual transfers after pecuniary payments payable in kind.
The denominator of the applicable fraction with respect to any residual transfer after satisfaction of a pecuniary payment payable in kind is the date of distribution value of the property distributed in satisfaction of the residual transfer, unless the pecuniary payment must be satisfied on the basis of the value of the property on—
(A) The date of distribution; or
(B) A date other than the date of distribution, but only if the pecuniary payment must be satisfied on a basis that fairly reflects net appreciation and depreciation (occurring between the valuation date and the date of distribution) in all of the assets from which the distribution could have been made.
(4)
Appropriate interest
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section and § 26.2654-1 (relating to certain trusts treated as separate trusts), appropriate interest means that interest must be payable from the date of death of the transferor (or from the date specified under applicable State law requiring the payment of interest) to the date of payment at a rate—
(A) At least equal to—
(
1
) The statutory rate of interest, if any, applicable to pecuniary bequests under the law of the State whose law governs the administration of the estate or trust; or
(
2
) If no such rate is indicated under applicable State law, 80 percent of the rate that is applicable under section 7520 at the death of the transferor; and
(B) Not in excess of the greater of—
(
1
) The statutory rate of interest, if any, applicable to pecuniary bequests under the law of the State whose law governs the administration of the trust; or
(
2
) 120 percent of the rate that is applicable under section 7520 at the death of the transferor.
(ii)
Pecuniary payments deemed to carry appropriate interest.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4), if a pecuniary payment does not carry appropriate interest, the pecuniary payment is considered to carry appropriate interest to the extent—
(A) The entire payment is made or property is irrevocably set aside to satisfy the entire pecuniary payment within 15 months of the transferor's death; or
(B) The governing instrument or applicable local law specifically requires the executor or trustee to allocate to the pecuniary payment a pro rata share of the income earned by the fund from which the pecuniary payment is to be made between the date of death of the transferor and the date of payment. For purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, property is irrevocably set aside if it is segregated and held in a separate account pending distribution.
(c)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section:

# Example 1. T transfers $100,000 to a newly-created irrevocable trust on December 15, 1996,
The trust provides that income is to be paid to T's child for 10 years. At the end of the 10-year period, the trust principal is to be paid to T's grandchild. T does not allocate any GST exemption to the trust on the gift tax return reporting the transfer. On November 15, 1997, T files a Form 709 allocating $50,000 of GST exemption to the trust. Because the allocation was made on a late filed return, the value of the property transferred to the trust is determined on the date the allocation is filed (unless an election is made pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section to value the trust property as of the first day of the month in which the allocation document is filed with the Internal Revenue Service). On November 15, 1997, the value of the trust property is $150,000. Effective as of November 15, 1997, the applicable fraction with respect to the trust is .333 ($50,000 (the amount of GST exemption allocated to the trust) over $150,000 (the value of the trust principal on the effective date of the GST exemption allocation)), and the inclusion ratio is .667 (1.0−.333).

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except the value of the trust property is $80,000 on November 15, 1997. The applicable fraction is .625 ($50,000 over $80,000) and the inclusion ratio is .375 (1.0−.625).

# Example 3.
T transfers $100,000 to a newly-created irrevocable trust on December 15, 1996. The trust provides that income is to be paid to T's child for 10 years. At the end of the 10-year period, the trust principal is to be paid to T's grandchild. T does not allocate any GST exemption to the trust on the gift tax return reporting the transfer. On November 15, 1997, T files a Form 709 allocating $50,000 of GST exemption to the trust. T elects to value the trust principal on the first day of the month in which the allocation is made pursuant to the election provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Because the late allocation is made in November, the value of the trust is determined as of November 1, 1997.

§ 26.2642-3
Special rule for charitable lead annuity trusts.
(a)
In general.
In determining the applicable fraction with respect to a charitable lead annuity trust—
(1) The numerator is the adjusted generation-skipping transfer tax exemption (adjusted GST exemption); and
(2) The denominator is the value of all property in the trust immediately after the termination of the charitable lead annuity.
(b)
Adjusted GST exemption defined.
The adjusted GST exemption is the amount of GST exemption allocated to the trust increased by an amount equal to the interest that would accrue if an amount equal to the allocated GST exemption were invested at the rate used to determine the amount of the estate or gift tax charitable deduction, compounded annually, for the actual period of the charitable lead annuity. If a late allocation is made to a charitable lead annuity trust, the adjusted GST exemption is the amount of GST exemption allocated to the trust increased by the interest that would accrue if invested at such rate for the period beginning on the date of the late allocation and extending for the balance of the actual period of the charitable lead annuity. The amount of GST exemption allocated to a charitable lead annuity trust is not reduced even though it is ultimately determined that the allocation of a lesser amount of GST exemption would have resulted in an inclusion ratio of zero. For purposes of chapter 13, a charitable lead annuity trust is any trust providing an interest in the form of a guaranteed annuity described in § 25.2522(c)-3(c)(2)(vi) of this chapter for which the transferor is allowed a charitable deduction for Federal estate or gift tax purposes.
(c)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of this section:

# Example.
T creates a charitable lead annuity trust for a 10-year term with the remainder payable to T's grandchild. T timely allocates an amount of GST exemption to the trust which T expects will ultimately result in a zero inclusion ratio. However, at the end of the charitable lead interest, because the property has not appreciated to the extent T anticipated, the numerator of the applicable fraction is greater than the denominator. The inclusion ratio for the trust is zero. No portion of the GST exemption allocated to the trust is restored to T or to T's estate.
§ 26.2642-4
Redetermination of applicable fraction.
(a)
In general.
The applicable fraction for a trust is redetermined whenever additional exemption is allocated to the trust or when certain changes occur with respect to the principal of the trust. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a), the numerator of the redetermined applicable fraction is the sum of the amount of GST exemption currently being allocated to the trust (if any) plus the value of the nontax portion of the trust, and the denominator of the redetermined applicable fraction is the value of the trust principal immediately after the event occurs. The nontax portion of a trust is determined by multiplying the value of the trust assets, determined immediately prior to the event, by the then applicable fraction.
(1)
Multiple transfers to a single trust.
If property is added to an existing trust, the denominator of the redetermined applicable fraction is the value of the trust immediately after the addition reduced as provided in § 26.2642-1(c).
(2)
Consolidation of separate trusts.
If separate trusts created by one transferor are consolidated, a single applicable fraction for the consolidated trust is determined. The numerator of the redetermined applicable fraction is the sum of the nontax portions of each trust immediately prior to the consolidation.
(3)
Property included in transferor's gross estate.
If the value of property held in a trust created by the transferor, with respect to which an allocation was made at a time that the trust was not subject to an ETIP, is included in the transferor's gross estate, the applicable fraction is redetermined if additional GST exemption is allocated to the property. The numerator of the redetermined applicable fraction is an amount equal to the nontax portion of the property immediately after the death of the transferor increased by the amount of GST exemption allocated by the executor of the transferor's estate to the trust. If additional GST exemption is not allocated to the trust, then, except as provided in this paragraph (a)(3), the applicable fraction immediately before death is not changed, if the trust was not subject to an ETIP at the time GST exemption was allocated to the trust. In any event, the denominator of the applicable fraction is reduced to reflect any federal or state, estate or inheritance taxes paid from the trust.
(4)
Imposition of recapture tax under section 2032A.
(i) If an additional estate tax is imposed under section 2032A and if the section 2032A election was effective (under § 26.2642-2(b)) for purposes of the GST tax, the applicable fraction with respect to the property is redetermined as of the date of death of the transferor. In making the redetermination, any available GST exemption not allocated at the death of the transferor (or at a prior recapture event) is automatically allocated to the property. The denominator of the applicable fraction is the fair market value of the property at the date of the transferor's death reduced as provided in § 26.2642-1(c) and further reduced by the amount of the additional GST tax actually recovered from the trust.
(ii) The GST tax imposed with respect to any taxable termination, taxable distribution, or direct skip occurring prior to the recapture event is recomputed based on the applicable fraction as redetermined. Any additional GST tax as recomputed is due and payable on the date that is six months after the event that causes the imposition of the additional estate tax under section 2032A. The additional GST tax is remitted with Form 706-A and is reported by attaching a statement to Form 706-A showing the computation of the additional GST tax.
(iii) The applicable fraction, as redetermined under this section, is also used in determining any GST tax imposed with respect to GSTs occurring after the date of the recapture event.
(b)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this section:

# Example 1. Allocation of additional exemption,
T transfers $200,000 to an irrevocable trust under which the income is payable to T's child, C, for life. Upon the termination of the trust, the remainder is payable to T's grandchild, GC. At a time when no ETIP exists with respect to the trust property, T makes a timely allocation of $100,000 of GST exemption, resulting in an inclusion ratio of .50. Subsequently, when the entire trust property is valued at $500,000, T allocates an additional $100,000 of T's unused GST exemption to the trust. The inclusion ratio of the trust is recomputed at that time. The numerator of the applicable fraction is $350,000 ($250,000 (the nontax portion as of the date of the allocation) plus $100,000 (the GST exemption currently being allocated)). The denominator is $500,000 (the date of allocation fair market value of the trust). The inclusion ratio is .30 (1 − .70).

# Example 2. Multiple transfers to a trust, allocation both timely and late,
On December 10, 1993, T transfers $10,000 to an irrevocable trust that does not satisfy the requirements of section 2642(c)(2). T makes identical transfers to the trust on December 10, 1994, 1995, 1996, and on January 15, 1997. Immediately after the transfer on January 15, 1997, the value of the trust principal is $40,000. On January 14, 1998, when the value of the trust principal is $50,000, T allocates $30,000 of GST exemption to the trust. T discloses the 1997 transfer on the Form 709 filed on January 14, 1998. Thus, T's allocation is a timely allocation with respect to the transfer in 1997, $10,000 of the allocation is effective as of the date of that transfer, and, on and after January 15, 1997, the inclusion ratio of the trust is .75 (1 − ($10,000/$40,000)). The balance of the allocation is a late allocation with respect to prior transfers to the trust and is effective as of January 14, 1998. In redetermining the inclusion ratio as of that date, the numerator
of the redetermined applicable fraction is $32,500 ($12,500 (.25 × $50,000), the nontax portion of the trust on January 14, 1998) plus $20,000 (the amount of GST exemption allocated late to the trust). The denominator of the new applicable fraction is $50,000 (the value of the trust principal at the time of the late allocation).

# Example 3. Excess allocation,
(i) T creates an irrevocable trust for the benefit of T's child and grandchild in 1996 transferring $50,000 to the trust on the date of creation. T allocates no GST exemption to the trust on the Form 709 reporting the transfer. On July 1, 1997 (when the value of the trust property is $60,000), T transfers an additional $40,000 to the trust.
(ii) On April 15, 1998, when the value of the trust is $150,000, T files a Form 709 reporting the 1997 transfer and allocating $150,000 of GST exemption to the trust. The allocation is a timely allocation of $40,000 with respect to the 1997 transfer and is effective as of that date. Thus, the applicable fraction for the trust as of July 1, 1997 is .40 ($40,000/$100,000 ($40,000 + $60,000)).
(iii) The allocation is also a late allocation of $90,000, the amount necessary to attain a zero inclusion ratio on April 15, 1998, computed as follows: $60,000 (the nontax portion immediately prior to the allocation (.40 × $150,000)) plus $90,000 (the additional allocation necessary to produce a zero inclusion ratio based on a denominator of $150,000)/$150,000 equals one and, thus, an inclusion ratio of zero. The balance of the allocation, $20,000 ($150,000 less the timely allocation of $40,000 less the late allocation of $90,000) is void.

# Example 4. Undisclosed transfer,
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that on February 1, 1998 (when the value of the trust is $150,000), T transfers an additional $50,000 to the trust and the value of the entire trust corpus on April 15, 1998 is $220,000. The Form 709 filed on April 15, 1998 does not disclose the 1998 transfer. Under the rule in § 26.2632-1(b)(2)(ii), the allocation is effective first as a timely allocation to the 1997 transfer; second, as a late allocation to the trust as of April 15, 1998; and, finally as a timely allocation to the February 1, 1998 transfer. As of April 15, 1998, $55,000, a pro rata portion of the trust assets, is considered to be the property transferred to the trust on February 1, 1998 (($50,000/$200,000) × $220,000). The balance of the trust, $165,000, represents prior transfers to the trust.
(ii) As in
Example
3, the allocation is a timely allocation as to the 1997 transfer (and the applicable fraction as of July 1, 1997 is .40) and a late allocation as of 1998. The amount of the late allocation is $99,000, computed as follows: (.40 × $165,000 plus $99,000)/$165,000 = one.
(iii) The balance of the allocation, $11,000 ($150,000 less the timely allocation of $40,000 less the late allocation of $99,000) is a timely allocation as of February 1, 1998. The applicable fraction with respect to the trust, as of February 1, 1998, is .355, computed as follows: $60,000 (the nontax portion of the trust immediately prior to the February 1, 1998 transfer (.40 × $150,000)) plus $11,000 (the amount of the timely allocation to the 1998 transfer)/$200,000 (the value of the trust on February 1, 1998, after the transfer on that date) = $71,000/$200,000 = .355.
(iv) The applicable fraction with respect to the trust, as of April 15, 1998, is .805 computed as follows: $78,100 (the nontax portion immediately prior to the allocation (.355 × $220,000)) plus $99,000 (the amount of the late allocation)/ $220,000 = $177,100/$220,000 = .805.

# Example 5. Redetermination of inclusion ratio on ETIP termination,
(i) T transfers $100,000 to an irrevocable trust. The trust instrument provides that trust income is to be paid to T for 9 years or until T's prior death. The trust principal is to be paid to T's grandchild, GC, on the termination of T's income interest. The trustee has the power to invade trust principal for the benefit of GC during the term of T's income interest. The trust is subject to an ETIP while T holds the retained income interest. T files a timely Form 709 reporting the transfer and allocates $100,000 of GST exemption to the trust. In year 4, when the value of the trust is $200,000, the trustee distributes $15,000 to GC. The distribution is a taxable distribution. Because of the existence of the ETIP, the inclusion ratio with respect to the taxable distribution is determined immediately prior to the occurrence of the GST. Thus, the inclusion ratio applicable to the year 4 GST is .50 (1 − ($100,000/$200,000)).
(ii) In year 5, when the value of the trust is again $200,000, the trustee distributes another $15,000 to GC. Because the trust is still subject to the ETIP in year 5, the inclusion ratio with respect to the year 5 GST is again computed immediately prior to the GST. In computing the new inclusion ratio, the numerator of the applicable fraction is reduced by the nontax portion of prior GSTs occurring during the ETIP. Thus, the numerator of the applicable fraction with respect to the GST in year 5 is $92,500 ($100,000 − (.50 × $15,000)) and the inclusion ratio applicable with respect to the GST in year 5 is .537 (1 − ($92,500/$200,000) = .463). Any additional GST exemption allocated on a timely ETIP return with respect to the GST in year 5 is effective immediately prior to the transfer.

§ 26.2642-5
Finality of inclusion ratio.
(a)
Direct skips.
The inclusion ratio applicable to a direct skip becomes
final when no additional GST tax (including additional GST tax payable as a result of a cessation, etc. of qualified use under section 2032A(c)) may be assessed with respect to the direct skip.
(b)
Other GSTs.
With respect to taxable distributions and taxable terminations, the inclusion ratio for a trust becomes final, on the later of—
(1) The expiration of the period for assessment with respect to the first GST tax return filed using that inclusion ratio (unless the trust is subject to an election under section 2032A in which case the applicable date under this subsection is the expiration of the period of assessment of any additional GST tax due as a result of a cessation, etc. of qualified use under section 2032A); or
(2) The expiration of the period for assessment of Federal estate tax with respect to the estate of the transferor. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), if an estate tax return is not required to be filed, the period for assessment is determined as if a return were required to be filed and as if the return were timely filed within the period prescribed by section 6075(a).

§ 26.2642-6
Qualified severance.
(a)
In general.
If a trust is divided in a qualified severance into two or more trusts, the separate trusts resulting from the severance will be treated as separate trusts for generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax purposes and the inclusion ratio of each new resulting trust may differ from the inclusion ratio of the original trust. Because the post-severance resulting trusts are treated as separate trusts for GST tax purposes, certain actions with respect to one resulting trust will generally have no GST tax impact with respect to the other resulting trust(s). For example, GST exemption allocated to one resulting trust will not impact on the inclusion ratio of the other resulting trust(s); a GST tax election made with respect to one resulting trust will not apply to the other resulting trust(s); the occurrence of a taxable distribution or termination with regard to a particular resulting trust will not have any GST tax impact on any other trust resulting from that severance. In general, the rules in this section are applicable only for purposes of the GST tax and are not applicable in determining, for example, whether the resulting trusts may file separate income tax returns or whether the severance may result in a gift subject to gift tax, may cause any trust to be included in the gross estate of a beneficiary, or may result in a realization of gain for purposes of section 1001. See § 1.1001-1(h) of this chapter for rules relating to whether a qualified severance will constitute an exchange of property for other property differing materially either in kind or in extent.
(b)
Qualified severance defined.
A qualified severance is a division of a trust (other than a division described in § 26.2654-1(b)) into two or more separate trusts that meets each of the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section.
(c)
Effective date of qualified severance.
A qualified severance is applicable as of the date of the severance, as defined in § 26.2642-6(d)(3), and the resulting trusts are treated as separate trusts for GST tax purposes as of that date.
(d)
Requirements for a qualified severance.
For purposes of this section, a qualified severance must satisfy each of the following requirements:
(1) The single trust is severed pursuant to the terms of the governing instrument, or pursuant to applicable local law.
(2) The severance is effective under local law.
(3) The date of severance is either the date selected by the trustee as of which the trust assets are to be valued in order to determine the funding of the resulting trusts, or the court-imposed date of funding in the case of an order of the local court with jurisdiction over the trust ordering the trustee to fund the resulting trusts on or as of a specific date. For a date to satisfy the definition in the preceding sentence, however, the funding must be commenced immediately upon, and funding must occur within a reasonable time (but in no event more than 90 days) after, the selected valuation date.
(4) The single trust (original trust) is severed on a fractional basis, such that each new trust (resulting trust) is
funded with a fraction or percentage of the original trust, and the sum of those fractions or percentages is one or one hundred percent, respectively. For this purpose, the fraction or percentage may be determined by means of a formula (for example, that fraction of the trust the numerator of which is equal to the transferor's unused GST tax exemption, and the denominator of which is the fair market value of the original trust's assets on the date of severance). The severance of a trust based on a pecuniary amount does not satisfy this requirement. For example, the severance of a trust is not a qualified severance if the trust is divided into two trusts, with one trust to be funded with $1,500,000 and the other trust to be funded with the balance of the original trust's assets. With respect to the particular assets to be distributed to each separate trust resulting from the severance, each such trust may be funded with the appropriate fraction or percentage (pro rata portion) of each asset held by the original trust. Alternatively, the assets may be divided among the resulting trusts on a non-pro rata basis, based on the fair market value of the assets on the date of severance. However, if a resulting trust is funded on a non-pro rata basis, each asset received by a resulting trust must be valued, solely for funding purposes, by multiplying the fair market value of the asset held in the original trust as of the date of severance by the fraction or percentage of that asset received by that resulting trust. Thus, the assets must be valued without taking into account any discount or premium arising from the severance, for example, any valuation discounts that might arise because the resulting trust receives less than the entire interest held by the original trust. See paragraph (j),
Example 6
of this section.
(5) The terms of the resulting trusts must provide, in the aggregate, for the same succession of interests of beneficiaries as are provided in the original trust. This requirement is satisfied if the beneficiaries of the separate resulting trusts and the interests of the beneficiaries with respect to the separate trusts, when the separate trusts are viewed collectively, are the same as the beneficiaries and their respective beneficial interests with respect to the original trust before severance. With respect to trusts from which discretionary distributions may be made to any one or more beneficiaries on a non-pro rata basis, this requirement is satisfied if—
(i) The terms of each of the resulting trusts are the same as the terms of the original trust (even though each permissible distributee of the original trust is not a beneficiary of all of the resulting trusts);
(ii) Each beneficiary's interest in the resulting trusts (collectively) equals the beneficiary's interest in the original trust, determined by the terms of the trust instrument or, if none, on a per-capita basis. For example, in the case of the severance of a discretionary trust established for the benefit of A, B, and C and their descendants with the remainder to be divided equally among those three families, this requirement is satisfied if the trust is divided into three separate trusts of equal value with one trust established for the benefit of A and A's descendants, one trust for the benefit of B and B's descendants, and one trust for the benefit of C and C's descendants;
(iii) The severance does not shift a beneficial interest in the trust to any beneficiary in a lower generation (as determined under section 2651) than the person or persons who held the beneficial interest in the original trust; and
(iv) The severance does not extend the time for the vesting of any beneficial interest in the trust beyond the period provided for in (or applicable to) the original trust.
(6) In the case of a qualified severance of a trust with an inclusion ratio as defined in § 26.2642-1 of either one or zero, each trust resulting from the severance will have an inclusion ratio equal to the inclusion ratio of the original trust.
(7)(i) In the case of a qualified severance occurring after GST tax exemption has been allocated to the trust (whether by an affirmative allocation, a deemed allocation, or an automatic allocation pursuant to the rules contained in section 2632), if the trust has an inclusion ratio as defined in § 26.2642-1 that is greater than zero and
less than one, then either paragraph (d)(7)(ii) or (iii) of this section must be satisfied.
(ii) The trust is severed initially into only two resulting trusts. One resulting trust must receive that fractional share of the total value of the original trust as of the date of severance that is equal to the applicable fraction, as defined in § 26.2642-1(b) and (c), used to determine the inclusion ratio of the original trust immediately before the severance. The other resulting trust must receive that fractional share of the total value of the original trust as of the date of severance that is equal to the excess of one over the fractional share described in the preceding sentence. The trust receiving the fractional share equal to the applicable fraction shall have an inclusion ratio of zero, and the other trust shall have an inclusion ratio of one. If the applicable fraction with respect to the original trust is .50, then, with respect to the two equal trusts resulting from the severance, the trustee may designate which of the resulting trusts will have an inclusion ratio of zero and which will have an inclusion ratio of one. Each separate trust resulting from the severance then may be further divided in accordance with the rules of this section. See paragraph (j),
Example 7
, of this section.
(iii) The trust is severed initially into more than two resulting trusts. One or more of the resulting trusts in the aggregate must receive that fractional share of the total value of the original trust as of the date of severance that is equal to the applicable fraction used to determine the inclusion ratio of the original trust immediately before the severance. The trust or trusts receiving such fractional share shall have an inclusion ratio of zero, and each of the other resulting trust or trusts shall have an inclusion ratio of one. (If, however, two or more of the resulting trusts each receives the fractional share of the total value of the original trust equal to the applicable fraction, the trustee may designate which of those resulting trusts will have an inclusion ratio of zero and which will have an inclusion ratio of one.) The resulting trust or trusts with an inclusion ratio of one must receive in the aggregate that fractional share of the total value of the original trust as of the date of severance that is equal to the excess of one over the fractional share described in the second sentence of this paragraph. See paragraph (j),
Example 9
, of this section.
(e)
Reporting a qualified severance
—(1)
In general.
A qualified severance is reported by filing Form 706-GS(T), “Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Return for Terminations,” (or such other form as may be provided from time to time by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the purpose of reporting a qualified severance). Unless otherwise provided in the applicable form or instructions, the IRS requests that the filer write “Qualified Severance” at the top of the form and attach a Notice of Qualified Severance (Notice). The return and attached Notice should be filed by April 15th of the year immediately following the year during which the severance occurred or by the last day of the period covered by an extension of time, if an extension of time is granted, to file such form.
(2)
Information concerning the original trust.
The Notice should provide, with respect to the original trust that was severed—
(i) The name of the transferor;
(ii) The name and date of creation of the original trust;
(iii) The tax identification number of the original trust; and
(iv) The inclusion ratio before the severance.
(3)
Information concerning each new trust.
The Notice should provide, with respect to each of the resulting trusts created by the severance—
(i) The name and tax identification number of the trust;
(ii) The date of severance (within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section);
(iii) The fraction of the total assets of the original trust received by the resulting trust;
(iv) Other details explaining the basis for the funding of the resulting trust (a fraction of the total fair market value of the assets on the date of severance, or a fraction of each asset); and
(v) The inclusion ratio.
(f)
Time for making a qualified severance.
(1) A qualified severance of a
trust may occur at any time prior to the termination of the trust. Thus, provided that the separate resulting trusts continue in existence after the severance, a qualified severance may occur either before or after—
(i) GST tax exemption has been allocated to the trust;
(ii) A taxable event has occurred with respect to the trust; or
(iii) An addition has been made to the trust.
(2) Because a qualified severance is effective as of the date of severance, a qualified severance has no effect on a taxable termination as defined in section 2612(a) or a taxable distribution as defined in section 2612(b) that occurred prior to the date of severance. A qualified severance shall be deemed to occur before a taxable termination or a taxable distribution that occurs by reason of the qualified severance. See paragraph (j)
Example 8
of this section.
(g)
Trusts that were irrevocable on September 25, 1985
—(1)
In general.
See § 26.2601-1(b)(4) for rules regarding severances and other actions with respect to trusts that were irrevocable on September 25, 1985.
(2)
Trusts in receipt of a post-September 25, 1985, addition.
A trust described in § 26.2601-1(b)(1)(iv)(A) that is deemed for GST tax purposes to consist of one separate share not subject to GST tax (the non-chapter 13 portion) with an inclusion ratio of zero, and one separate share subject to GST tax (the chapter 13 portion) with an inclusion ratio determined under section 2642, may be severed into two trusts in accordance with § 26.2654-1(a)(3). One resulting trust will hold the non-chapter 13 portion of the original trust (the non-chapter 13 trust) and will not be subject to GST tax, and the other resulting trust will hold the chapter 13 portion of the original trust (the chapter 13 trust) and will have the same inclusion ratio as the chapter 13 portion immediately prior to the severance. The chapter 13 trust may be further divided in a qualified severance in accordance with the rules of this section. The non-chapter 13 trust may be further divided in accordance with the rules of § 26.2601-1(b)(4).
(h)
Treatment of trusts resulting from a severance that is not a qualified severance.
Trusts resulting from a severance (other than a severance recognized for GST tax purposes under § 26.2654-1) that does not meet the requirements of a qualified severance under paragraph (b) of this section will be treated, after the date of severance, as separate trusts for purposes of the GST tax, provided that the trusts resulting from such severance are recognized as separate trusts under applicable state law. The post-severance treatment of the resulting trusts as separate trusts for GST tax purposes generally permits the allocation of GST tax exemption, the making of various elections permitted for GST tax purposes, and the occurrence of a taxable distribution or termination with regard to a particular resulting trust, with no GST tax impact on any other trust resulting from that severance. Each trust resulting from a severance described in this paragraph (h), however, will have the same inclusion ratio immediately after the severance as that of the original trust immediately before the severance. (See § 26.2654-1 for the inclusion ratio of each trust resulting from a severance described in that section.) Further, any trust resulting from a nonqualified severance may be severed subsequently, pursuant to a qualified severance described in this § 26.2642-6.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Examples.
The rules of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1. Succession of interests,
T dies in 2006. T's will establishes a testamentary trust (Trust) providing that income is to be paid to T's sister, S, for her life. On S's death, one-half of the corpus is to be paid to T's child, C (or to C's estate if C fails to survive S), and one-half of the corpus is to be paid to T's grandchild, GC (or to GC's estate if GC fails to survive S). On the Form 706, “United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return,” filed for T's estate, T's executor allocates all of T's available GST tax exemption to other transfers and trusts, such that Trust's inclusion ratio is 1. Subsequent to filing the Form 706 in 2007 and in accordance with applicable state law, the trustee divides Trust into two separate trusts, Trust 1 and Trust 2, with each trust receiving 50 percent of the value of the assets of the original trust as of the date of severance. Trust 1 provides that trust income is to be paid to S for life with remainder to C or
C's estate, and Trust 2 provides that trust income is to be paid to S for life with remainder to GC or GC's estate. Because Trust 1 and Trust 2 provide for the same succession of interests in the aggregate as provided in the original trust, the severance constitutes a qualified severance, provided that all other requirements of section 2642(a)(3) and this section are satisfied.

# Example 2. Succession of interests in discretionary trust,
In 2006, T establishes Trust, an irrevocable trust providing that income may be paid from time to time in such amounts as the trustee deems advisable to any one or more members of the group consisting of T's children (A and B) and their respective descendants. In addition, the trustee may distribute corpus to any trust beneficiary in such amounts as the trustee deems advisable. On the death of the last to die of A and B, the trust is to terminate and the corpus is to be distributed in two equal shares, one share to the then-living descendants of each child, per stirpes. T elects, under section 2632(c)(5), to not have the automatic allocation rules contained in section 2632(c) apply with respect to T's transfers to Trust, and T does not otherwise allocate GST tax exemption with respect to Trust. As a result, Trust has an inclusion ratio of one. In 2008, the trustee of Trust, pursuant to applicable state law, divides Trust into two equal but separate trusts, Trust 1 and Trust 2, each of which has terms identical to the terms of Trust except for the identity of the beneficiaries. Trust 1 and Trust 2 each has an inclusion ratio of one. Trust 1 provides that income is to be paid in such amounts as the trustee deems advisable to A and A's descendants. In addition, the trustee may distribute corpus to any trust beneficiary in such amounts as the trustee deems advisable. On the death of A, Trust 1 is to terminate and the corpus is to be distributed to the then-living descendants of A, per stirpes, but, if A dies with no living descendants, the principal will be added to Trust 2. Trust 2 contains identical provisions, except that B and B's descendants are the trust beneficiaries and, if B dies with no living descendants, the principal will be added to Trust 1. Trust 1 and Trust 2 in the aggregate provide for the same beneficiaries and the same succession of interests as provided in Trust, and the severance does not shift any beneficial interest to a beneficiary who occupies a lower generation than the person or persons who held the beneficial interest in Trust. Accordingly, the severance constitutes a qualified severance, provided that all other requirements of section 2642(a)(3) and this section are satisfied.

# Example 3. Severance based on actuarial value of beneficial interests,
In 2004, T establishes Trust, an irrevocable trust providing that income is to be paid to T's child C during C's lifetime. Upon C's death, Trust is to terminate and the assets of Trust are to be paid to GC, C's child, if living, or, if GC is not then living, to GC's estate. T properly elects, under section 2632(c)(5), not to have the automatic allocation rules contained in section 2632(c) apply with respect to T's transfers to Trust, and T does not otherwise allocate GST tax exemption with respect to Trust. Thus, Trust has an inclusion ratio of one. In 2009, the trustee of Trust, pursuant to applicable state law, divides Trust into two separate trusts, Trust 1 for the benefit of C (and on C's death to C's estate), and Trust 2 for the benefit of GC (and on GC's death to GC's estate). The document severing Trust directs that Trust 1 is to be funded with an amount equal to the actuarial value of C's interest in Trust prior to the severance, determined under section 7520 of the Internal Revenue Code. Similarly, Trust 2 is to be funded with an amount equal to the actuarial value of GC's interest in Trust prior to the severance, determined under section 7520. Trust 1 and Trust 2 do not provide for the same succession of interests as provided under the terms of the original trust. Therefore, the severance is not a qualified severance. Furthermore, because the severance results in no non-skip person having an interest in Trust 2, Trust 2 constitutes a skip person under section 2613 and, therefore, the severance results in a taxable termination subject to GST tax.

# Example 4. Severance of a trust with a 50% inclusion ratio,
On September 1, 2006, T transfers $100,000 to a trust for the benefit of T's grandchild, GC. On a timely filed Form 709, “United States Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return,” reporting the transfer, T allocates all of T's remaining GST tax exemption ($50,000) to the trust. As a result of the allocation, the applicable fraction with respect to the trust is .50 [$50,000 (the amount of GST tax exemption allocated to the trust) divided by $100,000 (the value of the property transferred to the trust)]. The inclusion ratio with respect to the trust is .50 [1−.50]. In 2007, pursuant to authority granted under applicable state law, the trustee severs the trust into two trusts, Trust 1 and Trust 2, each of which is identical to the original trust and each of which receives a 50 percent fractional share of the total value of the original trust, valued as of the date of severance. Because the applicable fraction with respect to the original trust is .50 and the trust is severed into two equal trusts, the trustee may designate which resulting trust has an inclusion ratio of one, and which resulting trust has an inclusion ratio of zero. Accordingly, in the Notice of Qualified Severance reporting the severance, the trustee designates Trust 1 as having an inclusion ratio of zero, and Trust 2 as having an inclusion ratio of one. The severance constitutes a qualified severance,
provided that all other requirements of section 2642(a)(3) and this section are satisfied.

# Example 5. Funding of severed trusts on a non-pro rata basis,
T's will establishes a testamentary trust (Trust) for the benefit of T's descendants, to be funded with T's stock in Corporation A and Corporation B, both publicly traded stocks. T dies on May 1, 2004, at which time the Corporation A stock included in T's gross estate has a fair market value of $100,000 and the stock of Corporation B included in T's gross estate has a fair market value of $200,000. On a timely filed Form 706, T's executor allocates all of T's remaining GST tax exemption ($270,000) to Trust. As a result of the allocation, the applicable fraction with respect to Trust is .90 [$270,000 (the amount of GST tax exemption allocated to the trust) divided by $300,000 (the value of the property transferred to the trust)]. The inclusion ratio with respect to Trust is .10 [1−.90]. On August 1, 2008, in accordance with applicable local law, the trustee executes a document severing Trust into two trusts, Trust 1 and Trust 2, each of which is identical to Trust. The instrument designates August 3, 2008, as the date of severance (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section). The terms of the instrument severing Trust provide that Trust 1 is to be funded on a non-pro rata basis with assets having a fair market value on the date of severance equal to 90% of the value of Trust's assets on that date, and Trust 2 is to be funded with assets having a fair market value on the date of severance equal to 10% of the value of Trust's assets on that date. On August 3, 2008, the value of the Trust assets totals $500,000, consisting of Corporation A stock worth $450,000 and Corporation B stock worth $50,000. On August 4, 2008, the trustee takes all action necessary to transfer all of the Corporation A stock to Trust 1 and to transfer all of the Corporation B stock to Trust 2. On August 6, 2008, the stock transfers are completed and the stock is received by the appropriate resulting trust. Accordingly, Trust 1 is funded with assets having a value equal to 90% of the value of Trust as of the date of severance, August 3, 2008, and Trust 2 is funded with assets having a value equal to 10% of the value of Trust as of the date of severance. Therefore, the severance constitutes a qualified severance, provided that all other requirements of section 2642(a)(3) and this section are satisfied. Trust 1 will have an inclusion ratio of zero and Trust 2 will have an inclusion ratio of one.

# Example 6. Funding of severed trusts on a non-pro rata basis,
(i) T's will establishes an irrevocable trust (Trust) for the benefit of T's descendants. As a result of the allocation of GST tax exemption, the applicable fraction with respect to Trust is .60 and Trust's inclusion ratio is .40 [1-.60]. Pursuant to authority granted under applicable state law, on August 1, 2008, the trustee executes a document severing Trust into two trusts, Trust 1 and Trust 2, each of which is identical to Trust. The instrument of severance provides that the severance is intended to qualify as a qualified severance within the meaning of section 2642(a)(3) and designates August 3, 2008, as the date of severance (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section). The instrument further provides that Trust 1 and Trust 2 are to be funded on a non-pro rata basis with Trust 1 funded with assets having a fair market value on the date of severance equal to 40% of the value of Trust's assets on that date and Trust 2 funded with assets having a fair market value equal to 60% of the value of Trust's assets on that date. The fair market value of the assets used to fund each trust is to be determined in compliance with the requirements of paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(ii) On August 3, 2008, the fair market value of the Trust assets totals $4,000,000, consisting of 52% of the outstanding common stock in Company, a closely-held corporation, valued at $3,000,000 and $1,000,000 in cash and marketable securities. Trustee proposes to divide the Company stock equally between Trust 1 and Trust 2, and thus transfer 26% of the Company stock to Trust 1 and 26% of the stock to Trust 2. In addition, the appropriate amount of cash and marketable securities will be distributed to each trust. In accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of this section, for funding purposes, the interest in the Company stock distributed to each trust is valued as a pro rata portion of the value of the 52% interest in Company held by Trust before severance, without taking into account, for example, any valuation discount that might otherwise apply in valuing the noncontrolling interest distributed to each resulting trust.
(iii) Accordingly, for funding purposes, each 26% interest in Company stock distributed to Trust 1 and Trust 2 is valued at $1,500,000 (.5 × $3,000,000). Therefore, Trust 1, which is to be funded with $1,600,000 (.40 × $4,000,000), receives $100,000 in cash and marketable securities valued as of August 3, 2008, in addition to the Company stock, and Trust 2, which is to be funded with $2,400,000 (.60 × $4,000,000), receives $900,000 in cash and marketable securities in addition to the Company stock. Therefore, the severance is a qualified severance, provided that all other requirements of section 2642(a)(3) and this section are satisfied.

# Example 7. Statutory qualified severance,
T dies on October 1, 2004. T's will establishes a testamentary trust (Trust) to be funded with $1,000,000. Trust income is to be paid to T's child, S, for S's life. The trustee may also distribute trust corpus from time to time, in equal or unequal shares, for the benefit of any one or more members of the group consisting of S and T's three grandchildren (GC1, GC2, and GC3). On S's death, Trust is
to terminate and the assets are to be divided equally among GC1, GC2, and GC3 (or their respective then-living descendants, per stirpes). On a timely filed Form 706, T's executor allocates all of T's remaining GST tax exemption ($300,000) to Trust. As a result of the allocation, the applicable fraction with respect to the trust is .30 [$300,000 (the amount of GST tax exemption allocated to the trust) divided by $1,000,000 (the value of the property transferred to the trust)]. The inclusion ratio with respect to the trust is .70 [1−.30]. On June 1, 2007, the trustee determines that it is in the best interest of the beneficiaries to sever Trust to provide a separate trust for each of T's three grandchildren and their respective families. The trustee severs Trust into two trusts, Trust 1 and Trust 2, each with terms and beneficiaries identical to Trust and thus each providing that trust income is to be paid to S for life, trust principal may be distributed for the benefit of any or all members of the group consisting of S and T's grandchildren, and, on S's death, the trust is to terminate and the assets are to be divided equally among GC1, GC2, and GC3 (or their respective then-living descendants, per stirpes). The instrument severing Trust provides that Trust 1 is to receive 30% of Trust's assets and Trust 2 is to receive 70% of Trust's assets. Further, each such trust is to be funded with a pro rata portion of each asset held in Trust. The trustee then severs Trust 1 into three equal trusts, Trust GC1, Trust GC2, and Trust GC3. Each trust is named for a grandchild of T and provides that trust income is to be paid to S for life, trust principal may be distributed for the benefit of S and T's grandchild for whom the trust is named, and, on S's death, the trust is to terminate and the trust proceeds distributed to the respective grandchild for whom the trust is named. If that grandchild has predeceased the termination date, the trust proceeds are to be distributed to that grandchild's then-living descendants, per stirpes, or, if none, then equally to the other two trusts resulting from the severance of Trust 1. Each such resulting trust is to be funded with a pro rata portion of each Trust 1 asset. The trustee also severs Trust 2 in a similar manner, into Trust GC1(2), Trust GC2(2), and Trust GC3(2). The severance of Trust into Trust 1 and Trust 2, the severance of Trust 1 into Trust GC1, Trust GC2, Trust GC3, and the severance of Trust 2 into Trust GC1(2), Trust GC2(2) and Trust GC3(2), constitute qualified severances, provided that all other requirements of section 2642(a)(3) and this section are satisfied with respect to each severance. Trust GC1, Trust GC2, Trust GC3 will each have an inclusion ratio of zero and Trust GC1(2), Trust GC2(2), and Trust GC3(2) will each have an inclusion ratio of one.

# Example 8. Qualified severance deemed to precede a taxable termination,
In 2004, T establishes an inter vivos irrevocable trust (Trust) for a term of 10 years providing that Trust income is to be paid annually in equal shares to T's child C and T's grandchild GC (the child of another then-living child of T). If either C or GC dies prior to the expiration of the 10-year term, the deceased beneficiary's share of Trust's income is to be paid to that beneficiary's then-living descendants, per stirpes, for the balance of the trust term. At the expiration of the 10-year trust term, the corpus is to be distributed equally to C and GC; if either C or GC is not then living, then such decedent's share is to be distributed instead to such decedent's then-living descendants, per stirpes. T allocates T's GST tax exemption to Trust such that Trust's applicable fraction is .50 and Trust's inclusion ratio is .50 [1−.50]. In 2006, pursuant to applicable state law, the trustee severs the trust into two equal trusts, Trust 1 and Trust 2. The instrument severing Trust provides that Trust 1 is to receive 50% of the Trust assets, and Trust 2 is to receive 50% of Trust's assets. Both resulting trusts are identical to Trust, except that each has different beneficiaries: C and C's descendants are designated as the beneficiaries of Trust 1, and GC and GC's descendants are designated as the beneficiaries of Trust 2. The severance constitutes a qualified severance, provided all other requirements of section 2642(a)(3) and this section are satisfied. Because the applicable fraction with respect to Trust is .50 and Trust was severed into two equal trusts, the trustee may designate which resulting trust has an inclusion ratio of one, and which has an inclusion ratio of zero. Accordingly, in the Notice of Qualified Severance reporting the severance, the trustee designates Trust 1 as having an inclusion ratio of one, and Trust 2 as having an inclusion ratio of zero. Because Trust 2 is a skip person under section 2613, the severance of Trust resulting in the distribution of 50% of Trust's corpus to Trust 2 would constitute a taxable termination or distribution (as described in section 2612(a)) of that 50% of Trust for GST tax purposes, but for the rule that a qualified severance is deemed to precede a taxable termination that is caused by the qualified severance. Thus, no GST tax will be due with regard to the creation and funding of Trust 2 because the inclusion ratio of Trust 2 is zero.

# Example 9. Regulatory qualified severance,
(i) In 2004, T establishes an inter vivos irrevocable trust (Trust) providing that trust income is to be paid annually in equal shares to T's children, A and B, for 10 years. Trust provides that the trustee has discretion to make additional distributions of principal to A and B during the 10-year term without adjustments to their shares of income or the trust remainder. If either (or both) dies prior to the expiration of the 10-year term, the deceased child's share of trust income is to be paid to the child's then living descendants,
per stirpes, for the balance of the trust term. At the expiration of the 10-year term, the corpus is to be distributed equally to A and B; if A and B (or either or them) is not then living, then such decedent's share is to be distributed instead to such decedent's then living descendants, per stirpes. T allocates GST tax exemption to Trust such that Trust's applicable fraction is .25 and its inclusion ratio is .75.
(ii) In 2006, pursuant to applicable state law, the trustee severs the trust into three trusts: Trust 1, Trust 2, and Trust 3. The instrument severing Trust provides that Trust 1 is to receive 50% of Trust's assets, Trust 2 is to receive 25% of Trust's assets, and Trust 3 is to receive 25% of Trust's assets. All three resulting trusts are identical to Trust, except that each has different beneficiaries: A and A's issue are designated as the beneficiaries of Trust 1, and B and B's issue are designated as the beneficiaries of Trust 2 and Trust 3. The severance constitutes a qualified severance, provided that all other requirements of section 2642(a)(3) and this section are satisfied. Trust 1 will have an inclusion ratio of 1. Because both Trust 2 and Trust 3 have each received the fractional share of Trust's assets equal to Trust's applicable fraction of .25, trustee designates that Trust 2 will have an inclusion ratio of one and that Trust 3 will have an inclusion ratio of zero.

# Example 10. Beneficiary's interest dependent on inclusion ratio,
On August 8, 2006, T transfers $1,000,000 to Trust and timely allocates $400,000 of T's remaining GST tax exemption to Trust. As a result of the allocation, the applicable fraction with respect to Trust is .40 [$400,000 divided by $1,000,000] and Trust's inclusion ratio is .60 [1−.40]. Trust provides that all income of Trust will be paid annually to C, T's child, for life. On C's death, the corpus is to pass in accordance with C's exercise of a testamentary limited power to appoint the corpus of Trust to C's lineal descendants. However, Trust provides that if, at the time of C's death, Trust's inclusion ratio is greater than zero, then C may also appoint that fraction of the trust corpus equal to the inclusion ratio to the creditors of C's estate. On May 3, 2008, pursuant to authority granted under applicable state law, the trustee severs Trust into two trusts. Trust 1 is funded with 40% of Trust's assets, and Trust 2 is funded with 60% of Trust's assets in accordance with the requirements of this section. Both Trust 1 and Trust 2 provide that all income of Trust will be paid annually to C during C's life. On C's death, Trust 1 corpus is to pass in accordance with C's exercise of a testamentary limited power to appoint the corpus to C's lineal descendants. Trust 2 is to pass in accordance with C's exercise of a testamentary power to appoint the corpus of Trust to C's lineal descendants and to the creditors of C's estate. The severance constitutes a qualified severance, provided that all other requirements of section 2642(a)(3) and this section are satisfied. No additional contribution or allocation of GST tax exemption is made to either Trust 1 or Trust 2 prior to C's death. Accordingly, the inclusion ratio with respect to Trust 1 is zero. The inclusion ratio with respect to Trust 2 is one until C's death, at which time C will become the transferor of Trust 2 for GST tax purposes. (Some or all of C's GST tax exemption may be allocated to Trust 2 upon C's death.)

# Example 11. Date of severance,
Trust is an irrevocable trust that has both skip person and non-skip person beneficiaries. Trust holds two parcels of real estate, Property A and Property B, stock in Company X, a publicly traded company, and cash. On June 16, 2008, the local court with jurisdiction over Trust issues an order, pursuant to the trustee's petition authorized under state law, severing Trust into two resulting trusts of equal value, Trust 1 and Trust 2. The court order directs that Property A will be distributed to Trust 1 and Property B will be distributed to Trust 2, and that an appropriate amount of stock and cash will be distributed to each trust such that the total value of property distributed to each trust as of the date of severance will be equal. The court order does not mandate a particular date of funding. Trustee receives notice of the court order on June 24, and selects July 16, 2008, as the date of severance. On June 26, 2008, Trustee commences the process of transferring title to Property A and Property B to the appropriate resulting trust(s), which process is completed on July 8, 2008. Also on June 26, the Trustee hires a professional appraiser to value Property A and Property B as of the date of severance and receives the appraisal report on Friday, October 3, 2008. On Monday, October 6, 2008, Trustee commences the process of transferring to Trust 1 and Trust 2 the appropriate amount of Company X stock valued as of July 16, 2008, and that transfer (as well as the transfer of Trust's cash) is completed by October 9, 2008. Under the facts presented, the funding of Trust 1 and Trust 2 occurred within 90 days of the date of severance selected by the trustee, and within a reasonable time after the date of severance taking into account the nature of the assets involved and the need to obtain an appraisal. Accordingly, the date of severance for purposes of this section is July 16, 2008, the resulting trusts are to be funded based on the value of the original trust assets as of that date, and the severance is a qualified severance assuming that all other requirements of section 2642(a)(3) and this section are met. (However, if Trust had contained only marketable securities and cash, then in order to satisfy the reasonable time requirement, the stock transfer would have
to have been commenced, and generally completed, immediately after the date of severance, and the cash distribution would have to have been made at the same time.)

# Example 12. Other severance that does not meet the requirements of a qualified severance,
(i) In 2004, T establishes an irrevocable inter vivos trust (Trust) providing that Trust income is to be paid to T's children, A and B, in equal shares for their joint lives. Upon the death of the first to die of A and B, all Trust income will be paid to the survivor of A and B. At the death of the survivor, the corpus is to be distributed in equal shares to T's grandchildren, W and X (with any then-deceased grandchild's share being paid in accordance with that grandchild's testamentary general power of appointment). W is A's child and X is B's child. T elects under section 2632(c)(5) not to have the automatic allocation rules contained in section 2632(c) apply with respect to T's transfers to Trust, but T allocates GST tax exemption to Trust resulting in Trust having an inclusion ratio of .30.
(ii) In 2009, the trustee of Trust, as permitted by applicable state law, divides Trust into two separate trusts, Trust 1 and Trust 2. Trust 1 provides that trust income is to be paid to A for life and, on A's death, the remainder is to be distributed to W (or pursuant to W's testamentary general power of appointment). Trust 2 provides that trust income is to be paid to B for life and, on B's death, the remainder is to be distributed to X (or pursuant to X's testamentary general power of appointment). Because Trust 1 and Trust 2 do not provide A and B with the contingent survivor income interests that were provided to A and B under the terms of Trust, Trust 1 and Trust 2 do not provide for the same succession of interests in the aggregate as provided by Trust. Therefore, the severance does not satisfy the requirements of this section and is not a qualified severance. Provided that Trust 1 and Trust 2 are recognized as separate trusts under applicable state law, Trust 1 and Trust 2 will be recognized as separate trusts for GST tax purposes pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section, prospectively from the date of the severance. However, Trust 1 and Trust 2 each have an inclusion ratio of .30 immediately after the severance, the same as the inclusion ratio of Trust prior to severance.

# Example 13. Qualified severance following a non-qualified severance,
Assume the same facts as in
Example 12
, except that, as of November 4, 2010, the trustee of Trust 1 severs Trust 1 into two trusts, Trust 3 and Trust 4, in accordance with applicable local law. The instrument severing Trust 1 provides that both resulting trusts have provisions identical to Trust 1. The terms of the instrument severing Trust 1 further provide that Trust 3 is to be funded on a pro rata basis with assets having a fair market value as of the date of severance equal to 70% of the value of Trust 1's assets on that date, and Trust 4 is to be funded with assets having a fair market value as of the date of severance equal to 30% of the value of Trust 1's assets on that date. The severance constitutes a qualified severance, provided that all other requirements of section 2642(a)(3) and this section are satisfied. Trust 3 will have an inclusion ratio of zero and Trust 4 will have an inclusion ratio of one.

Effective/applicability date
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (k), this section applies to severances occurring on or after August 2, 2007. Paragraph (d)(7)(iii), paragraph (h), and
Examples 9, 12
and
13
of paragraph (j) of this section apply to severances occurring on or after September 2, 2008.
(2)
Transition rule.
In the case of a qualified severance occurring after December 31, 2000, and before August 2, 2007, taxpayers may rely on any reasonable interpretation of section 2642(a)(3) as long as reasonable notice concerning the qualified severance and identification of the trusts involved has been given to the IRS. For this purpose, the proposed regulations (69 FR 51967) are treated as a reasonable interpretation of the statute. For purposes of the reporting provisions of § 26.2642-6(e), notice to the IRS should be mailed by the due date of the gift tax return (including extensions granted) for gifts made during the year in which the severance occurred. If no gift tax return is filed, notice to the IRS should be mailed by April 15th of the year immediately following the year during which the severance occurred. For severances occurring between December 31, 2000, and January 1, 2007, notification should be mailed to the IRS as soon as reasonably practicable after August 2, 2007, if sufficient notice has not already been given.
[T.D. 9348, 72 FR 42294, Aug. 2, 2007, as amended by T.D. 9421, 73 FR 44650, July 31, 2008]
§ 26.2642-7
Relief under section 2642(g)(1).
(a)
In general.
Under section 2642(g)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), the Secretary of the Treasury or her delegate (Secretary) has the authority to issue regulations describing the circumstances in which a transferor, as defined in section
2652(a) of the Code, or the executor of a transferor's estate, as defined in section 2203 of the Code, will be granted an extension of time to allocate generation-skipping transfer (GST) exemption as described in section 2642(b)(1) and (2). The Secretary also has the authority to issue regulations describing the circumstances under which a transferor or the executor of a transferor's estate will be granted an extension of time to make the elections described in section 2632(b)(3) and (c)(5) of the Code. Section 2632(b)(3) provides that an election may be made by or on behalf of a transferor not to have the transferor's GST exemption automatically allocated under section 2632(b)(1) to a direct skip, as defined in section 2612(c), made by the transferor during life. Section 2632(c)(5)(A)(i) provides that an election may be made by or on behalf of a transferor not to have the transferor's GST exemption automatically allocated under section 2632(c)(1) to an indirect skip, as defined in section 2632(c)(3)(A), or to any or all transfers made by such transferor to a particular trust. Section 2632(c)(5)(A)(ii) provides that an election may be made by or on behalf of a transferor to treat any trust as a GST trust, as defined in section 2632(c)(3)(B), for purposes of section 2632(c) with respect to any or all transfers made by that transferor to the trust. This section generally describes the factors that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will consider when an extension of time is sought by or on behalf of a transferor to timely allocate GST exemption or to make an election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5). If the time period for an automatic six-month extension under paragraph (i)(1) of this section has passed, relief provided under this section can be requested through the IRS private letter ruling program. See paragraph (i) of this section.
(b)
Effect of relief
—(1)
In general.
If an extension of time to allocate GST exemption is granted under this section, the allocation of GST exemption, once made, will be considered effective as of the date of the transfer. Further, the amount of the transferor's GST exemption required to be allocated in order to produce a zero inclusion ratio solely with regard to that transfer will be the value of the property transferred for purposes of chapter 11 or chapter 12 of the Code as of the date of the transfer. If an extension of time to elect out of the automatic allocation of GST exemption under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5)(A)(i) is granted under this section, the election, once made, will be considered effective as of the date of and immediately prior to the transfer. If an extension of time to elect to treat any trust as a GST trust under section 2632(c)(5)(A)(ii) is granted under this section, the election, once made, will be considered effective as of the date of and immediately prior to the first (or each) transfer covered by that election. See paragraph (h) of this section with regard to preserving a taxpayer's eligibility for a refund generated by a grant of relief, if applicable.
(2) [Reserved]
(3)
Effect on other transfers.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, an allocation of exemption or an election made pursuant to a grant of relief under this section does not reduce or eliminate any affirmative allocation or void any election made with respect to any other transfer occurring contemporaneously with or subsequent to the transfer or transfers for which relief has been granted.
(c)
Limitation on relief.
The amount of GST exemption that may be allocated to a transfer as the result of relief granted under this section in no event may exceed the amount of the transferor's unused GST exemption under section 2631(c) of the Code as of the date of the transfer. Thus, if, by the time of the making of the allocation or election pursuant to relief granted under this section, the GST exemption amount under section 2631(c) has increased to an amount in excess of the amount in effect for the date of the transfer, no portion of the increased amount may be applied to that earlier transfer by reason of the relief granted under this section.
(d)
Basis for determination
—(1)
In general.
Requests for relief under this section will be granted when and to the extent that the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate provides evidence (including the affidavits described in paragraph (i) of this section)
establishing to the satisfaction of the IRS that the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate acted reasonably and in good faith, and that the grant of relief will not prejudice the interests of the government. Paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section set forth nonexclusive lists of factors the IRS will consider in determining whether this standard of reasonableness, good faith, and lack of prejudice to the interests of the government has been met so that such relief will be granted. In making this determination, the IRS will consider those factors set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, as well as all other facts and circumstances not specifically set forth herein that are relevant to the particular situation. Paragraph (e) of this section sets forth some situations in which this standard is not met and, as a result, in which relief under this section will not be granted.
(2)
Reasonableness and good faith.
The following is a nonexclusive list of factors that will be considered in determining whether the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate acted reasonably and in good faith for purposes of this section. Not all of these factors may be relevant in a particular situation (and those that are not relevant are not required to be addressed in the request for relief made in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section). Further, it is possible that the evidence relating to any one of these factors, in the context of all of the facts and circumstances of the particular situation, may be sufficient to persuade the IRS that the grant of relief under section 2642(g)(1) would be appropriate. However, as a general rule, no single factor (whether listed or not) will be determinative in all cases. The factors are as follows:
(i)
Intent.
The intent of the transferor to timely allocate GST exemption to a transfer or to timely make an election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5), as evidenced in the trust instrument, the instrument of transfer, or other relevant documents contemporaneous with the transfer, such as Federal gift and estate tax returns and correspondence. This may include evidence of the intended GST tax status of the transfer or the trust (for example, exempt, non-exempt, or partially exempt), or more explicit evidence of intent with regard to the allocation of GST exemption or the election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5).
(ii)
Intervening events.
Intervening events beyond the control of the transferor or of the executor of the transferor's estate that caused the failure to allocate GST exemption to a transfer or the failure to make an election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5).
(iii)
Lack of awareness.
Lack of awareness, despite the exercise of reasonable diligence, by the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate of the need to allocate GST exemption to the transfer, taking into account the experience of the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate and the complexity of the GST tax issue, as the cause of the failure to allocate GST exemption to a transfer or to make an election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5).
(iv)
Consistency.
Consistency by the transferor with regard to the allocation of the transferor's GST exemption to one or more trusts or skip persons. For example, the transferor's consistent pattern of allocation of GST exemption to transfers (whether or not made in consecutive years) to skip persons or to a particular trust, or the transferor's consistent pattern of electing not to have the automatic allocation of GST exemption apply to transfers (whether or not made in consecutive years), will be taken into consideration. Evidence of consistency may be less relevant if there has been a change of circumstances or a change of trust beneficiaries that otherwise would explain a deviation from prior GST exemption allocation decisions. Relief under this section will not be denied merely because a pattern of allocation or election does not exist or because the existing pattern changed at some point, whether in response to the enactment of section 2642(g) or to some other factor unrelated to either a lack of reasonableness or good faith or prejudice to the interests of the government.
(v)
Qualified tax professional.
Reasonable reliance by the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate on
the advice of a qualified tax professional retained or employed by one or both of them and either the failure of the tax professional, or, in reliance on or consistent with (or in the absence of) that tax professional's advice, the failure of the transferor or the executor, to allocate GST exemption to the transfer or to make an election described in section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5). Reliance on a qualified tax professional will not be considered to have been reasonable if the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate knew or should have known that the professional either—
(A) Was not competent to render advice on the GST exemption; or
(B) Was not aware of all relevant facts.
(3)
Prejudice to the interests of the government.
The following is a nonexclusive list of factors that will be considered to determine whether the interests of the government would be prejudiced for purposes of this section:
(i)
Hindsight.
An attempt to benefit from hindsight will be deemed to prejudice the interests of the government. A factor relevant to this determination is whether the grant of the requested relief would permit an economic advantage or other benefit that would not have been available if the allocation or election had been timely made. For example, there may be prejudice if a grant of the requested relief would permit an economic advantage or other benefit that results from the selection of one out of a number of alternatives (other than whether or not to make an allocation or election) that were available at the time the allocation or election could have been timely made, if hindsight makes the selected alternative more beneficial than the other alternatives. Prejudice also would exist if the transferor failed to make the allocation or election in order to wait to see (thus, with the benefit of hindsight) whether making an allocation of exemption or election would be more beneficial than not making the allocation or election. For instance, assume that a transferor funds several trusts with different property interests on the same date, and does not allocate GST exemption to any trust. Several years later, the transferor seeks relief to allocate GST exemption to the trust that enjoyed the greatest asset appreciation and thus constitutes the most effective use of the transferor's GST exemption. Relief will not be granted because the transferor attempted to benefit from hindsight and thereby acquire an economic advantage.
(ii)
Timing of the request for relief.
The timing of the request for relief will be considered in determining whether the interests of the government would be prejudiced by granting relief under this section. The interests of the government would be prejudiced if delay by the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate in the filing of the request for relief was intended to deprive the IRS of a sufficient period of time in which to challenge any element of the transfer that is the subject of the request for relief, such as the value of the transferred property for Federal gift or estate tax purposes, the claimed identity of the transferor of the transferred property, or any other aspect of the transfer that is relevant for Federal gift or estate tax purposes. For this purpose, such intent will be presumed, but may be rebutted by evidence persuasive to the IRS of the existence of other reasons for or circumstances causing the delay.
(iii)
Intervening taxable events.
The occurrence and effect of an intervening taxable termination or taxable distribution will be considered in determining whether and to what extent the interests of the government would be prejudiced by a grant of relief under this section. The interests of the government may be prejudiced if a taxable termination or a taxable distribution occurred between the time for making a timely allocation of GST exemption or a timely election described in section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5) and the time at which the request for relief under this section was filed. The impact of a grant of relief on (and the difficulty of adjusting) the GST tax consequences of that intervening termination or distribution will be considered in determining whether the occurrence of a taxable termination or taxable distribution constitutes prejudice.
(iv)
Closed years.
Subject to the considerations described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, the expiration
of any period of limitations on the assessment or collection of transfer taxes prior to the filing of a request for relief under this section generally is not relevant to the determination of whether the requirements for a grant of relief under this section have been met. If that period has expired, however, and if the IRS concludes that the value of the transferred asset or assets as reported on a Federal gift or estate tax return by the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate is likely to have satisfied the definition of a gross valuation misstatement as defined in section 6662(h)(2)(C) of the Code, the IRS will consider the purported undervaluation in determining whether a grant of relief will prejudice the interests of the government.
(e)
Situations in which the standard of reasonableness, good faith, and lack of prejudice to the interests of the government has not been met
—(1)
In general.
Relief under this section will not be granted if the IRS determines that the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate has not acted reasonably and in good faith, or that the grant of relief would prejudice the interests of the government. The following situations illustrate some circumstances in which the standard of reasonableness, good faith, and lack of prejudice to the interests of the government has not been met, and as a result, in which relief under this section will not be granted.
(2)
Affirmative allocations
—(i) In general, relief will not be granted under this section to the extent that it would decrease or revoke an affirmative (but not automatic) allocation of GST exemption under section 2632(a) or 2642(b) that was made on a Federal gift or estate tax return, regardless of whether the transfer or the allocation of exemption was made during the transferor's life or upon the transferor's death.
(ii) There are three exceptions to this general rule, as follows. No request for relief is required for either of the first two exceptions:
(A) An allocation of GST exemption is void to the extent the amount allocated exceeds the amount necessary to obtain an inclusion ratio of zero with respect to the property transferred or to the trust. This provision does not apply to charitable lead annuity trusts, nor does it apply to an allocation made to a trust subject to an estate tax inclusion period before the termination of that period.
See
§ 26.2632-1(b)(4)(i).
(B) An allocation is void if the allocation is made with respect to a trust that, at the time of the allocation, has no GST potential with respect to the transferor making the allocation. For this purpose, a trust has GST potential even if the possibility of a GST is so remote as to be negligible.
See
§ 26.2632-1(b)(4)(i).
(C) A late allocation of GST exemption, as described in section 2642(b)(3), to a transfer or to a trust will be deemed void upon the grant of relief under this section if—
(
1
) Prior to December 31, 2000, a transfer is made that is subject to GST tax or to a trust that has GST potential with respect to the transferor;
(
2
) A timely allocation of GST exemption was not made to the transfer or the trust, and this missed allocation was not eligible for relief prior to the enactment of section 2642(g)(1);
(
3
) Prior to December 31, 2000, a late allocation of GST exemption was made to the transfer or the trust;
(
4
) The late allocation is disclosed as part of the request for relief or during the IRS's consideration of that request; and
(
5
) Relief under this section is granted to make a timely allocation to the transfer or the trust described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section.
(3)
Timing.
Relief will not be granted with regard to a transfer reported on the transferor's gift tax return in the situation in which the transferor filed the request for relief shortly after the expiration of the period during which an assessment of gift tax could be made with respect to that transfer, the IRS reasonably concludes that the transferor intentionally delayed that filing for the purpose of preventing an IRS examination of the reported value of the property subject to that transfer or the claimed identity of the transferor or other fact relevant for transfer tax purposes, and the transferor is unable to produce evidence sufficient to convince the IRS that the filing delay was attributable to some other reason or purpose.
(4)
Failure after being accurately informed.
Relief will not be granted under this section if the decision made by the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate (who had been accurately informed in all material respects by a qualified tax professional retained or employed by either (or both) of them with regard to the allocation of GST exemption or an election described in section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5)) was reflected or implemented by the action or inaction that is the subject of the request for relief.
(5)
Hindsight.
Relief under this section will not be granted if the IRS determines that the requested relief is an attempt to benefit from hindsight by waiting to see which of multiple transfers, made at substantially the same time but consisting of different property interests, enjoyed the greatest appreciation and thus would constitute the most effective use of the transferor's GST exemption.
(f) [Reserved]
(g)
Period of limitations under section 6501.
A request for relief under this section does not reopen, suspend, or extend the period of limitations on assessment or collection of any estate, gift, or GST tax under section 6501 of the Code. The IRS may request that the transferor or the transferor's executor consent, under section 6501(c)(4) and prior to the expiration of that period of limitations, to an extension of the period of limitations on assessment or collection of any or all gift and GST taxes for the transfer or transfers that are the subject of the requested relief. The transferor or the transferor's executor has the right to refuse to extend the period of limitations, or to limit any such extension to particular issues or to a particular period of time.
See
section 6501(c)(4)(B). Because a consent to an extension (whether or not limited) may eliminate prejudice to the interests of the government described in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii) and (e)(3) of this section, a refusal to consent to an extension is a factor that may adversely impact the availability of the requested relief.
(h)
Refunds.
The filing of a request for relief under section 2642(g)(1) with the IRS does not constitute a claim for refund or credit of an overpayment and no implied right to refund will arise from the filing of such a request for relief. Similarly, the filing of such a request for relief does not extend the period of limitations under section 6511 of the Code for filing a claim for refund or credit of an overpayment. If the grant of relief under section 2642(g)(1) results in the decrease of a trust's inclusion ratio or a reduction in the amount of a direct skip, and thus in a potential claim for refund or credit of an overpayment of tax, no such refund or credit will be allowed to the taxpayer or to the taxpayer's estate if the period of limitations under section 6511 for filing a claim for a refund or credit of the Federal gift, estate, or GST tax that was reduced by the granted relief has expired, unless a claim for refund or credit was filed before the expiration of that period. The taxpayer or the taxpayer's estate is responsible for preserving any potential claim for refund or credit.
(i)
Procedural requirements
—(1)
Automatic 6-month extension.
An automatic extension of 6 months from the due date of the gift or estate tax return, or of the Form 8939,
Allocation of Increase in Basis for Property Acquired From a Decedent,
of a decedent dying in calendar year 2010, (in each case, excluding extensions) is granted to file a supplemental return or Form 8939 on which the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate may allocate GST exemption or make an election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5). This extension, however, is available only if the transferor (or the executor of a transferor's estate) both timely filed the gift or estate tax return or the Form 8939 on which the GST exemption should have been allocated or the election should have been made, and, within that 6-month extension period, files a supplemental return or other supplementary filing. On the supplemental return or other filing, the taxpayer must comply with all of the requirements for allocating GST exemption under section 2632 or for making the election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5) for the year the allocation or election should have been made to make a valid allocation or election. Any supplemental return filed pursuant to this paragraph must say
FILED
PURSUANT TO § 26.2642-7(i)(1)
on the front page of the return or the Form 8939, and must be sent to the same address that a timely return or Form 8939 on which the allocation or election should have been made would have been sent, subject to address changes in future forms or instructions or guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
See
§ 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter. No request for a private letter ruling is required and, as a result, no user fee is required to be paid.
(2)
Private letter ruling program.
Except for the automatic 6-month extension provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, the relief described in this section is provided through the IRS's private letter ruling program. Requests for relief may be submitted in accordance with the applicable procedures for requests for a private letter ruling.
(3)
Affidavit and declaration of transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate.
(i) The transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate must submit a detailed affidavit describing the events that led to the failure to timely allocate GST exemption to a transfer or the failure to timely elect under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5), and the events that led to the discovery of the failure. In situations described in paragraph (i)(4)(vi) of this section, this affidavit also must include the additional information and statements described in that paragraph. If the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate relied on a tax professional for advice with respect to the allocation or election, the affidavit also must describe—
(A) The scope of the engagement;
(B) The responsibilities the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate believed the professional had assumed; and
(C) The extent to which the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate relied on the professional.
(ii) Attached to each affidavit must be copies of any writings (including, without limitation, notes and emails) and other contemporaneous documents within the possession or control of the affiant relevant to the determination of the transferor's intent with regard to the application of GST tax to the transaction for which relief under this section is requested.
(iii) The affidavit must be accompanied by a dated declaration, signed by the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate, that states:
Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this affidavit, including any attachments thereto, and to the best of my knowledge and belief, this affidavit, including any attachments thereto, is true, correct, and complete. In addition, under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined all the documents included as part of this request for relief, and that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, these documents collectively contain all the relevant facts relating to the request for relief and such facts are true, correct, and complete.
(4)
Affidavits and declarations from other parties.
(i) The transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate must submit detailed affidavits from the individuals specified in paragraphs (i)(4)(i)(A) through (D) of this section and other individuals who have knowledge or information about the events that led to the failure to allocate GST exemption or to elect under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5), or to the discovery of the failure. These individuals may include individuals whose knowledge or information is not within the personal knowledge of the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate. The individuals described in this paragraph must include—
(A) Each agent or legal representative of the transferor who participated in the consideration of, or the decision with regard to, the allocation of GST exemption or the election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5), or the preparation of the return for which relief is being requested;
(B) The preparer of the relevant Federal estate or gift tax return or returns;
(C) Each individual (including an employee of the transferor or of the executor of the transferor's estate) who provided information or advice with regard to, or otherwise made a significant contribution to, the decision concerning the allocation of GST exemption, the election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5), or the preparation of the relevant Federal estate and/or gift tax return or returns; and
(D) Each tax professional who advised or was consulted by the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate with regard to the allocation of GST exemption, the election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5), or the preparation of the relevant Federal estate or gift tax return or returns.
(ii) Each affidavit must describe the scope of the engagement and the responsibilities of the individual as well as the advice or service the individual provided to the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate.
(iii) Attached to each affidavit must be a copy of each writing (including, without limitation, notes and emails) and other contemporaneous documents within the possession of the affiant relevant to the transferor's intent or the affiant's advice with regard to the application of GST tax to the transaction for which relief under this section is requested. The documents that the affiant discovers by conducting in good faith a reasonably diligent search of records in the possession of or accessible to the affiant, or subject to the affiant's control, will be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (i)(4)(iii). A reasonably diligent search generally would include, without limitation, a review of the records in the possession or control of the affiant or the firm at which the affiant is employed or associated relating to the transaction or tax return at issue.
(iv) The IRS may require additional affidavits from persons not set forth in paragraph (i)(4)(i) of this section as well as additional documents when additional information or documents with respect to a transfer is believed by the IRS to be required or helpful in making its determination as to whether relief under this section should be granted.
(v) Each affidavit also must include the name and current address of the affiant, and must be accompanied by a dated declaration signed by the affiant that states:
Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have personal knowledge of the information set forth in this affidavit, including any attachments thereto. In addition, under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this affidavit, including any attachments thereto, and, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the affidavit contains all the relevant facts and the attachments include copies of all relevant writings or other documents resulting from a reasonably diligent search, conducted in good faith, of all records within my possession, accessible to me, or subject to my control, relating to the allocation of GST exemption, the election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5), and the preparation of the tax return at issue in the request for relief filed by or on behalf of [
transferor or executor of transferor's estate
], and such facts and attached documents are true, correct, and complete.
(vi) If an individual who would be required to provide an affidavit under paragraph (i)(4)(i) of this section has died or is unwilling or otherwise unable to provide the required affidavit, the affidavit required under paragraph (i)(3) of this section must include a statement to that effect, as well as a statement describing the relationship between that individual and the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate; the information or knowledge the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate believes that individual had about the events that led to the failure to make the allocation or the election or to the discovery of that failure; and, in cases other than the death of the individual, a detailed description of the efforts made to obtain the affidavit from the individual. The unwillingness of certain affiants to provide an affidavit, however, may be considered by the IRS in determining whether to grant the requested relief. For purposes of this paragraph (i)(4)(vi), the term
unwilling
refers to a person who is apparently able but refuses or otherwise fails, despite the best efforts, made in good faith, of the transferor or the transferor's executor, to provide the required affidavit. In addition, for purposes of this paragraph, the term
unable
refers to a permanent or potentially long-term condition such as physical or mental incapacity that prevents the person from providing the required affidavit, but not a temporary condition such as a temporary physical or mental incapacity or a person's inability due to a leave of
absence, travel, or a contractual requirement such as a confidentiality agreement.
(5)
Additional rules regarding relief.
For purposes of relief under paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section, the grant of relief in the form of an extension of time is not a determination that the taxpayer is otherwise eligible to make the election. In addition, notwithstanding the provisions of this section, an extension of time will not be granted under this section if alternative relief is provided by a statute, a regulation published in the
Federal Register,
or a revenue ruling, revenue procedure, notice, or announcement published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
(j)
Applicability date.
This section applies to requests for relief to which section 2642(g)(1) applies that are filed on or after May 6, 2024, regardless of the date of the transfer.
[89 FR 37123, May 6, 2024]
§ 26.2651-1
Generation assignment.
(a)
Special rule for persons with a deceased parent
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (a) applies for purposes of determining whether a transfer to or for the benefit of an individual who is a descendant of a parent of the transferor (or the transferor's spouse or former spouse) is a generation-skipping transfer. If that individual's parent, who is a lineal descendant of the parent of the transferor (or the transferor's spouse or former spouse), is deceased at the time the transfer (from which an interest of such individual is established or derived) is subject to the tax imposed on the transferor by chapter 11 or 12 of the Internal Revenue Code, the individual is treated as if that individual were a member of the generation that is one generation below the lower of—
(i) The transferor's generation; or
(ii) The generation assignment of the individual's youngest living lineal ancestor who is also a descendant of the parent of the transferor (or the transferor's spouse or former spouse).
(2)
Special rules
—(i)
Corresponding generation adjustment.
If an individual's generation assignment is adjusted with respect to a transfer in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a corresponding adjustment with respect to that transfer is made to the generation assignment of each—
(A) Spouse or former spouse of that individual;
(B) Descendant of that individual; and
(C) Spouse or former spouse of each descendant of that individual.
(ii)
Continued application of generation assignment.
If a transfer to a trust would be a generation-skipping transfer but for paragraph (a)(1) of this section, any generation assignment determined under this paragraph (a) continues to apply in determining whether any subsequent distribution from (or termination of an interest in) the portion of the trust attributable to that transfer is a generation-skipping transfer.
(iii)
Ninety-day rule.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, any individual who dies no later than 90 days after a transfer occurring by reason of the death of the transferor is treated as having predeceased the transferor.
(iv)
Local law.
A living person is not treated as having predeceased the transferor solely by reason of a provision of applicable local law; e.g., an individual who disclaims is not treated as a predeceased parent solely because state law treats a disclaimant as having predeceased the transferor for purposes of determining the disposition of the disclaimed property.
(3)
Established or derived.
For purposes of section 2651(e) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an individual's interest is established or derived at the time the transferor is subject to transfer tax on the property. See § 26.2652-1(a) for the definition of a transferor. If the same transferor, on more than one occasion, is subject to transfer tax imposed by either chapter 11 or 12 of the Internal Revenue Code on the property so transferred (whether the same property, reinvestments thereof, income thereon, or any or all of these), then the relevant time for determining whether paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies is the earliest time at which the transferor is subject to the tax imposed by either chapter 11 or 12 of the Internal Revenue Code. For purposes of section 2651(e) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the interest of a remainder beneficiary of a trust for which an
election under section 2523(f) or section 2056(b)(7) (QTIP election) has been made will be deemed to have been established or derived, to the extent of the QTIP election, on the date as of which the value of the trust corpus is first subject to tax under section 2519 or section 2044. The preceding sentence does not apply to a trust, however, to the extent that an election under section 2652(a)(3) (reverse QTIP election) has been made for the trust because, to the extent of a reverse QTIP election, the spouse who established the trust will remain the transferor of the trust for generation-skipping transfer tax purposes.
(4)
Special rule in the case of additional contributions to a trust.
If a transferor referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section contributes additional property to a trust that existed before the application of paragraph (a)(1), then the additional property is treated as being held in a separate trust for purposes of chapter 13 of the Internal Revenue Code. The provisions of § 26.2654-1(a)(2), regarding treatment as separate trusts, apply as if different transferors had contributed to the separate portions of the single trust. Additional subsequent contributions from that transferor will be added to the new share that is treated as a separate trust.
(b)
Limited application to collateral heirs.
Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply in the case of a transfer to any individual who is not a lineal descendant of the transferor (or the transferor's spouse or former spouse) if the transferor has any living lineal descendant at the time of the transfer.
(c)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section:

# Example 1.
T establishes an irrevocable trust, Trust, providing that trust income is to be paid to T's grandchild, GC, for 5 years. At the end of the 5-year period or on GC's prior death, Trust is to terminate and the principal is to be distributed to GC if GC is living or to GC's children if GC has died. The transfer that occurred on the creation of the trust is subject to the tax imposed by chapter 12 of the Internal Revenue Code and, at the time of the transfer, T's child, C, who is a parent of GC, is deceased. GC is treated as a member of the generation that is one generation below T's generation. As a result, GC is not a skip person and Trust is not a skip person. Therefore, the transfer to Trust is not a direct skip. Similarly, distributions to GC during the term of Trust and at the termination of Trust will not be GSTs.

# Example 2.
On January 1, 2004, T transfers $100,000 to an irrevocable inter vivos trust that provides T with an annuity payable for four years or until T's prior death. The annuity satisfies the definition of a qualified interest under section 2702(b). When the trust terminates, the corpus is to be paid to T's grandchild, GC. The transfer is subject to the tax imposed by chapter 12 of the Internal Revenue Code and, at the time of the transfer, T's child, C, who is a parent of GC, is living. C dies in 2006. In this case, C was alive at the time the transfer by T was subject to the tax imposed by chapter 12 of the Internal Revenue Code. Therefore, section 2651(e) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section do not apply. When the trust subsequently terminates, the distribution to GC is a taxable termination that is subject to the GST tax to the extent the trust has an inclusion ratio greater than zero. See section 2642(a).

# Example 3.
T dies testate in 2002, survived by T's spouse, S, their children, C1 and C2, and C1's child, GC. Under the terms of T's will, a trust is established for the benefit of S and of T and S's descendants. Under the terms of the trust, all income is payable to S during S's lifetime and the trustee may distribute trust corpus for S's health, support and maintenance. At S's death, the corpus is to be distributed, outright, to C1 and C2. If either C1 or C2 has predeceased S, the deceased child's share of the corpus is to be distributed to that child's then-living descendants, per stirpes. The executor of T's estate makes the election under section 2056(b)(7) to treat the trust property as qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) but does not make the election under section 2652(a)(3) (reverse QTIP election). In 2003, C1 dies survived by S and GC. In 2004, S dies, and the trust terminates. The full fair market value of the trust is includible in S's gross estate under section 2044 and S becomes the transferor of the trust under section 2652(a)(1)(A). GC's interest is considered established or derived at S's death, and because C1 is deceased at that time, GC is treated as a member of the generation that is one generation below the generation of the transferor, S. As a result, GC is not a skip person and the transfer to GC is not a direct skip.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3.
However, the executor of T's estate makes the election under section 2652(a)(3) (reverse QTIP election) for the entire trust. Therefore, T remains the transferor because, for purposes of chapter 13 of the Internal Revenue Code, the election to be treated as qualified terminable interest property is treated as if it had not been made. In this case, GC's interest is established or derived
on T's death in 2002. Because C1 was living at the time of T's death, the predeceased parent rule under section 2651(e) does not apply, even though C1 was deceased at the time the transfer from S to GC was subject to the tax under chapter 11 of the Internal Revenue Code. When the trust terminates, the distribution to GC is a taxable termination that is subject to the GST tax to the extent the trust has an inclusion ratio greater than zero. See section 2642(a).

# Example 5.
T establishes an irrevocable trust providing that trust income is to be paid to T's grandniece, GN, for 5 years or until GN's prior death. At the end of the 5-year period or on GN's prior death, the trust is to terminate and the principal is to be distributed to GN if living, or if GN has died, to GN's then-living descendants, per stirpes. S is a sibling of T and the parent of N. N is the parent of GN. At the time of the transfer, T has no living lineal descendant, S is living, N is deceased, and the transfer is subject to the gift tax imposed by chapter 12 of the Internal Revenue Code. GN is treated as a member of the generation that is one generation below T's generation because S, GN's youngest living lineal ancestor who is also a descendant of T's parent, is in T's generation. As a result, GN is not a skip person and the transfer to the trust is not a direct skip. In addition, distributions to GN during the term of the trust and at the termination of the trust will not be GSTs.

# Example 6.
On January 1, 2004, T transfers $50,000 to a great-grandniece, GGN, who is the great-grandchild of B, a brother of T. At the time of the transfer, T has no living lineal descendants and B's grandchild, GN, who is a parent of GGN and a child of B's living child, N, is deceased. GGN will be treated as a member of the generation that is one generation below the lower of T's generation or the generation assignment of GGN's youngest living lineal ancestor who is also a descendant of the parent of the transferor. In this case, N is GGN's youngest living lineal ancestor who is also a descendant of the parent of T. Because N's generation assignment is lower than T's generation, GGN will be treated as a member of the generation that is one generation below N's generation assignment (
i.e.
, GGN will be treated as a member of her parent's generation). As a result, GGN remains a skip person and the transfer to GGN is a direct skip.

# Example 7.
T has a child, C. C and C's spouse, S, have a 20-year-old child, GC. C dies and S subsequently marries S2. S2 legally adopts GC. T transfers $100,000 to GC. Under section 2651(b)(1), GC is assigned to the generation that is two generations below T. However, since GC's parent, C, is deceased at the time of the transfer, GC will be treated as a member of the generation that is one generation below T. As a result, GC is not a skip person and the transfer to GC is not a direct skip.
[T.D. 9214, 70 FR 41142, July 18, 2005]
§ 26.2651-2
Individual assigned to more than 1 generation.
(a)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, an individual who would be assigned to more than 1 generation is assigned to the youngest of the generations to which that individual would be assigned.
(b)
Exception.
Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, an adopted individual (as defined in this paragraph) will be treated as a member of the generation that is one generation below the adoptive parent for purposes of determining whether a transfer to the adopted individual from the adoptive parent (or the spouse or former spouse of the adoptive parent, or a lineal descendant of a grandparent of the adoptive parent) is subject to chapter 13 of the Internal Revenue Code. For purposes of this paragraph (b), an adopted individual is an individual who is—
(1) Legally adopted by the adoptive parent;
(2) A descendant of a parent of the adoptive parent (or the spouse or former spouse of the adoptive parent);
(3) Under the age of 18 at the time of the adoption; and
(4) Not adopted primarily for the purpose of avoiding GST tax. The determination of whether an adoption is primarily for GST tax-avoidance purposes is made based upon all of the facts and circumstances. The most significant factor is whether there is a bona fide parent/child relationship between the adoptive parent and the adopted individual, in which the adoptive parent has fully assumed all significant responsibilities for the care and raising of the adopted child. Other factors may include (but are not limited to), at the time of the adoption—
(i) The age of the adopted individual (for example, the younger the age of the adopted individual, or the age of the youngest of siblings who are all adopted together, the more likely the adoption will not be considered primarily for GST tax-avoidance purposes); and
(ii) The relationship between the adopted individual and the individual's parents (for example, objective evidence of the absence or incapacity of the parents may indicate that the adoption is not primarily for GST tax-avoidance purposes).
(c)
Special rules
—(1)
Corresponding generation adjustment.
If an individual's generation assignment is adjusted with respect to a transfer in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, a corresponding adjustment with respect to that transfer is made to the generation assignment of each—
(i) Spouse or former spouse of that individual;
(ii) Descendant of that individual; and
(iii) Spouse or former spouse of each descendant of that individual.
(2) Continued application of generation assignment. If a transfer to a trust would be a generation-skipping transfer but for paragraph (b) of this section, any generation assignment determined under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section continues to apply in determining whether any subsequent distribution from (or termination of an interest in) the portion of the trust attributable to that transfer is a generation-skipping transfer.
(d)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of this section:

# Example.
T has a child, C. C has a 20-year-old child, GC. T legally adopts GC and transfers $100,000 to GC. GC's generation assignment is determined by section 2651(b)(1) and GC is assigned to the generation that is two generations below T. In addition, because T has legally adopted GC, GC is generally treated as a child of T under state law. Under these circumstances, GC is an individual who is assigned to more than one generation and the exception in § 26.2651-2(b) does not apply. Thus, the special rule under section 2651(f)(1) applies and GC is assigned to the generation that is two generations below T. GC remains a skip person with respect to T and the transfer to GC is a direct skip.
[T.D. 9214, 70 FR 41142, July 18, 2005]
§ 26.2651-3
Effective dates.
(a)
In general.
The rules of §§ 26.2651-1 and 26.2651-2 are applicable for terminations, distributions, and transfers occurring on or after July 18, 2005.
(b)
Transition rule.
In the case of transfers occurring after December 31, 1997, and before July 18, 2005, taxpayers may rely on any reasonable interpretation of section 2651(e). For this purpose, these final regulations, as well as the proposed regulations issued on September 3, 2004 (69 FR 53862), are treated as a reasonable interpretation of the statute.
[T.D. 9214, 70 FR 41142, July 18, 2005]
§ 26.2652-1
Transferor defined; other definitions.
(a)
Transferor defined
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the individual with respect to whom property was most recently subject to Federal estate or gift tax is the transferor of that property for purposes of chapter 13. An individual is treated as transferring any property with respect to which the individual is the transferor. Thus, an individual may be a transferor even though there is no transfer of property under local law at the time the Federal estate or gift tax applies. For purposes of this paragraph, a surviving spouse is the transferor of a qualified domestic trust created by the deceased spouse that is included in the surviving spouse's gross estate, provided the trust is not subject to the election described in § 26.2652-2 (reverse QTIP election). A surviving spouse is also the transferor of a qualified domestic trust created by the surviving spouse pursuant to section 2056(d)(2)(B). For generation-skipping transfer tax rules related to an ABLE account established under section 529A, see § 1.529A-4 of this chapter.
(2)
Transfers subject to Federal estate or gift tax.
For purposes of this chapter, a transfer is subject to Federal gift tax if a gift tax is imposed under section 2501(a) (without regard to exemptions, exclusions, deductions, and credits). A transfer is subject to Federal estate tax if the value of the property is includible in the decedent's gross estate as determined under section 2031 or section 2103.
(3)
Special rule for certain QTIP trusts.
Solely for purposes of chapter 13, if a transferor of qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) elects under § 26.2652-2(a) to treat the property as if
the QTIP election had not been made (reverse QTIP election), the identity of the transferor of the property is determined without regard to the application of sections 2044, 2207A, and 2519.
(4)
Split-gift transfers.
In the case of a transfer with respect to which the donor's spouse makes an election under section 2513 to treat the gift as made one-half by the spouse, the electing spouse is treated as the transferor of one-half of the entire value of the property transferred by the donor, regardless of the interest the electing spouse is actually deemed to have transferred under section 2513. The donor is treated as the transferor of one-half of the value of the entire property. See § 26.2632-1(c)(5)
Example 3,
regarding allocation of GST exemption with respect to split-gift transfers subject to an ETIP.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (a):

# Example 1. Identity of transferor,
T transfers $100,000 to a trust for the sole benefit of T's grandchild. The transfer is subject to Federal gift tax because a gift tax is imposed under section 2501(a) (without regard to exemptions, exclusions, deductions, and credits). Thus, for purposes of chapter 13, T is the transferor of the $100,000. It is immaterial that a portion of the transfer is excluded from the total amount of T's taxable gift by reason of section 2503(b).

# Example 2. Gift splitting and identity of transferor,
The facts are the same as in
Example
1, except T's spouse, S, consents under section 2513 to split the gift with T. For purposes of chapter 13, S and T are each treated as a transferor of $50,000 to the trust.

# Example 3. Change of transferor on subsequent transfer tax event,
T transfers $100,000 to a trust providing that all the net trust income is to be paid to T's spouse, S, for S's lifetime. T elects under section 2523(f) to treat the transfer as a transfer of qualified terminable interest property, and T does not make the reverse QTIP election under section 2652(a)(3). On S's death, the trust property is included in S's gross estate under section 2044. Thus, S becomes the transferor at the time of S's death.

# Example 4. Effect of transfer of an interest in trust on identity of the transferor,
T transfers $100,000 to a trust providing that all of the net income is to be paid to T's child, C, for C's lifetime. At C's death, the trust property is to be paid to T's grandchild. C transfers the income interest to X, an unrelated party, in a transfer that is a completed transfer for Federal gift tax purposes. Because C's transfer is a transfer of a term interest in the trust that does not affect the rights of other parties with respect to the trust property, T remains the transferor with respect to the trust.

# Example 5. Effect of lapse of withdrawal right on identity of transferor,
T transfers $10,000 to a new trust providing that the trust income is to be paid to T's child, C, for C's life and, on the death of C, the trust principal is to be paid to T's grandchild, GC. The trustee has discretion to distribute principal for GC's benefit during C's lifetime. C has a right to withdraw $10,000 from the trust for a 60-day period following the transfer. Thereafter, the power lapses. C does not exercise the withdrawal right. The transfer by T is subject to Federal gift tax because a gift tax is imposed under section 2501(a) (without regard to exemptions, exclusions, deductions, and credits) and, thus, T is treated as having transferred the entire $10,000 to the trust. On the lapse of the withdrawal right, C becomes a transferor to the extent C is treated as having made a completed transfer for purposes of chapter 12. Therefore, except to the extent that the amount with respect to which the power of withdrawal lapses exceeds the greater of $5,000 or 5% of the value of the trust property, T remains the transferor of the trust property for purposes of chapter 13.

# Example 6. Effect of reverse QTIP election on identity of the transferor,
T establishes a testamentary trust having a principal of $500,000. Under the terms of the trust, all trust income is payable to T's surviving spouse, S, during S's lifetime. T's executor makes an election to treat the trust property as qualified terminable interest property and also makes the reverse QTIP election. For purposes of chapter 13, T is the transferor with respect to the trust. On S's death, the then full fair market value of the trust is includible in S's gross estate under section 2044. However, because of the reverse QTIP election, S does not become the transferor with respect to the trust; T continues to be the transferor.

# Example 7. Effect of reverse QTIP election on constructive additions,
The facts are the same as in Example 6, except the inclusion of the QTIP trust in S's gross estate increased the Federal estate tax liability of S's estate by $200,000. The estate does not exercise the right of recovery from the trust granted under section 2207A. Under local law, the beneficiaries of S's residuary estate (which bears all estate taxes under the will) could compel the executor to exercise the right of recovery but do not do so. Solely for purposes of chapter 13, the beneficiaries of the residuary estate are not treated as having made an addition to the trust by reason of their failure to exercise their right of recovery. Because of the reverse QTIP election, for GST purposes, the trust property is not treated as includible in S's gross estate and,
under those circumstances, no right of recovery exists.

# Example 8. Effect of reverse QTIP election on constructive additions,
S, the surviving spouse of T, dies testate. At the time of S's death, S was the beneficiary of a trust with respect to which T's executor made a QTIP election under section 2056(b)(7). Thus, the trust is includible in S's gross estate under section 2044. T's executor also made the reverse QTIP election with respect to the trust. S's will provides that all death taxes payable with respect to the trust are payable from S's residuary estate. Since the transferor of the property is determined without regard to section 2044 and section 2207A, S is not treated as making a constructive addition to the trust by reason of the tax apportionment clause in S's will.

# Example 9. Split-gift transfers,
T transfers $100,000 to an inter vivos trust that provides T with an annuity payable for ten years or until T's prior death. The annuity satisfies the definition of a qualified interest under section 2702(b). When the trust terminates, the corpus is to be paid to T's grandchild, GC. T's spouse, S, consents under section 2513 to have the gift treated as made one-half by S. Under section 2513, only the actuarial value of the gift to GC is eligible to be treated as made one-half by S. However, because S is treated as the donor of one-half of the gift to GC, S becomes the transferor of one-half of the entire trust ($50,000) for purposes of Chapter 13.
(b)
Trust defined
—(1)
In general.
A trust includes any arrangement (other than an estate) that has substantially the same effect as a trust. Thus, for example, arrangements involving life estates and remainders, estates for years, and insurance and annuity contracts are trusts. Generally, a transfer as to which the identity of the transferee is contingent upon the occurrence of an event is a transfer in trust; however, a transfer of property included in the transferor's gross estate, as to which the identity of the transferee is contingent upon an event that must occur within 6 months of the transferor's death, is not considered a transfer in trust solely by reason of the existence of the contingency.
(2)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (b):

# Example 1. Uniform gifts to minors transfers,
T transfers cash to an account in the name of T's child, C, as custodian for C's child, GC (who is a minor), under a state statute substantially similar to the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act. For purposes of chapter 13, the transfer to the custodial account is treated as a transfer to a trust.

# Example 2. Contingent transfers,
T bequeaths $200,000 to T's child, C, provided that if C does not survive T by more than 6 months, the bequest is payable to T's grandchild, GC. C dies 4 months after T. The bequest is not a transfer in trust because the contingency that determines the recipient of the bequest must occur within 6 months of T's death. The bequest to GC is a direct skip.

# Example 3. Contingent transfers,
The facts are the same as in Example 2, except C must survive T by 18 months to take the bequest. The bequest is a transfer in trust for purposes of chapter 13, and the death of C is a taxable termination.
(c)
Trustee defined.
The trustee of a trust is the person designated as trustee under local law or, if no such person is so designated, the person in actual or constructive possession of property held in trust.
(d)
Executor defined.
For purposes of chapter 13, the executor is the executor or administrator of the decedent's estate. However, if no executor or administrator is appointed, qualified or acting within the United States, the executor is the fiduciary who is primarily responsible for payment of the decedent's debts and expenses. If there is no such executor, administrator or fiduciary, the executor is the person in actual or constructive possession of the largest portion of the value of the decedent's gross estate.
(e)
Interest in trust.
See § 26.2612-1(e) for the definition of
interest in trust.
[T.D. 8644, 60 FR 66903, Dec. 27, 1995; 61 FR 29654, June 12, 1996, as amended by T.D. 8720, 62 FR 27498, May 20, 1997; T.D. 9923, 85 FR 74047, Nov. 19, 2020]
§ 26.2652-2
Special election for qualified terminable interest property.
(a)
In general.
If an election is made to treat property as qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) under section 2523(f) or section 2056(b)(7), the person making the election may, for purposes of chapter 13, elect to treat the property as if the QTIP election had not been made (reverse QTIP election). An election under this section is irrevocable. An election under this section is not effective unless it is made with respect to all of the property in the trust to which the QTIP election applies. See, however, § 26.2654-1(b)(1). Property that qualifies for a deduction
under section 2056(b)(5) is not eligible for the election under this section.
(b)
Time and manner of making election.
An election under this section is made on the return on which the QTIP election is made. If a protective QTIP election is made, no election under this section is effective unless a protective reverse QTIP election is also made.
(c)
Transitional rule.
If a reverse QTIP election is made with respect to a trust prior to December 27, 1995, and GST exemption has been allocated to that trust, the transferor (or the transferor's executor) may elect to treat the trust as two separate trusts, one of which has a zero inclusion ratio by reason of the transferor's GST exemption previously allocated to the trust. The separate trust with the zero inclusion ratio consists of that fractional share of the value of the entire trust equal to the value of the nontax portion of the trust under § 26.2642-4(a). The reverse QTIP election is treated as applying only to the trust with the zero inclusion ratio. An election under this paragraph (c) is made by attaching a statement to a copy of the return on which the reverse QTIP election was made under section 2652(a)(3). The statement must indicate that an election is being made to treat the trust as two separate trusts and must identify the values of the two separate trusts. The statement is to be filed in the same place in which the original return was filed and must be filed before June 24, 1996. A trust subject to the election described in this paragraph is treated as a trust that was created by two transferors. See § 26.2654-1(a)(2) for special rules involving trusts with multiple transferors.
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section:

# Example 1. Special (reverse QTIP) election under section 2652(a)(3),
T transfers $1,000,000 to a trust providing that all trust income is to be paid to T's spouse, S, for S's lifetime. On S's death, the trust principal is payable to GC, a grandchild of S and T. T elects to treat all of the transfer as a transfer of QTIP and also makes the reverse QTIP election for all of the property. Because of the reverse QTIP election, T continues to be treated as the transferor of the property after S's death for purposes of chapter 13. A taxable termination rather than a direct skip occurs on S's death.

# Example 2. Election under transition rule,
In 1994, T died leaving $4 million in trust for the benefit of T's surviving spouse, S. On January 16, 1995, T's executor filed T's Form 706 on which the executor elects to treat the entire trust as qualified terminable interest property. The executor also makes a reverse QTIP election. The reverse QTIP election is effective with respect to the entire trust even though T's executor could allocate only $1 million of GST exemption to the trust. T's executor may elect to treat the trust as two separate trusts, one having a value of 25% of the value of the single trust and an inclusion ratio of zero, but only if the election is made prior to June 24, 1996. If the executor makes the transitional election, the other separate trust, having a value of 75% of the value of the single trust and an inclusion ratio of one, is not treated as subject to the reverse QTIP election.

# Example 3. Denominator of the applicable fraction of QTIP trust,
T bequeaths $1,500,000 to a trust in which T's surviving spouse, S, receives an income interest for life. Upon the death of S, the property is to remain in trust for the benefit of C, the child of T and S. Upon C's death, the trust is to terminate and the trust property paid to the descendants of C. The bequest qualifies for the estate tax marital deduction under section 2056(b)(7) as QTIP. The executor does not make the reverse QTIP election under section 2652(a)(3). As a result, S becomes the transferor of the trust at S's death when the value of the property in the QTIP trust is included in S's gross estate under section 2044. For purposes of computing the applicable fraction with respect to the QTIP trust upon S's death, the denominator of the fraction is reduced by any Federal estate tax (whether imposed under section 2001, 2101 or 2056A(b)) and State death tax attributable to the trust property that is actually recovered from the trust.
§ 26.2653-1
Taxation of multiple skips.
(a)
General rule.
If property is held in trust immediately after a GST, solely for purposes of determining whether future events involve a skip person, the transferor is thereafter deemed to occupy the generation immediately above the highest generation of any person holding an interest in the trust immediately after the transfer. If no person holds an interest in the trust immediately after the GST, the transferor is treated as occupying the generation above the highest generation of any person in existence at the time of the GST who then occupies the highest generation level of any person who may subsequently hold an interest in
the trust. See § 26.2612-1(e) for rules determining when a person has an interest in property held in trust.
(b)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section:

# Example 1. T transfers property to an irrevocable trust for the benefit of T's grandchild, GC, and great-grandchild, GGC,
During GC's life, the trust income may be distributed to GC and GGC in the trustee's absolute discretion. At GC's death, the trust property passes to GGC. Both GC and GGC have an interest in the trust for purposes of chapter 13. The transfer by T to the trust is a direct skip, and the property is held in trust immediately after the transfer. After the direct skip, the transferor is treated as being one generation above GC, the highest generation individual having an interest in the trust. Therefore, GC is no longer a skip person and distributions to GC are not taxable distributions. However, because GGC occupies a generation that is two generations below the deemed generation of T, GGC is a skip person and distributions of trust income to GGC are taxable distributions.

# Example 2.
T transfers property to an irrevocable trust providing that the income is to be paid to T's child, C, for life. At C's death, the trust income is to be accumulated for 10 years and added to principal. At the end of the 10-year accumulation period, the trust income is to be paid to T's grandchild, GC, for life. Upon GC's death, the trust property is to be paid to T's great-grandchild, GGC, or to GGC's estate. A GST occurs at C's death. Immediately after C's death and during the 10-year accumulation period, no person has an interest in the trust within the meaning of section 2652(c) and § 26.2612-1(e) because no one can receive current distributions of income or principal. Immediately after C's death, T is treated as occupying the generation above the generation of GC (the trust beneficiary in existence at the time of the GST who then occupies the highest generation level of any person who may subsequently hold an interest in the trust). Thus, subsequent income distributions to GC are not taxable distributions.
§ 26.2654-1
Certain trusts treated as separate trusts.
(a)
Single trust treated as separate trusts
—(1)
Substantially separate and independent shares
—(i)
In general.
If a single trust consists solely of substantially separate and independent shares for different beneficiaries, the share attributable to each beneficiary (or group of beneficiaries) is treated as a separate trust for purposes of Chapter 13. The phrase “substantially separate and independent shares” generally has the same meaning as provided in § 1.663(c)-3. However, except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, a portion of a trust is not a separate share unless such share exists from and at all times after the creation of the trust. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(1), a trust is treated as created at the date of death of the grantor if the trust is includible in its entirety in the grantor's gross estate for Federal estate tax purposes. Further, except with respect to shares or trusts that are treated as separate trusts under local law, treatment of a single trust as separate trusts under this paragraph (a)(1) does not permit treatment of those portions as separate trusts for purposes of filing returns and payment of tax or for purposes of computing any other tax imposed under the Internal Revenue Code. Also, additions to, and distributions from, such trusts are allocated pro rata among the separate trusts, unless the governing instrument expressly provides otherwise. See § 26.2642-6 and paragraph (b) of this section regarding the treatment, for purposes of Chapter 13, of separate trusts resulting from the discretionary severance of a single trust.
(ii)
Certain pecuniary amounts.
For purposes of this section, if a person holds the current right to receive a mandatory (i.e., nondiscretionary and noncontingent) payment of a pecuniary amount at the death of the transferor from an inter vivos trust that is includible in the transferor's gross estate, or a testamentary trust, the pecuniary amount is a separate and independent share if—
(A) The trustee is required to pay appropriate interest (as defined in § 26.2642-2(b)(4)(i) and (ii)) to the person; and
(B) If the pecuniary amount is payable in kind on the basis of value other than the date of distribution value of the assets, the trustee is required to allocate assets to the pecuniary payment in a manner that fairly reflects net appreciation or depreciation in the value of the assets in the fund available to pay the pecuniary amount measured from the valuation date to the date of payment.
(iii)
Mandatory severances.
For purposes of this section, if the governing instrument of a trust requires the division or severance of a single trust into separate trusts upon the future occurrence of a particular event not within the discretion of the trustee or any other person, and if the trusts resulting from such a division or severance are recognized as separate trusts under applicable state law, then each resulting trust is treated as a separate trust for purposes of Chapter 13. For this purpose, the rules of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) of this section apply with respect to the severance and funding of the trusts. Similarly, if the governing instrument requires the division of a single trust into separate shares under the circumstances described in this paragraph, each such share is treated as a separate trust for purposes of Chapter 13. The post-severance treatment of the resulting shares or trusts as separate trusts for GST tax purposes generally permits the allocation of GST tax exemption, the making of various elections permitted for GST tax purposes, and the occurrence of a taxable distribution or termination with regard to a particular resulting share or trust, with no GST tax impact on any other trust or share resulting from that severance. The treatment of a single trust as separate trusts under this paragraph (a)(1), however, does not permit treatment of those portions as separate trusts for purposes of filing returns and payment of tax or for purposes of computing any other tax imposed under the Internal Revenue Code, if those portions are not treated as separate trusts under local law. Also, additions to, and distributions from, such trusts are allocated pro rata among the separate trusts, unless the governing instrument expressly provides otherwise. Each separate share and each trust resulting from a mandatory division or severance described in this paragraph will have the same inclusion ratio immediately after the severance as that of the original trust immediately before the division or severance.
(2)
Multiple transferors with respect to single trust
—(i)
In general.
If there is more than one transferor with respect to a trust, the portions of the trust attributable to the different transferors are treated as separate trusts for purposes of chapter 13. Treatment of a single trust as separate trusts under this paragraph (a)(2) does not permit treatment of those portions as separate trusts for purposes of filing returns and payment of tax or for purposes of computing any other tax imposed under the Internal Revenue Code. Also, additions to, and distributions from, such trusts are allocated pro rata among the separate trusts unless otherwise expressly provided in the governing instrument.
(ii)
Addition by a transferor.
If an individual makes an addition to a trust of which the individual is not the sole transferor, the portion of the single trust attributable to each separate trust is determined by multiplying the fair market value of the single trust immediately after the contribution by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the value of the separate trust immediately after the contribution. The denominator of the fraction is the fair market value of all the property in the single trust immediately after the transfer.
(3)
Severance of a single trust.
A single trust treated as separate trusts under paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be divided at any time into separate trusts to reflect that treatment. For this purpose, the rules of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) of this section apply with respect to the severance and funding of the severed trusts.
(4)
Allocation of exemption
—(i)
In general.
With respect to a separate share treated as a separate trust under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, an individual's GST exemption is allocated to the separate trust. See § 26.2632-1 for rules concerning the allocation of GST exemption.
(ii)
Automatic allocation to direct skips.
If the transfer is a direct skip to a trust that occurs during the transferor's lifetime and is treated as a transfer to separate trusts under paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, the transferor's GST exemption not previously allocated is automatically allocated on a pro rata basis among the separate trusts. The transferor may prevent an automatic allocation of GST exemption to a separate share of a single trust by describing on a timely-
filed United States Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return (Form 709) the transfer and the extent to which the automatic allocation is not to apply to a particular share. See § 26.2632-1(b) for rules for avoiding the automatic allocation of GST exemption.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this section (a):

# Example 1. Separate shares as separate trusts,
T transfers $100,000 to a trust under which income is to be paid in equal shares for 10 years to T's child, C, and T's grandchild, GC (or their respective estates). The trust does not permit distributions of principal during the term of the trust. At the end of the 10-year term, the trust principal is to be distributed to C and GC in equal shares. The shares of C and GC in the trust are separate and independent and, therefore, are treated as separate trusts. The result would not be the same if the trust permitted distributions of principal unless the distributions could only be made from a one-half separate share of the initial trust principal and the distributee's future rights with respect to the trust are correspondingly reduced. T may allocate part of T's GST exemption under section 2632(a) to the share held for the benefit of GC.

# Example 2. Separate share rule inapplicable,
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except the trustee holds the discretionary power to distribute the income in any proportion between C and GC during the last year of the trust. The shares of C and GC in the trust are not separate and independent shares throughout the entire term of the trust and, therefore, are not treated as separate trusts for purposes of chapter 13.

# Example 3. Pecuniary payment as separate share,
T creates a lifetime revocable trust providing that on T's death $500,000 is payable to T's spouse, S, with the balance of the principal to be held for the benefit of T's grandchildren. The value of the trust is includible in T's gross estate upon T's death. Under the terms of the trust, the payment to S is required to be made in cash, and under local law S is entitled to receive interest on the payment at an annual rate of 6 percent, commencing immediately upon T's death. For purposes of chapter 13, the trust is treated as created at T's death, and the $500,000 payable to S from the trust is treated as a separate share. The result would be the same if the payment to S could be satisfied using noncash assets at their value on the date of distribution. Further, the result would be the same if the decedent's probate estate poured over to the revocable trust on the decedent's death and was then distributed in accordance with the terms of the trust.

# Example 4. Pecuniary payment not treated as separate share,
The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except the bequest to S is to be paid in noncash assets valued at their values as finally determined for Federal estate tax purposes. Neither the trust instrument nor local law requires that the assets distributed in satisfaction of the bequest fairly reflect net appreciation or depreciation in all the assets from which the bequest may be funded. S's $500,000 bequest is not treated as a separate share and the trust is treated as a single trust for purposes of chapter 13.

# Example 5. Multiple transferors to single trust,
A transfers $100,000 to an irrevocable generation-skipping trust; B simultaneously transfers $50,000 to the same trust. As of the time of the transfers, the single trust is treated as two trusts for purposes of chapter 13. Because A contributed
2/3
of the value of the initial corpus,
2/3
of the single trust principal is treated as a separate trust created by A. Similarly, because B contributed
1/3
of the value of the initial corpus,
1/3
of the single trust is treated as a separate trust created by B. A or B may allocate their GST exemption under section 2632(a) to the respective separate trusts.

# Example 6. Additional contributions,
A transfers $100,000 to an irrevocable generation-skipping trust; B simultaneously transfers $50,000 to the same trust. When the value of the single trust has increased to $180,000, A contributes an additional $60,000 to the trust. At the time of the additional contribution, the portion of the single trust attributable to each grantor's separate trust must be redetermined. The portion of the single trust attributable to A's separate trust immediately after the contribution is
3/4
(((2/3 × $180,000) + $60,000)/$240,000). The portion attributable to B's separate trust after A's addition is
1/4
.

# Example 7. Distributions from a separate share,
The facts are the same as in
Example 6,
except that, after A's second contribution, $50,000 is distributed to a beneficiary of the trust. Absent a provision in the trust instrument that charges the distribution against the contribution of either A or B,
3/4
of the distribution is treated as made from the separate trust of which A is the transferor and
1/4
from the separate trust of which B is the transferor.

# Example 8. Subsequent mandatory division into separate trusts,
T creates an irrevocable trust that provides the trustee with the discretionary power to distribute income or corpus to T's children and grandchildren. The trust provides that, when T's youngest child reaches age 21, the trust will be divided into separate shares, one share for each child of T. The income from a respective child's share will be paid to the child during the child's life, with the remainder passing on the child's death to such child's children (grandchildren of T). The separate shares
that come into existence when the youngest child reaches age 21 will be recognized as of that date as separate trusts for purposes of Chapter 13. The inclusion ratio of the separate trusts will be identical to the inclusion ratio of the trust before the severance. Any allocation of GST tax exemption to the trust after T's youngest child reaches age 21 may be made to any one or more of the separate shares. The result would be the same if the trust instrument provided that the trust was to be divided into separate trusts when T's youngest child reached age 21, provided that the severance and funding of the separate trusts meets the requirements of this section.
(b)
Division of a trust included in the gross estate
—(1)
In general.
The severance of a trust that is included in the transferor's gross estate (or created under the transferor's will) into two or more trusts is recognized for purposes of chapter 13 if—
(i) The trust is severed pursuant to a direction in the governing instrument providing that the trust is to be divided upon the death of the transferor; or
(ii) The governing instrument does not require or otherwise direct severance but the trust is severed pursuant to discretionary authority granted either under the governing instrument or under local law; and
(A) The terms of the new trusts provide in the aggregate for the same succession of interests and beneficiaries as are provided in the original trust;
(B) The severance occurs (or a reformation proceeding, if required, is commenced) prior to the date prescribed for filing the Federal estate tax return (including extensions actually granted) for the estate of the transferor; and
(C) Either—
(
1
) The new trusts are severed on a fractional basis. If severed on a fractional basis, the separate trusts need not be funded with a pro rata portion of each asset held by the undivided trust. The trusts may be funded on a nonpro rata basis provided funding is based on either the fair market value of the assets on the date of funding or in a manner that fairly reflects the net appreciation or depreciation in the value of the assets measured from the valuation date to the date of funding; or
(
2
) If the severance is required (by the terms of the governing instrument) to be made on the basis of a pecuniary amount, the pecuniary payment is satisfied in a manner that would meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section if it were paid to an individual.
(2)
Special rule.
If a court order severing the trust has not been issued at the time the Federal estate tax return is filed, the executor must indicate on a statement attached to the return that a proceeding has been commenced to sever the trust and describe the manner in which the trust is proposed to be severed. A copy of the petition or other instrument used to commence the proceeding must also be attached to the return. If the governing instrument of a trust or local law authorizes the severance of the trust, a severance pursuant to that authorization is treated as meeting the requirement of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section if the executor indicates on the Federal estate tax return that separate trusts will be created (or funded) and clearly sets forth the manner in which the trust is to be severed and the separate trusts funded.
(3)
Allocation of exemption.
An individual's GST exemption under § 2632 may be allocated to the separate trusts created pursuant to this section at the discretion of the executor or trustee.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section (b):

# Example 1. Severance of single trust,
T's will establishes a testamentary trust providing that income is to be paid to T's spouse for life. At the spouse's death, one-half of the corpus is to be paid to T's child, C, or C's estate (if C fails to survive the spouse) and one-half of the corpus is to be paid to T's grandchild, GC, or GC's estate (if GC fails to survive the spouse). If the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section are otherwise satisfied, T's executor may divide the testamentary trust equally into two separate trusts, one trust providing an income interest to spouse for life with remainder to C, and the other trust with an income interest to spouse for life with remainder to GC. Furthermore, if the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section are satisfied, the executor or trustee may further divide the trust for the benefit of GC. GST exemption may be allocated to any of the divided trusts.

# Example 2. Severance of revocable trust,
T creates an inter vivos revocable trust providing that, at T's death and after payment of all taxes and administration expenses, the remaining corpus will be divided into two trusts. One trust, for the benefit of T's spouse, is to be funded with the smallest amount that, if qualifying for the marital deduction, will reduce the estate tax to zero. The other trust, for the benefit of T's descendants, is to be funded with the balance of the revocable trust corpus. The trust corpus is includible in T's gross estate. Each trust is recognized as a separate trust for purposes of chapter 13.

# Example 3. Formula severance,
T's will establishes a testamentary marital trust (Trust) that meets the requirements of qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) if an election under section 2056(b)(7) is made. Trust provides that all trust income is to be paid to T's spouse for life. On the spouse's death, the trust corpus is to be held in further trust for the benefit of T's then-living descendants. On T's date of death in January of 2004, T's unused GST tax exemption is $1,200,000, and T's will includes $200,000 of bequests to T's grandchildren. Prior to the due date for filing the Form 706, “United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return,” for T's estate, T's executor, pursuant to applicable state law, divides Trust into two separate trusts, Trust 1 and Trust 2. Trust 1 is to be funded with that fraction of the Trust assets, the numerator of which is $1,000,000, and the denominator of which is the value of the Trust assets as finally determined for federal estate tax purposes. Trust 2 is to be funded with that fraction of the Trust assets, the numerator of which is the excess of the Trust assets over $1,000,000, and the denominator of which is the value of the Trust assets as finally determined for federal estate tax purposes. On the Form 706 filed for the estate, T's executor makes a QTIP election under section 2056(b)(7) with respect to Trust 1 and Trust 2 and a “reverse” QTIP election under section 2652(a)(3) with respect to Trust 1. Further, T's executor allocates $200,000 of T's available GST tax exemption to the bequests to T's grandchildren, and the balance of T's exemption ($1,000,000) to Trust 1. If the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section are otherwise satisfied, Trust 1 and Trust 2 are recognized as separate trusts for GST tax purposes. Accordingly, the “reverse” QTIP election and allocation of GST tax exemption with respect to Trust 1 are recognized and effective for generation-skipping transfer tax purposes.
(c)

§ 26.2662-1
Generation-skipping transfer tax return requirements.
(a)
In general.
Chapter 13 imposes a tax on generation-skipping transfers (as defined in section 2611). The requirements relating to the return of tax depend on the type of generation-skipping transfer involved. This section contains rules for filing the required tax return. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section provides special rules concerning the return requirements for generation-skipping transfers pursuant to certain trust arrangements (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section), such as life insurance policies and annuities.
(b)
Form of return
—(1)
Taxable distributions.
Form 706GS(D) must be filed in accordance with its instructions for any taxable distribution (as defined in section 2612(b)). The trust involved in a transfer described in the preceding sentence must file Form 706GS(D-1) in accordance with its instructions. A copy of Form 706GS(D-1) shall be sent to each distributee.
(2)
Taxable terminations.
Form 706GS(T) must be filed in accordance with its instructions for any taxable termination (as defined in section 2612(a)).
(3)
Direct skip
—(i)
Inter vivos direct skips.
Form 709 must be filed in accordance with its instructions for any direct skip (as defined in section 2612(c)) that is subject to chapter 12 and occurs during the life of the transferor.
(ii)
Direct skips occurring at death
—(A)
In general.
Form 706 or Form 706NA must be filed in accordance with its instructions for any direct skips (as defined in section 2612(c)) that are subject to chapter 11 and occur at the death of the decedent.
(B)
Direct skips payable from a trust.
Schedule R-1 of Form 706 must be filed in accordance with its instructions for
any direct skip from a trust if such direct skip is subject to chapter 11. See paragraph (c)(2) of this section for special rules relating to the person liable for tax and required to make the return under certain circumstances.
(c)
Person liable for tax and required to make return
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the following person is liable for the tax imposed by section 2601 and must make the required tax return—
(i) The transferee in a taxable distribution (as defined in section 2612(b));
(ii) The trustee in the case of a taxable termination (as defined in section 2612(a));
(iii) The transferor (as defined in section 2652(a)(1)(B)) in the case of an inter vivos direct skip (as defined in section 2612(c));
(iv) The trustee in the case of a direct skip from a trust or with respect to property that continues to be held in trust; or
(v) The executor in the case of a direct skip (other than a direct skip described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section) if the transfer is subject to chapter 11. See paragraph (c)(2) of this section for special rules relating to direct skips to or from certain trust arrangements (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section).
(2)
Special rule for direct skips occurring at death with respect to property held in trust arrangements
—(i)
In general.
In the case of certain property held in a trust arrangement (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) at the date of death of the transferor, the person who is required to make the return and who is liable for the tax imposed by chapter 13 is determined under paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) and (iv) of this section.
(ii)
Trust arrangement defined.
For purposes of this section, the term
trust arrangement
includes any arrangement (other than an estate) which, although not an explicit trust, has the same effect as an explicit trust. For purposes of this section, the term “explicit trust” means a trust described in § 301.7701-4(a).
(iii)
Executor's liability in the case of transfers with respect to decedents dying on or after June 24, 1996 if the transfer is less than $250,000.
In the case of a direct skip occurring at death, the executor of the decedent's estate is liable for the tax imposed on that direct skip by chapter 13 and is required to file Form 706 or Form 706NA (and not Schedule R-1 of Form 706) if, at the date of the decedent's death—
(A) The property involved in the direct skip is held in a trust arrangement; and
(B) The total value of the property involved in direct skips with respect to the trustee of that trust arrangement is less than $250,000.
(iv)
Executor's liability in the case of transfers with respect to decedents dying prior to June 24, 1996 if the transfer is less than $100,000.
In the case of a direct skip occurring at death with respect to a decedent dying prior to June 24, 1996, the rule in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section that imposes liability upon the executor applies only if the property involved in the direct skip with respect to the trustee of the trust arrangement, in the aggregate, is less than $100,000.
(v)
Executor's right of recovery.
In cases where the rules of paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) and (iv) of this section impose liability for the generation-skipping transfer tax on the executor, the executor is entitled to recover from the trustee (if the property continues to be held in trust) or from the recipient of the property (in the case of a transfer from a trust), the generation-skipping transfer tax attributable to the transfer.
(vi)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(2) with respect to decedents dying on or after June 24, 1996:

# Example 1. Insurance proceeds less than $250,000,
On August 1, 1997, T, the insured under an insurance policy, died. The proceeds ($200,000) were includible in T's gross estate for Federal estate tax purposes. T's grandchild, GC, was named the sole beneficiary of the policy. The insurance policy is treated as a trust under section 2652(b)(1), and the payment of the proceeds to GC is a transfer from a trust for purposes of chapter 13. Therefore, the payment of the proceeds to GC is a direct skip. Since the proceeds from the policy ($200,000) are less than $250,000, the executor is liable for the tax imposed by chapter 13 and is required to file Form 706.

# Example 2. Aggregate insurance proceeds of $250,000 or more,
Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except T is the insured under two
insurance policies issued by the same insurance company. The proceeds ($150,000) from each policy are includible in T's gross estate for Federal estate tax purposes. T's grandchild, GC1, was named the sole beneficiary of Policy 1, and T's other grandchild, GC2, was named the sole beneficiary of Policy 2. GC1 and GC2 are skip persons (as defined in section 2613). Therefore, the payments of the proceeds are direct skips. Since the total value of the policies ($300,000) exceeds $250,000, the insurance company is liable for the tax imposed by chapter 13 and is required to file Schedule R-1 of Form 706.

# Example 3. Insurance proceeds of $250,000 or more held by insurance company,
On August 1, 1997, T, the insured under an insurance policy, dies. The policy provides that the insurance company shall make monthly payments of $750 to GC, T's grandchild, for life with the remainder payable to T's great grandchild, GGC. The face value of the policy is $300,000. Since the proceeds continue to be held by the insurance company (the trustee), the proceeds are treated as if they were transferred to a trust for purposes of chapter 13. The trust is a skip person (as defined in section 2613(a)(2)) and the transfer is a direct skip. Since the total value of the policy ($300,000) exceeds $250,000, the insurance company is liable for the tax imposed by chapter 13 and is required to file Schedule R-1 of Form 706.

# Example 4. Insurance proceeds less than $250,000 held by insurance company,
Assume the same facts as in Example 3, except the policy provides that the insurance company shall make monthly payments of $500 to GC and that the face value of the policy is $200,000. The transfer is a transfer to a trust for purposes of chapter 13. However, since the total value of the policy ($200,000) is less than $250,000, the executor is liable for the tax imposed by chapter 13 and is required to file Form 706.

# Example 5.
On August 1, 1997, A, the insured under a life insurance policy, dies. The insurance proceeds on A's life that are payable under policies issued by Company X are in the aggregate amount of $200,000 and are includible in A's gross estate. Because the proceeds are includible in A's gross estate, the generation-skipping transfer that occurs upon A's death, if any, will be a direct skip rather than a taxable distribution or a taxable termination. Accordingly, because the aggregate amount of insurance proceeds with respect to Company X is less than $250,000, Company X may pay the proceeds without regard to whether the beneficiary is a skip person in relation to the decedent-transferor.
(3)
Limitation on personal liability of trustee.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, a trustee is not personally liable for any increases in the tax imposed by section 2601 which is attributable to the fact that—
(i) A transfer is made to the trust during the life of the transferor for which a gift tax return is not filed; or
(ii) The inclusion ratio with respect to the trust, determined by reference to the transferor's gift tax return, is erroneous, the actual inclusion ratio being greater than the reported inclusion ratio.
(iii) This paragraph (c)(3) does not apply if the trustee has or is deemed to have knowledge of facts sufficient to reasonably conclude that a gift tax return was required to be filed or that the inclusion ratio is erroneous. A trustee is deemed to have knowledge of such facts if the trustee's agent, employee, partner, or co-trustee has knowledge of such facts.
(4)
Exceptions
—(i)
Legal or mental incapacity.
If a distributee is legally or mentally incapable of making a return, the return may be made for the distributee by the distributee's guardian or, if no guardian has been appointed, by a person charged with the care of the distributee's person or property.
(ii)
Returns made by fiduciaries.
See section 6012(b) for a fiduciary's responsibilities regarding the returns of decedents, returns of persons under a disability, returns of estates and trusts, and returns made by joint fiduciaries.
(d)
Time and manner of filing return
—(1)
In general.
Forms 706, 706NA, 706GS(D), 706GS(D-1), 706GS(T), 709, and Schedule R-1 of Form 706 must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service office with which an estate or gift tax return of the transferor must be filed. The return shall be filed—
(i)
Direct skip.
In the case of a direct skip, on or before the date on which an estate or gift tax return is required to be filed with respect to the transfer (see section 6075(b)(3)); and
(ii)
Other transfers.
In all other cases, on or before the 15th day of the 4th month after the close of the calendar year in which such transfer occurs. See paragraph (d)(2) of this section for an exception to this rule when an election is made under section 2624(c) to value property included in certain taxable terminations in accordance with section 2032.
(2)
Exception for alternative valuation of taxable termination.
In the case of a taxable termination with respect to which an election is made under section 2624(c) to value property in accordance with section 2032, a Form 706GS(T) must be filed on or before the 15th day of the 4th month after the close of the calendar year in which the taxable termination occurred, or on or before the 10th month following the month in which the death that resulted in the taxable termination occurred, whichever is later.
(e)
Place for filing returns.
See section 6091 for the place for filing any return, declaration, statement, or other document, or copies thereof, required by chapter 13.
(f)
Lien on property.
The liens imposed under sections 6324, 6324A, and 6324B are applicable with respect to the tax imposed under chapter 13. Thus, a lien under section 6324 is imposed in the amount of the tax imposed by section 2601 on all property transferred in a generation-skipping transfer until the tax is fully paid or becomes uncollectible by reason of lapse of time. The lien attaches at the time of the generation-skipping transfer and is in addition to the lien for taxes under section 6321.

§ 26.2663-1
Recapture tax under section 2032A.
See § 26.2642-4(a)(4) for rules relating to the recomputation of the applicable fraction and the imposition of additional GST tax, if additional estate tax is imposed under section 2032A.
§ 26.2663-2
Application of chapter 13 to transfers by nonresidents not citizens of the United States.
(a)
In general.
This section provides rules for applying chapter 13 of the Internal Revenue Code to transfers by a transferor who is a nonresident not a citizen of the United States (NRA transferor). For purposes of this section, an individual is a resident or citizen of the United States if that individual is a resident or citizen of the United States under the rules of chapter 11 or 12 of the Internal Revenue Code, as the case may be. Every NRA transferor is allowed a GST exemption of $1,000,000. See § 26.2632-1 regarding the allocation of the exemption.
(b)
Transfers subject to chapter 13
—(1)
Direct skips.
A transfer by a NRA transferor is a direct skip subject to chapter 13 only to the extent that the transfer is subject to the Federal estate or gift tax within the meaning of § 26.2652-1(a)(2). See § 26.2612-1(a) for the definition of direct skip.
(2)
Taxable distributions and taxable terminations.
Chapter 13 applies to a taxable distribution or a taxable termination to the extent that the initial transfer of property to the trust by a NRA transferor, whether during life or at death, was subject to the Federal estate or gift tax within the meaning of § 26.2652-1(a)(2). See § 26.2612-1(b) for the definition of a taxable termination and § 26.2612-1(c) for the definition of a taxable distribution.
(c)
Trusts funded in part with property subject to chapter 13 and in part with property not subject to chapter 13
—(1)
In general.
If a single trust created by a NRA transferor is in part subject to chapter 13 under the rules of paragraph (b) of this section and in part not subject to chapter 13, the applicable fraction with respect to the trust is determined as of the date of the transfer, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(i)
Numerator of applicable fraction.
The numerator of the applicable fraction is the sum of the amount of GST exemption allocated to the trust (if any) plus the value of the nontax portion of the trust.
(ii)
Denominator of applicable fraction.
The denominator of the applicable fraction is the value of the property transferred to the trust reduced as provided in § 26.2642-1(c).
(2)
Nontax portion of the trust.
The nontax portion of a trust is a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of property not subject to chapter 13 determined as of the date of the initial completed transfer to the trust, and the denominator of which is the value of the entire trust. For example, T, a NRA transferor, transfers property that has a value of $1,000 to a generation-skipping trust. Of the property transferred to the trust, property having a value of $200 is subject to chapter
13 and property having a value of $800 is not subject to chapter 13. The nontax portion is .8 ($800 (the value of the property not subject to chapter 13) over $1,000 (the total value of the property transferred to the trust)).
(3)
Special rule with respect to the estate tax inclusion period.
For purposes of this section, the provisions of § 26.2632-1(c), providing rules applicable in the case of an estate tax inclusion period (ETIP), apply only if the property transferred by the NRA transferor is subsequently included in the transferor's gross estate. If the property is not subsequently included in the gross estate, then the nontax portion of the trust and the applicable fraction are determined as of the date of the initial transfer. If the property is subsequently included in the gross estate, then the nontax portion and the applicable fraction are determined as of the date of death.
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section. In each example T, a NRA, is the transferor; C is T's child; and GC is C's child and a grandchild of T:

# Example 1. Direct transfer to skip person,
T transfers property to GC in a transfer that is subject to Federal gift tax under chapter 12 within the meaning of § 26.2652-1(a)(2). At the time of the transfer, C and GC are NRAs. T's transfer is subject to chapter 13 because the transfer is subject to gift tax under chapter 12.

# Example 2. Transfers of both U.S. and foreign situs property,
(i) T's will established a testamentary trust for the benefit of C and GC. The trust was funded with stock in a publicly traded U.S. corporation having a value on the date of T's death of $100,000, and property not situated in the United States (and therefore not subject to estate tax) having a value on the date of T's death of $400,000.
(ii) On a timely filed estate tax return (Form 706NA), the executor of T's estate allocates $50,000 of GST exemption under section 2632(a) to the trust. The numerator of the applicable fraction is $450,000, the sum of $50,000 (the amount of exemption allocated to the trust) plus $400,000 (the value of the nontax portion of the trust (4/5 × $500,000)). The denominator is $500,000. Hence, the applicable fraction with respect to the trust is .9 ($450,000/$500,000), and the inclusion ratio is .1 (1 - 9/10).

# Example 3. Inter vivos transfer of U.S. and foreign situs property to a trust and a timely allocation of GST exemption,
T establishes a trust providing that trust income is payable to T's child for life and the remainder is to be paid to T's grandchild. T transfers property to the trust that has a value of $100,000 and is subject to chapter 13. T also transfers property to the trust that has a value of $300,000 but is not subject to chapter 13. T allocates $100,000 of exemption to the trust on a timely filed United States Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return (Form 709). The applicable fraction with respect to the trust is 1, determined as follows: $300,000 (the value of the nontax portion of the trust) plus $100,000 (the exemption allocated to the trust)/ $400,000 (the total value of the property transferred to the trust).

# Example 4. Inter vivos transfer of U.S. and foreign situs property to a trust and a late allocation of GST exemption,
(i) In 1996, T transfers $500,000 of property to an inter vivos trust the terms of which provide that income is payable to C, for life, with the remainder to GC. The property transferred to the trust consists of property subject to chapter 13 that has a value of $400,000 on the date of the transfer and property not subject to chapter 13 that has a value of $100,000. T does not allocate GST exemption to the trust. On the transfer date, the nontax portion of the trust is .2 ($100,000/$500,000) and the applicable fraction is also .2 determined as follows: $100,000 (the value of the nontax portion of the trust)/$500,000 (the value of the property transferred to the trust).
(ii) In 1999, when the value of the trust is $800,000, T allocates $100,000 of GST exemption to the trust. The applicable fraction of the trust must be recomputed. The numerator of the applicable fraction is $260,000 ($100,000 (the amount of GST exemption allocated to the trust)) plus $160,000 (the value of the nontax portion of the trust as of the date of allocation (.2 × $800,000)). The denominator of the applicable fraction is $800,000. Accordingly, the applicable fraction with respect to the trust after the allocation is .325 ($260,000/$800,000) and the inclusion ratio is .675 (1−.325).

# Example 5. Taxable termination,
The facts are the same as in Example 4 except that, in 2006, when the value of the property is $1,200,000, C dies and the trust corpus is distributed to GC. The termination is a taxable termination. If no further GST exemption has been allocated to the trust, the applicable fraction remains .325 and the inclusion ratio remains .675.

# Example 6. Estate Tax Inclusion Period,
(i) T transferred property to an inter vivos trust the terms of which provided T with an annuity payable for 10 years or until T's prior death. The annuity satisfies the definition of a qualified interest under section 2702(b). The trust also provided that, at the end of the trust term, the remainder will pass to GC or GC's estate. The property transferred to the
trust consisted of property subject to chapter 13 that has a value of $100,000 and property not subject to chapter 13 that has a value of $400,000. T allocated $100,000 of GST exemption to the trust. If T dies within the 10 year period, the value of the trust principal will be subject to inclusion in T's gross estate to the extent provided in sections 2103 and 2104(b). Accordingly, the ETIP rule under paragraph (c)(3) of this section applies.
(ii) In year 6 of the trust term, T died. At T's death, the trust corpus had a value of $800,000, and $500,000 was includible in T's gross estate as provided in sections 2103 and 2104(b). Thus, $500,000 of the trust corpus is subject to chapter 13 and $300,000 is not subject to chapter 13. The $100,000 GST exemption allocation is effective as of T's date of death. Also, the nontax portion of the trust and the applicable fraction are determined as of T's date of death. In this case, the nontax portion of the trust is .375, determined as follows: $300,000 (the value of the trust not subject to chapter 13)/$800,000 (the value of the trust). The numerator of the applicable fraction is $400,000, determined as follows: $100,000 (GST exemption previously allocated to the trust) plus $300,000 (the value of the nontax portion of the trust). The denominator of the applicable fraction is $800,000. Thus, the applicable fraction with respect to the trust is .50, unless additional exemption is allocated to the trust by T's executor or the automatic allocation rules of § 26.2632-1(d)(2) apply.

# Example 7.
The facts are the same as in
Example 6
except that T survives the termination date of T's retained annuity and the trust corpus is distributed to GC. Since the trust was not included in T's gross estate, the ETIP rules do not apply. Accordingly, the nontax portion of the trust and the applicable fraction are determined as of the date of the transfer to the trust. The nontax portion of the trust is .80 ($400,000/$500,000). The numerator of the applicable fraction is $500,000 determined as follows: $100,000 (GST exemption allocated to the trust) plus $400,000 (the value of the nontax portion of the trust). Accordingly, the applicable fraction is 1, and the inclusion ratio is zero.
(e)
Transitional rule for allocations for transfers made before December 27, 1995.
If an NRA made a GST (inter vivos or testamentary) after December 23, 1992, and before December 27, 1995 that is subject to chapter 13 (within the meaning of § 26.2663-2), the NRA will be treated as having made a timely allocation of GST exemption to the transfer in a calendar year in the order prescribed in section 2632(c). Thus, a NRA's unused GST exemption will initially be treated as allocated to any direct skips made during the calendar year and then to any trusts with respect to which the NRA made transfers during the same calendar year and from which a taxable distribution or a taxable termination may occur. Allocations within the above categories are made in the order in which the transfers occur. Allocations among simultaneous transfers within the same category are made pursuant to the principles of section 2632(c)(2). This transitional allocation rule will not apply if the NRA transferor, or the executor of the NRA's estate, as the case may be, elected to have an automatic allocation of GST exemption not apply by describing on a timely-filed Form 709 for the year of the transfer, or a timely filed Form 706NA, the details of the transfer and the extent to which the allocation was not to apply.

§ 28.2801-1
Tax on certain gifts and bequests from covered expatriates.
(a)
In general.
Section 2801 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) imposes a tax (section 2801 tax) on covered gifts and covered bequests, including distributions attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests from non-electing foreign trusts, received by a U.S. citizen or resident from a covered expatriate during a calendar year. Domestic trusts, as well as electing foreign trusts, are subject to tax under section 2801 in the same manner as if the trusts were U.S. citizens.
See
section 2801(e)(4)(A)(i) and (B)(iii). Accordingly, the section 2801 tax is paid by the U.S. citizen or resident, domestic trust, or electing foreign trust that receives the covered gift or covered bequest, including distributions attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests from non-electing foreign trusts. For purposes of the regulations in this part 28 (26 CFR part 28), references to U.S. citizens are considered to include domestic trusts and electing foreign trusts.
(b)
Applicability date.
This section applies to covered gifts or covered bequests received on or after January 1, 2025.
§ 28.2801-2
Definitions.
(a)
Overview.
This section provides definitions of terms applicable solely for purposes of section 2801 of the Code and the regulations in this part 28.
(b)
U.S. citizen or resident.
A
U.S. citizen or resident
is an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States for purposes of chapter 11 or 12 of subtitle B, as the case may be, at the time of receipt of the covered gift or covered bequest. Furthermore, references to a U.S. citizen also include a domestic trust, as well as an electing foreign trust. See § 28.2801-1(a).
(c)
Domestic trust.
The term
domestic trust
means a trust defined in section 7701(a)(30)(E) of the Code. References to a domestic trust include an electing foreign trust.
(d)
Foreign trust
—(1)
In general.
The term
foreign trust
means a trust defined in section 7701(a)(31)(B).
(2)
Electing foreign trust.
The term
electing foreign trust
means a foreign trust that has in effect a valid election to be treated as a domestic trust for purposes of section 2801.
See
§ 28.2801-5(d).
(3)
Non-electing foreign trust.
The term
non-electing foreign trust
means any foreign trust other than an electing foreign trust described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(e)
U.S. recipient.
The term
U.S. recipient
means a U.S. citizen or resident, a domestic trust, or an electing foreign trust that receives a covered gift or covered bequest, whether directly or indirectly, during the calendar year. The term U.S. recipient includes a U.S. citizen or resident receiving a distribution from a non-electing foreign trust if the distribution is attributable (in whole or in part) to one or more covered gifts or covered bequests received by the non-electing foreign trust.
See
§ 28.2801-5(c) to determine the amount of a distribution attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests. This term also includes the U.S. citizen or resident shareholders, partners, or other interest-holders, as the case may be (if any), of a business entity that receives a covered gift or covered bequest.
(f)
Covered bequest.
The term
covered bequest
means any property acquired by a recipient on or after June 17, 2008, directly or indirectly by reason of the death of a covered expatriate, regardless of the situs of the property and of
whether such property was acquired by the covered expatriate before or after expatriation from the United States, but only to the extent the property would have been included in the covered expatriate's gross estate for Federal estate tax purposes if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen immediately before death. See paragraph (i) of this section for guidance in determining when property is acquired indirectly for purposes of this paragraph (f). The term
covered bequest
also includes any other property that would have been included in the covered expatriate's gross estate for Federal estate tax purposes (for example, under section 2035 of the Code) if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen immediately before death, as well as distributions made by reason of the death of a covered expatriate from a non-electing foreign trust to the extent the distributions are attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests made to the non-electing foreign trust on or after June 17, 2008.
See
§ 28.2801-3 for additional rules and exceptions applicable to the term
covered bequest.
(g)
Covered gift.
The term
covered gift
means any property acquired by a recipient on or after June 17, 2008, by gift directly or indirectly from an individual who is a covered expatriate at the time the property is received by the recipient, regardless of the situs of such property and of whether such property was acquired by the covered expatriate before or after expatriation from the United States. See paragraph (i) of this section for guidance in determining when property is acquired indirectly for purposes of this paragraph (g). The term
covered gift
also includes distributions made, other than by reason of the death of a covered expatriate, from a non-electing foreign trust to the extent the distributions are attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests made to the non-electing foreign trust on or after June 17, 2008.
See
§ 28.2801-3 for additional rules and exceptions applicable to the term covered gift.
(h)
Expatriate and covered expatriate.
The term
expatriate
has the same meaning for purposes of section 2801 as that term has in section 877A(g)(2) of the Code. The term
covered expatriate
has the same meaning for purposes of section 2801 as that term has in section 877A(g)(1). The determination of whether an individual is a covered expatriate is made as of the expatriation date as defined in section 877A(g)(3), and if an expatriate meets the definition of a covered expatriate, the expatriate is a covered expatriate for purposes of section 2801 at all times after the expatriation date. However, an expatriate is not treated as a covered expatriate for purposes of section 2801 during any period beginning after the expatriation date during which such individual is subject to United States estate or gift tax (chapter 11 or chapter 12 of subtitle B) as a U.S. citizen or resident.
See
section 877A(g)(1)(C). An individual's status as a covered expatriate will be determined as of the date of the most recent expatriation, if there has been more than one.
(i)
Indirect acquisition of property.
For purposes of paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, an indirect acquisition of property means the receipt of an interest in property, gratuitously passed from or conferred by the covered expatriate, by or on behalf of the recipient through another person, or by a trust or entity in which the recipient has an interest, regardless of the means or device employed. Such an indirect acquisition includes but is not limited to—
(1) Property acquired by a recipient through a transfer to a corporation or other entity other than a trust or estate, to the extent of the ownership interest of the recipient in that corporation or other entity;
(2) Money paid or property distributed by a covered expatriate, or distributed from a non-electing foreign trust that received a covered gift or covered bequest, in satisfaction of a debt or liability of the recipient, regardless of the payee of that payment or distribution;
(3) Property acquired by or on behalf of a recipient pursuant to the exercise, release, or lapse (without regard to the exception in section 2041(b)(2) or 2514(e) of the Code) of a non-covered expatriate's power of appointment granted by a covered expatriate over property not in trust, unless the property previously was subjected to section 2801 tax upon the grant of the power or the covered
expatriate had no more than a non-general power of appointment over that property; and
(4) Property acquired through or from any person not subject to the section 2801 tax that is, in substance, a covered gift or covered bequest from a covered expatriate.
(j)
Power of appointment.
The term
power of appointment
refers to both a general and non-general power of appointment, except as expressly limited to one or the other in a particular provision of the regulations in this part 28. The term
general power of appointment
has the same meaning as in sections 2041(b)(1) and 2514(c). The term
non-general power of appointment
means any power of appointment that is not a general power of appointment. For purposes of section 2801, the term
power of appointment
is defined without regard to the exception in section 2041(b)(2) or 2514(e).
(k)
Section 2801 tax.
The term
section 2801 tax
has the meaning provided in § 28.2801-1(a).
(l)
Section 2801(c) amount.

section 2801(c) amount
is the dollar amount of the per-donee gift tax exclusion in effect under section 2503(b) for that calendar year.
(m)
Statutory references
—(1)
Code.
The term
Code
means the Internal Revenue Code.
(2)
Subtitle B.
The term
subtitle B
means subtitle B of the Code.
(n)
Applicability date.
This section applies to covered gifts or covered bequests received on or after January 1, 2025.
§ 28.2801-3
Rules and exceptions applicable to covered gifts and covered bequests.
(a)
Covered gift.
Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, the term
gift
as used in the definition of
covered gift
in § 28.2801-2(g) has the same meaning as in chapter 12 of subtitle B, but without regard to the exceptions in section 2501(a)(2), (4), and (5) of the Code, the per-donee exclusion under section 2503(b) of the Code for certain transfers of a present interest, the exclusion under section 2503(e) for certain educational or medical expenses, and the waiver of certain pension rights under section 2503(f).
(b)
Covered bequest.
Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, property acquired
by reason of the death of a covered expatriate
(one of the types of transfers defined as a covered bequest in § 28.2801-2(f)) includes any property that would have been includible in the gross estate of the covered expatriate under chapter 11 of subtitle B if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen at the time of death. Therefore, property acquired by reason of a covered expatriate's death includes, without limitation, property or an interest in property acquired by reason of a covered expatriate's death—
(1) By bequest, devise, trust provision, beneficiary designation, or other contractual arrangement, or by operation of law, to the extent the property would have been includible in the covered expatriate's gross estate if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen at death;
(2) That was transferred by the covered expatriate during life, either before or after expatriation, and that would have been includible in the covered expatriate's gross estate under section 2036, 2037, or 2038 of the Code had the covered expatriate been a U.S. citizen at death;
(3) That was received for the benefit of a covered expatriate from such covered expatriate's spouse, or predeceased spouse, for which a valid qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) election was made on such spouse's, or predeceased spouse's, Form 709,
United States Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return,
Form 709-NA,
United States Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return of Nonresident Not a Citizen of the United States,
Form 706,
United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return,
or Form 706-NA,
United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return, Estate of nonresident not a citizen of the United States,
which would have been includible in the covered expatriate's gross estate under section 2044 of the Code if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen at death; or
(4) That otherwise passed from the covered expatriate by reason of his or her death, such as—
(i) Property held by the covered expatriate and another person as joint tenants with right of survivorship or as tenants by the entirety, but only to the extent such property would have been includible in the covered expatriate's gross estate under section 2040 of the Code if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen at death;
(ii) Any annuity or other payment that would have been includible in the covered expatriate's gross estate if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen at death;
(iii) Property subject to a general power of appointment held by the covered expatriate at death that would have been includible in the covered expatriate's gross estate under section 2041 if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen at death; or
(iv) Life insurance proceeds payable upon the covered expatriate's death that would have been includible in the covered expatriate's gross estate under section 2042 of the Code if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen at death.
(c)
Exceptions to covered gift and covered bequest.
Notwithstanding the definitions of
covered gift
and
covered bequest
in § 28.2801-2(f) and (g), respectively, as further described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the terms
covered gift
and
covered bequest
do not include property described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section.
(1)
Reported taxable gifts.
Property transferred as a taxable gift under section 2503(a) that is reported on the donor's timely filed Form 709 or Form 709-NA is not a covered gift. However, property excluded from the definition of a taxable gift, such as a present interest not in excess of the annual exclusion amount under section 2503(b), is not excluded from the definition of a covered gift under this paragraph (c)(1) even if reported on the donor's Form 709 or Form 709-NA.
(2)
Property reported as subject to estate tax.
Property that is includible in the gross estate of the covered expatriate and is reported on a timely filed Form 706, Form 706-NA, or Form 706-QDT,
U.S. Estate Tax Return for Qualified Domestic Trusts,
or any successor form, is not a covered bequest. Thus, if the covered expatriate's gross estate is not of sufficient value to require the filing of a Form 706-NA, for example, and no Form 706-NA is timely filed, the property passing from that covered expatriate is not excluded from the definition of a covered bequest under the rule of this paragraph (c)(2). Further, this exclusion does not apply to the property not reported on such a form, whether or not subject to United States estate tax (that is, non-U.S. situs property that passes to U.S. citizens or residents).
(3)
Covered bequest previously subject to section 2801 tax as a covered gift.
If a covered bequest from a covered expatriate previously constituted a covered gift from that covered expatriate (for example, because of a retained power or right described in section 2036), the property is a covered bequest only to the extent that the value of the covered bequest exceeds the value of the covered gift that was subject to section 2801.
(4)
Transfers to charity.
A gift to a donee described in section 2522(b) of the Code or a bequest to a beneficiary described in section 2055(a) of the Code is not a covered gift or covered bequest to the extent a charitable deduction under section 2522 or 2055 would have been allowed if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen at the time of the transfer.
(5)
Transfers to spouse.
Property transferred from a covered expatriate to the covered expatriate's spouse generally is not a covered gift or covered bequest to the extent a marital deduction under section 2523 or 2056 of the Code would have been allowed if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen at the time of the transfer. To the extent that a gift or bequest of property to a trust (or to a separate share of the trust) would qualify for the marital deduction, the property transferred in the gift or bequest is not a covered gift or covered bequest. To the extent the gift or bequest of property to the trust (or to a separate share of the trust) would not qualify for the marital deduction, the property transferred in the gift or bequest is a covered gift or covered bequest to the trust, and in the case of a non-electing foreign trust, distributions attributable to such gift or bequest will subject the U.S. citizen
or resident spouse receiving such distributions to the section 2801 tax.
See
§§ 28.2801-4(a)(3) and 28.2801-5(a). For qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) described in section 2056(b)(7) and for property in a qualified domestic trust (QDOT) described in section 2056A of the Code, a valid QTIP and/or QDOT election must be made by the covered expatriate or covered expatriate's estate in order for the gift or bequest of such property to qualify for the marital exclusion under section 2801(e)(3), and, thus not be a covered gift or covered bequest under this paragraph (c)(5). Such an election can be made only with respect to the transfer of property subject to gift or estate tax under section 2511(a) or 2103 of the Code. Furthermore, to exclude from covered bequests property in a QDOT for the benefit of a covered expatriate, funded pursuant to a bequest by the covered expatriate's predeceased spouse who also was a covered expatriate, a valid QDOT election must have been made in the predeceased covered expatriate's estate.
(6)
Qualified disclaimers.
Property transferred pursuant to a covered expatriate's qualified disclaimer, as defined in section 2518(b) of the Code, is not a covered gift or covered bequest from that covered expatriate.
(d)
Covered gifts and covered bequests made in trust.
For transfers of property to a trust that are covered gifts or covered bequests as described in §§ 28.2801-2 and 28.2801-3, the property is treated as a covered gift or covered bequest to the trust without regard to the beneficial interests in the trust or whether any person has a general power of appointment or a power of withdrawal over trust property. Accordingly, the rules in section 2801(e)(4) and § 28.2801-4(a) apply to determine liability for payment of the section 2801 tax. The U.S. recipient of a covered gift or a covered bequest made to a domestic trust or to an electing foreign trust is the domestic or electing foreign trust, and the U.S. recipient of a covered gift or a covered bequest made to a non-electing foreign trust is each U.S. citizen or resident receiving a distribution from the non-electing foreign trust (without regard to whether that distribution is or is not pursuant to the exercise or release of a general power of appointment).
See
§ 28.2801-2(e) for the definition of a U.S. recipient.
(e)
Powers of appointment
—(1)
Covered expatriate as holder of power.
The exercise or release of a general power of appointment held by a covered expatriate over property, whether or not in trust (even if that covered expatriate was a U.S. citizen or resident when the general power of appointment was granted), for the benefit of a U.S. citizen or resident is a covered gift or covered bequest. For this purpose, the lapse of a general power of appointment held by a covered expatriate is treated as a release to the extent provided in sections 2041(b)(2) and 2514(e) of the Code. Furthermore, the exercise of a power of appointment by a covered expatriate that creates another power of appointment as described in section 2041(a)(3) or 2514(d) for the benefit of a U.S. citizen or resident is a covered gift or a covered bequest.
(2)
Covered expatriate as grantor of power.
The grant by a covered expatriate to an individual who is a U.S. citizen or resident of a general power of appointment over property not held in trust is a covered gift or covered bequest to the powerholder. For the rule applying to the grant by a covered expatriate of a general power of appointment over property in trust, see paragraph (d) of this section.
(f)
Examples.
The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples:
(1)
Example 1: Transfer to spouse.
In Year 1, CE, a covered expatriate domiciled in Country F, a foreign country with which the United States does not have a gift tax treaty, gives $300,000 cash to his wife, W, a U.S. resident and citizen of Country F. Under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the $100,000 exclusion for a noncitizen spouse, as indexed for inflation in Year 1, is excluded from the definition of a covered gift under section 2801 because only that amount of the transfer would have qualified for the gift tax marital deduction if CE had been a U.S. citizen at the time of the gift.
See
sections 2801(e)(3), 2523(i), and 2503(b). The remaining amount ($300,000, less the $100,000 exclusion for a noncitizen spouse, as indexed for inflation) is a covered gift from CE to W.
W must timely file Form 708,
United States Return of Tax for Gifts and Bequests Received from Covered Expatriates,
and timely pay the tax. See §§ 28.6011-1(a), 28.6071-1(a), and 28.6151-1(a). W also must report the transfer on Form 3520,
Annual Return to Report Transactions With Foreign Trusts and Receipt of Certain Foreign Gifts,
and any other required form.
See
§ 28.2801-6(c)(1).
(2)
Example 2: Reporting property as subject to estate tax
—(i)
Year 1.
CE, a covered expatriate domiciled in Country F, a foreign country with which the United States does not have an estate tax treaty, owns a condominium in the United States with son, S, a U.S. citizen. CE and S each contributed their actuarial share of the purchase price when purchasing the condominium and own it as joint tenants with rights of survivorship. On December 14, Year 1, CE dies. At the time of CE's death, the fair market value of CE's share of the condominium, $250,000, is included in CE's gross estate under sections 2040 and 2103.
(ii)
Year 2.
On September 14 of the following calendar year, Year 2, the executor of CE's estate timely files a Form 4768,
Application for Extension of Time to File a Return and/or Pay U.S. Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Taxes,
requesting a 6-month extension of time to file Form 706-NA, and a 1-year extension of time to pay the estate tax. The Internal Revenue Service grants both extensions, but CE's executor fails to file the Form 706-NA until after March 14 of Year 3.
(iii)
Analysis.
S learns that the executor of CE's estate did not timely file Form 706-NA. CE's estate remains liable for estate tax on CE's interest in the condominium. In addition, because CE is a covered expatriate and CE's estate failed to timely file the tax return reporting the transaction, S received a covered bequest as defined in § 28.2801-2(f) and paragraph (b) of this section and must timely file Form 708 and pay the section 2801 tax. See §§ 28.6011-1(a), 28.6071-1(a), and 28.6151-1(a). S also must file Form 3520 to report a large gift or bequest from a foreign person and any other required form.
See
§ 28.2801-6(c)(1).
(3)
Example 3: Covered gift in trust with grant of general power of appointment over trust property
—(i)
Facts.
On October 20, Year 1, CE, a covered expatriate domiciled in Country F, a foreign country with which the United States does not have a gift tax treaty, transfers $500,000 in cash from an account in Country F to an irrevocable foreign trust created on that same date. The foreign trust does not elect to be treated as a domestic trust for purposes of section 2801. Under section 2511(a), no gift tax is imposed on the transfer and thus, CE is not required to file a U.S. gift tax return. Under the terms of the foreign trust, A, CE's child and a U.S. resident, and Q, A's child and a U.S. citizen, may receive discretionary distributions of income and principal during life. At A's death, the assets remaining in the foreign trust will be distributed to B, CE's other U.S. resident child, or if B is not living at the time of A's death, then to CE's then-living issue, per stirpes. The terms of the foreign trust also allow A to appoint trust principal and/or income to A, A's estate, A's creditors, the creditors of A's estate, or A's issue at any time. On March 5, Year 2, A exercises this power to appoint and causes the trustee to distribute $100,000 to Q.
(ii)
Effects on Q.
On October 20, Year 1, the irrevocable, non-electing foreign trust receives a covered gift for purposes of section 2801, but no section 2801 tax is imposed at that time. On March 5, Year 2, when Q receives $100,000 from the irrevocable foreign trust pursuant to the exercise of A's power of appointment, Q receives a distribution attributable to a covered gift and section 2801 tax is imposed on Q.
See
§ 28.2801-4(d)(5). Q must timely file Form 708 to report the covered gift from a foreign person (specifically, from CE).
See
section 6039F(a) and §§ 28.6011-1(a), 28.6071-1(a), and 28.6151-1(a). Furthermore, because the $100,000 is being distributed from a foreign trust, Q must report the gift on a Form 3520 as a distribution from a foreign trust.
See
§ 28.2801-6(c)(2).
(iii)
Effects on A.
Although A has no section 2801 reporting requirement, under section 2501, A makes a taxable gift to Q of $100,000 when A exercises the general power of appointment for Q's benefit.
See
section 2514(b). Accordingly, A must report A's $100,000 gift to
Q on a timely filed Form 709.
See
section 6019. Because A is considered the transferor of the $100,000 for gift and GST tax purposes, the distribution to Q is not a generation-skipping transfer under chapter 13.
See
§ 26.2652-1(a)(1) of this chapter.
(4)
Example 4: Lapse of power of appointment held by covered expatriate.
A, a U.S. citizen, creates an irrevocable domestic trust for the benefit of A's issue, CE, and CE's children. CE is a covered expatriate, but CE's children are U.S. citizens. CE has the right to withdraw $5,000 in each year in which A makes a contribution to the trust, but the withdrawal right lapses 30 days after the date of the contribution. In Year 1, A funds the trust, but CE fails to exercise CE's right to withdraw $5,000 within 30 days of the contribution. The $5,000 lapse is not considered to be a release of the power by CE, so it is neither a gift for U.S. gift tax purposes, nor a covered gift for purposes of section 2801 under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(5)
Example 5: Property subject to section 2801 tax as a covered gift and as a covered bequest.
F, a CE, transfers an income interest in property to A, a U.S. citizen, while retaining the remainder interest. F was not required to, and did not, file a gift tax return. Upon F's death, A receives full title to the property. The initial transfer of the income interest was a covered gift valued at $1,000,000, upon which A paid the section 2801 tax. The value of the property at F's death is $4,500,000. Because the full value of the property would have been included in F's gross estate if F had died as a U.S. citizen, there is a covered bequest at F's death. The covered bequest is subject to section 2801 tax on the excess of the value of the covered bequest over the value of the covered gift ($4,500,000 minus $1,000,000), or $3,500,000.
(g)
Applicability date.
This section applies to covered gifts or covered bequests received on or after January 1, 2025.
§ 28.2801-4
Liability for and payment of tax on covered gifts and covered bequests; computation of tax.
(a)
Liability for tax
—(1)
U.S. citizen or resident.
A U.S. citizen or resident who receives a covered gift or covered bequest is liable for payment of the section 2801 tax.
(2)
Domestic trust
—(i)
In general.
A domestic trust that receives a covered gift or covered bequest is treated as a U.S. citizen and is liable for payment of the section 2801 tax.
See
section 2801(e)(4)(A)(i) and § 28.2801-2(b).
(ii)
Generation-skipping transfer tax.
A trust's payment of the section 2801 tax does not result in a taxable distribution under section 2621 of the Code to any trust beneficiary for purposes of the generation-skipping transfer tax to the extent that the trust, rather than the beneficiary, is liable for the section 2801 tax.
(iii) [Reserved].
(iv)
Migrated foreign trust.
A non-electing foreign trust that has previously received a covered gift or covered bequest and that subsequently becomes a domestic trust as defined under section 7701(a)(30)(E) of the Code (migrated foreign trust), must file a timely Form 708,
United States Return of Tax for Gifts and Bequests Received from Covered Expatriates,
for the taxable year in which the trust becomes a domestic trust. The section 2801 tax, if any, must be paid by the due date of that Form 708. On that Form 708, the section 2801 tax is calculated in the same manner as if such trust were making an election under § 28.2801-5(d) to be treated as a domestic trust solely for purposes of the section 2801 tax. Accordingly, the trustee must report and pay the section 2801 tax on all covered gifts and covered bequests received by the trust during the year in which the trust becomes a domestic trust, as well as on the portion of the trust's value at the end of the year preceding the year in which the trust becomes a domestic trust that is attributable to all prior covered gifts and covered bequests. Because the migrated foreign trust will be treated for purposes of section 2801 as a domestic trust for the entire year during which it became a domestic trust, distributions made to U.S. citizens or residents during that year but before the date on which the trust became a domestic trust will not be subject to section 2801.
(3)
Foreign trust
—(i)
In general.
A foreign trust that receives a covered gift
or covered bequest is not liable for payment of the section 2801 tax unless the trust makes an election to be treated as a domestic trust solely for purposes of section 2801 as provided in § 28.2801-5(d). Absent such an election, each U.S. recipient is liable for payment of the section 2801 tax on that person's receipt, either directly or indirectly, of a distribution from the foreign trust to the extent that the distribution is attributable to a covered gift or covered bequest made to the foreign trust.
See
§ 28.2801-5(b) and (c) regarding distributions from non-electing foreign trusts.
(ii)
Income tax deduction.
The U.S. recipient of a distribution from a non-electing foreign trust is allowed a deduction against income tax under section 164 in the calendar year in which the U.S. recipient paid or accrued the section 2801 tax. Thus, for cash method taxpayers, the calendar year in which the payment of the section 2801 tax occurs is later than the year in which the distribution is received and becomes subject to income tax. The amount of the deduction is equal to the portion of the section 2801 tax attributable to such distribution, but only to the extent that portion of the distribution is included in the U.S. recipient's gross income (which, for this purpose, also includes accumulation distributions under section 665(b)). The amount of the deduction allowed under section 164 is calculated as follows:
(A) First, the U.S. recipient must determine the total amount of distribution(s) from all non-electing foreign trusts treated as covered gifts and covered bequests received by that U.S. recipient during the calendar year to which the section 2801 tax payment relates.
(B) Second, of the amount determined in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, the U.S. recipient must determine the amount that also is included in the U.S. recipient's gross income for that calendar year. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B), distributions from non-electing foreign trusts included in the U.S. recipient's gross income are deemed first to consist of the portion of those distributions, if any, that are attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests.
(C) Finally, the U.S. recipient must determine the portion of the section 2801 tax paid for that calendar year that is attributable to the amount determined in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, the covered gifts and covered bequests received from non-electing foreign trusts that also are included in the U.S. recipient's gross income. This amount is the allowable deduction. Thus, for a calendar year taxpayer, the deduction is determined by multiplying the section 2801 tax paid during the calendar year by the ratio of the amount determined in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section to the total covered gifts and covered bequests received by the U.S. recipient during the calendar year to which that tax payment relates (that is, 2801 tax liability x [non-electing foreign trust distributions attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests that are also included in gross income/total covered gifts or covered bequests received]).
(b)
Computation of tax
—(1)
In general.
The section 2801 tax is computed by multiplying the net covered gifts and covered bequests (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) received by a U.S. recipient during the calendar year by the highest rate of estate tax under section 2001(c) in effect for that calendar year. See paragraph (f)(1) of this section (
Example 1
).
(2)
Net covered gifts and covered bequests.
The net covered gifts and covered bequests received by a U.S. recipient during the calendar year is the total value of all covered gifts and covered bequests received by that U.S. recipient during the calendar year, less the section 2801(c) amount, which is the dollar amount of the per-donee exclusion in effect under section 2503(b) for that calendar year. The total value of all covered gifts and covered bequests received by a U.S. recipient during the calendar year includes distributions made from a non-electing foreign trust to the extent the distributions are attributable to covered gifts or covered bequests made to the foreign trust on or after June 17, 2008.
(c)
Value of covered gift or covered bequest.
The value of a covered gift or covered bequest is the fair market value of the property as of the date of its receipt by the U.S. recipient. See
paragraph (d) of this section regarding the determination of the date of receipt. As in the case of chapters 11 and 12, the fair market value of a covered gift or covered bequest is the price, as of the date of receipt, at which such property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. The fair market value of a covered gift is determined in accordance with the Federal gift tax valuation principles of section 2512 and chapter 14 and the corresponding regulations. The fair market value of a covered bequest is determined by applying the Federal estate tax valuation principles of section 2031 and chapter 14, to the extent applicable, and the corresponding regulations, but without regard to sections 2032 and 2032A.
(d)
Date of receipt
—(1)
In general.
The section 2801 tax is imposed upon the receipt of a covered gift or covered bequest by a U.S. recipient.
(2)
Covered gift.
The date of receipt of a covered gift is the same as the date of the gift for purposes of chapter 12 of subtitle B as if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen at the time of the transfer (subject to the other provisions of this paragraph (d)). For example, for a gift of stock, if the covered expatriate delivers a properly endorsed stock certificate to the U.S. recipient, the date of delivery is the date of receipt for purposes of this section. Alternatively, if the covered expatriate delivers the stock certificate to the issuing corporation or its transfer agent in order to transfer title to the U.S. recipient, the date of receipt is the date the stock is transferred on the books of the corporation. However, for an asset or property interest subject to a claim of right of another involving a bona fide dispute, the date of receipt is the date on which such claim is extinguished.
(3)
Covered bequest.
The date of receipt of a covered bequest is the date of distribution from the estate or the decedent's revocable trust rather than the date of death of the covered expatriate (subject to the other provisions of this subparagraph (d)). However, the date of receipt for property passing on the death of the covered expatriate by operation of law, or by beneficiary designation or other contractual agreement, is the date of death of the covered expatriate. Notwithstanding the previous sentences, for an asset subject to a claim of right of another involving a bona fide dispute, the date of receipt is the date on which such claim is extinguished.
(4)
Domestic trusts and electing foreign trusts.
The U.S. recipient of a covered gift or covered bequest made to a domestic trust or an electing foreign trust is the trust. For a lifetime transfer of assets by a covered expatriate to a domestic trust or an electing foreign trust, the date of receipt of the covered gift is the date of the gift for purposes of chapter 12 of subtitle B, determined as if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen at the time of the transfer. For example, in the event of a transfer by a covered expatriate to a revocable trust, the date of receipt is the later of the date the right to revoke the trust is relinquished or extinguished and the date when all powers over or interests in the trust (if any) that would prevent the transfer from being a completed transfer for gift tax purposes (determined as if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen) are extinguished. Similarly, in the event of a transfer by a covered expatriate to an irrevocable domestic trust or electing foreign trust over or in which the covered expatriate retains powers or interests that would prevent the transfer from being a completed gift for gift tax purposes (determined as if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen), the date of receipt by the trust is the date all such powers or interests are extinguished. Additionally, if before the relinquishment of the right to revoke the trust or relinquishment of some other powers or interests that would render the gift incomplete (determined as if the covered expatriate had been a U.S. citizen), such trust distributes property to a U.S. recipient not in discharge of a support or other obligation of the donor, then the U.S. recipient of that distribution receives a covered gift on the date of that distribution.
(5)
Non-electing foreign trusts.
A U.S. citizen or resident is treated as receiving a covered gift or covered bequest on
the date that person receives a distribution from a non-electing foreign trust attributable to a covered gift or covered bequest that was received by the trust. The date of such a receipt by a U.S. citizen or resident is the date of each distribution from the non-electing foreign trust. In the event of a sale, encumbrance, monetization, or other disposition of a U.S. recipient's interest in a non-electing foreign trust, the date of receipt is the date of such sale, encumbrance, monetization, or other disposition of the interest.
(6)
Powers of appointment
—(i)
Covered expatriate as holder of power.
In the case of the exercise, release, or lapse of a power of appointment held by a covered expatriate that is a covered gift pursuant to § 28.2801-3(e)(1), the date of receipt is the date of the exercise, release, or lapse of the power. In the case of the exercise, release, or lapse of a power of appointment held by a covered expatriate that is a covered bequest pursuant to § 28.2801-3(e)(1), the date of receipt is the date the property subject to the power is distributed from the decedent's estate or any trust if the power of appointment is over property in such estate or trust, or the date of the covered expatriate's death if the power of appointment is over property passing on the covered expatriate's death by operation of law, or by beneficiary designation, or other contractual agreement.
(ii)
Covered expatriate as grantor of power.
The date of receipt of property subject to a general power of appointment granted by a covered expatriate to a U.S. citizen or resident over property not transferred in trust that constitutes a covered gift or covered bequest pursuant to § 28.2801-3(e)(2) is the first date on which both the general power of appointment is exercisable by the U.S. citizen or resident and the property subject to the general power of appointment has been irrevocably transferred by the covered expatriate. The date of receipt of property subject to a general power of appointment over property in a domestic trust or an electing foreign trust is determined in accordance with paragraphs (d)(2) through (4) of this section, and over property in a non-electing foreign trust is determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(5) of this section. See § 28.2801-3(d) for the rule applying to covered gifts and covered bequests made in trust.
(7)
Indirect receipts.
The date of receipt by a U.S. recipient of a covered gift or covered bequest received indirectly from a covered expatriate is the date of its receipt, as determined under this paragraph (d), by the U.S. citizen or resident who is the first recipient of that property from the covered expatriate to be subject to section 2801 with regard to that property. For example, the date of receipt of property subject to a non-general power of appointment over property not held in trust given by a covered expatriate to a foreign person (other than another covered expatriate) is the date that property is received by the U.S. recipient in whose favor the power was exercised. Further, the date of receipt of property received through one or more entities not subject to section 2801 is the date of its receipt by the U.S. recipient from a conduit entity.
(8)
Future interest in property not in trust
—(i)
Date of receipt.
The date of receipt by a U.S. recipient (including a domestic trust or an electing foreign trust) of a future interest in property not held in trust is the earlier of the date such interest may be transferred by the U.S. recipient and the date that is the later of the date that such interest vests in the U.S. recipient or the date that the last intervening interest in the property is extinguished. For this purpose, a transfer includes a sale, encumbering, monetization, or other disposition of the interest.
(ii)
Date-of-receipt election for future interest in property not in trust.
A U.S. recipient of a covered gift or covered bequest that is a future interest in property not held in trust instead may elect to treat the date of receipt as the date of the donor's transfer of that future interest in the event of a covered gift, or as the date of death of the covered expatriate in the event of a covered bequest. Such an election will be made on Form 708 for the year in which this elective date of receipt occurs, in accordance with the instructions for such form.
(e)
Reduction of tax for foreign gift or estate tax paid
—(1)
In general.
The section 2801 tax is reduced by the amount of any gift or estate tax paid to a foreign country with respect to the covered gift or covered bequest. For this purpose, the term
foreign country
includes territories and political subdivisions of foreign states. However, no reduction is allowable for interest and penalties paid in connection with those foreign taxes. To claim the reduction of section 2801 tax, the U.S. recipient must attach to the Form 708 a copy of the foreign gift or estate tax return and a copy of the receipt or cancelled check for payment of the foreign gift or estate tax. The U.S. recipient also must report on an attachment to the Form 708:
(i) The amount of foreign gift or estate tax paid with respect to each covered gift or covered bequest and the amount and date of each payment thereof;
(ii) A description and the value of the property with respect to which such taxes were imposed;
(iii) Whether any refund of part or all of the foreign gift or estate tax has been or will be claimed or allowed, and the amount of such refund; and
(iv) All other information necessary for the verification and computation of the amount of the reduction of section 2801 tax.
(2)
Protective claim for refund.
A protective claim for refund under this section may be filed to preserve the U.S. recipient's right to claim a refund in the event any gift or estate tax with respect to the covered gift or covered bequest is owed but not yet paid to a foreign country until after the expiration of the period of limitation for filing a claim for refund. Such a protective claim may be filed at any time before the expiration of the period of limitation prescribed in section 6511(a) for the filing of a claim for refund and shall be made in accordance with the usual procedures for filing a claim for refund.
See https://www.irs.gov
and Form 843,
Claim for Refund and Request for Abatement,
and its instructions. Action on a protective claim will proceed after the U.S. recipient has notified the Internal Revenue Service within a reasonable period that the gift or estate tax with respect to the covered gift or covered bequest has been paid to a foreign country.
(f)
Examples.
The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples.
(1)
Example 1: Computation of tax.
In Year 1, A, a U.S. citizen, receives a $50,000 covered gift from B and an $80,000 covered bequest from C. Both B and C are covered expatriates. In Year 1, the highest estate tax rate is 40 percent and the section 2801(c) amount is $16,000. A's section 2801 tax for Year 1 is computed by multiplying A's net covered gifts and covered bequests by 40 percent. A's net covered gifts and covered bequests for Year 1 are $114,000, which is determined by reducing A's total covered gifts and covered bequests received during Year 1, $130,000 ($50,000 + $80,000), by the section 2801(c) amount of $16,000. A's section 2801 tax liability then is reduced by any foreign gift or estate tax paid under paragraph (e) of this section. Assuming A, B, and C paid no foreign gift or estate tax on the transfers, A's section 2801 tax liability for Year 1 is $45,600 ($114,000 × 0.4).
(2)
Example 2: Deduction of section 2801 tax for income tax purposes.
In Year 1, B receives a covered bequest of $25,000. Also in Year 1, B receives an aggregate $500,000 of distributions from a non-electing foreign trust of which $100,000 was attributable to a covered gift. In Year 1, the highest estate and gift tax rate is 40 percent and the section 2801(c) amount is $16,000. Based on information provided by the trustee of the non-electing foreign trust, B includes $50,000 of the aggregate distributions from the non-electing foreign trust in B's gross income for Year 1. Under paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, B (a cash basis taxpayer) is entitled to an income tax deduction under section 164 for the calendar year in which the section 2801 tax is paid. In Year 2, B timely reports the distributions from the non-electing foreign trust and pays $43,600 in section 2801 tax (($125,000−$16,000) × 0.4). In Year 2, B is entitled to an income tax deduction because B paid the section 2801 tax in Year 2 on the Year 1 covered gift and covered bequest. B's Year 2 income tax deduction is computed as follows:
(i) $100,000 of B's total covered gifts and covered bequests of $125,000 received in Year 1 consisted of the portion of the distributions from the non-electing foreign trust attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests received by the trust. See paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.
(ii) $50,000 of the $500,000 of trust distributions were includible in B's gross income for Year 1. This amount is deemed to consist first of distributions subject to the section 2801 tax ($100,000). Thus, the entire amount included in B's gross income ($50,000) also is subject to the section 2801 tax, and is used in the numerator to determine the income tax deduction available to B. See paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
(iii) The portion of B's section 2801 tax liability attributable to distributions from a non-electing foreign trust that are both covered gifts or covered bequests and includible in B's taxable income is $17,440 ($43,600 × ($50,000/$125,000)). Therefore, B's deduction under section 164 is $17,440. See paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(C) of this section.

Example 3: Date of receipt; bona fide claim.
On October 10, Year 1, CE, a covered expatriate, died testate as a resident of Country F, a foreign country with which the United States does not have an estate tax treaty. CE designated his son, S, as the beneficiary of CE's retirement account. S is a U.S. citizen. CE's wife, W, who is a citizen and resident of Country F, elects to take her elective share of CE's estate under local law. S contests whether the retirement account is property subject to the elective share. S and W agree to settle their respective claims by dividing CE's assets equally between them. On December 15 of Year 2, Country F's court enters an order accepting the terms of the settlement agreement and dismissing the case. Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, S received a covered bequest of one-half of CE's retirement account on December 15, Year 2, when W's claim of right was extinguished.

Applicability date.
This section applies to covered gifts or covered bequests received on or after January 1, 2025.
§ 28.2801-5
Foreign trusts.
(a)
In general.
The section 2801 tax is imposed on a U.S. recipient who receives distributions, whether of income or principal, from a non-electing foreign trust to the extent the distributions are attributable to one or more covered gifts or covered bequests made to that foreign trust. See paragraph (d) of this section regarding a foreign trust's election to be treated as a domestic trust for purposes of section 2801.
(b)
Distribution defined.
For purposes of determining whether a U.S. recipient has received a distribution from a non-electing foreign trust, the term
distribution
means any direct, indirect, or constructive transfer from a non-electing foreign trust, including a transfer to the extent made for less than full and adequate consideration in money or money's worth. Although section 643(i) of the Code does not apply for the purpose of defining a distribution under this section, certain loans from or uncompensated use of property held by a non-electing foreign trust nevertheless may satisfy the definition of a distribution under this paragraph if the loan or use of trust property would be a gift as defined for purposes of chapter 12 of subtitle B. For purposes of determining whether a U.S. recipient has received a distribution from a non-electing foreign trust, the term
distribution
also includes each distribution from a non-electing foreign trust pursuant to the exercise, release, or lapse (without regard to the exception in section 2041(b)(2) or 2514(e) of the Code) of a power of appointment, whether or not such power is a general power of appointment. In addition, the term
distribution
also includes the domestication of a foreign trust, and any sale, encumbering, monetization, or other disposition by the U.S. recipient of the recipient's interest in the trust to the extent of that disposition.
See
§ 28.2801-4(a)(2)(iv). The determination of whether a U.S. recipient has received a distribution is made without regard to whether any portion of the non-electing foreign trust is treated as owned by the U.S. recipient or any other person under subpart E of part I, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Code (pertaining to grantors and others
treated as substantial owners), and without regard to whether the U.S. recipient of the transfer is designated as a beneficiary by the terms of the trust. A U.S. recipient receiving a distribution for purposes of this section must determine whether the information reporting requirements of section 6048(c) apply.
See
§ 28.2801-6(c)(2).
(c)
Amount of distribution attributable to covered gift or covered bequest
—(1)
Section 2801 ratio
—(i)
In general.
A foreign trust may have received covered gifts and covered bequests as well as contributions that were not covered gifts or covered bequests. Under such circumstances, the fair market value of the foreign trust at any time consists, in part, of a portion of the trust attributable to the covered gifts and covered bequests it has received (covered portion) and in part of a portion of the trust attributable to other contributions (non-covered portion). The covered portion of the trust includes the ratable portion of appreciation and income that has accrued on the foreign trust's assets from the date of the contribution of the covered gifts and covered bequests to the foreign trust. For purposes of section 2801, the amount of each distribution from the foreign trust, whether made from the income or principal of the trust, that is considered attributable to the foreign trust's covered gifts and covered bequests is determined on a proportional basis, by reference to the section 2801 ratio (as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section), and not by the identification or tracing of particular trust assets. Specifically, this portion of each distribution is determined by multiplying the distributed amount by the percentage of the trust that consists of its covered portion immediately prior to that distribution (section 2801 ratio). Thus, for example, the section 2801 ratio of a foreign trust whose assets are comprised exclusively of covered gifts or covered bequests and the income and appreciation thereon, would be one and the full amount of each distribution from that foreign trust to a U.S. citizen or resident would be attributable to the foreign trust's covered gifts and covered bequests and subject to the imposition of section 2801 tax. Because the non-electing foreign trust itself is not taxed on its receipt of covered gifts and covered bequests, the trust is not entitled to an annual exclusion pursuant to section 2801(c); that exclusion is available only in computing the section 2801 tax payable by the U.S. recipient filing a Form 708,
United States Return of Tax for Gifts and Bequests Received from Covered Expatriates.
(ii)
Computation.
The section 2801 ratio, which must be redetermined after each contribution to the foreign trust, is computed by using the following fraction:
ER14JA25.001
Where,
X = The value of the trust attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests, if any, immediately before the contribution (pre-contribution value); this value is determined by multiplying the fair market value of the trust assets immediately prior to the contribution by the section 2801 ratio in effect immediately prior to the current contribution. This amount will be zero for all years prior to the year in which the foreign trust receives its first covered gift or covered bequest;
Y = The portion, if any, of the fair market value of the current contribution that constitutes a covered gift or covered bequest; and
Z = The fair market value of the trust immediately after the current contribution. See paragraph (e)(1) of this section (
Example 1
), for an illustration of this computation.
(2)
Effect of reported transfer and tax payment.
With regard to the value of property on which a section 2801 tax has been timely paid, even though that property thereafter remains in a non-electing foreign trust, that value no longer is considered to be, or to be attributable to, a covered gift or covered
bequest to that foreign trust for purposes of the computation described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. For purposes of the prior sentence, a section 2801 tax is deemed to have been timely paid on amounts for which no section 2801 tax was due, provided those amounts were reported as a covered gift or covered bequest on a timely filed Form 708 or the total covered gifts and covered bequests received in a calendar year do not exceed the section 2801(c) amount. An amount for which no section 2801 tax was due refers to the amount of a covered gift or covered bequest received by an electing foreign trust not in excess of the section 2801(c) amount.
See
§ 28.2801-5(e) (
Example 4
).
(3)
Inadequate information to calculate section 2801 ratio.
A U.S. citizen or resident receiving a distribution from a non-electing foreign trust must proceed upon the assumption that the distribution is attributable to a covered gift or covered bequest to the extent the trustee of the foreign trust does not have sufficient books and records to calculate the section 2801 ratio or the taxpayer is unable to obtain the necessary information regarding the foreign trust to calculate the section 2801 ratio. The assumption is rebuttable to the extent the taxpayer can supply information sufficient to persuade the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that the distribution is not entirely attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests.
(d)
Foreign trust treated as domestic trust
—(1)
Election required.
To be considered an electing foreign trust, so that the foreign trust is treated as a domestic trust solely for purposes of the section 2801 tax, a valid election is required.
(2)
Effect of election
—(i) A valid election subjects the electing foreign trust to the section 2801 tax on all covered gifts and covered bequests received by the foreign trust during that calendar year, the portion of the trust attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests received by the trust in prior years, as determined in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, and all covered gifts and covered bequests received by the foreign trust during calendar years subsequent to the first year in which the election is effective, unless and until the election is terminated. To the extent that covered gifts and covered bequests are subject to the section 2801 tax under the prior sentence, those trust receipts are no longer treated as a covered gift or covered bequest for purposes of determining the portion of the trust attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests. Therefore, upon making a valid election, the foreign trust's section 2801 ratio described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section will be zero until the effective date of any termination of the election and the subsequent receipt of any covered gift or covered bequest, and a distribution made from the foreign trust while this election is in effect is not taxable under section 2801 to the U.S. recipient.
(ii) This election has no effect on any distribution from the foreign trust that was made to a U.S. recipient in a calendar year prior to the calendar year for which the election is made. Thus, even after a valid election is made, a distribution to a U.S. recipient in a calendar year prior to the calendar year for which the election is made that was attributable to one or more covered gifts or covered bequests continues to be a distribution attributable to one or more covered gifts or covered bequests and the section 2801 ratio in place at the time of the distribution continues to apply to that distribution. Furthermore, an election under this section does not relieve the U.S. recipient from the information reporting requirements of section 6048(c).
See
§ 28.2801-6(c)(2).
(3)
Time and manner of making the election
—(i)
When to make the election.
The election is made on a timely filed Form 708 for the calendar year for which the foreign trust seeks to subject itself to the section 2801 tax as described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. The election may be made for a calendar year whether or not the foreign trust received a covered gift or covered bequest during that calendar year.
See
§ 28.6071-1.
(ii)
Requirements for a valid election.
To make a valid election to be treated as a domestic trust for purposes of section 2801, the foreign trust must timely
file a Form 708 and must, on such form—
(A) Make the election, timely pay the section 2801 tax, if any, as determined under paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, and include a computation illustrating how the trustee of the foreign trust calculated both the section 2801 ratio described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section and the section 2801 tax;
(B) Designate and authorize a U.S. agent as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section;
(C) Agree to timely file Form 708 to report each covered gift and bequest made to the trust in accordance with § 28.2801-5(d)(4);
(D) Identify the amount and year of all prior distributions attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests made to a U.S. recipient, and provide the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each U.S. recipient;
(E) Provide a copy of the governing instrument of the trust and provide the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each permissible distributee described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(F) of this section; and
(F) Affirm under penalties of perjury that each permissible distributee was notified that the trustee is making (or has made) the election, effective as of January 1 of the calendar year for which the Form 708 on which the election is made is filed. For this purpose, a permissible distributee is any U.S. citizen or resident who:
(
1
) Currently may or must receive distributions from the trust, whether of income or principal;
(
2
) May withdraw income or principal from the trust during that year or in a future year, regardless of whether the right arises or lapses upon the occurrence of a future event; and
(
3
) Would be described in either or both of paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(F)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section upon an immediate termination of either the trust or the interest of any person described in either or both of paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(F)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section.
(iii)
Section 2801 tax payable with the election.
To make a valid election to be treated as a domestic trust for purposes of section 2801, the electing foreign trust must timely pay the section 2801 tax on all covered gifts and covered bequests received by the electing foreign trust in the calendar year for which the Form 708 is being filed. In some cases, an electing foreign trust may have received covered gifts or covered bequests in prior calendar years during which no such election was in effect. In those cases, the trustee must also, at the same time, report and pay the tax on the fair market value, determined as of the last day of the calendar year immediately preceding the year for which the Form 708 is being filed, of the portion of the trust attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests received by such trust in prior calendar years (except as provided in paragraph (d)(6)(iii) of this section with regard to an imperfect election). That portion is determined by multiplying the fair market value of the trust, as of the December 31 immediately preceding the year for which the election is made, by the section 2801 ratio in effect on that date, as calculated under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. The trustee must proceed upon the assumption that the corpus and undistributed income are attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests to the extent the trustee does not have sufficient books and records to determine what amount of the corpus and undistributed income is attributable to prior covered gifts and covered bequests. The assumption is rebuttable by the taxpayer's furnishing information sufficient to persuade the IRS that corpus and undistributed income is not attributable to prior covered gifts or covered bequests. See paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(iv)
Designation of U.S. agent
—(A)
In general.
The trustee of an electing foreign trust must designate and authorize a U.S. person, as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, to act as an agent for the trust for purposes of section 2801. The designation and authorization are made on a duly filed Form 2848,
Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative,
or as may be directed otherwise in IRS forms or publications. By designating a U.S. agent, the trustee of the trust agrees to provide the agent with all information necessary to comply with any information request or summons issued by the Secretary of the Treasury or her delegate
(Secretary) that is relevant to the collection or determination of tax under section 2801. Such information may include, without limitation, copies of the books and records of the trust, financial statements, and appraisals of trust property.
(B)
Role of designated agent.
Acting as an agent for an electing foreign trust for purposes of section 2801 includes serving as the trust's agent for purposes of section 7602 of the Code (
Examination of books and witnesses
), section 7603 of the Code (
Service of summons
), and section 7604 of the Code (
Enforcement of summons
) with respect to—
(
1
) Any request by the Secretary to examine records or produce testimony related to the proper identification or treatment of covered gifts or covered bequests contributed to the foreign trust and distributions of such contributions and the income therefrom; and
(
2
) Any summons by the Secretary for records or testimony related to the proper identification or treatment of covered gifts or covered bequests contributed to the foreign trust and distributions of such contributions and the income therefrom.
(C)
Effect of appointment of agent.
An electing foreign trust that appoints such an agent is not considered to have an office or a permanent establishment in the United States, or to be engaged in a trade or business in the United States, solely because of the agent's activities as an agent pursuant to this section.
(4)
Filing requirement.
The trustee of an electing foreign trust must timely file a Form 708 to report and pay the section 2801 tax on all covered gifts and covered bequests received by the trust during the calendar year.
See
§ 28.6071-1. Nevertheless, the trustee of an electing foreign trust is not required to file Form 708 for a calendar year in which either the trust received no covered gifts or covered bequests, or the total fair market value of all covered gifts and covered bequests received by the electing foreign trust during that calendar year is less than or equal to the section 2801(c) amount.
(5)
Duration of status as electing foreign trust
—(i)
In general.
A valid election (one that meets all of the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section) is effective as of January 1 of the calendar year for which the Form 708 on which the election is made is filed. The election, once made, applies for all calendar years until the election is terminated as described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Termination
—(A)
Manner of termination.
An election to be treated as a domestic trust for purposes of section 2801 is terminated by—
(
1
) A failure of the foreign trust to timely file a required Form 708 and timely pay the section 2801 tax, as required by paragraph (d)(4) of this section;
(
2
) A failure of the foreign trust to enter into a closing agreement and to timely pay any additional amount of section 2801 tax (in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section) with respect to recalculations described in paragraph (d)(6) of this section (a termination that also results in the conversion of the trust's election to an imperfect election); or
(
3
) An affirmative revocation of the election made in accordance with the instructions for Form 708.
(B)
Effective date of termination.
The effective date of the termination of an election to be treated as a domestic trust for purposes of section 2801 is as follows:
(
1
) For a termination described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section, the termination is effective as of the first day of the calendar year for which the Form 708 was required under paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(
2
) For a termination described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section, the termination is effective as of the first day of the calendar year for which the Form 708 was filed with respect to which the additional amount of section 2801 tax is claimed to be due by the IRS.
(
3
) For a termination described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A)(
3
) of this section, the termination is effective as of the first day of the calendar year for which a Form 708 was filed to affirmatively revoke the election.
(C)
Notice requirements upon termination.
In the case of a termination of the election, the trustee should notify
promptly each permissible distributee of the trust, as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(F) of this section and determined as of the effective date of the termination of the election, that the foreign trust's election was terminated (or terminated and converted to an imperfect election) and the effective date of the termination, and that each U.S. recipient of a distribution made from the foreign trust on or after the effective date of that termination is subject to the section 2801 tax on the portion of each such distribution that is attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests. See paragraph (d)(6)(iii)(B) of this section for an additional notification requirement in the case of an imperfect election.
(iii)
Subsequent elections.
If a foreign trust's election is terminated under paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section, the foreign trust is not prohibited from making another election in a future year, subject to the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(6)
Dispute as to amount of section 2801 tax owed by electing foreign trust
—(i)
Procedure.
If the IRS disputes the value of a covered gift or covered bequest, or otherwise challenges the computation of the section 2801 tax, that is reported on the electing foreign trust's timely filed Form 708 for any calendar year, the IRS will issue a letter (but not a notice of deficiency as defined in section 6212 of the Code) to the trustee of the trust and the appointed U.S. agent that details the disputed information and the proper amount of section 2801 tax as recalculated. The trustee of the foreign trust must pay the additional amount of section 2801 tax including interest and penalties, if any, on or before the due date specified in the letter (or other date agreed to by the IRS) and enter into a closing agreement with the IRS as described in section 7121 to maintain its election.
(ii)
Effect of compliance.
If the trustee of the foreign trust complies with the requirements of paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, then the foreign trust's election to be treated as a domestic trust under paragraph (d) of this section remains in effect. In the absence of fraud, malfeasance, or misrepresentation of a material fact, any value determined in the closing agreement will be deemed to be final and binding on both the IRS and the foreign trust. Subsequently, the IRS will not challenge the amount of section 2801 tax due from either the foreign trust or any of its distributees who are U.S. citizens or residents for the year for which that Form 708 was filed by the foreign trust, except with respect to any covered gifts or covered bequests not reported on that return. In addition, neither the foreign trust nor any of its distributees will be able to file a claim for refund with respect to section 2801 tax paid by the foreign trust on the covered gifts and covered bequests reported on that Form 708.
(iii)
Effect of failing to comply (imperfect election
)—(A)
In general.
If the foreign trust fails to enter into the closing agreement and to timely pay any of the additional amount of section 2801 tax (with interest and penalties, if any) determined to be due by the IRS in accordance with the procedure in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, then the foreign trust's valid election is terminated and is converted to an imperfect election. The conversion to an imperfect election is retroactive to the first day of the calendar year (subject year) for which the Form 708 was filed with respect to which the additional amount of section 2801 tax is claimed to be due by the IRS. The trust will be a non-electing foreign trust for the subject year and for each subsequent year until another valid election (if any) is made by the trust. However, the value the foreign trust reported on the Form 708 for the subject year and each other year during the interim period described in paragraph (d)(6)(iii)(D) of this section, and on which the trust paid the section 2801 tax, is no longer considered to be attributable to covered gifts or covered bequests when computing the section 2801 ratio (described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section) that will be applicable to distributions made by the foreign trust to U.S. recipients during the subject year and thereafter until the effective date of any subsequent election meeting the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The U.S. recipients of distributions from the foreign trust, however, should take into consideration the additional value determined by the IRS,
on which the foreign trust did not timely pay the section 2801 tax, when computing the section 2801 ratio to be applied to a distribution from the trust. See paragraph (c) of this section. Any disagreement with regard to that additional value will be an issue to be resolved as part of the review of that U.S. recipient's own Form 708 reporting a distribution.
(B)
Notice to permissible distributees.
If the trustee of the foreign trust fails to enter into the closing agreement and to remit, by the due date specified or otherwise agreed to by the IRS, the additional section 2801 tax, including all interest and penalties, in accordance with the procedure in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, the trustee should notify promptly each permissible distributee, as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(F) of this section:
(
1
) That the foreign trust's election was terminated and the effective date of the termination (see paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section);
(
2
) Of the amount of additional value on which the foreign trust did not timely pay the section 2801 tax as determined or otherwise agreed to by the IRS, which value the IRS thus deems to be attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests; and
(
3
) That each U.S. recipient of a distribution made from the foreign trust on or after that termination date is subject to the section 2801 tax on the portion of each such distribution attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests.
(C)
Reasonable cause.
If a U.S. recipient received a distribution from the foreign trust on or after January 1 of the year for which the election was terminated and the election became an imperfect election, provided the U.S. recipient files a Form 708 and pays the section 2801 tax within a reasonable period of time after being notified by the trustee of the foreign trust or otherwise becoming aware that a valid election was not in effect when the distribution was made, the U.S. recipient's failure to timely file and pay are due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect for purposes of section 6651. For this purpose, a reasonable period of time is not more than six months after the U.S. recipient is notified by the trustee or otherwise becomes aware that a valid election is not in effect.
(D)
Interim period.
If a foreign trust's valid election is terminated and becomes an imperfect election, there is a period of time (interim period) that begins on the effective date of the termination of the election (see paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B) of this section) during which both the foreign trust and its U.S. beneficiaries are likely to continue to comply with section 2801 as it applies to an electing foreign trust with a valid election in place. The interim period ends on the earlier of December 31 of the calendar year during which the additional amount of section 2801 tax was due to be paid, as described in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, or the effective date of a subsequent valid election to be treated as a domestic trust for purposes of section 2801. As described in paragraph (d)(6)(iii)(A) of this section regarding imperfect elections, the value of the covered gifts and covered bequests received by the foreign trust during this interim period, which the foreign trust has reported on one or more filed Forms 708 and on which the foreign trust has paid the section 2801 tax, is no longer considered to be attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests for purposes of computing the section 2801 ratio described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section as it applies to distributions made by non-electing foreign trusts to their U.S. beneficiaries. In addition, each distribution made by the foreign trust to a U.S. citizen or resident during this interim period must be reported on that U.S. recipient's Form 708 by applying the section 2801 ratio to that distribution. If, once the interim period has ended, the foreign trust has no election in place, the rules of section 2801(e)(4)(B)(i) will apply until the foreign trust subsequently (if ever) makes another valid election to be treated as a domestic trust for purposes of section 2801.
(7)
No overpayment caused solely by virtue of defect in election.
Any remittance of section 2801 tax made by an electing foreign trust does not become an overpayment solely by virtue of a defect in the election. Instead, if at some subsequent time the IRS determines that the election was not in fact a valid
election, then the election shall be considered valid only with respect to the value of the covered gifts or covered bequests on which the section 2801 tax was paid by the foreign trust and such value on which the section 2801 tax has been paid is no longer treated as attributable to a covered gift or covered bequest for purposes of determining the portion of the foreign trust attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests. See paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (6)(iii) of this section.
(e)
Examples.
The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples.
(1)
Example 1: Computation of section 2801 ratio.
A and B each contribute $100,000 to a new foreign trust. A (but not B) is a covered expatriate and A's contribution is a covered gift. The trustee of the trust does not make a valid election to have the trust treated as a domestic trust for purposes of section 2801. The section 2801 ratio immediately after these two contributions is 0.50, computed as follows: the pre-contribution value of the trust ($0) multiplied by the pre-contribution section 2801 ratio (0), plus the current covered gift ($100,000), divided by the post-contribution fair market value of the trust ($200,000).
See
§ 28.2801-5(c). Therefore, 50 percent of each distribution from the trust to a U.S. recipient is subject to the section 2801 tax until the next contribution is made to the trust. If the trustee distributes $40,000 to C, a U.S. citizen, before the trust receives any other contributions, then $20,000 ($40,000 × 0.5) is a covered gift to C.
(2)
Example 2: Distribution to spouse.
In Year 1, A contributes $300,000 to a foreign trust. A is a covered expatriate. B, A's U.S. citizen spouse, and A's issue may receive discretionary distributions of income and principal. The transfer would not have qualified for the gift tax marital deduction if A had been a U.S. citizen or resident at the time of the gift; therefore, A's contribution is a covered gift.
See
sections 2801(e)(3) and 2523. No one pays foreign gift taxes on A's contribution. The trustee of the trust does not make a valid election to have the trust treated as a domestic trust for purposes of section 2801. The section 2801 ratio immediately after A's contribution is one. The highest gift tax rate is 40 percent, and the section 2801(c) amount is $17,000. The trustee distributes $200,000 to B in Year 1. The entire amount is a covered gift to B.
See
section 28.2801-3(c)(5). This is the only covered gift B receives in Year 1. B receives no covered bequests in Year 1. B's section 2801 tax for Year 1 is computed by multiplying B's net covered gift by 40 percent. B's net covered gift for Year 1 is $183,000, which is determined by reducing B's covered gift received during Year 1 by the section 2801(c) amount. B's section 2801 tax liability for Year 1 is $73,200 ($183,000 × 0.4).
(3)
Example 3: Computation of section 2801 ratio when multiple contributions are made to foreign trust.
(i) In 2005, A, a U.S. citizen, established and funded an irrevocable foreign trust with $200,000. On January 1 of each of the following three years (2006 through 2008), A contributed an additional $100,000 to the foreign trust. A reported A's contributions to the foreign trust as completed gifts on timely filed Forms 709, for calendar years 2005 through 2008. None of these contributions is a covered gift because the gifts predated the effective date of section 2801. On August 8, 2008, a date after the effective date of section 2801 (June 17, 2008), A expatriated and became a covered expatriate. On January 1 of a year after 2008 (Year X), A makes an additional $100,000 contribution to the trust. The aggregate $600,000 contributed to the trust by A, both before and after expatriation, are the only contributions to the trust. The trustee of the foreign trust does not make a valid election to have the trust treated as a domestic trust for purposes of section 2801. Each year, the trustee of the foreign trust provides beneficiary B, a U.S. citizen, with an accounting of the trust showing each receipt and disbursement of the trust during that year, including the date and amount of each contribution by A.
(ii) The fair market value of the trust was $610,000 immediately prior to A's contribution to the trust on January 1, Year X. Therefore, upon the Year X contribution of A's first and only covered gift, the portion of the trust attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests (covered portion) changed from zero to 0.14 ([(section 2801 ratio of
0 × $610,000 fair market value pre-contribution) plus the $100,000 covered gift]/$710,000 fair market value post-contribution). See paragraph (c) of this section.
(iii) In February of Year X, B received a distribution of $225,000 from the foreign trust. Although A contributed a total of $600,000 to the foreign trust, only $100,000 of that total was a covered gift, being the only contribution made by A both after the enactment of section 2801 and after A's expatriation. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the portion of the $225,000 distribution from the foreign trust attributable to a covered gift is $31,500 ($225,000 × 0.14 (section 2801 ratio)) because the distribution is made proportionally from the covered and non-covered portions of the trust. See paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Accordingly, B received a covered gift of $31,500.
(iv) Pursuant to the terms of the foreign trust, the trust made a terminating distribution on August 5, Year X, when B turned 35, and B received the balance of the appreciated trust, $505,000. The portion of this distribution attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests is $70,700 ($505,000 × 0.14). Therefore, B has received covered gifts from the foreign trust during Year X in the total amount of $102,200 ($31,500 + $70,700).

Example 4: Termination of election.
(i) In Year 1, A contributes $200,000 and B contributes $100,000 to Trust, a foreign trust. A and B are covered expatriates. A's and B's contributions are covered gifts. No one pays foreign gift taxes on A's and B's contributions. The trustee of Trust makes a valid election to have Trust treated as a domestic trust for purposes of section 2801. The highest gift tax rate is 40 percent, and the section 2801(c) amount is $17,000. The section 2801 tax for Year 1 is computed by multiplying the net covered gifts and covered bequests by 40 percent. The net covered gifts and covered bequests for Year 1 total $283,000, determined by reducing the covered gifts and covered bequests received by Trust during Year 1, $300,000, by the section 2801(c) amount, $17,000. Trust's 2801 tax liability for Year 1 is $113,200 ($283,000 × 0.4). Any distributions made to U.S. recipients before the trust receives another contribution have a section 2801 ratio of zero and are not subject to the section 2801 tax. See paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.
(ii) In Year 2, A contributes $100,000 to Trust, all of which is a covered gift. The trustee of Trust fails to timely file a Form 708 for Year 2 and timely pay the section 2801 tax. The fair market value of Trust was $400,000 immediately prior to A's contribution. The section 2801 ratio immediately after A's contribution is 0.20, computed as follows: the pre-contribution value of Trust ($400,000) multiplied by the section 2801 ratio in effect immediately prior to the Year 2 contribution (0), plus the fair market value of the Year 2 contribution that constitutes a covered gift ($100,000), divided by the fair market value of Trust after the Year 2 contribution ($500,000). See paragraph (c)(1) and (2) of this section. If the trustee distributes $40,000 to C, a U.S. citizen, after the contribution in Year 2, then $8,000 ($40,000 × 0.20) is a covered gift to C. In Year 2, C also receives a covered gift of $50,000 directly from B. No one pays foreign gift taxes on B's covered gift. C receives no covered bequests in Year 2. C's section 2801 tax for Year 2 is computed by multiplying C's net covered gifts and covered bequests by 40 percent. C's net covered gifts and covered bequests for Year 2 total $41,000, determined by reducing the covered gifts and covered bequests received by C during Year 2, $58,000 ($8,000 + $50,000), by the section 2801(c) amount, $17,000. C's section 2801 tax liability for Year 2 is $16,400 ($41,000 × 0.4).

Example 5: Imperfect election of foreign trust.
(i) In Year 1, CE, a covered expatriate, gives a 20 percent limited partnership interest in a closely held business to a foreign trust created for the benefit of CE's child, A, who is a U.S. citizen. The limited partnership interest is a covered gift. The trustee of the foreign trust makes a valid election to have the trust treated as a domestic trust for purposes of section 2801, trustee timely files a Form 708, reports the fair market value of the covered gift as $500,000, and timely pays the section 2801 tax on the reported fair market value of the covered
gift. Later in Year 1, the trust makes a $100,000 distribution to A.
(ii) In Year 2, CE contributes $200,000 in cash to the foreign trust. The cash is a covered gift. The trustee of the foreign trust timely files a Form 708 reporting the transfer and pays the section 2801 tax. The trust does not make a distribution to any beneficiary during Year 2. In Year 3, the IRS disputes the reported value of the partnership interest transferred in Year 1 and determines that the proper valuation on the date of the gift was $800,000. In Year 3, the IRS issues a letter to the trustee of the foreign trust detailing its finding of the increased valuation and of the resulting additional section 2801 tax including accrued interest, if any, due on or before a later date in Year 3 specified in the letter. The foreign trust fails to pay the additional section 2801 tax liability on or before that due date.
(iii) Under paragraph (d)(6)(iii) of this section, the foreign trust's election for Year 1 is terminated and converted into an imperfect election as of January 1 of Year 1. In computing the foreign trust's section 2801 ratio for Year 1, the $500,000 of value on which the section 2801 tax was timely paid is no longer considered to be attributable to a covered gift. See paragraph (d)(6)(iii) of this section. When the trustee advises A of the letter from the IRS, A must file a late Form 708 reporting the portion of the Year 1 distribution attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests. Although A may owe section 2801 tax and interest, A will not owe any penalties under section 6651 as long as A files the Form 708 and pays the tax within six months after A receives notice of the termination of the election from the trustee of the foreign trust or otherwise becomes aware of the termination of the election. See paragraph (d)(6)(iii)(C) of this section.
(iv) When A files a Form 708 to report the Year 1 distribution, the IRS will verify whether A treated the $300,000 undervaluation claimed by the IRS as a covered gift in computing the section 2801 ratio. As with any other item reported on that return, A has the burden to prove the value of the covered gift to the foreign trust, and the IRS may challenge that value. If A treats the $300,000 as a covered gift to the trust, under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the section 2801 ratio after the Year 1 contribution is 0.375 ($0 + ($300,000)/$800,000)). Thus, 37.5 percent of all distributions made to A from the foreign trust during Year 1 are subject to the section 2801 tax (plus interest from the due date of the tax as if reported on a Form 708 that was timely filed as to Year 1).
(v) Although the foreign trust timely filed the Form 708 for Year 2 and timely paid the section 2801 tax shown on that return, and although the foreign trust's election had not yet been terminated and converted into an imperfect election during Year 2, the foreign trust nevertheless did not have a valid election for Year 2 because the trust did not timely pay the section 2801 tax on all covered gifts and covered bequests received in prior years as required in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, specifically, the tax on the additional $300,000 of value of the Year 1 transfer. However, under paragraph (d)(6)(iii)(D) of this section, because the foreign trust timely filed the Form 708 and paid the section 2801 tax on the Year 2 covered gift of $200,000, the $200,000 amount is no longer considered a covered gift for purposes of computing the section 2801 ratio after that contribution.
(6)
Example 6: Subsequent election after termination of election.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (e)(5) of this section (
Example 5
). In Year 3, the foreign trust does not receive a covered gift or covered bequest. However, the trustee decides that making another election to be treated as a domestic trust would be in the best interests of the trust's beneficiaries. Accordingly, by the due date for the Form 708 for Year 3, the trustee timely files the return and pays the section 2801 tax on the portion of the trust attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests. See paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section. The trustee calculates the portion of the trust attributable to covered gifts and covered bequests received by the trust in prior calendar years by multiplying the fair market value of the trust on December 31, Year 2, by the section 2801 ratio in effect on that date. See paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section. The foreign
trust is an electing foreign trust in Year 3.
(f)
Applicability date.
This section applies to covered gifts or covered bequests received on or after January 1, 2025.
§ 28.2801-6
Special rules and cross-references.
(a)
Determination of basis.
For purposes of determining the U.S. recipient's basis in property received as a covered gift or covered bequest, see sections 1015 and 1014 of the Code, respectively. However, the basis adjustment provided in section 1015(d) does not apply to increase the basis in a covered gift to reflect the tax paid under this section.
(b)
Generation-skipping transfer tax.
Transfers made by a nonresident not a citizen of the United States (NRNC transferor) are subject to generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax only to the extent those transfers are subject to Federal estate or gift tax as described in § 26.2652-1(a)(2) of this chapter. In applying this rule, taxable distributions and taxable terminations are subject to the GST tax only to the extent the NRNC transferor's contributions to the trust, as defined in § 26.2652-1(b)(1) of this chapter, were subject to Federal estate or gift tax as described in § 26.2652-1(a)(2) of this chapter.
See
§ 26.2663-2 of this chapter. A transfer is subject to Federal estate or gift tax, regardless of whether a Federal estate or gift tax return reporting the transfer is timely filed and regardless of whether chapter 15 of the Code applies because of a covered expatriate's failure to timely file an estate or gift tax return.

Information returns
—(1)
Gifts and bequests.
Pursuant to section 6039F of the Code and any corresponding regulations and Form 3520, Part IV, each U.S. person who treats an amount received from a foreign person (other than through a foreign trust) as a gift or bequest (whether or not a covered gift or covered bequest) must report such gift or bequest on Part IV of Form 3520 if the value of the total of such gifts and bequests exceeds a certain threshold. For purposes of this provision, a U.S. person is as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code and includes a U.S. resident within the meaning of section 7701(b)(1)(A) of the Code.
(2)
Foreign trust distributions.
Pursuant to section 6048(c) of the Code and the corresponding regulations, and to the extent provided in Notice 97-34 and Part III of Form 3520 and its Instructions, a U.S. person must report each distribution received during the taxable year from a foreign trust on Part III of Form 3520. Under section 6677(a) of the Code, a penalty of the greater of $10,000 or 35 percent of the gross value of the distribution may be imposed on a U.S. person who fails to timely report the distribution. For purposes of this provision, the term
U.S. person
is as defined in section 7701(a)(30) and includes both U.S. citizens and U.S. residents within the meaning of section 7701(b)(1)(A).
(3)
Penalties and use of information.
The filing of Form 706, Form 706-NA, Form 706-QDT, Form 708, Form 709, or Form 709-NA, or any successor form, does not relieve a U.S. citizen or resident who is required to file Form 3520 from any penalties imposed under section 6677(a) for failure to comply with section 6048(c), or from any penalties imposed under section 6039F(c) of the Code for failure to comply with section 6039F(a). Pursuant to section 6039F(c)(1)(A), the Secretary of the Treasury or her delegate may determine the tax consequences of the receipt of a purported foreign gift or bequest.
(d)
Application of penalties
—(1)
Accuracy-related penalties on underpayments.
The section 6662 accuracy-related penalty may be imposed upon any underpayment of tax attributable to—

(2)
Penalty for substantial and gross valuation misstatements attributable to incorrect appraisals.
The section 6695A penalty for substantial and gross valuation misstatements attributable to incorrect appraisals may be imposed upon any person who prepares an appraisal of the value of a covered gift or covered bequest.

§ 28.2801-7
Determining responsibility under section 2801.
(a)
Responsibility of U.S. citizens or residents receiving gifts or bequests from expatriates.
It is the responsibility of the taxpayer (in this case, the U.S. citizen or resident receiving a gift or bequest from an expatriate or a distribution from a foreign trust funded at least in part by an expatriate) to ascertain the taxpayer's obligations under section 2801 of the Code, which includes making the determination of whether the transferor is a covered expatriate and whether the transfer is a covered gift or covered bequest.
(b)
Disclosure of return and return information
—(1)
In general.
In certain circumstances, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may be permitted, upon request of a U.S. citizen or resident in receipt of a gift or bequest from an expatriate, to disclose to the U.S. citizen or resident return or return information of the donor or decedent expatriate that may assist the U.S. citizen or resident in determining whether the donor or decedent was a covered expatriate and whether the transfer was a covered gift or covered bequest.
See
section 6103 of the Code. The U.S. citizen or resident may not rely upon this information, however, if the U.S. citizen or resident knows, or has reason to know, that the information received from the IRS is incorrect or incomplete. The circumstances under which such information may be disclosed to a U.S. citizen or resident, the process for authorizing disclosures, and the procedures for requesting such information from the IRS, will be as provided by publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter).
(2)
Rebuttable presumption.
Unless a living donor expatriate authorizes the disclosure of the donor expatriate's relevant return or return information to the U.S. citizen or resident receiving the gift, there is a rebuttable presumption that the donor is a covered expatriate and that the gift is a covered gift.
(c)
Protective return.
A taxpayer who reasonably concludes that a gift or bequest is not subject to section 2801 may file a protective Form 708 to start the period of limitations for the assessment of any section 2801 tax. See § 28.6011-1(b) that provides safe harbor procedures for filing a protective Form 708.
(d)
Applicability date.

(a)
In general.
Every U.S. recipient (as defined in § 28.2801-2(e)) subject to taxation under chapter 15 of subtitle B must keep, for the purpose of determining the total amount of covered gifts and covered bequests, such permanent books of account or records as are necessary to establish the amount of that person's aggregate covered gifts and covered bequests, and the other information required to be shown on Form 708,
United States Return of Tax for Gifts and Bequests Received from Covered Expatriates,
or any successor form. All documents and vouchers used in preparing Form 708 must be retained by the person required to file the return so as to be available for inspection so long as the contents thereof may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law.
(b)
Supplemental information.
The U.S. recipient, as defined in § 28.2801-2(e), must furnish such supplemental information as may be deemed necessary by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to allow the IRS to determine the correct amount of tax. Therefore, the U.S. recipient must furnish, upon request, copies of all documents relating to the covered gift or covered bequest, appraisals of any items included in the aggregate amount of covered gifts and covered bequests, copies of balance sheets and other financial statements obtainable by that person relating to the value of stock or other property constituting the covered gift or covered bequest, and any other information obtainable by that person that may be necessary in the determination of the tax. See section 2801 of the Code
and the corresponding regulations. For every policy of life insurance listed on the return, the U.S. recipient must procure a statement from the insurance company on Form 712,
Life Insurance Statement,
or any successor form, and file it with the IRS office where the return is filed. If specifically requested by the IRS, the insurance company must file this statement directly with the IRS.
(c)
Applicability date.
This section applies on and after January 14, 2025.
§ 28.6011-1
Returns.
(a)
Return required.
The return of any section 2801 tax imposed by chapter 15 of subtitle B of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) must be made on Form 708,
United States Return of Tax for Gifts and Bequests Received from Covered Expatriates,
in accordance with the instructions applicable to the form (or on such other form as may be provided in future guidance or instructions). With respect to each covered gift and covered bequest received during the calendar year, the U.S. recipient as defined in § 28.2801-2(e) must include on Form 708 the information set forth in § 25.6019-4 of this chapter. The U.S. recipient must file Form 708 for each calendar year in which the U.S. recipient receives a covered gift or covered bequest. The U.S. recipient who receives the covered gift or covered bequest during the calendar year is the person required to file the return. A U.S. recipient is not required to file such form, however, for a calendar year in which the total fair market value of all covered gifts and covered bequests received by that person during that calendar year is less than or equal to the section 2801(c) amount (as defined in § 28.2801-2(l)).
(b)
Protective return safe harbor.
A U.S. citizen or resident (as defined in § 28.2801-2(b)) who receives a gift or bequest from an expatriate and reasonably concludes that the gift or bequest is not a covered gift or a covered bequest from a covered expatriate may file a protective Form 708 to start the running of the period of limitations for assessment of tax. Under the safe harbor procedure of this paragraph (b), a Form 708 will start the running of the period of limitations for assessment of tax if the return includes all of the information otherwise required on Form 708, along with an affidavit, signed under penalties of perjury, setting forth the information on which the U.S. citizen or resident has relied in concluding that the donor or decedent, as the case may be, was not a covered expatriate, or that the transfer was not a covered gift or a covered bequest, as well as that person's efforts to obtain other information that might be relevant to these determinations. For purposes of this safe harbor, if the U.S. citizen or resident has obtained, and is permitted to rely on, information from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (as described in § 28.2801-7(b)(1)), the U.S. citizen or resident must attach a copy of such information to the protective return. For purposes of this safe harbor, the U.S. citizen or resident also must attach a copy of a completed Part III of Form 3520,
Annual Return to Report Transactions With Foreign Trusts and Receipt of Certain Foreign Gifts,
for all trust distributions, or Part IV of Form 3520 for all gifts and bequests, if applicable.
