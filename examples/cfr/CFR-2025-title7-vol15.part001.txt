§ 3430.11
Competition.
(a)
Standards for competition.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, NIFA will enter into grants and cooperative agreements, unless restricted by statute, only after competition.
(b)
Exception.
The NIFA ADO and the designated Agency approving official may make a determination in writing that competition is not deemed appropriate for a particular transaction. Such determination shall be limited to transactions where it can be adequately justified that a noncompetitive award is in the best interest of the Federal Government and necessary to the goals of the program.
§ 3430.12
Requests for applications.
(a)
General.
For each competitive and noncompetitive non-formula program, NIFA will prepare a program solicitation (also called a request for applications (RFA)), in accordance with appendix I to 2 CFR part 200, establishing a standard format for Federal agency announcements (
i.e.
, program solicitations or RFAs) of funding opportunities under programs that award discretionary grants or cooperative agreements. This policy directive requires the content of the RFA to be organized in a sequential manner beginning with overview information followed by the full text of the announcement and will apply unless superseded by statute or another OMB policy directive. The RFA may include all or a portion of the following items:
(1) Contact information.
(2) Directions for interested stakeholders or beneficiaries to submit written comments in a published program solicitation or RFA.
(3) Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number.
(4) Legislative authority and background information.

These PAs may provide tentative due dates and are released without associated application packages. Hence, no applications are solicited under a PA. PAs are
announced in the
Federal Register
or on the NIFA Web site.
(d) If applicants choose to address center of excellence criteria, they must do so in their project narrative, subject to any page limitations on that section of the application.
[74 FR 45740, Sept. 4, 2009, as amended at 79 FR 76001, Dec. 19, 2014; 82 FR 21109, May 5, 2017]
§ 3430.13
Letter of intent to submit an application.
(a)
General.
NIFA may request or require that prospective applicants notify program staff of their intent to submit an application, identified as “letter of intent”. If applicable, the request or requirement will be included in the RFA, along with directions for the preparation and submission of the letter of intent, the type of letter of intent, and any relevant deadlines. There are two types of letters of intent: optional and required.
(b)
Optional letter of intent.
Entities interested in submitting an application for a NIFA award should complete and submit a “Letter of Intent to Submit an Application” by the due date specified in the RFA. This does not obligate the applicant in any way, but will provide useful information to NIFA in preparing for application review. Applicants that do not submit a letter of intent by the specified due date are still allowed to submit an application by the application due date specified in the RFA, unless otherwise specified in the RFA.
(c)
Required letter of intent.
Certain programs may require that the prospective applicants submit a letter of intent for specific programs. This type of letter is evaluated by the program staff for suitability to the program and in regard to program priorities, needs, and scope. Invitations to submit a full application will be issued by the Program Officer or his or her representative. For programs requiring a letter of intent, applications submitted without prior approval of the letter of intent by the program staff will be returned without review. Programs requiring a specific letter of intent will be specified in the RFA.
§ 3430.14
Types of applications; types of award instruments.
(a)
Types of applications.
The type of application acceptable may vary by funding opportunity. The RFA will stipulate the type of application that may be submitted to NIFA in response to the funding opportunity. Applicants may submit the following types of applications as specified in the RFA.
(1)
New.
An application that is being submitted to the program for the first time.
(2)
Resubmission.
This is a project application that has been submitted for consideration under the same program previously but has not been approved for an award under the program. For competitive programs, this type of application is evaluated in competition with other pending applications in the area to which it is assigned. Resubmissions are reviewed according to the same evaluation criteria as new applications. In addition, applicants must respond to the previous panel review summaries, unless waived by NIFA.
(3)
Renewal.
An application requesting additional funding for a period subsequent to that provided by a current award. For competitive programs, a renewal application competes with all other applications. Renewal applications must be developed as fully as though the applicant is applying for the first time. Renewal applicants also must have filed a progress report via Current Research Information System (CRIS), unless waived by NIFA.
(4)
Continuation.
A noncompeting application for an additional funding/budget period within a previously approved project.
(5)
Revision.
An application that proposes a change in the Federal Government's financial obligations or contingent liability from an existing obligation; or, any other change in the terms and conditions of the existing award.
(6)
Resubmitted renewal.
This is a project application that has been submitted for consideration under the same program previously. This type of application has also been submitted for renewal under the same program but was not approved. For competitive programs, this type of application is evaluated in competition with other pending applications in the area to which it
is assigned. Resubmitted renewal applications are reviewed according to the same evaluation criteria as new applications. Applicants must respond to the previous panel review summaries and file a progress report via CRIS, unless waived by NIFA.
(b)
Types of award instruments.
The following is a list of corresponding categories of award instruments issued by NIFA.
(1)
Standard.
This is an award instrument by which NIFA agrees to support a specified level of effort for a predetermined project period without the announced intention of providing additional support at a future date.
(2)
Renewal.
This is an award instrument by which NIFA agrees to provide additional funding under a standard award as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for a project period beyond that approved in an original or amended award, provided that the cumulative period does not exceed any statutory time limitation of the award.
(3)
Continuation.
This is an award instrument by which NIFA agrees to support a specified level of effort for a predetermined period of time with a statement of intention to provide additional support at a future date, provided that performance has been satisfactory, appropriations are available for this purpose, and continued support would be in the best interest of the Federal Government and the public.
(4)
Supplemental.
This is an award instrument by which NIFA agrees to provide small amounts of additional funding under a standard, renewal, or continuation award as specified in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section and may involve a short-term (usually six months or less) extension of the project period beyond that approved in an original or amended award, but in no case may the cumulative period of the project, including short term extensions, exceed any statutory time limitation of the award.
(c)
Obligation of the Federal Government.
Neither the acceptance of any application nor the award of any project shall commit or obligate the United States in any way to make any renewal, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any approved application or portion of an approved application.
§ 3430.15
Stakeholder input.
Section 103(c)(2) of the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 (AREERA) (7 U.S.C. 7613(c)(2)) requires the Secretary to solicit and consider input on each program RFA from persons who conduct agricultural research, education, and extension for use in formulating future RFAs for competitive programs. NIFA will provide instructions for submission of stakeholder input in the RFA. NIFA will consider any comments received within the specified timeframe in the development of the future RFAs for the program.
§ 3430.16
Eligibility requirements.
(a)
General.
Program-specific eligibility requirements appear in the subpart applicable to each program and in the RFAs.
(b)
Foreign entities
—(1)
Awards to institutions.

Specific management information relating to an applicant shall be submitted on a one-time basis, with updates on an as-needed basis, as part of the responsibility determination prior to an award being made under a specific NIFA program, if such information has not been provided previously under this or another NIFA program. NIFA will provide copies of forms recommended for use in fulfilling these requirements as part of the pre-award process. Although an applicant may be eligible based on its status as one of these entities, there are factors that may exclude an applicant from receiving Federal financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits under a NIFA program
(e.g., debarment or suspension of an individual involved or a determination that an applicant is not responsible based on submitted organizational management information).
(d)
Certification of NLGCA status.
NIFA will make publically available (
e.g.,
Federal Register
) the process through which institutions may apply for designation as a NLGCA. The public notice will, at a minimum, include NLGCA criteria, instructions on how to request designation, information about how NIFA will respond to requests, and termination of NLGCA status.

§ 3430.17
Content of an application.
(a) The RFA provides instructions on how to access a funding opportunity. The funding opportunity contains the application package, which includes the forms necessary for completion of an application in response to the RFA, as well as the application instructions. The application instructions document, “NIFA Grants.gov Application Guide: A Guide for Preparation and Submission of NIFA Applications via Grants.gov,” is intended to assist applicants in the preparation and submission of applications to NIFA. It is also the primary document for use in the preparation of NIFA applications via Grants.gov.
(b)
Center of Excellence:
In addition to meeting the other requirements detailed in the request for application (RFA), eligible applicants who wish to be considered as a center of excellence must provide a brief justification statement at the end of their project narrative and within the page limits provided for the project narrative, describing how they meet the standards of a center of excellence, based on the following criteria:
(1) The ability of the center of excellence to ensure coordination and cost effectiveness by reducing unnecessarily duplicative efforts regarding research, teaching, and extension in the implementation of the proposed research and/or extension activity outlined in this application;
(2) In addition to any applicable matching requirements, the ability of the center of excellence to leverage available resources by using public- private partnerships among agricultural industry groups, institutions of higher education, and the Federal Government in the implementation of the proposed research and/or extension activity outlined in this application. Resources leveraged should be commensurate with the size of the award;
(3) The planned scope and capability of the center of excellence to implement teaching initiatives to increase awareness and effectively disseminate solutions to target audiences through extension activities in the implementation of the proposed research and/or extension activity outlined in this application; and
(4) The ability or capacity of the center of excellence to increase the economic returns to rural communities by identifying, attracting, and directing funds to high-priority agricultural issues in support of and as a result of the implementation of the proposed research and/or extension activity outlined in this application.
(5) Additionally, where practicable (not required), center of excellence applicants should describe proposed efforts to improve teaching capacity and infrastructure at colleges and universities (including land-grant colleges
and universities, cooperating forestry schools, certified Non-Land Grant Colleges of Agriculture (NLGCA) (list of certified NLGCA is available at
http://www.nifa.usda.gov/funding/pdfs/nlgca_colleges.pdf
), and schools of veterinary medicine).
[74 FR 45740, Sept. 4, 2009, as amended at 82 FR 21109, May 5, 2017]
§ 3430.18
Submission of an application.
(a)
When to submit.
The RFA will provide deadlines for the submission of letters of intent, if requested and required, and applications. NIFA may issue separate RFAs and/or establish separate deadlines for different types of applications, different award instruments, or different topics or phases of the Federal assistance programs. If applications are not received by applicable deadlines, they will not be considered for funding. Exceptions will be considered only when extenuating circumstances exist, as determined by NIFA, and justification and supporting documentation are provided to NIFA.
(b)
What to submit.
The contents of the applicable application package, as well as any other information, are to be submitted by the due date.
(c)
Where to submit.
The RFA will provide addresses for submission of letters of intent, if requested or required, and applications. It also will indicate permissible methods of submission (
i.e.,
electronic, e-mail, hand-delivery, U.S. Postal Service, courier). Conformance with preparation and submission instructions is required and will be strictly enforced unless a deviation had been approved. NIFA may establish additional requirements. NIFA may return without review applications that are not consistent with the RFA instructions.
§ 3430.19
Resubmission of an application.
(a)
Previously unfunded applications.
(1) Applications that are resubmitted to a program, after being previously submitted but not funded by that program, must include the following information:
(i) The NIFA-assigned proposal number of the previously submitted application.
(ii) Summary of the previous reviewers' comments.
(iii) Explanation of how the previous reviewers' comments or previous panel summary have been addressed in the current application.
(2) Resubmitting an application that has been revised based on previous reviewers' critiques does not guarantee the application will be recommended for funding.
(b)
Previously funded applications.
(1) NIFA competitive programs are generally not designed to support multiple Federal assistance awards activities that are essentially repetitive in nature. PDs who have had their projects funded previously are discouraged from resubmitting relatively identical applications for further funding. Applications that are sequential continuations or new stages of previously funded projects must compete with first-time applications, and should thoroughly demonstrate how the proposed project expands substantially on previously funded efforts and promotes innovation and creativity beyond the scope of the previously funded project.
(2) An application may be submitted only once to NIFA. The submission of duplicative or substantially similar applications concurrently for review by more than one program will result in the exclusion of the redundant applications from NIFA consideration.
§ 3430.20
Acknowledgment of an application.
The receipt of all letters of intent and applications will be acknowledged by NIFA. Applicants who do not receive an acknowledgement within a certain number of days (as established in the RFA, e.g., 15 and 30 days) of the submission deadline should contact the program contact. Once the application has been assigned a proposal number by NIFA, that number should be cited on all future correspondence.
§ 3430.21
Confidentiality of applications and awards.
(a)
General.
Names of submitting institutions and individuals, as well as application contents and evaluations, will be kept confidential, except to those involved in the review process, to the extent permissible by law.
(b)
Identifying confidential and proprietary information in an application.
If an application contains proprietary information that constitutes a trade secret, proprietary commercial or financial information, confidential personal information, or data affecting the national security, it will be treated in confidence to the extent permitted by law, provided that the information is clearly marked by the proposer with the term “confidential and proprietary information” and that the following statement is included at the bottom of the project narrative or any other attachment included in the application that contains such information: “The following pages (specify) contain proprietary information which (name of proposing organization) requests not to be released to persons outside the Government, except for purposes of evaluation.”
(c)
Disposition of applications.
By law, the Department is required to make the final decisions as to whether the information is required to be kept in confidence. Information contained in unsuccessful applications will remain the property of the proposer. However, the Department will retain for three years one file copy of each application received; extra copies will be destroyed. Public release of information from any application submitted will be subject to existing legal requirements. Any application that is funded will be considered an integral part of the award and normally will be made available to the public upon request, except for designated proprietary information that is determined by the Department to be proprietary information.
(d)
Submission of proprietary information.
The inclusion of proprietary information is discouraged unless it is necessary for the proper evaluation of the application. If proprietary information is to be included, it should be limited, set apart from other text on a separate page, and keyed to the text by numbers. It should be confined to a few critical technical items that, if disclosed, could jeopardize the obtaining of foreign or domestic patents. Trade secrets, salaries, or other information that could jeopardize commercial competitiveness should be similarly keyed and presented on a separate page. Applications or reports that attempt to restrict dissemination of large amounts of information may be found unacceptable by the Department and constitute grounds for return of the application without further consideration. Without assuming any liability for inadvertent disclosure, the Department will limit dissemination of such information to its employees and, where necessary for the evaluation of the application, to outside reviewers on a confidential basis. An application may be withdrawn at any time prior to the final action thereon.

# Subpart C—Pre-award: Application Review and Evaluation
§ 3430.31
Guiding principles.
The guiding principle for Federal assistance application review and evaluation is to ensure that each proposal is treated in a consistent and fair manner regardless of regional and institutional affiliation. After the evaluation process by the review panel, NIFA, through the program officer, ensures that applicants receive appropriate feedback and comments on their proposals, and processes the awards in as timely a manner as possible.
§ 3430.32
Preliminary application review.
Prior to technical examination, a preliminary review will be made of all applications for responsiveness to the administrative requirements set forth in the RFA. Applications that do not meet the administrative requirements may be eliminated from program competition. However, NIFA retains the right to conduct discussions with applicants to resolve technical and/or budget issues, as deemed necessary by NIFA.
§ 3430.33
Selection of reviewers.
(a)
Requirement.
NIFA is responsible for performing a review of applications submitted to NIFA competitive award programs in accordance with section 103(a) of AREERA (7 U.S.C. 7613(a)). Reviews are undertaken to ensure that projects supported by NIFA are of high quality and are consistent with the goals and requirements of the funding program. Applications submitted to
NIFA undergo a programmatic evaluation to determine the worthiness of Federal support. The scientific peer review or merit review is performed by peer or merit reviewers and also may entail an assessment by Federal employees.
(b)
NIFA Peer Review System.
The NIFA Application Review Process is accomplished through the use of the NIFA Peer Review System (PRS), a Web-based system which allows reviewers and potential reviewers to update personal information and to complete and submit reviews electronically to NIFA.
(c)
Relevant training and experience.
Reviewers will be selected based upon training and experience in relevant scientific, extension, or education fields taking into account the following factors:
(1) Level of relevant formal scientific, technical education, and extension experience of the individual, as well as the extent to which an individual is engaged in relevant research, education, or extension activities.
(2) Need to include as reviewers experts from various areas of specialization within relevant scientific, education, and extension fields.
(3) Need to include as reviewers other experts (e.g., producers, range or forest managers/operators, and consumers) who can assess relevance of the applications to targeted audiences and to program needs.
(4) Need to include as reviewers experts from a variety of organizational types (e.g., colleges, universities, industry, State and Federal agencies, private profit and nonprofit organizations) and geographic locations.
(5) Need to maintain a balanced composition of reviewers with regard to minority and female representation and an equitable age distribution.
(6) Need to include reviewers who can judge the effective usefulness to producers and the general public of each application.
(d)
Confidentiality.
The identities of reviewers will remain confidential to the maximum extent possible. Therefore, the names of reviewers will not be released to applicants. If it is possible to reveal the names of reviewers in such a way that they cannot be identified with the review of any particular application, this will be done at the end of the fiscal year or as requested. Names of submitting institutions and individuals, as well as application content and peer evaluations, will be kept confidential, except to those involved in the review process, to the extent permitted by law. Reviewers are expected to be in compliance with NIFA Confidentiality Guidelines. Reviewers provide this assurance through PRS.
(e)
Conflicts of interest.
During the evaluation process, extreme care will be taken to prevent any actual or perceived conflicts of interest that may impact review or evaluation. For the purpose of determining conflicts of interest, the academic and administrative autonomy of an institution shall be determined. Reviewers are expected to be in compliance with NIFA Conflict-of-Interest Guidelines. Reviewers provide this assurance through PRS.
§ 3430.34
Evaluation criteria.
(a)
General.
To ensure any project receiving funds from NIFA is consistent with the broad goals of the funding program, the content of each proposal/application submitted to NIFA will be evaluated based on a pre-determined set of review criteria. It is the responsibility of the Program Officer to develop, adopt, adapt, or otherwise establish the criteria by which proposals are to be evaluated. It may be appropriate for the Program Officer to involve other scientists or stakeholders in the development of criteria, or to extract criteria from legislative authority or appropriations language. The review criteria are described in the RFA and shall not include criteria concerning any cost sharing or matching requirements per section 103(a)(3) of AREERA (7 U.S.C. 7613(a)(3)).
(b)
Guidance for reviewers.
In order that all potential applicants for a program have similar opportunities to compete for funds, all reviewers will receive from the Program Officer a description of the review criteria. Reviewers are instructed to use those same evaluation criteria, and only those criteria, to judge the merit of the proposals they review.
(c)
Center of Excellence status.
All eligible applicants will be competitively
peer reviewed (as described in Part V, A. and B. of the RFA), and ranked in accordance with the evaluation criteria. Those that rank highly meritorious and requested to be considered as a center of excellence will be further evaluated by the peer panel to determine whether they have met the criteria to be a center of excellence. In instances where they are found to be equally meritorious with the application of a non-center of excellence, based on peer review, selection for funding will be weighed in favor of applicants meeting the center of excellence criteria. NIFA will effectively use the center of excellence prioritization as a “tie breaker”. Applicants that rank highly meritorious but who did not request consideration as a center of excellence or who are not deemed to have met the center of excellence standards may still receive funding.

§ 3430.35
Review of noncompetitive applications.
(a)
General.
Some projects are directed by either authorizing legislation and/or appropriations to specifically support a designated institution or set of institutions for particular research, education, or extension topics of importance to the nation, a State, or a region. Although these projects may be awarded noncompetitively, these projects or activities are subject to the same application process, award terms and conditions, Federal assistance laws and regulations, reporting and monitoring requirements, and post-award administration and closeout policies and procedures as competitive Federal assistance programs. The only difference is these applications are not subject to a competitive peer or merit review process at the Agency level.
(b)
Requirements.
All noncompetitive applications recommended for funding are required to be reviewed by the program officer and, as required, other Departmental and NIFA officials; and the review documented by the NIFA program officer. For awards recommended for funding at or greater than $10,000, an independent review and a unit review by program officials are required.
§ 3430.36
Procedures to minimize or eliminate duplication of effort.
NIFA may implement appropriate business processes to minimize or eliminate the awarding of NIFA Federal assistance that unnecessarily duplicates activities already being sponsored under other awards, including awards made by other Federal agencies. Business processes may include the review of the Current and Pending Support Form; documented CRIS searches prior to award; the conduct of PD workshops, conferences, meetings, and symposia; and agency participation in Federal Government-wide and other committees, taskforces, or groups that seek to solve problems related to agricultural research, education, and extension and other activities delegated to the NIFA Director.
§ 3430.37
Feedback to applicants.
Copies of individual reviews and/or summary reviews, not including the identity of reviewers, will be sent to the applicant PDs after the review process has been completed.

# Subpart D—Award
§ 3430.41
Administration.
(a)
General.
Within the limit of funds available for such purpose, the NIFA ADO shall make Federal assistance awards to those responsible, eligible applicants whose applications are judged most meritorious under the procedures set forth in the RFA. The date specified by the NIFA ADO as the effective date of the award shall be no later than September 30th of the Federal fiscal year in which the project is approved for support and funds are appropriated for such purpose, unless otherwise permitted by law. It should be noted that the project need not be initiated on the award effective date, but as soon thereafter as practical so that project goals may be attained within the funded project period. All funds awarded by NIFA shall be expended solely for the purpose for which the funds are awarded in accordance with the approved application and budget,
the regulations, the terms and conditions of the award, the applicable Federal cost principles, and the Department's assistance regulations (e.g., 2 CFR part 200).
(b)
Notice of Award.
The notice of award document (
i.e.,
Form NIFA-2009, Award Face Sheet) will provide pertinent instructions and information noted in 2 CFR 200.211.
(c)
Center of Excellence.
Applicant's Notice of Award will reflect that, for that particular grant program, the applicant meets all of the requirements of a center of excellence. Entities recognized as a center of excellence will maintain that distinction for the duration of their award or as identified in the terms and conditions of that award.
[74 FR 45740, Sept. 4, 2009, as amended at 79 FR 76001, Dec. 19, 2014; 82 FR 21110, May 5, 2017; 85 FR 72913, Nov. 16, 2020]
§ 3430.42
Special award conditions.
(a)
General.
NIFA may, with respect to any award, impose additional conditions prior to or at the time of any award when, in the judgment of NIFA, such conditions are necessary to ensure or protect advancement of the approved project, the interests of the public, or the conservation of grant or cooperative agreement funds. NIFA may impose additional requirements if an applicant or recipient has a history of poor performance; is not financially stable; has a management system that does not meet prescribed standards; has not complied with the terms and conditions of a previous award; or is not otherwise responsible.
(b)
Notification of additional requirements.
When NIFA imposes additional requirements, NIFA will notify the recipient in writing as to the following: The nature of the additional requirements; the reason why the additional requirements are being imposed; the nature of the corrective actions needed; the time allowed for completing the corrective actions; and the method for requesting reconsideration of the additional requirements imposed.
(c)
Form NIFA-2009, Award Face Sheet.
These special award conditions, as applicable, will be added as a special provision to the award terms and conditions and identified on the Form NIFA-2009, Award Face Sheet, for the award.
(d)
Removal of additional requirements.
NIFA will promptly remove any additional requirements once the conditions that prompted them have been corrected.

# Subpart E—Post-Award and Closeout
§ 3430.51
Payment.
(a)
General.
All payments will be made in advance unless a deviation is accepted (see § 3430.3) or as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. All payments to the awardee shall be made via the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Payment Management System (DHHS-PMS), U.S. Department of the Treasury's Automated Standard Application for Payments (ASAP) system, or another electronic funds transfer (EFT) method, except for awards to other Federal agencies. Awardees are expected to request funds via DHHS-PMS, ASAP, or other electronic payment system for reimbursement basis in a timely manner.
(b)
Reimbursement method.
NIFA shall use the reimbursement method if it determines that advance payment is not feasible and that the awardee does not maintain or demonstrate the willingness to maintain written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the awardee, and financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability.
§ 3430.52
Cost sharing and matching.
(a)
General.
Awardees may be required to match the Federal funds received under a NIFA award. The required percentage of matching, type of matching (e.g., cash and/or in-kind contributions), sources of match (e.g., non-Federal), and whether NIFA has any authority to waive the match will be specified in the subpart applicable to the specific Federal assistance program, as well as in the RFA.
(1) A recipient of a NIFA competitive grant programs that are awarded under a covered law provided in section 3371 of under the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy
Act of 1977 must provide funds, in-kind contributions, or a combination of both, from sources other than funds provided through such grant in an amount that is at least equal to the amount awarded by NIFA unless an exception applies. NIFA will determine program applicability of this match and include in the RFA for those programs: The match requirement, exceptions, waivers, and any other information necessary to determine applicability of the match requirement. In accordance with section 1492 of the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 3371), as added by section 7128 of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (Pub. L. 113-79), for grants awarded after October 1, 2014, the recipient of an award must provide funds, in-kind contributions, or a combination of both, from sources other than funds provided through such grant in an amount that is at least equal to the amount awarded by NIFA unless one of the exemptions described herein is applicable.
(2) The matching funds requirement does not apply to grants awarded:
(i) To a research agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); or
(ii) To an entity eligible to receive funds under a capacity and infrastructure program (as defined in section 251(f)(1)(C) of the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994, 7 U.S.C. 6971(f)(1)(C)), including a partner of such an entity. Entities eligible to receive funds under a capacity and infrastructure program and exempt from the matching funds requirement include:
(A) 1862 Land-grant Institutions, including State Agricultural Experiment Stations receiving funding under the Hatch Act of 1887;
(B) 1890 Land-grant Institutions;
(C) 1994 Land-grant Institutions;
(D) Entities eligible to receive funds under the of Continuing Animal Health and Disease, Food Security, and Stewardship Research, Education, and Extension Program Funds—Capacity and Infrastructure Program (CIP);
(E) Hispanic-Serving Agricultural Colleges and Universities (HSACU);
(F) Insular Area Schools Eligible to Receive Funds from the Distance Education/Resident Instruction Grant Programs;
(G) Entities eligible to receive funds under the of McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Program Funds;
(H) Non-Land Grant Colleges of Agriculture (NLGCA)—(for exemption from the new matching requirement, these applications must include NLGCA certification, see instructions for requesting certifications at
http://www.nifa.usda.gov/form/form.html,
and for attaching the certification in Part IV, B. of this RFA);
(I) Entities eligible to receive funds under a program established under section 1417(b) of the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 3152(b)), including:
(
1
) 1890 Institution Teaching, Research, and Extension Capacity Building Grants Program;
(
2
) Higher Education Challenge Grants Program;
(
3
) Higher Education Multicultural Scholars Program; and
(
4
) Food and Agricultural Sciences National Needs Graduate and Postgraduate Fellowship Grants Program.
(J) Individual public or private, nonprofit Alaska Native-Serving and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions of higher education (see 20 U.S.C. 1059d).
(b)
Indirect Costs as in-kind matching contributions.
Indirect costs may be claimed under the Federal portion of the award budget or, alternatively, indirect costs may be claimed as a matching contribution (if no indirect costs are requested under the Federal portion of the award budget). However, unless explicitly authorized in the RFA, indirect costs may not be claimed on both the Federal portion of the award budget and as a matching contribution, unless the total claimed on both the Federal portion of the award budget and as a matching contribution does not exceed the maximum allowed indirect costs or the institution's negotiated indirect cost rate, whichever is less. An awardee may split the allocation between the Federal and non-Federal portions of the budget only if the total amount of indirect costs charged to the project does not exceed the maximum allowed
indirect costs or the institution's negotiated indirect cost rate, whichever is less. For example, if an awardee's indirect costs are capped at 22 percent pursuant to section 1462(a) of NARETPA (7 U.S.C. 3310(a)), the awardee may request 11 percent of the indirect costs on both the Federal portion of the award and as a matching contribution. Or, the awardee may request any similar percentage that, when combined, does not exceed the maximum indirect cost rate of 22 percent.
[74 FR 45740, Sept. 4, 2009, as amended at 81 FR 6414, Feb. 8, 2016]
§ 3430.53
Program income.
(a)
General.
NIFA shall apply the standards set forth in this subpart in requiring awardee organizations to account for program income related to projects financed in whole or in part with Federal funds.
(b)
Addition method.
Unless otherwise provided in the authorizing statute, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award, program income earned during the project period shall be retained by the awardee and shall be added to funds committed to the project by NIFA and the awardee and used to further eligible project or program objectives. Any specific program deviations will be identified in the individual subparts.
(c)
Award terms and conditions.
Unless the program regulations identified in the individual subpart provide otherwise, awardees shall follow the terms and conditions of the award.
§ 3430.54
Indirect costs.
Indirect cost rates for grants and cooperative agreements shall be determined in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, unless superseded by another authority. Any restriction on indirect costs is to be identified in the request for applications as appropriate. Use of indirect costs as in-kind matching contributions is subject to § 3430.52(b).
[81 FR 6414, Feb. 8, 2016]
§ 3430.55
Technical reporting.
(a)
Requirement.
All projects supported with Federal funds under this part must be documented in the Current Research Information System (CRIS).
(b)
Initial Documentation in the CRIS Database.
Information collected in the “Work Unit Description” (Form AD-416) and “Work Unit Classification” (Form AD-417) is required upon project initiation for all new awards in CRIS (
i.e.
, prior to award).
(c)
Annual CRIS Reports.
Unless stated differently in the award terms and conditions, an annual “Accomplishments Report” (Form AD-421) is due 90 calendar days after the award's anniversary date (
i.e.
, one year following the month and day on which the project period begins and each year thereafter up until a final report is required). An annual report covers a one-year period. In addition to the Form AD-421, the following information, when applicable, must be submitted to the programmatic contact person identified in block 14 of the Award Face Sheet (Form NIFA-2009): a comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals established for the reporting period (where the output of the project can be expressed readily in numbers, a computation of the cost per unit of output should be considered if the information is considered useful); the reasons for slippage if established goals were not met; and additional pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or unexpectedly high unit costs. The annual report of “Funding and Staff Support” (Form AD-419) is due February 1 of the year subsequent to the Federal fiscal year being reported.
(d)
CRIS Final Report.
The CRIS final report, “Accomplishments Report” (Form AD-421), covers the entire period of performance of the award. The report should encompass progress made during the entire timeframe of the project instead of covering accomplishments made only during the final reporting segment of the project. In addition to providing the information required under paragraph (c) of this section, the final report must include the following when applicable: a disclosure of any inventions not previously reported that were conceived or first actually reduced to practice during the performance of the work under the
award; a written statement on whether or not the awardee elects (or plans to elect) to obtain patent(s) on any such invention; and an identification of equipment purchased with any Federal funds under the award and any subsequent use of such equipment.
(e)
CRIS Web Site Via Internet.
The CRIS database is available to the public on the worldwide web. CRIS project information is available via the Internet CRIS Web site at
http://cris.nifa.usda.gov.
To submit forms electronically, the CRIS forms Web site can be accessed through the CRIS Web site or accessed directly at
http://cwf.uvm.edu/cris.
(f)
Additional reporting requirements.
Awardees may be required to submit other technical reports or submit the CRIS reports more frequently than annually. Additional requirements for a specific Federal assistance program are described in the applicable subpart after subpart E and are identified in the RFA. The Award Face Sheet (Form NIFA-2009) also will specify these additional reporting requirements as a special provision to the award terms and conditions.
§ 3430.56
Financial reporting.
(a)
SF-269, Financial Status Report.
Unless stated differently in the award terms and conditions, a final SF-269, Financial Status Report, is due 90 days after the expiration of the award and should be submitted to the Awards Management Branch (AMB) at Awards Management Branch; Office of Extramural Programs, NIFA; U.S. Department of Agriculture; STOP 2271; 1400 Independence Avenue, SW.; Washington, DC 20250-2271. The awardee shall report program outlays and program income on the same accounting basis (
i.e.
, cash or accrual) that it uses in its normal accounting system. When submitting a final SF-269, Financial Status Report, the total matching contribution, if required, should be shown in the report. The final SF-269 must not show any unliquidated obligations. If the awardee still has valid obligations that remain unpaid when the report is due, it shall request an extension of time for submitting the report pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section; submit a provisional report (showing the unliquidated obligations) by the due date; and submit a final report when all obligations have been liquidated, but no later than the approved extension date. SF-269, Financial Status Reports, must be submitted by all awardees, including Federal agencies and national laboratories.
(b)
Awards with Required Matching.
For awards requiring a matching contribution, an annual SF-269, Financial Status Report, is required and this requirement will be indicated on the Award Face Sheet, Form-2009, in which case it must be submitted no later than 45 days following the end of the budget or reporting period.
(c)
Requests for an extension to submit a final SF-269, Financial Status Report
—(1)
Before the due date.
Awardees may request, prior to the end of the 90-day period following the award expiration date, an extension to submit a final SF-269, Financial Status Report. This request should include a provisional report pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, as well as an anticipated submission date and a justification for the late submission. Subject to § 3430.63 or other statutory or agency policy limitations, funds will remain available for drawdown during this period.
(2)
After the due date.
Requests are considered late when they are submitted after the 90-day period following the award expiration date. Requests to submit a final SF-269, Financial Status Report, will only be considered, up to 30 days after the due date, in extenuating circumstances. This request should include a provisional report pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, as well as an anticipated submission date, a justification for the late submission, and a justification for the extenuating circumstances. However, such requests are subject to § 3430.63 or any other statutory or agency policy limitations. If an awardee needs to request additional funds, procedures in paragraph (d) of this section apply.
(d)
Overdue SF-269, Financial Status Reports.
Awardees with overdue SF-269, Financial Status Reports, or other required financial reports (as identified in the award terms and conditions), will have their applicable balances at DHHS-PMS, ASAP, or other electronic
payment system restricted or placed on “manual review,” which restricts the awardee's ability to draw funds, thus requiring prior approval from NIFA. If any remaining available balances are needed by the awardee (beyond the 90-day period following the award expiration date) and the awardee has not requested an extension to submit a final SF-269, Financial Status Report, the awardee will be required to contact AMB to request permission to draw any additional funds and will be required to provide justification and documentation to support the draw. Awardees also will need to comply with procedures in paragraph (c) of this section. AMB will approve these draw requests only in extenuating circumstances, as determined by NIFA.
(e)
SF-272, Federal Cash Transactions Report.
Awardees receiving electronic payments through DHHS-PMS are required to submit their SF-272, Federal Cash Transactions Report, via the DHHS-PMS by the specified dates. Failure to submit this quarterly report by the due date may result in funds being restricted by DHHS-PMS. Awardees not receiving payments through DHHS-PMS may be exempt from this reporting requirement.
(f)
Additional reporting requirements.
NIFA may require additional financial reporting requirements as follows: NIFA may require forecasts of Federal cash requirements in the “Remarks” section of the report; and when practical and deemed necessary, NIFA may require awardees to report in the “Remarks” section the amount of cash advances received in excess of three days (
i.e.
, short narrative with explanations of actions taken to reduce the excess balances). When NIFA needs additional information or more frequent reports, a special provision will be added to the award terms and conditions and identified on the Form NIFA-2009, Award Face Sheet. Should NIFA determine that an awardee's accounting system is inadequate, additional pertinent information to further monitor awards may be requested from the awardee until such time as the system is brought up to standard, as determined by NIFA. This additional reporting requirement will be required via a special provision to the award terms and conditions and identified on the Form-2009, Award Face Sheet.
§ 3430.57
Project meetings.
In addition to reviewing (and monitoring the status of) progress and final technical reports and financial reports, NIFA Program Officers may use regular and periodic conference calls to monitor the awardee's performance as well as PD conferences, workshops, meetings, and symposia to not only monitor the awards, but to facilitate communication and the sharing of project results. These opportunities also serve to eliminate or minimize NIFA funding unneeded duplicative project activities. Required attendance at these conference calls, conferences, workshops, meetings, and symposia will be identified in the RFA and the awardee should develop a proposal accordingly.
§ 3430.58
Prior approvals.
(a)
Subcontracts.
No more than 50 percent of the award may be subcontracted to other parties without prior written approval of the ADO except contracts to other Federal agencies. Any subcontract awarded to a Federal agency under an award must have prior written approval of the ADO. To request approval, a justification for the proposed subcontractual arrangements, a performance statement, and a detailed budget for the subcontract must be submitted to the ADO.
(b)
No-cost extensions of time
—(1)
General.
Awardees may initiate a one-time no-cost extension of the expiration date of the award of up to 12 months unless one or more of the following conditions apply: the terms and conditions of the award prohibit the extension; the extension requires additional Federal funds; and the extension involves any change in the approved objectives or scope of the project. For the first no-cost extension, the awardee must notify NIFA in writing with the supporting reasons and revised expiration date at least 10 days before the expiration date specified in the award.
(2)
Additional requests for no-cost extensions of time before expiration date.
When more than one no-cost extension of time or an extension of more than 12 months is required, the extension(s)
must be approved in writing by the ADO. The awardee should prepare and submit a written request (which must be received no later than 10 days prior to the expiration date of the award) to the ADO. The request must contain, at a minimum, the following information: the length of the additional time required to complete the project objectives and a justification for the extension; a summary of the progress to date; an estimate of the funds expected to remain unobligated on the scheduled expiration date; a projected timetable to complete the portion(s) of the project for which the extension is being requested; and signature of the AR and the PD.
(3)
Requests for no-cost extensions of time after expiration date.
NIFA may consider and approve requests for no-cost extensions of time up to 120 days following the expiration of the award. These will be approved only for extenuating circumstances, as determined by NIFA. The awardee's AR must submit the requirements identified under paragraph (b)(2) of this section as well as an “extenuating circumstance” justification and a description of the actions taken by the awardee to minimize these requests in the future.
(4)
Other requirements.
No-cost extensions of time may not be exercised merely for the purpose of using unobligated balances. All extensions are subject to any statutory term limitations as well as any expiring appropriation limitations under § 3430.63.
§ 3430.59
Review of disallowed costs.
(a)
Notice.
If the NIFA determines that there is a basis for disallowing a cost, NIFA shall provide the awardee written notice of its intent to disallow the cost. The written notice shall state the amount of the cost and the factual and legal basis for disallowing it.
(b)
Awardee response.
Within 60 days of receiving written notice of NIFA's intent to disallow the cost, the awardee may respond with written evidence and arguments to show the cost is allowable, or that , for equitable, practical, or other reasons, shall not recover all or part of the amount, or that the recovery should be made in installments. The 60-day time period may be extended for an additional 30 days upon written request by the awardee; however, such request for an extension of time must be made before the expiration of the 60-day time period specified in this paragraph. An extension of time will be granted only in extenuating circumstances.
(c)
Decision.
Within 60 days of receiving the awardee's written response to the notice of intent to disallow the cost, NIFA shall issue a management decision stating whether or not the cost has been disallowed, the reasons for the decision, and the method of appeal that has been provided under this section. If the awardee does not respond to the written notice under paragraph (a) of this section within the time frame specified in paragraph (b) of this section, NIFA shall issue a management decision on the basis of the information available to it. The management decision shall constitute the final action with respect to whether the cost is allowed or disallowed. In the case of a questioned cost identified in the context of an audit2 CFR 200.521, the management decision will constitute the management decision under 7 CFR 3052.405(a).
(d)
Demand for payment.
If the management decision under paragraph (c) of this section constitutes a finding that the cost is disallowed and, therefore, that a debt is owed to the Government, NIFA shall provide the required demand and notice pursuant to 7 CFR 3.11.
(e)
Review process.
Within 60 days of receiving the demand and notice referred to in paragraph (d) of this section, the awardee may submit a written request to the NIFAOffice of Grants and Financial Management (OGFM) Deputy Director for a review of the final management decision that the debt exists and the amount of the debt. Within 60 days of receiving the written request for a review, the NIFA Deputy Administrator (or other senior NIFA official designated by the NIFA Office of Grants and Financial Management (OGFM) Deputy Director) will issue a final decision regarding the debt. Review by the NIFA Office of Grants and Financial Management (OGFM) Deputy Director or designee constitutes, and will be in accordance
with, the administrative review procedures provided for debts under 7 CFR part 3, subpart F.
[74 FR 45740, Sept. 4, 2009, as amended at 79 FR 76001, Dec. 19, 2014]
§ 3430.60
Suspension, termination, and withholding of support.
(a)
General.
If an awardee has failed to materially comply with the terms and conditions of the award, NIFA may take certain enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, suspending the award pending corrective action, terminating the award for cause, and withholding of support.
(b)
Suspension.
NIFA generally will suspend (rather than immediately terminate) an award to allow the awardee an opportunity to take appropriate corrective action before NIFA makes a termination decision. NIFA may decide to terminate the award if the awardee does not take appropriate corrective action during the period of suspension. NIFA may terminate, without first suspending, the award if the deficiency is so serious as to warrant immediate termination. Termination for cause may be appealed under the NIFA award appeals procedures specified in § 3430.62.
(c)
Termination.
An award also may be terminated, partially or wholly, by the awardee or by NIFA with the consent of the awardee. If the awardee decides to terminate a portion of the award, NIFA may determine that the remaining portion of the award will not accomplish the purposes for which the award was originally made. In any such case, NIFA will advise the awardee of the possibility of termination of the entire award and allow the awardee to withdraw its termination request. If the awardee does not withdraw its request for partial termination, NIFA may initiate procedures to terminate the entire award for cause.
(d)
Withholding of support.
Withholding of support is a decision not to make a non-competing continuation award within the current competitive segment. Support may be withheld for one or more of the following reasons: Adequate Federal funds are not available to support the project; an awardee failed to show satisfactory progress in achieving the objectives of the project; an awardee failed to meet the terms and conditions of a previous award; or for whatever reason, continued funding would not be in the best interests of the Federal Government. If a non-competing continuation award is denied (withheld) because the awardee failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a previous award, the awardee may appeal that determination under § 3430.62.
§ 3430.61
Debt collection.
The collection of debts owed to NIFA by awardees, including those resulting from cost disallowances, recovery of funds, unobligated balances, or other circumstances, are subject to the Department's debt collection procedures as set forth in 7 CFR part 3, and, with respect to cost disallowances, § 3430.59.
§ 3430.62
Award appeals procedures.
(a)
General.
NIFA permits awardees to appeal certain post-award adverse administrative decisions made by NIFA. These include: termination, in whole or in part, of an award for failure of the awardee to carry out its approved project in accordance with the applicable law and the terms and conditions of award or for failure of the awardee otherwise to comply with any law, regulation, assurance, term, or condition applicable to the award; denial (withholding) of a non-competing continuation award for failure to comply with the terms of a previous award; and determination that an award is void (
i.e.,
a decision that an award is invalid because it was not authorized by statute or regulation or because it was fraudulently obtained). Appeals of determinations regarding the allowability of costs are subject to the procedures in § 3430.59.
(b)
Appeal Procedures.
The formal notification of an adverse determination will contain a statement of the awardee's appeal rights. As the first level in appealing an adverse determination, the awardee must submit a request for review to the NIFA official specified in the notification, detailing the nature of the disagreement with the adverse determination and providing supporting documents in accordance with the procedures contained in the notification. The awardee's request to NIFA for review must be received within 60
days after receipt of the written notification of the adverse determination; however, an extension may be granted if the awardee can show good cause why an extension is warranted.
(c)
Decision.
If the NIFA decision on the appeal is adverse to the awardee or if an awardee's request for review is rejected, the awardee then has the option of submitting a request to the NIFA Office of Grants and Financial Management (OGFM) Deputy Director for further review. The decision of the NIFA Office of Grants and Financial Management (OGFM) Deputy Director is considered final.

# Subpart A—General
§ 3550.1
Applicability.
This part sets forth policies for the direct single family housing loan programs operated by the Rural Housing Service (RHS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). It addresses the requirements of sections 502 and 504 of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended, and includes policies regarding both loan and grant origination and servicing. Procedures for implementing these regulations can be found in program handbooks, available in any Rural Development office. Any provision on the expenditure of funds under this part is contingent upon the availability of funds.
§ 3550.2
Purpose.
The purpose of the direct RHS single family housing loan programs is to provide low- and very low-income people who will live in rural areas with an opportunity to own adequate but modest, decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings and related facilities. The section 502 program offers persons who do not currently own adequate housing, and who cannot obtain other credit, the opportunity to acquire, build, rehabilitate, improve, or relocate dwellings in rural areas. The section 504 program offers loans to very low-income homeowners who cannot obtain other credit to repair or rehabilitate their properties. The section 504 program also offers grants to homeowners age 62 or older who cannot obtain a loan to correct health and safety hazards or to make the unit accessible to household members with disabilities.
§ 3550.3
Civil rights.
RHS will administer its programs fairly, and in accordance with both the letter and the spirit of all equal opportunity and fair housing legislation and applicable executive orders. Loans, grants, services, and benefits provided under this part shall not be denied to any person based on race, color, national origin, sex, religion, marital status, familial status, age, physical or mental disability, receipt of income from public assistance, or because the applicant has, in good faith, exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1601
et seq.
). All activities under this part shall be accomplished in accordance with the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3620), Executive Order 11246, and Executive Order 11063, as amended by Executive Order 12259, as applicable. The civil rights compliance requirements for RHS are in 7 CFR part 1901, subpart E.
§ 3550.4
Reviews and appeals.
Whenever RHS makes a decision that is adverse to a participant, RHS will provide the participant with written notice of such adverse decision and the participant's rights to a USDA National Appeals Division hearing in accordance with 7 CFR part 11. Any adverse decision, whether appealable or non-appealable may be reviewed by the next-level RHS supervisor.
§ 3550.5
Environmental requirements.
(a)
Policy.
RHS will consider environmental quality as equal with economic, social, and other relevant factors in program development and decision-making processes. RHS will take into account potential environmental impacts of proposed projects by working with RHS applicants, other federal agencies, Indian tribes, State and local governments, and interested citizens and organizations in order to formulate actions that advance the program's goals in a manner that will protect, enhance, and restore environmental quality.
(b)
Regulatory references.
Processing or servicing actions taken under this part must comply with the environmental review requirements in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970, and 7 CFR part 1924, which addresses lead-based paint.
[61 FR 59779, Nov. 22, 1996, as amended at 81 FR 11048, Mar. 2, 2016]
§ 3550.6
State law or State supplement.
State and local laws and regulations, and the laws of federally recognized Indian tribes, may affect RHS implementation of certain provisions of this regulation, for example, with respect to the treatment of liens, construction, or environmental policies. Supplemental
guidance may be issued in the case of any conflict or significant differences.
§ 3550.7
Demonstration programs.
From time to time, RHS may authorize limited demonstration programs. The purpose of these demonstration programs is to test new approaches to offering housing under the statutory authority granted to the Secretary. Therefore, such demonstration programs may not be consistent with some of the provisions contained in this part. However, any program requirements that are statutory will remain in effect. Demonstration programs will be clearly identified as such.
§ 3550.8
Exception authority.
An RHS official may request, and the Administrator or designee may make, an exception to any requirement or provision of this part or address any omission of this part that is consistent with the applicable statute if the Administrator determines that application of the requirement or provision, or failure to take action in the case of an omission, would adversely affect the Government's interest.
§ 3550.9
Conflict of interest.
(a)
Objective.
It is the objective of RHS to maintain the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and impartiality by employees. To reduce the potential for employee conflict of interest, all processing, approval, servicing, or review activity will be conducted in accordance with 7 CFR part 1900, subpart D by RHS employees who:
(1) Are not themselves the applicant or borrower;
(2) Are not members of the family or close known relatives of the applicant or borrower;
(3) Do not have an immediate working relationship with the applicant or borrower, the employee related to the applicant or borrower, or the employee who would normally conduct the activity; or
(4) Do not have a business or close personal association with the applicant or borrower.
(b)
Applicant or borrower responsibility.
The applicant or borrower must disclose any known relationship or association with an RHS employee when such information is requested.
(c)
RHS employee responsibility.
An RHS employee must disclose any known relationship or association with a recipient, regardless of whether the relationship or association is known to others. RHS employees or members of their families may not purchase a Real Estate Owned (REO) property, security property from a borrower, or security property at a foreclosure sale. Loan closing agents who have been involved with a particular property, as well as members of their families, are also precluded from purchasing such properties.
[61 FR 59779, Nov. 22, 1996; 61 FR 65266, Dec. 11, 1996; 75 FR 59060, Sept. 27, 2010]

# Subpart B—Section 502 Origination
§ 3550.51
Program objectives.
Section 502 of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended authorizes the Rural Housing Service (RHS) to provide financing to help low- and very low-income persons who cannot obtain credit from other sources obtain adequate housing in rural areas. Resources for the section 502 program are limited, and therefore, applicants are required to use section 502 funds in conjunction with funding or financing from other sources, if feasible. Sections 3550.52 through 3550.73 set forth the requirements for originating loans on program terms. Section 3550.74 describes the differences for originating loans on nonprogram (NP) terms.
§ 3550.52
Loan purposes.
Section 502 funds may be used to buy, build, rehabilitate, improve, or relocate an eligible dwelling and provide related facilities for use by the borrower as a permanent residence. In limited circumstances section 502 funds may be used to refinance existing debt.
(a)
Purchases from existing RHS borrowers.
To purchase a property currently financed by an RHS loan, the new borrower will assume the existing RHS indebtedness or receive new loan funds as determined by the Agency. The Agency will periodically determine whether assumptions or new loans are appropriate on a program wide basis based on the best interest of the government, taking into account factors such as funding availability and staff resources. Regardless of the method, loan funds may be used for eligible costs as defined in paragraph (d) of this section or to permit a remaining borrower to purchase the equity of a departing co-borrower.
(b)
Refinancing non-RHS loans.
Debt from an existing non-RHS loan may be refinanced if the existing debt is secured by a lien against the property, RHS will have a first lien position on the security property after refinancing, and:
(1) In the case of loans for existing dwellings, if:
(i) Due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control, the applicant is in danger of losing the property, the debt is over $5,000, and the debt was incurred for eligible program purposes prior to loan application or was a protective advance made by the mortgagee for items covered by the loan to be refinanced, including accrued interest, insurance premiums, real estate tax advances, or preliminary foreclosure costs; or
(ii) If a loan of $5,000 or more is necessary for repairs to correct major deficiencies and make the dwelling decent, safe and sanitary and refinancing is necessary for the borrower to show repayment ability, regardless of the delinquency.
(2) In the case of loans for a building site without a dwelling, if:
(i) The debt to be refinanced was incurred for the sole purpose of purchasing the site;
(ii) The applicant is unable to acquire adequate housing without refinancing; and
(iii) The RHS loan will include funds to construct an appropriate dwelling on the site for the applicant's use.
(3) Debts incurred after the date of RHS loan application but before closing may be refinanced if the costs are incurred for eligible loan purposes and any construction work conforms to the standards specified in this part.
(c)
Refinancing RHS debt.
An existing RHS loan may be refinanced in accordance with § 3550.204 to allow the borrower to receive payment assistance. In addition, depending on the availability of funds and program priorities
as determined by RHS, an existing RHS loan and the related subsidy recapture may be refinanced as allowed under § 3550.201.
(d)
Eligible costs.
Improvements financed with loan funds must be on land which, after closing, is part of the security property. In addition to acquisition, construction, repairs, or the cost of relocating a dwelling, loan funds may be used to pay for:
(1) Reasonable expenses related to obtaining the loan, including legal, architectural and engineering, technical, title clearance, and loan closing fees; and appraisal, surveying, environmental, tax monitoring, and other technical services; and personal liability insurance fees for Mutual Self-Help borrowers.
(2) The cost of providing special design features or equipment when necessary because of a physical disability of the applicant or a member of the household.
(3) Reasonable connection fees, assessments, or the pro rata installment costs for utilities such as water, sewer, electricity, and gas for which the borrower is liable and which are not paid from other funds.
(4) Reasonable and customary lender charges and fees if the RHS loan is being made in combination with a leveraged loan.
(5) Real estate taxes that are due and payable on the property at the time of closing and for the establishment of escrow accounts for real estate taxes, hazard and flood insurance premiums, and related costs.
(6) Packaging fees resulting from the certified loan application packaging process outlined in § 3550.75. The Agency will determine the limit, based on factors such as the level of service provided and the prevailing cost to provide the service, and such cap will not exceed two percent of the national average area loan limit. Nominal packaging fees not resulting from the certified loan application process are an eligible cost provided the fee does not exceed a limit determined by the Agency based on the level and cost of service factors, but no greater than one half percent of the national average area loan limit; the loan application packager is a nonprofit, tax exempt partner that received an exception to all or part of the requirements outlined in § 3550.75 from the applicable Rural Development State Director; and the packager gathers and submits the information needed for the Agency to determine if the applicant is eligible along with a fully completed and signed uniform residential loan application.
(7) Purchasing and installing essential equipment in the dwelling, including ranges, refrigerators, washers or dryers, if these items are normally sold with dwellings in the area and if the purchase of these items is not the primary purpose of the loans.
(8) Purchasing and installing approved energy savings measures and approved furnaces and space heaters that use fuel that is commonly used, economical, and dependably available.
(9) Providing site preparation, including grading, foundation plantings, seeding or sodding, trees, walks, yard fences, and driveways to a building site.
(10) Reasonable fees for homeownership education as determined by the State Director under § 3550.11 of this subpart. Such fees may be added to the loan amount in excess of the area loan limit and appraised value of the house.
(e)
Loan restrictions.
Loan funds may not be used to:
(1) Purchase an existing manufactured home, or for any other purposes prohibited in § 3550.73(b).
(2) Purchase or improve income-producing land or buildings to be used principally for income-producing purposes.
(3) Pay fees, commissions, or charges to for-profit entities related to loan packaging or referral of prospective applicants to RHS.

Income eligibility.
At the time of loan approval, the household's adjusted income must not exceed the applicable low-income limit for the area, and at closing, must not exceed the applicable moderate-income limit for the area (see § 3550.54). When an existing RHS
loan is being refinanced as a special servicing action under § 3550.201), the household's adjusted income must not exceed the applicable moderate-income limit for the area at the time of loan approval and closing.
(b)
Citizenship status.
The applicant must be a United States citizen or a noncitizen who qualifies as a legal alien as defined in § 3550.10.

(f)
Suspension or debarment.
Applications from applicants who have been suspended or debarred from participation in Federal programs will be handled in accordance with 2 CFR parts 180 and 417.
(g)
Repayment ability.
Repayment ability means applicants must demonstrate adequate and dependably available income. The determination of income dependability will include consideration of the applicant's history of annual income.
(1) An applicant is considered to have repayment ability when the monthly amount required for payment of principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI), does not exceed thirty-three percent of the applicant's repayment income (PITI ratio). In addition, the monthly amount required to pay PITI plus recurring monthly debts must not exceed forty-one percent of the applicant's repayment income (total debt ratio).
(2) If the applicant's PITI ratio and total debt ratio exceed the percentages specified by the Agency by a minimal amount, compensating factors may be considered. Examples of compensating factors include payment history (if applicant has historically paid a greater share of income for housing with the same income and debt level), savings history, job prospects, and adjustments for nontaxable income.
(3) If an applicant does not meet the repayment ability requirements in this paragraph (g), the applicant can have another party join the application as a cosigner, have other household members join the application, or both.
(h)
Credit qualifications.
Applicants must be unable to secure the necessary credit from other sources on terms and conditions that the applicant could reasonably be expected to fulfill. Applicants must have a credit history that indicates reasonable ability and willingness to meet debt obligations. An applicant with an outstanding judgment obtained by the United States in a federal court, other than the United States Tax Court, is not eligible for a loan or grant from RHS.
(1) Indicators of unacceptable credit include:
(i) Payments on any account where the amount of the delinquency exceeded one installment for more than 30 days within the last 12 months.
(ii) Payments on any account which was delinquent for more than 30 days on two or more occasions within a 12-month period.

(vi) Two or more rent payments paid 30 or more days late within the last 2 years. If the applicant has experienced no other credit problems in the past 2 years, only 1 year of rent history will be evaluated. Rent payment history requirements may be waived if the RHS loan will reduce shelter costs significantly and contribute to an improved repayment ability.
(vii) Outstanding collection accounts with a record of irregular payment with no satisfactory arrangements for repayment, or collection accounts that were paid in full within the last 6 months.
(viii) Non-agency debts written off within the last 36 months unless paid in full at least 12 months ago.
(ix) Agency debts that were debt settled within the last 36 months or are being considered for debt settlement.
(x) Delinquency on a federal debt.
(2) The following will not be considered indicators of unacceptable credit:

Homeownership education.
Applicants who are first-time homebuyers must agree to provide documentation, in the form of a completion certificate or letter from the provider, that a homeownership education course from a certified provider under § 3550.11 has been successfully completed as defined by the provider. Requests for exceptions to the homeownership education requirement in this paragraph (i) will be reviewed and granted on an individual case-by-case basis. The State Director may grant an exception to the homeownership education requirement for individuals in geographic areas within the State where the State Director verifies that certified homeownership education is not reasonably available in the local area in any of the formats listed in § 3550.11(b).
Whether such homeownership education is reasonably available will be determined based on factors including, but not limited to: Distance, travel time, geographic obstacles, and cost. On a case-by-case basis, the State Director also may grant an exception, provided the applicant borrower documents a special need, such as a disability, that would unduly impede completing a homeownership course in a reasonably available format.

§ 3550.57
Dwelling requirements.
(a)
Modest dwelling.
The property must be one that is considered modest for the area, must not be designed for income producing purposes, or have a market value in excess of the applicable maximum area loan limit, in accordance with § 3550.63, unless RHS authorizes an exception under this paragraph (a). An exception may be granted on a case-by-case basis to accommodate the specific needs of an applicant, such as to serve exceptionally large households or to provide reasonable accommodation for a household member with a disability. Any additional loan amount approved must not exceed the amount required to address the specific need. Existing properties with in-ground swimming pools may be considered modest; however, in-ground swimming pools with new construction or with properties which are purchased new are prohibited.
(1)
Area-wide exception.
Area-wide exceptions may be granted when RHS determines that the section 203(b) limit is too low to enable applicants to purchase adequate housing.
(2)
Individual exceptions.
Individual exceptions may be granted to accommodate the specific needs of an applicant, such as to serve exceptionally large households or to provide reasonable accommodation for a household member with a disability.

§ 3550.58
Ownership requirements.
After the loan is closed, the borrower must have an acceptable interest in the property as evidenced by one of the following.
(a)
Fee-simple ownership.
Acceptable fee-simple ownership is evidenced by a fully marketable title with a deed vesting a fee-simple interest in the property to the borrower.
(b)
Secure leasehold interest.
A written lease is required. To be acceptable, a leasehold interest must have an unexpired term that is at least 150 percent of the term of the mortgage, unless the loan is guaranteed, in which case the unexpired term of the lease must be at least 2 years longer than the loan term. In no case may the unexpired term be less than 25 years.
(c)
Life estate interest.
To be acceptable a life estate interest must provide the borrower with rights of present possession, control, and beneficial use of the property. Generally, persons with any remainder interests must be signatories to the mortgage. All of the
remainder interests need not be included in the mortgage to the extent that one or more of the persons holding remainder interests are not legally competent (and there is no representative who can legally consent to the mortgage), cannot be located, or if the remainder interests are divided among such a large number of people that it is not practical to obtain the signatures of all of the remainder interests. In such cases, the loan may not exceed the value of the property interests owned by the persons executing the mortgage.
(d)
Undivided interest.
All legally competent co-owners will be required to sign the mortgage. When one or more of the co-owners are not legally competent (and there is no representative who can legally consent to the mortgage), cannot be located, or the ownership interests are divided among so large a number of co- owners that it is not practical for all of their interests to be mortgaged, their interests not exceeding 50 percent may be excluded from the security requirements. In such cases, the loan may not exceed the value of the property interests owned by the persons executing the mortgage.
(e)
Possessory rights.
Acceptable forms of ownership include possessory rights on an American Indian reservation or State-owned land and the interest of an American Indian in land held in severalty under trust patents or deeds containing restrictions against alienation, provided that land in trust or restricted status will remain in trust or restricted status.
§ 3550.59
Security requirements.
Before approving any loan, RHS will impose requirements to secure its interests.
(a)
Adequate security.
A loan will be considered adequately secured only when all of the following requirements are met:
(1) RHS obtains at closing a mortgage on all ownership interests in the security property or the requirements of § 3550.58 are satisfied.
(2) No liens prior to the RHS mortgage exist at the time of closing and no junior liens are likely to be taken immediately after or at the time of closing, unless the other liens are taken as part of a leveraging strategy or the RHS loan is essential for repairs. Any lien senior to the RHS lien must secure an affordable non-RHS loan. Liens junior to the RHS lien may be allowed at loan closing if the junior lien will not interfere with the purpose or repayment of the RHS loan. When the junior lien involves a grant or a forgivable affordable housing product, the total debt may exceed the market value provided:
(i) The RHS loan is fully secured (with allowable exceptions for the tax service fee, appraisal fee, homebuyer education and initial escrow for taxes and insurance);
(ii) The junior lien is for an authorized loan purpose identified in § 3550.52; and
(iii) The grant or forgivable affordable housing product comes from a recognized grant source such as a Community Development Block Grant or a HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME).
(3) The provisions of 7 CFR part 1927, subpart B regarding title clearance and the use of legal services have been followed.
(4) Existing and proposed property improvements are totally on the site and do not encroach on adjoining property.
(b)
Guaranteed payment.
Mortgage insurance guaranteeing payment from a Government agency or Indian tribe is adequate security.
[61 FR 59779, Nov. 22, 1996, as amended at 67 FR 78330, Dec. 24, 2002; 87 FR 6772, Feb. 7, 2022]
§ 3550.60
Escrow account.
RHS may require that customers deposit into an escrow account amounts necessary to ensure that the account will contain sufficient funds to pay real estate taxes, hazard and flood insurance premiums, and other related costs when they are due in accordance with the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA) (12 U.S.C. 2601,
et seq.
) and section 501(e) of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended.
§ 3550.61
Insurance.
(a) Borrower responsibility. Any borrower with a secured indebtedness in
excess of $15,000 at the time of loan approval must furnish and continually maintain hazard insurance on the security property, with companies, in amounts, and on terms and conditions acceptable to RHS including a “loss payable clause” payable to RHS to protect the Government's interest.
(b) Amount. The borrower is required to insure the dwelling and any other essential buildings in an amount equal to the insurable value of the dwelling and other essential buildings. However, in cases where the borrower's outstanding secured indebtedness is less than the insurable value of the dwelling and other essential buildings, the borrower may elect a lower coverage provided it is not less than the outstanding secured indebtedness. If the borrower fails, or is unable, to insure the secured property, RHS will force place insurance and charge the cost to the borrower's account. Force place insurance only provides insurance coverage to the Agency and does not provide any direct coverage or benefit to the borrower. The amount of the lender-placed coverage will generally be the property's last known insured value.
(c)
Flood insurance.
Flood insurance must be obtained and maintained for the life of the loan for all property located in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) as determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). RHS actions will be consistent with 7 CFR part 1806, subpart B which addressed flood insurance requirements. If flood insurance through FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program is not available in an SFHA, the property is not eligible for federal financial assistance.
(d)
Losses.
(1) Loss deductible clauses for required insurance coverage may not exceed the generally accepted minimums based on current industry standards and local market conditions.
(2) Customers must immediately notify RHS of any loss or damage to insured property and collect the amount of the loss from the insurance company.
(3) Depending on the amount of the loss, RHS may require that loss payments be supervised. All repairs and replacements done by or under the direction of the borrower, or by contract, will be planned, performed, inspected, and paid for in accordance with 7 CFR part 1924, subpart A.
(4) When insurance funds remain after all repairs, replacements, and other authorized disbursements have been made, the funds will be applied in the following order:
(i) Prior liens, including delinquent property taxes.
(ii) Past-due amounts.
(iii) Protective advances due.
(iv) Released to the customer if the RHS debt is adequately secured.
(5) If a loss occurs when insurance is not in force, the borrower is responsible for making the needed repairs or replacements and ensuring that the insurance is reinstated on the property.
(6) If the borrower is not financially able to make the repairs, RHS may take one of the following actions:
(i) Make a subsequent loan for repairs.
(ii) Subordinate the RHS lien to permit the borrower to obtain funds for needed repairs from another source.
(iii) Permit the borrower to obtain funds secured by a junior lien from another source.
(iv) Make a protective advance to protect the Government's interest.
(v) Accelerate the account.
[61 FR 59779, Nov. 22, 1996, as amended at 70 FR 6552, Feb. 8, 2005; 73 FR 49592, Aug. 22, 2008]
§ 3550.62
Appraisals.
(a)
Requirement.
An appraisal is required when the debt to be secured exceeds $15,000 or whenever RHS determines that it is necessary to establish the adequacy of the security. Appraisals must be made in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices. When other real estate is taken as additional security, it will be appraised if it represents a substantial portion of the security for the loan.
(b)
Fees.
RHS will charge a fee for each loan application that requires an appraisal, except the appraisal fee is not required on appraisals done for subsequent loans needed to make minimal, essential repairs or in cases where another party provides an appraisal
which is acceptable to RHS. Fees collected in connection with a dwelling constructed under an approved conditional commitment will be paid to the contractor at closing to offset the cost of the real estate appraisal that is included in the conditional commitment fee.
§ 3550.63
Maximum loan amount.
Total secured indebtedness must not exceed the area loan limit or market value limitations specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, whichever is lower. Any loan amount for the RHS appraisal, tax monitoring fee, and the charge to establish an escrow account for taxes and insurance will not be subject to the limitations specified below. This section does not apply to loans on NP terms.
(a)
Area loan limit.
(1) The area loan limit is the maximum value of the property RHS will finance in a given locality. This limit is based on a percentage(s) of the applicable local HUD section 203(b) limit. The percentage(s) will be determined by the Agency and published in the program handbook. The area loan limits will be reviewed at least annually and posted to the Agency website.
(2) The maximum loan limit calculated under paragraph (a)(1) will be reduced in the following situations:
(i) When the applicant owns the site or is purchasing the site at a sales price below market value, the market value of the lot will be deducted from the maximum loan limit, and
(ii) When an applicant is receiving a housing grant or other form of affordable housing assistance for purposes other than closing costs, the amount(s) of such grants and affordable housing assistance will be deducted from the maximum loan limit.
(3) The maximum loan limit for self-help housing will be calculated by adding the total of the market value of the lot (including reasonable and typical costs of site development), the cost of construction, and the value of sweat equity. The total of these three factors cannot exceed the limit established in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(b)
Market value limitation.
(1) The market value limitation is 100 percent of market value for existing housing and for new dwellings for which RHS will receive adequate documentation of construction quality and the source of such documentation is acceptable to RHS.
(2) The market value limitation is 90 percent of market value for new dwellings for which adequate documentation of construction quality is not available.
(3) The market value limitation can be increased by:
(i) Up to one percent, if RHS makes a subsequent loan for closing costs only, in conjunction with the sale of an REO property or an assumption.
(ii) The amount necessary to make a subsequent loan for repairs necessary to protect the Government's interest, and reasonable closing costs.
(iii) The amount necessary to refinance an existing borrower's RHS loans, plus closing costs associated with the new loan.

§ 3550.64
Down payment.
Elderly families must use any net family assets in excess of $20,000 towards a down payment on the property. Non-elderly families must use net family assets in excess of $15,000 towards a down payment on the property. Applicants may contribute assets in addition to the required down payment to further reduce the amount to be financed.
[73 FR 49593, Aug. 22, 2008]
§ 3550.65
[Reserved]
§ 3550.66
Interest rate.
Loans will be written using the applicable RHS interest rate in effect at loan approval or loan closing, whichever is lower. Information about current interest rates is available in any Rural Development office.
[67 FR 78330, Dec. 24, 2002]
§ 3550.67
Repayment period.
Loans will be scheduled for repayment over a period that does not exceed the expected useful life of the property as a dwelling. The loan repayment period will not exceed:
(a) Thirty-three years in all cases except as noted in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
(b) Thirty-eight years:
(1) For initial loans, or subsequent loans made in conjunction with an assumption, if the applicant's adjusted income does not exceed 60 percent of the area adjusted median income and the longer term is necessary to show repayment ability.
(2) For subsequent loans not made in conjunction with an assumption if the applicant's initial loan was for a period of 38 years, the applicant's adjusted income at the time the subsequent loan is approved does not exceed 60 percent of area adjusted median income, and the longer terms is necessary to show repayment ability.
(c) Ten years for loans not exceeding an amount determined by the Agency based on factors such as the performance of unsecured loans in the Agency's portfolio and the Agency's budgetary needs, but not to exceed eight percent of the national average area loan limit.
(d) Thirty years for manufactured homes.
[61 FR 59779, Nov. 22, 1996, as amended at 87 FR 6772, Feb. 7, 2022]
§ 3550.68
Payment subsidies.
RHS administers three types of payment subsidies: interest credit, payment assistance method 1, and payment assistance method 2. Payment subsidies are subject to recapture when the borrower transfers title or ceases to occupy the property.
(a)
Eligibility for payment subsidy.
(1) Applicants or borrowers who receive loans on program terms are eligible to receive payment subsidy if they personally occupy the property and have adjusted income at or below the applicable moderate-income limit.
(2) Payment subsidy may be granted for initial loans or subsequent loans made in conjunction with an assumption only if the term of the loan is 25 years or more.
(3) Payment subsidy may be granted for subsequent loans not made in conjunction with an assumption if the initial loan was for a term of 25 years or more.
(b)
Determining type of payment subsidy.
(1) A borrower currently receiving interest credit will continue to receive it for the initial loan and for any subsequent loan for as long as the borrower is eligible for and remains on interest credit.
(2) If a borrower receiving payment assistance using payment assistance method 1 receives a subsequent loan, payment assistance method 2 will be used to calculate the subsidy for the initial loan and subsequent loan.
(3) A borrower who has never received payment subsidy, or who has stopped receiving interest credit or payment assistance method 1, and at a later date again qualifies for a payment subsidy, will receive payment assistance method 2.
(4) A borrower may not opt to change payment assistance methods.
(c)
Calculation of payment assistance.
Regardless of the method used, payment assistance may not exceed the amount necessary if the loan were amortized at an interest rate of one percent.
(1)
Payment Assistance Method 2.
The amount of payment assistance granted is the lesser of the difference between:
(i) The annualized promissory note installments for the combined RHS loan and eligible leveraged loans plus the cost of taxes and insurance less twenty-four percent of the borrower's adjusted income, or
(ii) The annualized promissory note installment for the RHS loan less amount the borrower would pay if the loan were amortized at an interest rate of one percent.
(2)
Payment Assistance Method 1.
The amount of payment assistance granted is the difference between the installment due on the promissory note and the greater of the payment amortized at the equivalent interest rate or the payment calculated based on the required floor payment. In leveraging situations, the equivalent interest rate will be used.
(i) The floor payment, which is defined as a minimum percentage of adjusted income that the borrower must pay for PITI: 22 percent for very low-income borrowers, 24 percent for low-income borrowers with adjusted income below 65 percent of area adjusted
median, and 26 percent for low-income borrowers with adjusted incomes between 65 and 80 percent of area adjusted median; or
(ii) The annualized note rate installment and the payment at the equivalent interest rate, which is determined by a comparison of the borrower's adjusted income to the adjusted median income for the area in which the security property is located. The following chart is used to determine the equivalent interest rate.
When the applicant's adjusted income is:

(d)
Calculation of interest credit.
The amount of interest credit granted is the difference between the note rate installment as prescribed on the promissory note and the greater of:
(1) Twenty percent of the borrower's adjusted income less the cost of real estate taxes and insurance, or
(2) The amount the borrower would pay if the loan were amortized at an interest rate of 1 percent.
(e)
Annual review.
The borrower's income will be reviewed annually to determine whether the borrower is eligible for continued payment subsidy. The borrower must notify RHS whenever an adult member of the household changes or obtains employment, there is a change in household composition, or if income increases by at least 10 percent so that RHS can determine whether a review of the borrower's circumstances is required.
[72 FR 73255, Dec. 27, 2007, as amended at 79 FR 28810, May 20, 2014; 84 FR 29038, June 21, 2019]
§ 3550.69
Deferred mortgage payments.
For qualified borrowers, RHS may defer up to 25 percent of the monthly principal and interest payment at 1 percent for up to 15 years. This assistance may be granted only at initial loan closing and is reviewed annually. Deferred mortgage payments are subject to recapture when the borrower transfers title or ceases to occupy the property.
(a)
Eligibility.
In order to qualify for deferred mortgage payments, all of the following must be true:
(1) The applicants adjusted income at the time of initial loan approval does not exceed the applicable very low-income limits.
(2) The loan term is 38 years, or 30 years for a manufactured home.
(3) The applicant's payments for principal and interest, calculated at a one percent interest rate for the maximum allowable term, plus estimated costs for taxes and insurance exceeds:
(i) For applicants receiving payment assistance, 29 percent of the applicants repayment income by more than $10 per month; or
(ii) For applicants receiving interest credit, 20 percent of adjusted income by more than $10 per month.
(b)
Amount and terms.
(1) The amount of the mortgage payment to be deferred will be the difference between the applicants payment for principal and interest, calculated at one percent interest for the maximum allowable term, plus estimated costs for taxes and insurance and:
(i) For applicants receiving payment assistance, 29 percent of the applicants repayment income.
(ii) For applicants receiving interest credit, 20 percent of adjusted income.
(2) Deferred mortgage payment agreements will be effective for a 12-month period.
(3) Deferred mortgage assistance may be continued for up to 15 years after
loan closing. Once a borrower becomes ineligible for deferred mortgage assistance, the borrower can never again receive deferred mortgage assistance.
(c)
Annual review.
The borrower's income, taxes, and insurance will be reviewed annually to determine eligibility for continued deferred mortgage assistance. The borrower must notify RHS whenever an adult member of the household changes or obtains employment or if income increases by at least 10 percent so that RHS can determine whether a review of the borrower's circumstances is required.
§ 3550.70
Conditional commitments.
A conditional commitment is a determination by RHS that a dwelling offered for sale will be acceptable for purchase by a qualified RHS loan applicant if it is built or rehabilitated in accordance with RHS-approved plans, specifications, and regulations and priced within the lesser of the property's appraised value or the applicable maximum load limit. The conditional commitment does not reserve funds, does not guarantee funding, and does not ensure that an eligible loan applicant will be available to buy the dwelling.
(a)
Eligibility.
To be eligible to request a conditional commitment, the builder, dealer-contractor, or seller must:
(1) Have an adequate ownership interest in the property, as defined in § 3550.58, prior to the beginning of any planned construction;
(2) Have the experience and ability to complete any proposed work in a competent and professional manner;
(3) Have the legal capacity to enter into the required agreements;
(4) Be financially responsible and have the ability to finance or obtain financing for any proposed construction or rehabilitation; and
(5) Comply with the requirements of 7 CFR part 1901, subpart E and all applicable laws, regulations, and Executive Orders relating to equal opportunity. Anyone who receives 5 or more conditional commitments during a 12-month period must obtain RHS approval of an affirmative marketing plan.
(b)
Limitations.
Conditional commitments for new or substantially rehabilitated dwellings will not be issued after construction has started. RHS may limit the total number of conditional commitments issued in any locality based on market demand.
(c)
Commitment period.
A conditional commitment will be valid for 12 months from the date of issuance. The commitment may be extended for up to an additional 6 months if there are unexpected delays in construction caused by such factors as bad weather, materials shortages, or marketing difficulties. Conditional commitments may be canceled if construction does not begin within 60 days after the commitment is issued.
(d)
Conditional commitments involving packaging of applications.
A conditional commitment may be made to a seller, builder, or dealer-contractor who packages an RHS loan application for a prospective purchaser. In cases where the dwelling is to be constructed for sale to a specific eligible applicant, all of the following conditions must be met:
(1) The conditional commitment will not be approved until the applicant's loan has been approved;
(2) Construction will not begin until loan funds are obligated for the loan. Exceptions may be made when it appears likely that funding will be forthcoming and as long as the RHS lien priority is not jeopardized. The sales agreement must indicate that the loan has been approved but not funded and must provide that if the loan is not closed within 90 days of the date of approval, the contractor may terminate the sales agreement and sell the property to another party. If the sales agreement is terminated, the conditional commitment will be honored for another eligible loan applicant for the remaining period of the commitment; and
(3) The RHS loan will be closed only after the dwelling is constructed or the required rehabilitation completed and final inspection has been made.
(e)
Fees.
An application for a conditional commitment must include payment of the conditional commitment fee. The fee will be refunded if for any reason preliminary inspection of the property or investigation of the conditional commitment applicant indicates that a conditional commitment will
not be issued. Application fees will not be refunded for any property on which the required appraisal has been made.
(f)
Failure of conditional commitment applicant or dwelling to qualify.
The conditional commitment applicant will be informed if the conditional commitment is denied. Conditional commitments will be canceled if the property does not meet program requirements.
(g)
Changes in plans, specifications, or commitment price.
The holder of the conditional commitment must request approval for changes in plans, specifications, and commitment price. RHS may approve the changes if the following requirements are met:
(1) The property price does not exceed the maximum loan limit and increases in costs are due to factors beyond the control of the commitment holder; and
(2) The requested changes are justifiable and appropriate.

§ 3550.71
Special requirements for condominiums.
RHS loans may be made for condominium units under the following conditions:
(a) The unit is in a project approved or accepted by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac).
(b) The condominium project complies with the requirements of the condominium enabling statute and all other applicable laws. Any right of first refusal in the condominium documents will not impair the rights of RHS to:
(1) Foreclose or take title to a condominium unit pursuant to the remedies in the mortgage;
(2) Accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure in the event of default by a mortgagor; and
(3) Sell or lease a unit acquired by RHS.
(c) If RHS obtains title to a condominium unit pursuant to the remedies in its mortgage or through foreclosure, RHS will not be liable for more than 6 months of the unit's unpaid regularly budgeted dues or charges accrued before acquisition of the title to the unit by RHS. The homeowners association's lien priority may include costs of collecting unpaid dues.
(d) In case of condemnation or substantial loss to the units or common elements of the condominium project, unless at least two-thirds of the first mortgagees or unit owners of the individual condominium units have given their consent, the homeowners association may not:
(1) By act or omission seek to abandon or terminate the condominium project;
(2) Change the pro rata interest or obligations of any condominium unit in order to levy assessments or charges, allocate distribution of hazard insurance proceeds or condemnation awards, or determine the pro rata share of ownership of each condominium unit in the common elements;
(3) Partition or subdivide any condominium unit;
(4) Seek to abandon, partition, subdivide, encumber, sell, or transfer the common elements by act or omission (the granting of easements for public utilities or other public purposes consistent with the intended use of the common elements by the condominium project is not a transfer within the meaning of this clause); or
(5) Use hazard insurance proceeds for losses to any condominium property (whether units or common elements) for other than the repair, replacement, or reconstruction of the condominium property.
(e) All taxes, assessments, and charges that may become liens prior to the first mortgage under local law relate only to the individual condominium units and not to the condominium project as a whole.
(f) No provision of the condominium documents gives a condominium unit owner or any other party priority over any rights of RHS as first or second mortgagee of the condominium unit
pursuant to its mortgage in the case of a payment to the unit owner of insurance proceeds or condemnation awards for losses to or taking of condominium units or common elements.
(g) If the condominium project is on a leasehold the underlying lease provides adequate security of tenure as described in § 3550.58(b).
(h) At least 70 percent of the units have been sold. Multiple purchases of condominium units by one owner are counted as one sale when determining if the sales requirement has been met.
(i) No more than 15 percent of the unit owners are more than 1 month delinquent in payment of homeowners association dues or assessments at the time the RHS loan is closed.

(3)
Agency-approved intermediaries.
To become an Agency-approved intermediary, an interested party must apply and demonstrate to the Agency's satisfaction that they meet each of the conditions specified below.

(3)
Non-Agency trainers.
Prior to offering the required course to packagers and intermediaries, non-Agency trainers must obtain approval from designated Agency staff. Non-Agency trainers, who will generally be limited to housing nonprofit organizations but may in rare cases include public bodies such as public universities, must provide proof of relevant experience and resources for delivery; present evidence that their individual trainers are competent and knowledgeable on all subject areas; submit course materials for Agency review; agree to maintain attendance records, test results, and updated course materials; and bear the cost of providing the training though a reasonable tuition fee may be charged the course participants. The course content, schedule, and tuition must be approved by RHS and a designated Agency staff member will typically participate in each training session to ensure accuracy of the program information and to serve as a program resource. A list of eligible non-Agency trainers, which is subject to change based on non-Agency trainers' performance, will be published by the Agency.
(d)
Confidentiality.
The Agency-certified loan application packager, qualified employer, Agency-approved intermediary and their agents must safeguard each applicant's personal and financial information.

Rural areas.
Loans may be made only in rural areas designated by RHS. If an area designation is changed to nonrural an existing RHS borrower may receive 504 assistance.

§ 3550.106
Dwelling requirements.
(a)
Modest dwelling.
The property must be one that is considered modest for the area, must not be designed for income producing purposes, or have a market value in excess of the applicable maximum area loan limit, in accordance with § 3550.63.

§ 3550.107
Ownership requirements.
The applicant must have an acceptable ownership interest in the property as evidenced by one of the following:
(a)
Full fee ownership.
Acceptable full fee ownership is evidenced by a fully marketable title with a deed vesting a fee interest in the property to the applicant.
(b)
Secure leasehold interest.
A written lease is required. For loans, the unexpired portion of the lease must not be less than 2 years beyond the term of the promissory note. For grants, the remaining lease period must be at least 5 years. A leasehold for mutual help housing financed by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on Indian lands requires no minimum lease period and constitutes acceptable ownership.
(c)
Life estate interest.
To be acceptable, a life estate interest must provide the applicant with rights of present possession, control, and beneficial use of the property. For secured loans, generally persons with any remainder interests must be signatories to the mortgage. All of the remainder interests need not be included in the mortgage to the extent that one or more of the persons holding remainder interests are not legally competent (and there is no representative who can legally consent to the mortgage), cannot be located, or if the remainder interests are divided among such a large number of people that it is not practical to obtain the signatures of all of the remainder interests. In such cases, the loan may not exceed the value of the property interests owned by the persons executing the mortgage.
(d)
Undivided interest.
An undivided interest is acceptable if there is no reason to believe that the applicant's position as an owner-occupant will be jeopardized as a result of the improvements to be made, and:
(1) In the case of unsecured loans or grants, if any co-owners living or planning to live in the dwelling sign the repayment agreement.
(2) In the case of a secured loan, when one or more of the co-owners are not legally competent (and there is no representative who can legally consent to the mortgage), cannot be located, or the ownership interests are divided among so large a number of co-owners that it is not practical for all of their interests to be mortgaged, their interests not exceeding 50 percent may be excluded from the security requirements. In such cases, the loan may not exceed the value of the property interests owned by the persons executing the mortgage.
(e)
Possessory rights.
Acceptable forms of ownership include possessory right on an American Indian reservation or State-owned land and the interest of an American Indian in land held severalty under trust patents or deeds containing restrictions against alienation, provided that land in trust or restricted status will remain in trust or restricted status.
(f)
Land purchase contract.
A land purchase contract is acceptable if the applicant is current on all payments, and there is a reasonable likelihood that the applicant will be able to continue meeting the financial obligations of the contract.
(g)
Alternative evidence of ownership.
If evidence, as described in paragraphs (a)
through (e) of this section, is not available, RHS may accept any of the following as evidence of ownership:
(1) Records of the local taxing authority that show the applicant as owner and that demonstrate that real estate taxes for the property are paid by the applicant.
(2) Affidavits by others in the community stating that the applicant has occupied the property as the apparent owner for a period of not less than 10 years, and is generally believed to be the owner.
(3) Any instrument, whether or not recorded, which is commonly accepted as evidence of ownership.
§ 3550.108
Security requirements (loans only).
When the total section 504 indebtedness is $7,500 or more, the property will be secured by a mortgage on the property, leasehold interest, or land purchase contract.
(a) RHS does not require a first lien position, but the total of all debts on the secured property may not exceed the value of the security, except by the amount of any required contributions to an escrow account for taxes and insurance and any required appraisal fee.
(b) Title clearance and the use of legal services generally must be conducted in accordance with 7 CFR part 1927, subpart B. These requirements need not be followed for:
(1) Loans where the total section 504 indebtedness does not exceed an amount determined by the Agency based on factors such as average costs for title insurance and closing agents compared to average housing repair costs, but no greater than twenty percent of the national average area loan limit.
(2) Subsequent loans made for minimal essential repairs necessary to protect the Government's interest.
[61 FR 59779, Nov. 22, 1996, as amended at 67 FR 78331, Dec. 24, 2002; 87 FR 6772, Feb. 7, 2022]
§ 3550.109
Escrow account (loans only).
RHS may require that borrowers deposit into an escrow account amounts necessary to ensure that the account will contain sufficient funds to pay real estate taxes, hazard and flood insurance premiums, and other related costs when they are due in accordance with the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA) and section 501(e) of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended.
§ 3550.110
Insurance (loans only).
(a) Borrower responsibility. Any borrower with a secured indebtedness in excess of $15,000 at the time of loan approval must furnish and continually maintain hazard insurance on the security property, with companies, in amounts, and on terms and conditions acceptable to RHS including a “loss payable clause” payable to RHS to protect the Government's interest.
(b) Amount. The borrower is required to insure the dwelling and any other essential buildings in an amount equal to the insurable value of the dwelling and other essential buildings. However, in cases where the borrower's outstanding secured indebtedness is less than the insurable value of the dwelling and other essential buildings, the borrower may elect a lower coverage provided it is not less than the outstanding secured indebtedness. If the borrower fails, or is unable to insure the secured property, RHS will force place insurance and charge the cost to the borrower's account. Force place insurance only provides insurance coverage to the Agency and does not provide any direct coverage or benefit to the borrower. The amount of the lender-placed coverage generally will be the property's last known insured value.
(c)
Flood insurance.
Flood insurance must be obtained and maintained for the life of the loan for all property located in Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) as determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). RHS actions will be consistent with 7 CFR part 1806, subpart B which addresses flood insurance requirements. If flood insurance through FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program is not available in a SFHA, the property is not eligible for federal financial assistance.
(d)
Losses.
(1) Loss deductible clauses for required insurance coverage may not exceed the generally accepted
minimums based on current and local market conditions.
(2) Borrowers must immediately notify RHS of any loss or damage to insured property and collect the amount of the loss from the insurance company.
(3) RHS may require that loss payments be supervised. All repairs and replacements done by or under the direction of the borrower, or by contract, will be planned, performed, inspected, and paid for in accordance with 7 CFR part 1924, subpart A.
(4) When insurance funds remain after all repairs, replacements, and other authorized disbursements have been made, the funds will be applied in the following order:
(i) Prior liens, including delinquent property taxes.
(ii) Delinquency on the account.
(iii) Advances due for recoverable cost items.
(iv) Released to the borrower if the RHS debt is adequately secured.
(5) If a loss occurs when insurance is not in force, the borrower is responsible for making the needed repairs or replacements and ensuring that the insurance is reinstated on the property.
(6) If the borrower is not financially able to make the repairs, RHS may take one of the following actions:
(i) Make a subsequent loan for repairs.
(ii) Subordinate the RHS lien to permit the borrower to obtain funds for needed repairs from another source.
(iii) Permit the borrower to obtain funds secured by a junior lien from another source.
(iv) Make a protective advance to protect the Government's interest.
(v) Accelerate the account and demand payment in full.
[61 FR 59779, Nov. 22, 1996, as amended at 70 FR 6552, Feb. 8, 2005; 73 FR 49593, Aug. 22, 2008]
§ 3550.111
Appraisals (loans only).
An appraisal is required when the section 504 debt to be secured exceeds $15,000 or whenever RHS determines that it is necessary to establish the adequacy of the security. RHS may charge an appraisal fee. Appraisals must be made in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices. When other real estate is taken as additional security it will be appraised if it represents a substantial portion of the security for the loan.
§ 3550.112
Maximum loan and grant.
(a)
Maximum loan permitted.
The sum of all outstanding section 504 loans to one household for one dwelling may not exceed an amount determined by the Agency based on factors such as average loan amounts and repair costs, but no greater than twenty percent of the national average area loan limit.
(1) Transferees who have assumed a section 504 loan and wish to obtain a subsequent section 504 loan are limited to the difference between the unpaid principal balance of the debt assumed and the maximum loan permitted.
(2) For a secured loan, the total of all debts on the secured property may not exceed the value of the security, except by the amount of any required appraisal and tax monitoring fees, and the contributions to an escrow account for taxes and insurance.
(b)
Maximum loan based upon ability to pay.
The maximum loan is limited to the principal balance that can be supported given the amount the applicant has available, as determined by RHS, to repay a loan at 1 percent interest with a 20-year term.
(c)
Maximum grant.
The lifetime total of the grant assistance to any one household or one dwelling may not exceed ten percent of the national average area loan limit.

# Subpart D—Regular Servicing
§ 3550.151
Servicing goals.
This subpart sets forth the Rural Housing Service (RHS) policies for managing the repayment of loans made under sections 502 and 504 of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended.
§ 3550.152
Loan payments.
(a)
Payment terms.
Unless the loan documents specify other loan repayment terms, borrowers are required to make monthly payments. Borrowers with existing loans specifying annual payments may request conversion to monthly payments, and must convert to a monthly payment schedule before any subsequent loan or new payment assistance is approved. Suitable forms of payment are: check, money order, or bank draft. Borrowers who make cash payments will be assessed a fee to cover the cost of conversion to a money order.
(b)
Application of payments.
If a borrower makes less than the scheduled payment, the payment is held in suspense and is not applied to the borrower's account. When subsequent payments are received in an amount sufficient to equal a scheduled payment, the amount will be applied in the following order:
(1) Protective advances charged to the account.
(2) Accrued interest due.
(3) Principal due.
(4) Escrow for taxes and insurance.
(c)
Multiple loans.
When a borrower with multiple loans for the same property makes less than the scheduled payment on all loans, the payment will be applied to the oldest loan and then in declining order of age. Future remittances will be applied beginning with the oldest unpaid installment.
(d)
Application of excess payments.
Borrowers can elect to make payments in excess of the scheduled amount to be applied to principal, provided there are no outstanding fees.
§ 3550.153
Fees.
RHS may assess reasonable fees including a tax service fee, fees for late payments, and fees for checks returned for insufficient funds.
§ 3550.154
Inspections.
RHS or its agent may make reasonable entries upon and inspections of any property used as security for an RHS loan as necessary to protect the interest of the Government. RHS will give the borrower notice at the time of or prior to an inspection.
§ 3550.155
Escrow account.
Escrow accounts will be administered in accordance with RESPA and section 501(e) of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended.
(a) Upon creation of the escrow account, RHS may require borrowers to deposit funds sufficient to pay taxes and insurance premiums applicable to the mortgage for the period since the
last payments were made and to fund a cushion as permitted by RESPA.
(b) Borrowers may elect to escrow at any time during the terms of the loan if the outstanding RHS loan balance is over $2,500.
(c) RHS may require borrowers to escrow in conjunction with any special servicing action.
§ 3550.156
Borrower obligations.
(a) After receiving a loan from RHS, borrowers are expected to meet a variety of obligations outlined in the loan documents. In addition to making timely payments, these obligations include:
(1) Maintaining the security property; and
(2) Maintaining an adequately funded escrow account, or paying real estate taxes, hazard and flood insurance, and other related costs when due.
(b) If a borrower fails to fulfill these obligations, RHS may obtain the needed service and charge the cost to the borrowers account.
§ 3550.157
Payment subsidy.
(a)
Borrowers currently receiving payment subsidy.
(1) RHS will review annually each borrower's eligibility for continued payment subsidy and determine the appropriate level of assistance. To be eligible for payment subsidy renewal, the borrower must also occupy the property.
(2) If the renewal is not completed before the expiration date of the existing agreement, the effective date of the renewal will be either the expiration date of the previous agreement if RHS error caused the delay, or the next due date after the renewal is approved in all other cases.
(3) The borrower must notify RHS whenever an adult member of the household becomes employed or changes employment, there is a change in household composition, or if income increases by at least 10 percent. The household may also report decreases in income. If the change in the household's income will cause the payment for principal and interest to change by at least 10 percent, the household's payment subsidy may be adjusted for a new 12-month period. The new agreement will be effective the due date following the date the borrower's information is verified by RHS.
(b)
Borrowers not currently receiving payment subsidy.
Payment assistance may be granted to borrowers not currently receiving payment subsidy whose loans were approved on or after August 1, 1968, whose income does not exceed the applicable low-income limit for the area, are personally occupying the RHS financed property, and who meet the requirements of § 3550.53(b), (e), and (f). In general, to receive payment assistance the term of the loan at closing must have been at least 25 years. If an account has been reamortized and the initial term of the loan was at least 25 years, payment assistance may be granted even though the term of the reamortized loan is less than 25 years. Payment assistance may be granted on a subsequent loan for repairs with a term of less than 25 years.
(c)
Cancellation of payment subsidy.
RHS will cancel a payment subsidy if the borrower does not occupy the property, has sold or transferred title to the property, or is no longer eligible for payment subsidy.
§ 3550.158
Active military duty.
The Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act requires that the interest rate charged a borrower who enters full-time active military duty after a loan is closed not exceed six percent. Active military duty does not include participation in a military reserve or the National Guard unless the borrower is called to active duty.
(a)
Amount of assistance.
If a borrower qualifies for payment subsidy after reduction of the interest rate to six percent, the amount of payment subsidy received during the period of active military duty will be the difference between the amount due at the subsidized rate for principal and interest and the amount due at a six percent interest rate. The six percent interest rate will be effective with the first payment due after RHS confirms the active military status of the borrower.
(b)
Change of active military status.
The borrower must notify RHS when he or she is no longer on active military duty. RHS will cancel the six percent interest rate and resume use of the promissory note interest rate. A new
payment subsidy agreement may be processed if the borrower is eligible.
§ 3550.159
Borrower actions requiring RHS approval.
(a)
Mineral leases.
Borrowers who wish to lease mineral rights to a security property must request authorization from RHS. RHS may consent to the lease of mineral rights and subordinate its liens to the lessee's rights and interests in the mineral activity if the security property will remain suitable as a residence and the Government's security interest will not be adversely affected. Subordination of RHS loans to a mineral lease does not entitle the leaseholder to any proceeds from the sale of the security property.
(1) If the proposed activity is likely to decrease the value of the security property, RHS may consent to the lease only if the borrower assigns 100 percent of the income from the lease to RHS to be applied to reduce principal and the rent to be paid is at least equal to the estimated decrease in the market value of the security.
(2) If the proposed activity is not likely to decrease the value of the security property, RHS may consent to the lease if the borrower agrees to use any damage compensation received from the lessee to repair damage to the site or dwelling, or to assign it to RHS to be applied to reduce principal.
(b)
Subordination.
RHS may subordinate its interests to permit a borrower to defer recapture amounts and refinance the loan, or to obtain a subsequent loan with private credit.
(1) When it is in the best interest of the Government, subordination will be permitted if:
(i) The other lender will verify that the funds will be used for purposes for which an RHS loan could be made;
(ii) The prior lien debt will be on terms and conditions that the borrower can reasonably be expected to meet without jeopardizing repayment of the RHS indebtedness;
(iii) Any proposed development will be planned and performed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1924, subpart A or directed by the other lender in a manner which is consistent with that subpart; and
(iv) An agreement is obtained in writing from the prior lienholder providing that at least 30 days prior written notice will be given to RHS before action to foreclose on the prior lien is initiated.
(2) The total amount of debt permitted when RHS subordinates its interests depends on whether the borrower pays off the RHS loan.
(i) For situations in which the borrower is obtaining a subsequent loan from another source and will not pay off the RHS debt, the prior lien debt plus the unpaid balance of all RHS loans, exclusive of recapture, will not exceed the market value of the security.
(ii) For situations in which RHS is subordinating only a deferred recapture amount, the prior lien debt plus the deferred recapture amount will not exceed the market value of the security.
(c)
Partial release of security.
RHS may consent to transactions affecting the security, such as sale or exchange of security property or granting of a right-of-way across the security property, and grant a partial release provided:
(1) The compensation is:
(i) For sale of the security property, cash in an amount equal to the value of the security being disposed of or rights granted.
(ii) For exchange of security property, another parcel of property acquired in exchange with value equal to or greater than that being disposed of.
(iii) For granting an easement or right-of-way, benefits derived that are equal to or greater than the value of the security property being disposed of.
(2) An appraisal must be conducted if the latest appraisal is more than 1 year old or if it does not reflect market value and the amount of consideration exceeds $5,000. The appraisal fee will be charged to the borrower.
(3) The security property, after the transaction is completed, will be an adequate but modest, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling and related facilities.
(4) Repayment of the RHS debt will not be jeopardized.
(5) Environmental requirements are met and environmental documentation
is submitted in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970.
(6) When exchange of all or part of the security is involved, title clearance is obtained before release of the existing security.
(7) Proceeds from the sale of a portion of the security property, granting an easement or right-of-way, damage compensation, and all similar transactions requiring RHS consent, will be used in the following order:
(i) To pay customary and reasonable costs related to the transaction that must be paid by the borrower.
(ii) To be applied on a prior lien debt, if any.
(iii) To be applied to RHS indebtedness or used for improvements to the security property in keeping with purposes and limitations applicable for use of RHS loan funds. Proposed development will be planned and performed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1924, subpart A and supervised to ensure that the proceeds are used as planned.
(d)
Lease of security property.
A borrower must notify RHS if they lease the property. If the lease is for a term of more than 3 years or contains an option to purchase, RHS may liquidate the loan. During the period of any lease, the borrower is not eligible for a payment subsidy or special servicing benefits.
[61 FR 59779, Nov. 22, 1996, as amended at 81 FR 11048, Mar. 2, 2016]
§ 3550.160
Refinancing with private credit.
(a)
Objective.
RHS direct loan programs are not intended to supplant or compete with private credit sources. Therefore, borrowers are required to refinance RHS loans with private credit sources when RHS determines that the borrower meets RHS criteria.
(b)
Criteria for refinancing with private credit.
Borrowers must refinance with private credit when RHS determines that the borrower has the ability to obtain other credit at reasonable rates and terms based on their income, assets, and credit history. Reasonable rates and terms are those commercial rates and terms that borrowers are expected to meet when borrowing for similar purposes. Differences in interest rates and terms between RHS and other lenders will not be an acceptable reason for a borrower to fail to refinance with private credit if the available rates and terms are within the borrower's ability to pay.
(c)
Notice of requirement to refinance with private credit.
The financial status of all borrowers may be reviewed periodically to determine their ability to refinance with private credit. A borrower's financial status may be reviewed at any time if information becomes available to RHS that indicates that the borrower's circumstances have changed.
(1) A borrower undergoing review is required to supply, within 30 days of a request from RHS, sufficient financial information to enable RHS to determine the borrowers ability to refinance with private credit. Foreclosure action may be initiated against any borrower who fails to respond.
(2) When RHS determines that a borrower has the ability to refinance with private credit, the borrower will be required to refinance within 90 days.
(3) Within 30 days after being notified of the requirement to refinance with private credit, a borrower may contest the RHS decision and provide additional financial information to document an inability to refinance with private credit.
(d)
Failure to refinance with private credit.
(1) If the borrower is unable to secure private credit, the borrower must submit written statements and documentation to RHS showing:
(i) The lenders contacted.
(ii) The amount of the loan requested by the borrower and the amount, if any, offered by the lenders.
(iii) The rates and terms offered by the lenders or the specific reasons why other credit is not available.
(iv) The information provided by the borrower to the lenders regarding the purpose of the loan.
(2) If RHS determines that the borrower's submission does not demonstrate the borrower's inability to refinance with private credit, or if the borrower fails to submit the required information, foreclosure may be initiated.
(e)
Subordination of recapture amount.
RHS may subordinate its interest in
any deferred recapture amount to permit a borrower to refinance with private credit. The amount to which the RHS debt will be subordinated may include:
(1) The amount required to repay the RHS debt, exclusive of recapture;
(2) Reasonable closing costs;
(3) Up to one percent of the loan amount for loan servicing costs, if required by the lender; and
(4) The cost of any necessary repairs or improvements to the security property.
(f)
Application for additional credit.
A borrower who has been asked to refinance with private credit will not be considered for additional credit until the refinancing issue is resolved unless such additional credit is necessary to protect the Government's interest.
§ 3550.161
Final payment.
(a)
Payment in full.
Full payment of a borrower's account includes repayment of principal and outstanding interest, unauthorized assistance, recapture amounts, and charges made to the borrower's account. Any supervised funds or funds remaining in a borrower's escrow account will be applied to the borrower's account or returned to the borrower.
(b)
Release of security instruments.
RHS may release security instruments when full payment of all amounts owed has been received and verified. If RHS and the borrower agree to settle the account for less than the full amount owed, the security instruments may be released when all agreed-upon amounts are received and verified. Security instruments will not be released until any deferred recapture amount has been paid in full.
(c)
Payoff statements.
At the borrower's request, RHS will provide a written statement indicating the amount required to pay the account in full. RHS may charge a fee for statements for the same account if more than 2 statements are requested in any 30 day period.
(d)
Suitable forms of payment.
Suitable forms of payment are: check, money order, or bank draft. Borrowers who make cash payments will be assessed a fee to cover conversion to a money order.
(e)
Recording costs.
Recording costs for the release of the mortgage will be the responsibility of the borrower, except where State law requires the mortgagee to record or file the satisfaction.
§ 3550.162
Recapture.
(a)
Recapture policy.
Borrowers with loans approved or assumed on or after October 1, 1979, will be required to repay subsidy amounts received through payment subsidy (including the former interest credit program) or deferred mortgage assistance in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Amounts to be recaptured are due and payable when the borrower transfers title or ceases to occupy the property, including but not limited to, in the event of foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure. Such recapture will include the amount of principal reduction attributed to subsidy (for loans subject to recapture that were approved, and received interest credit, between October 1, 1979, and December 31, 1989), except in cases of foreclosure and deed in lieu of foreclosure.
(b)
Amount to be recaptured
—(1)
General.
The amount to be recaptured is determined by a calculation specified in the borrower's subsidy repayment agreement and is based on the borrower's equity in the property at the time of loan pay off. If there is no equity based on the recapture calculation, the amount of principal reduction attributed to subsidy is not collected. The recapture calculation includes the amount of principal reduction attributed to subsidy plus the lesser of:
(i) The amount of subsidy received; or
(ii) A portion of the value appreciation of the property subject to recapture. In order for the value appreciation to be calculated, the borrower will provide a current appraisal, including an appraisal for any capital improvements, or arm's length sales contract as evidence of market value upon Agency request. Appraisals must meet Agency standards under § 3550.62.
(2)
Foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the amount to be recaptured in a foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure is the amount of
subsidy received, not including any principal reduction attributed to subsidy. Foreclosure actions will seek to recover such amounts only from the proceeds of the property. Liquidation proceeds (in the case of foreclosure) or the net recovery value (in the case of deed in lieu of foreclosure) will be applied or credited to the borrower's debt in accordance with the security agreement in the following order:
(i) Recoverable costs (e.g. protective advances, foreclosure costs, late charges).
(ii) Accrued interest.
(iii) Principal.
(iv) Subsidy.
(3)
Value appreciation.
The value appreciation of property with a cross-collateralized loan is based on the market value of the dwelling and lot. If located on a farm, the lot size would be a typical lot for a single family housing property.
(4)
Interest
reduced from the promissory note rate to six percent under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) is not subject to recapture.
(c)
Deferral of recapture.
If the borrower refinances or otherwise pays in full without transfer of title and continues to occupy the property, the amount of recapture will be calculated in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section but payment of recapture may be deferred, interest free, until the property is sold or vacated. If the recapture amount is deferred, the Agency mortgage can be subordinated when in the Government's best interest but will not be released nor the promissory note satisfied until the Agency is paid in full. In situations where deferral of recapture is an option, recapture will be discounted if paid in full at the time of settlement or timely paid after Agency notification to the borrower that recapture is due.
(d)
Assumed loans.
(1) When a loan subject to recapture is assumed under new rates and terms, the recapture amount may be paid in full by the seller or included in the principal amount assumed by the buyer.
(2) When a loan is assumed under the same rates and terms as the original promissory note, recapture amounts will not be due. When the new borrower transfers title or ceases to occupy the property, all subsidy subject to recapture before and after the assumption is due.
(3) When a borrower has deferred payment of recapture amounts, the deferred recapture amount may be included in the principal amount of the new loan.

§ 3550.163
Transfer of security and assumption of indebtedness.
(a)
General policy.
RHS mortgages contain due-on-sale clauses that generally require RHS consent before title to a security property can be transferred with an assumption of the indebtedness. If it is in the best interest of the Government, RHS will approve the transfer of title and assumption of indebtedness on program or nonprogram (NP) terms, depending on the transferee's eligibility and the property's characteristics.
(b)
RHS approval of assumptions.
(1) A borrower with a loan on program terms who wishes to transfer a security property restricted by a due-on-sale clause to a purchaser who wishes to assume the debt must receive prior authorization from RHS. If RHS authorizes the transfer and assumption, the account will be serviced in the purchaser's name and the purchaser will be liable for the loan under the terms of the security instrument.
(2) If a borrower transfers title to the security property with a due-on-sale clause without obtaining RHS authorization, RHS will not approve assumption of the indebtedness, and the loan will be liquidated unless RHS determines that it is in the Government's best interest to continue the loan. If RHS decides to continue the loan, the account will be serviced in the original borrower's name and the original borrower will remain liable for the loan under the terms of the security instrument.
(c)
Exceptions to due-on-sale clauses.
(1) Due-on-sale clauses are not triggered by the following types of transfers:
(i) A transfer from the borrower to a spouse or children not resulting from the death of the borrower.
(ii) A transfer to a relative, joint tenant, or tenant by the entirety resulting from the death of the borrower.
(iii) A transfer to a spouse or ex-spouse resulting from a divorce decree, legal separation agreement, or property settlement agreement.
(iv) A transfer to a person other than a deceased borrower's spouse who wishes to assume the loan for the benefit of persons who were dependent on the deceased borrower at the time of death, if the dwelling will be occupied by one or more persons who were dependent on the borrower at the time of death, and there is a reasonable prospect of repayment.
(v) A transfer into an inter vivos trust in which the borrower does not transfer rights of occupancy in the property.
(2) A transferee who obtains property through one of the types of transfer listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section:
(i) Is not required to assume the loan, and RHS is not permitted to liquidate the loan, if the transferee continues to make scheduled payments and meet all other obligations of the loan. A transferee who does not assume the loan is not eligible for payment assistance or a moratorium.
(ii) May assume the loan on the rates and terms contained in the promissory note, with no down payment. If the account is past due at the time an assumption is executed, the account may be brought current by using any of the servicing methods discussed in subpart E of this part.
(iii) May assume the loan under new rates and terms if the transferee applies and is program-eligible.
(3) Any subsequent transfer of title, except upon death of the inheritor or between inheritors to consolidate title, will be treated as a sale.
(d)
Requirements for an assumption.
(1) Loans secured by program-eligible properties to be assumed by program-eligible purchasers may be assumed on program terms. Loans secured by nonprogram properties and loans to be assumed by purchasers who are not eligible for program terms may be assumed on NP terms.
(2) The amount the transferee will assume will be either the current market value less any prior liens and any required down payment, or the indebtedness, whichever is less.
(3) For loans assumed on program terms, the interest rate charged by RHS will be the rate in effect at loan approval or loan closing, whichever is lower. For loans assumed on nonprogram terms, the interest rate will be the rate in effect at the time of loan approval.
(4) If additional financing is required to purchase the property or to make repairs, RHS may approve a subsequent loan under subparts B or C of this part.
(5) If an appraisal is required for an assumption on new terms, the purchaser is responsible for the appraisal fee.
(6) If all or a portion of the borrower's account balance is assumed, the borrower and cosigner, if any, will be released from liability on the amount of the indebtedness assumed. If an account balance remains after the assumption, RHS may pursue debt settlement in accordance with subpart F of this part.
(7) Unless it is in the Government's best interest, RHS will not approve an assumption of a secured loan if the seller fails to repay any unsecured RHS loan.
(8) If a loan is secured by a property with a dwelling situated on more than a minimum adequate site and the excess property cannot be sold separately as a minimum adequate site for another dwelling, RHS may approve a transfer of the entire property. If the excess property can be sold separately as a minimum adequate site, RHS will approve assumption of only the dwelling and the minimum adequate site. If the value of the dwelling on the minimum adequate site is less than the amount of the outstanding RHS debt, the remaining debt will be secured by the excess property. The outstanding debt will be converted to an NP loan and reamortized over a period not to exceed 10 years or the final due date of the original promissory note, whichever is sooner.

§ 3550.164
Unauthorized assistance.
(a)
Definition.
Unauthorized assistance includes any loan, payment subsidy, deferred mortgage payment, or grant for which the recipient was not eligible.
(b)
Unauthorized assistance due to false information.
(1) False information includes information that the recipient knew was incorrect or should have known was incorrect that was provided or omitted for the purposes of obtaining assistance for which the recipient was not eligible.
(2) If the recipient receives an unauthorized loan due to false information, RHS will adjust the account using the NP interest rate that was in effect when the loan was approved. The recipient must pay the account in full within 30 days.
(3) If the recipient receives unauthorized subsidy due to false information, RHS will require the recipient to repay it within 30 days. The account cannot be reamortized to include the unauthorized subsidy. If the recipient repays the unauthorized subsidy, the loan may be continued.
(c)
Unauthorized assistance due to inaccurate information.
(1) Inaccurate information includes incorrect information inadvertently provided, used, or omitted without the intent to obtain benefits for which the recipient was not eligible.
(2) RHS will permit a recipient who receives an unauthorized loan due to inaccurate information to retain the loan under the following conditions.
(i) If the inaccurate information was related to the purpose of the loan or the recipient's eligibility, with the exception of income, or the income used was incorrect, but the recipient still qualified as income-eligible, RHS will allow the recipient to continue the loan on existing terms.
(ii) If a section 502 recipient's income was above the moderate-income level, RHS will convert the loan to an NP loan, using the nonprogram interest rate in effect on the date the loan was approved.
(iii) If a section 504 recipient's income was above the very low-income level, RHS will apply the applicable 502 or nonprogram interest rate in effect on the date the loan was approved.
(iv) If an incorrect interest rate was used, RHS will adjust the account using the correct interest rate.
(3) If the recipient receives unauthorized subsidy due to inaccurate information, RHS will require the recipient to repay it within 30 days. If the recipient cannot repay it within 30 days, the account may be reamortized. If the recipient repays the unauthorized subsidy or reamortizes the loan, the loan may be continued.
(d)
Unauthorized grants.
Recipients may either repay the unauthorized assistance in a lump sum or execute a promissory note, regardless of whether the unauthorized assistance was due to false or inaccurate information. RHS may seek a judgment if the recipient refuses to repay the unauthorized assistance.
(e)
Account servicing.
RHS will adjust all accounts retroactively to establish the amount of unauthorized assistance. If the recipient does not repay the unauthorized assistance within 30 days, RHS may accelerate the loan. If the unauthorized assistance is due to inaccurate information and the recipient is unable to repay within 30 days, RHS may reamortize the loan.
(f)
Accounts with no security.
If an unauthorized loan or grant is unsecured, RHS may seek the best mortgage obtainable.

# Subpart E—Special Servicing
§ 3550.201
Purpose of special servicing actions.
The Rural Housing Service (RHS) may approve special servicing actions to reduce the number of borrower failures that result in liquidation. Borrowers who have difficulty keeping their accounts current may be eligible for one or more available servicing options including: Payment assistance; delinquency workout agreements that temporarily modify payment terms; protective advances of funds for taxes, insurance, and other approved costs; and payment moratoriums. Subject to the availability of funds and Agency priorities, refinancing may be available as a special servicing option in accordance with § 3550.52(c).
[87 FR 6773, Feb. 7, 2022]
§ 3550.202
Past due accounts.
An account is past due if the scheduled payment is not received by the due date, or as authorized by State law.
(a)
Late fee.
A late fee will be assessed if the full scheduled payment is not received by the 15th day after the due date.
(b)
Liquidation
—(1)
For borrowers with monthly payments.
The account may be accelerated without further servicing when at least 3 scheduled payments are past due or an amount equal to at least 2 scheduled payments is past due for at least 3 consecutive months. In such cases RHS may pursue voluntary liquidation and foreclosure.
(2)
For borrowers with annual payments.
The account may be accelerated without further servicing when at least
3/12
of 1 scheduled payment has not been received by its due date. In such cases, RHS may pursue voluntary liquidation and foreclosure.
(3)
Subsidy recapture.
Acceleration under this section will take into account any subsidy recapture due under § 3550.162.
[61 FR 59779, Nov. 22, 1996, as amended at 77 FR 3379, Jan. 24, 2012]
§ 3550.203
General servicing actions.
Whenever any of the servicing actions described in this subpart result in reamortization of the account RHS may:
(a) Require a borrower who currently makes annual payments, but receives a monthly income, to convert to monthly payments.
(b) Require the creation and funding of an escrow account for real estate taxes and insurance, if one does not already exist for any borrower with monthly payments.
(c) Convert the method of calculating interest for any account being charged daily simple interest to an amortized payment schedule.
§ 3550.204
Payment assistance.
Borrowers who are eligible may be offered payment assistance in accordance with subpart B of this part. Borrowers who are not eligible for payment assistance because the loan was approved before August 1, 1968, or the loan was made on above-moderate or nonprogram (NP) terms, may refinance the loan in order to obtain payment assistance if:
(a) The borrower is eligible to receive a loan with payment assistance;
(b) Due to circumstances beyond the borrower's control, the borrower is in danger of losing the property; and
(c) The property is program-eligible.
§ 3550.205
Delinquency workout agreements.
Borrowers with past due accounts may be offered the opportunity to avoid liquidation by entering into a delinquency workout agreement that specifies a plan for bringing the account current. To receive a delinquency workout agreement, the following requirements apply:
(a) A borrower who is able to do so will be required to pay the past-due amount in a single payment.
(b) A borrower who is unable to pay the past-due amount in a single payment must pay monthly all scheduled payments plus an agreed upon additional amount that brings the account current within 2 years or the remaining term of the loan, whichever is shorter.
(c) If a borrower becomes more than 30 days past due under the terms of a delinquency workout agreement, RHS may cancel the agreement.
§ 3550.206
Protective advances.
RHS may pay for fees or services and charge the cost against the borrower's account to protect the Governments interest.
(a)
Advances for taxes and insurance.
RHS may advance funds to pay real estate taxes, hazard and flood insurance premiums, and other related costs, as well as amounts needed to fund the current escrow cycle.
(b)
Advances for costs other than taxes and insurance.
Protective advances for costs other than taxes and insurance, such as emergency repairs, will be made only if the borrower cannot obtain a subsequent loan.
(c)
Repayment arrangements.
(1) Advances for borrowers with multiple loans will be charged against the largest loan.
(2) Amounts advanced will be due with the next scheduled payment. RHS may schedule repayment consistent with the borrowers ability to repay or reamortize the loan.
(3) Advances will bear interest at the promissory note rate of the loan to which the advance was charged.
§ 3550.207
Payment moratorium.
RHS may defer a borrowers scheduled payments for up to 2 years. NP borrowers are not eligible for a payment moratorium.
(a)
Borrower eligibility.
For a borrower to be eligible for a moratorium, all of the following conditions must be met:
(1) Due to circumstances beyond the borrower's control, the borrower is temporarily unable to continue making scheduled payments because:
(i) The borrower's repayment income fell by at least 20 percent within the past 12 months;
(ii) The borrower must pay unexpected and unreimbursed expenses resulting from the illness, injury, or death of the borrower or a family member; or
(iii) The borrower must pay unexpected and unreimbursed expenses resulting from damage to the security property in cases where adequate hazard insurance was not available or was prohibitively expensive.
(2) The borrower occupies the dwelling, unless RHS determines that it is uninhabitable.
(3) The borrower's account is not currently accelerated.
(b)
Reviews of borrower eligibility.
(1) Periodically RHS may require the borrower to submit financial information to demonstrate that the moratorium should be continued. The moratorium may be canceled if:
(i) The borrower does not respond to a request for financial information;
(ii) RHS receives information indicating that the moratorium is no longer required; or
(iii) In the case of a moratorium granted to pay unexpected or unreimbursed expenses, the borrower cannot show that an amount at least equal to the deferred payments has been applied toward the expenses.
(2) At least 30 days before the moratorium is scheduled to expire, the borrower must provide financial information needed to process the re-amortization of the loan(s).
(c)
Resumption of scheduled payments.
When the moratorium expires or is cancelled, the loan will be re-amortized to include the amount deferred during the moratorium and the borrower will be required to escrow. If the new monthly payment, after consideration of the maximum amount of payment subsidy available to the borrower, exceeds the borrower's repayment ability, all or part of the interest that has accrued during the moratorium may be forgiven so that the new monthly payment optimizes both affordability to the borrower as well as the best interest of the Government.
[61 FR 59779, Nov. 22, 1996, as amended at 87 FR 6773, Feb. 7, 2022]
§ 3550.208
Reamortization using promissory note interest rate.
Reamortization using the promissory note interest rate may be authorized when RHS determines that reamortization is required to enable the borrower to meet scheduled obligations, and only if the Government's lien priority is not adversely affected.
(a)
Permitted uses.
Reamortization at the promissory note interest rate may be used to accomplish a variety of servicing actions, including to:
(1) Repay unauthorized assistance due to inaccurate information.
(2) Repay principal and interest accrued and advances made during a moratorium.
(3) Bring current an account under a delinquency workout agreement after the borrower has demonstrated the willingness and ability to meet the terms of the loan and delinquency workout agreement and reamortization is in the borrower's and Government's best interests.
(4) Bring a delinquent account current in the case of an assumption where the due on sale clause is not triggered as described in § 3550.163(c).
(5) Cover the remaining debt when a portion of the security property is being transferred but the acquisition price does not cover the outstanding debt. The remaining balance will be reamortized for a period not to exceed 10 years or the final due date of the note being reamortized, whichever is sooner.
(6) Bring an account current where the National Appeals Division (NAD) reverses an adverse action, the borrower has adequate repayment ability, and RHS determines the reamortization is in the best interests of the Government and the borrower.
(b)
Payment term of reamortized loan.
Except as noted in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the term of the reamortized loan may be extended to the maximum term for which the borrower was eligible at the time the loan was originally made, less the number of years the loan has been outstanding. In all cases, the term must not exceed the remaining security life of the property.

§ 3550.211
Liquidation.
(a)
Policy.
When RHS determines that a borrower is unable or unwilling to meet loan obligations, RHS may accelerate the loan and, if necessary, acquire the security property. The borrower is responsible for all expenses associated with liquidation and acquisition. If the account is satisfied in full, the borrower will be released from liability. If the account is not satisfied in full, RHS may pursue any deficiency unless the borrower received a moratorium at any time during the life of the loan and faithfully tried to repay the loan.
(b)
Tribal allotted or trust land.
Liquidations involving a security interest in tribal allotted or trust land shall only be pursued after offering to transfer the account to an eligible tribal member, the tribe, or the Indian Housing Authority. Forced liquidation of RHS security interests in Indian trust lands or on tribal allotted land will be recommended only after the State Director has determined it is in the best interest of the Government.
(c)
Acceleration and foreclosure.
If RHS determines that foreclosure is in the best interest of the Government, RHS will send an acceleration notice to each borrower and any cosigner.
(d)
Voluntary liquidation.
Borrowers may voluntarily liquidate through:

Refinancing or sale.
The borrower may refinance or sell the security property for at least net recovery value and apply the proceeds to the account.

only after the debt has been accelerated and when it is in the Government's best interest.
(3)
Offer by third party.
If a junior lienholder or cosigner makes an offer in the amount of at least the net recovery value, RHS may assign the note and mortgage.
(e)
Bankruptcy.
(1) When a petition in bankruptcy is filed by a borrower after acceleration, collection actions and foreclosure actions are suspended in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.
(2) RHS may accept conveyance of security property by the trustee in bankruptcy if the Bankruptcy Court has approved the transaction, RHS determines the conveyance is in the best interest of the Government, and RHS will acquire title free of all liens and encumbrances except RHS liens.
(3) Whenever possible in a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, a reaffirmation agreement will be signed by the borrower and approved by the court prior to discharge, if RHS decides to continue with the borrower.
(f)
Junior lienholder foreclosure.
When a junior lienholder foreclosure does not result in payment in full of the RHS debt but the property is sold subject to the RHS lien, RHS may liquidate the account unless the new owner is eligible to assume the RHS debt and actually assumes the RHS debt.
(g)
Payment subsidy.
If the borrower is receiving payment subsidy, the payment subsidy agreement will not be canceled when the debt is accelerated, but will not be renewed unless the account is reinstated.
(h)
Eligibility for special servicing actions.
A borrower is not eligible for special servicing actions once the account has been accelerated.
(i)
Reporting.
RHS may report to IRS and credit reporting agencies any debt settled through liquidation.

§ 3550.251
Property management and disposition.
(a)
Policy.
Rural Housing Service (RHS) will manage custodial property and Real Estate Owned (REO) property to protect the Government's interest, and may dispose of REO property through direct sales, sealed bid, or auction. RHS will follow affirmative fair housing marketing policies.
(b)
Custodial property.
RHS may take custodial possession of security property that has been abandoned, or for other reasons necessary to protect the Government's security. After taking custodial possession of a security property, RHS may maintain and repair the security property as needed to protect the Government's interest, pay required real estate taxes and assessments, and secure personal property left on the premises. Expenses will be charged to the borrower's account. Custodial property may be leased when it is in the Government's best interest and in such cases the borrower's account will be credited for income from the security property.
(c)
REO property
—(1)
Classification.
When RHS takes title to a security property, it is classified as either program or nonprogram (NP) property. An REO property that is eligible for financing under the section 502 program, or which could reasonably be repaired to be eligible, is classified as program property. An REO property that cannot reasonably be repaired to be eligible as section 502 property, and property that has been improved to a point that it
will no longer qualify as modest under section 502, is classified as NP property.
(2)
Disclosing decent, safe, and sanitary defects.
When RHS determines that an REO property to be sold is not decent, safe, and sanitary, or does not meet cost-effective energy conservation standards, it will disclose the reasons why. The deed by which such an REO property is conveyed will contain a covenant restricting it from residential use until it is decent, safe, and sanitary and meets the RHS cost-effective energy conservation standards. RHS will also notify any potential purchaser of any known lead-based paint hazards.
(3)
Property on Indian tribal allotted or trust land.
REO property which is located on Indian tribal allotted or trust land, will be sold or otherwise disposed of only to a member of the particular tribe having jurisdiction over the allotted or tribal land, to the tribe, or to an Indian housing authority serving the tribe on a first-come, first-served basis.
(4)
Sale of program REO properties.
For no less than 30 days after a program REO property is listed for sale, the property will be reserved for sale to eligible direct or guaranteed single family housing very-low, low- or moderate income applicants under this part or part 3555 of this title, and for sale or lease to nonprofit organizations or public bodies providing transitional housing and turnkey housing for tenants of such transitional housing in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 11408a. Offers from eligible direct or guaranteed single family housing applicants are evaluated at the listed price, not the offering price. Priority of offers received the same day from eligible direct or guaranteed single family housing applicants will be given to applicants qualifying for veterans' preference, cash offers from highest to lowest, then credit offers from highest to lowest. Acceptable offers of equal priority received on the same business day are selected by lot. After the expiration of a reservation period, REO properties can be bought by any buyer.
(5)
Sale by sealed bid or auction.
RHS may authorize the sale of an REO property by sealed bid or public auction when it is in the best interest of the Government.
(d)
Special purposes.
(1) REO property may be purchased for conversion to multiple family housing.
(2) RHS shall follow the standards and procedures in 42 U.S.C. 11408a for the sale or lease of an REO property to a public agency or nonprofit organization. The terms of the sale and lease, and the entity seeking to purchase or lease the REO property, must meet the requirements in 42 U.S.C. 11408a.
(3) REO property may be sold under special provisions to nonprofit organizations or public bodies for the purpose of providing affordable housing to very low- and low-income families.
[61 FR 59779, Nov. 22, 1996, as amended at 67 FR 78332, Dec. 24, 2002; 87 FR 6773, Feb. 7, 2022]
§ 3550.252
Debt settlement policies.
(a)
Applicability.
Debt settlement procedures may be initiated to collect any amounts due to RHS including:
(1) Balances remaining on loan accounts after all liquidation proceeds or credits have been applied;
(2) Subsidy recapture or grant amounts due; and
(3) Unauthorized assistance due.
(b)
Judgment.
RHS may seek a judgment whenever a judgment might enable RHS to collect all or a significant portion of an amount owed.
(c)
Multiple loans.
RHS does not settle debts for one loan while other RHS loans on the same security property remain active.
(d)
Cosigners and claims against estates.
RHS may use any and all remedies available under law to collect from any cosigner and from a deceased borrower's estate.
(e)
Reporting.
RHS will report to the Internal Revenue Service and credit reporting agencies any debt settled through cancellation, compromise, or adjustment.
(f)
Settlement during legal or investigative action.
Cases that are under investigation for fiscal irregularity or have been referred to the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of the General Counsel, or the U.S. Attorney will not be considered for debt settlement until final action by the investigating or prosecuting entity has been taken.
(g)
Offsets.
RHS may request offsets as described in § 3550.210 to collect amounts owed.
(h)
Escrow funds.
At liquidation all funds held in escrow or unapplied funds will be applied against the debt.
§ 3550.253
Settlement of a debt by compromise or adjustment.
Compromise or adjustment offers may be initiated by the debtor or by RHS. RHS will approve only those compromises and adjustments that are in the best interest of the Government.
(a)
Compromise.
A compromise is an agreement by RHS to release a debtor from liability upon receipt of a specified lump sum that is less than the total amount due.
(b)
Adjustments.
An adjustment is an agreement by RHS to release a debtor from liability generally upon receipt of an initial lump sum representing the maximum amount the debtor can afford to pay and periodic additional payments over a period of up to 5 years.
(c)
Timing of offers.
(1) For a settlement offer to be considered, secured debts must be fully matured under the terms of the debt instrument or must have been accelerated by RHS.
(2) Unsecured debts owed after the sale of the security property may be proposed for compromise or adjustment at any time. Debts that were never secured may be proposed for compromise or adjustment when they are due and payable.
(d)
Retention of security property.
The debtor may retain the security property if the compromise payment is at least equal to the net recovery value, and it is in the best interest of the Government to allow the debtor to retain the security property.

# Subpart A—General
§ 3555.1
Applicability.
This part sets forth policies for the Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program (SFHGLP) administered by USDA Rural Development. It addresses the requirements of section 502(h) of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended, and includes policies regarding originating, servicing, holding and liquidating SFHGLP loans. Any provision regarding the expenditure of funds under this part is contingent upon the availability of funds.
§ 3555.2
Purpose.
(a)
General.
The purpose of the SFHGLP is to provide low- and moderate-income persons who will live in rural areas with an opportunity to own decent, safe and sanitary dwellings and related facilities. The SFHGLP offers applicants without sufficient resources to provide the necessary housing on their own account, and unable to secure the credit necessary for such housing from other sources upon terms and conditions, which the applicant can reasonably be expected to fulfill without the guarantee, an opportunity to acquire, build, rehabilitate, improve, or relocate dwellings in rural areas.
(b)
Demonstration programs.
Rural Development may authorize limited demonstration programs as allowed by law. The objective of these demonstration programs will be to test new approaches to offering housing under the statutory authority granted to the Secretary. Therefore, such demonstration programs may not be consistent with all of the provisions contained in this part. However, any statutory SFHGLP requirements will remain in effect.
§ 3555.3
Civil rights.
Rural Development, lenders, and their agents must administer the program fairly, and in accordance with both the letter and the spirit of all equal opportunity, equal credit opportunity and fair housing legislation, and applicable executive orders. Loan guarantees, services, and benefits provided under this part shall not be denied to any person based on race, color, national origin, sex, religion, marital status, familial status, age (provided the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract), handicap, receipt of income from public assistance, sexual orientation, or because the applicant has, in good faith, exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1601
et seq.
). All activities under this part shall be accomplished in accordance with the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3620),
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C. 1691), and Executive Order 11063 as amended by Executive Order 12259, as applicable. Rural Development's civil rights compliance requirements are provided in 7 CFR part 1901, subpart E.
§ 3555.4
Mediation and appeals.
Whenever Rural Development makes a decision that will adversely affect a participant, the participant may proceed with alternative dispute resolution including mediation and a USDA National Appeals Division hearing in accordance with 7 CFR parts 1 and 11. The participant also may request an informal review of the adverse decision made by Rural Development. Except when the adverse decision applies to a loss claim, the applicant or borrower and the lender may participate in the appeal process. Adverse decisions made by the lender cannot be appealed unless concurrence by Rural Development was required by this subpart and obtained by the lender.
§ 3555.5
Environmental requirements.
(a)
Policy.
Rural Development will consider environmental quality, economic, social, and other relevant factors in program development and decision-making processes. Rural Development will take into account potential environmental impacts of proposed projects by working with applicants, other Federal agencies, American Indian tribes, State and local governments, and interested citizens and organizations in order to formulate actions that advance the program's goals in a manner that will protect environmental quality.
(b)
Regulatory references.
Loan processing or servicing actions taken under this part must comply with the environmental review requirements in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970, and 7 CFR part 1924, which addresses lead-based paint.
(c)
Agency responsibilities.
Rural Development is responsible for compliance with all applicable environmental regulations and statutes.
(d)
Lender and loan applicant responsibilities.
(1) Lenders must use due diligence in regard to potential environmental hazards to ensure the property is decent, safe and sanitary and of sufficient value to adequately secure the loan. The level of due diligence review to determine potential environmental hazards must be equivalent to the standards established by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, or the VA.
(2) Mortgage loan transactions will be subject to the requirements of the 1994 National Flood Insurance Reform Act to determine if the dwelling is located in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA).
(3) On an as needed basis, lenders and loan applicants will assist Rural Development in obtaining such information as Rural Development needs to complete its environmental review and to cooperate in the resolution of environmental problems.
(4) Lenders will become familiar with Agency environmental requirements, so they can advise applicants and reduce the probability of unacceptable applications being submitted to Rural Development.
(5) The lender must comply with Federally mandated flood insurance purchase requirements. Existing dwellings in a SFHA are not eligible under the SFHGLP unless flood insurance through the FEMA National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is available for the community and flood insurance, whether NFIP, “write your own,” or private flood insurance, is purchased by the borrower. The lender will require the borrower to obtain, and maintain for the term of the mortgage, flood insurance for any property located in a SFHA, listing the lender as a loss payee. Purchase of existing structures within the federally regulated floodplain will not require consideration of alternatives to avoid adverse effects and incompatible development in floodplains;
(6) The borrower must obtain, and continuously maintain for the life of the mortgage, flood insurance on the security property in an amount sufficient to protect the property securing the guaranteed loan. Flood insurance policies must be issued under the NFIP, or by a licensed property and casualty insurance company authorized to participate in NFIP's “Write Your Own” program or private flood insurance policy, as approved by the
lender. Lenders are required to accept private flood insurance policies, when purchased by a borrower, that meet the requirements of 42 U.S.C. 4012a (b)(1)(A). Lenders remain responsible to ensure a private flood insurance policy meets the requirements of 42 U.S.C. 4012a (b)(1)(A).
(7) Rural Development will not guarantee loans for new or proposed homes in an SFHA unless the lender obtains a final Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) or a final Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) that removes the property from the SFHA, or performs an alternatives analysis in compliance with the Agencies National Environmental Policy Act regulation and obtains a FEMA elevation certificate that shows that the lowest floor (including basement) of the dwelling and all related building improvements are built at or above the 100-year flood plain elevation in compliance with the NFIP.
[78 FR 73941, Dec. 9, 2013, as amended at 81 FR 6428, Feb. 8, 2016; 81 FR 11048, Mar. 2, 2016]
§ 3555.6
State and local law.
Lenders will comply with applicable State and local laws and regulations, including the laws of American Indian tribes. Supplemental guidance will be issued in the case of any conflict with or significant differences from provisions of this part.
§ 3555.7
Exception authority.
The Administrator of the Agency, or a designee, may make an exception to any requirement or provision of this part or to address any omissions in this part, when the Administrator, or designee, determines that application of the requirement or failure to take action would adversely affect the Government's interest. Any exception must be consistent with the authorizing statute and other applicable laws.
§ 3555.8
Conflict of interest.
(a)
Applicant or borrower responsibility.
The applicant or borrower must disclose to the lender any prohibited relationship or association with any Rural Development employee, and the lender must disclose that information to Rural Development.
(b)
Lender responsibility.
The lender must disclose to Rural Development any prohibited relationship or association it, or any of its employees, has with any Rural Development employee.
(c)
Prohibited relationships and associations.
Prohibited relationships and associations include the following:
(1) Immediate family members, including parents and children, whether related by blood or marriage;
(2) Close relatives, including grandmother, grandfather, aunt, uncle, sister, brother, niece, nephew, granddaughter, grandson, or first cousin, whether related by blood or marriage;
(3) Any household residents;
(4) Immediate working relationships, including coworkers in the same office, subordinates, and immediate supervisors; and
(5) Close business associations, including business partnerships, joint ventures, or closely held corporations.
(d)
Result of disclosure.
Disclosure of prohibited relationships and associations under this section will not necessarily result in applicant, borrower or lender ineligibility. Disclosures may result in reassignment with regard to the loan guarantee in question so that no prohibited relationships or associations exist between the Rural Development employees responsible for loan guarantee transactions and lenders, borrowers, or applicants.
§ 3555.9
Enforcement.
Rural Development will take such actions as are appropriate and necessary to enforce the provisions of these regulations. Such actions will include, but not be limited to, reduction of the loss claim payment; termination of a lender's or servicer's participation in the SFHGLP; suspension and debarment of participation in this or other Federal programs; and, any other appropriate administrative, civil, or criminal actions as allowed by law. Rural Development may assess civil monetary penalties pursuant to Section 543 of the Housing Act of 1949, 42 U.S.C. 1409s(b).

(c)
Combination construction and permanent loan.
Loan funds may be used and Rural Development will guarantee a “combination construction and permanent loan” as defined at § 3555.10, during the term of construction and prior to the borrower occupying the property, subject to the conditions in § 3555.105.
(d)
Refinancing.
Refinancing is permitted only in the following situations:
(1) The loan may be used for permanent financing when temporary financing to construct a new dwelling, or to purchase and improve an existing
dwelling, is arranged as a part of the loan package.
(2) In the case of loans for a site on which a dwelling is not constructed prior to issuance of the Loan Note Guarantee, refinancing is permitted if:
(i) The site is free and clear of debt;
(ii) The debt to be refinanced was incurred for the sole purpose of purchasing the site;
(iii) The applicant is unable to acquire adequate housing without refinancing; and
(iv) An appropriate dwelling will be constructed on the site.
(3) The loan is a present Section 502 Direct or guaranteed loan, authorized under the Housing Act of 1949 subject to the following additional requirements:
(i) Three options for refinancing may be offered: Streamlined, non-streamlined, and streamlined-assist. Other than provided in this paragraph, no cash out is permitted for any refinance. Documentation costs and underwriting requirements of subparts D, E, and F of this part apply to streamlined and non-streamlined refinances.
(A) Lenders may offer a streamlined refinance for existing Section 502 Guaranteed loans, which does not require a new appraisal. The lender will pay off the balance of the existing Section 502 Guaranteed loan.
(B) Lenders may offer non-streamlined refinancing for existing Section 502 Guaranteed or Direct loans, which requires a new and current market value appraisal. The amount of the new loan must be supported by sufficient equity in the property as determined by an appraisal. The appraised value may be exceeded by the amount of up-front guarantee fee financed, if any, when using the non-streamlined option.
(C) A streamlined-assist refinance loan is a special refinance option available to existing Section 502 direct and guaranteed loan borrowers. Applicants must meet the income eligibility requirements of § 3555.151(a), and must not have had any defaults during the 12 month period prior to the refinance loan application. There are no debt-to-income calculation requirements, no credit report requirements, no property inspection requirements, and no loan-to-value requirements. There is no appraisal requirement except for Section 502 direct loan borrowers who have received a subsidy.
(ii) The interest rate of the new loan must be fixed and must not exceed the interest rate of the original loan being refinanced.
(iii) Existing borrowers seeking to refinance must have demonstrated their ability to meet payment demands by maintaining a current account for the 180 days prior to application.
(iv) The loan security must include the same property as the original loan and be owned and occupied by the borrowers as their principal residence.
(v) The maximum loan amount cannot exceed the balance of the loan being refinanced including accrued interest, the guarantee fee, and reasonable and customary closing costs. When a direct loan is refinanced, any recapture amount owed may be included in the loan amount or deferred as long as the recapture amount takes a subordinate lien position to the new SFHGLP loan. A discount on the recapture amount may be offered if the borrower does not defer recapture or includes the recapture amount in the new loan.
(vi) Two options for refinancing can be offered. Lenders may offer a streamlined refinance for existing Section 502 Guaranteed loans, which does not require a new appraisal. Streamlined financing may not be available for existing Section 502 Direct loans. The lender will pay off the principal balance of the existing Section 502 Guaranteed loan. The new loan amount cannot include any accrued interest, closing costs or lender fees. The refinance up-front guarantee fee as established by the Agency can be included in the loan to be refinanced to the extent financing does not exceed the original loan amount. Lenders may offer non-streamlined refinancing for existing Section 502 Guaranteed or Direct loans, which requires a new and current market value appraisal. The new loan may include the principal and interest of the existing Agency loan, reasonable closing costs and lenders fees to extent there is sufficient equity in the property as determined by an appraisal. The appraised value may be exceeded
by the amount of up-front guarantee fee financed, if any, when using the non-streamlined option. Documentation, costs, and underwriting requirements of subparts D, E, and F of this part apply to refinances, unless otherwise provided by the Agency.
(vii) Lenders may require property inspections and/or repairs as a condition to loan approval. Expenses related to property inspections and repairs required of the lender may not be financed into the new loan amount.
(viii) The lender pays a guarantee fee as established by the Agency.
(ix) The refinance loan may be subject to an annual fee as established by the Agency; and
(x) The Agency may limit the number of guaranteed loans made for refinancing purposes based on market conditions and other appropriate factors.

The lender and Rural Development will meet all environmental responsibilities in accordance with § 3555.5.
(f)
Issuance of a conditional commitment.
The lender must demonstrate that all the general loan, applicant, and site eligibility requirements of this part are met before Rural Development will issue a conditional commitment. The lender, however, may obtain any required property inspection reports, such as a well test or construction phase inspections, if applicable and not needed for environmental compliance, after the issuance of the conditional commitment, but prior to loan closing.
(1) The conditional commitment will expire in 90 days from issuance, unless new construction is involved.
(2) The expiration of a conditional commitment may coincide with projected completion of new construction.
(3) An extension may be granted if the loan cannot be closed due to circumstances beyond the lender's control.
(4) Lenders may accept or decline the conditional commitment, or submit requests for changes with adequate support and documentation to be reviewed by the Agency.
(g)
Loan guarantee fee.
The lender must pay a nonrefundable up-front guarantee fee, the cost of which may be passed on to the borrower. The up-front guarantee fee will not exceed 3.5 percent of the principal obligation. The current guarantee fee is available at any Rural Development office and may change periodically. Notice of a change in fee will be published as authorized in Exhibit K of subpart A of part 1810 of this chapter (RD Instruction 440.1, available in any Rural Development office) or online at:
http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/rd_instructions.html.
Once the guarantee has been issued, the fee will not be refunded.
(h)
Annual fee.
The Agency may impose an annual fee of the lender not to exceed 0.5 percent of the average annual scheduled unpaid principal balance of the loan for the life of the loan to allow the Agency to reduce the up-front guarantee in § 3555.107(g). The annual fee will be applicable to purchase and refinance loan transactions. The annual fee may be passed on to the borrower by the lender. The Agency may assess a late charge to the lender if the annual fee is not paid by the due date, and the late charge may not be passed on to the borrower. Further administrative guidance is provided in the handbook.
(i)
Proper closing and requesting the loan note guarantee.
The lender must ensure that any loan to be guaranteed is properly closed using documents acceptable to Rural Development.
(1) Within 30 days of loan closing, the lender must request issuance of a loan guarantee.
(2) The lender will certify the loan was closed in accordance with the conditional commitment and that no major changes have taken place since issuance of a commitment, except any changes specifically approved by the Agency.
(3) The lender will maintain evidence of hazard insurance and, if applicable, flood insurance.
(4) For all loan submissions, evidence of documentation supporting the properly closed loan will be submitted using Rural Development's automated systems.
(5) Lenders will submit full documentation supporting a closed loan or evidence of self-certification status, as described in this section. Self-certified lenders must still submit the settlement statement and promissory note. Lenders must obtain written authorization from the Agency prior to submitting evidence of self-certification in lieu of full documentation. Authorization for self-certification may be granted by the Agency if:
(i) The lender has an active lender agreement.
(ii) The lender is actively engaged in originating SFHGLP loans and has closed a minimum of 10 loans in the past 12 months.
(iii) The lender has successfully submitted 10 consecutive loan closing to the Agency that were in compliance with loan closing requirements and procedures.
(iv) The lender agrees to retain evidence of confirmed closing conditions in accordance with the issued conditional commitment in the lender's permanent loan file.
(j)
Issuance of the guarantee.
The loan guarantee does not take effect until:
(1) The lender transmits the required up-front guarantee fee, the lender certification form provided by Rural Development, and loan closing documents to Rural Development;
(2) The lender meets all other conditions set out in the conditional commitment;
(3) The loan is current at the time the lender requests the loan guarantee;
(4) Any construction or rehabilitation, is complete except for development described in §§ 3555.101(c) and 3555.202(c); and
(5) Rural Development issues the loan guarantee document.
[78 FR 73941, Dec. 9, 2013, as amended at 81 FR 6429, Feb. 8, 2016; 87 FR 6776, Feb. 7, 2022]
§ 3555.108
Full faith and credit.
(a)
General.
The Loan Note Guarantee constitutes an obligation supported by the full faith and credit of the United States and is incontestable except for fraud or misrepresentation of which the lender has actual knowledge at the time it becomes such lender or which the lender participates in or condones. Misrepresentation includes negligent misrepresentation.
(b)
Interest.
A note that provides for the payment of interest on interest, however, shall not be guaranteed. If the note to which the Loan Note Guarantee is attached or relates provides for the payment of interest on interest, then the Loan Note Guarantee is void. Notwithstanding the prohibition of interest on interest, interest may be capitalized in connection with re-amortization under subpart G of this part.
(c)
Violations.
The Loan Note Guarantee will be unenforceable by the lender to the extent any loss is occasioned by violation of usury laws, civil rights laws, negligent servicing, failure to obtain the required security or use of loan funds for unauthorized purposes, regardless of the time at which Rural Development acquires knowledge of the foregoing. Negligent servicing is defined as servicing that is inconsistent with this subpart and includes the failure to perform those services which a reasonably prudent Lender would perform in servicing its own loan portfolio of loans that are not guaranteed. The term includes not only the concept of a failure to act, but also not acting in a timely manner or acting contrary to the manner in which a reasonably prudent Lender would act up to the time of loan maturity or until a final loss is paid.
(d)
Indemnification.
The loan note guarantee will remain in effect for any holder of the loan who acquired it from an originating lender. If the Agency determines that a lender did not originate a loan in accordance with the requirements in this part, and the Agency pays a claim under the loan guarantee, the Agency may revoke the originating lender's eligibility status in accordance with subpart B of this part and may also require the originating lender:
(1) To indemnify the Agency for the loss, if the default leading to the payment of loss claim occurred within five (5) years of loan closing, when one or more of the following conditions is satisfied:
(i) The originating lender utilized unsupported data or omitted material information when submitting the request for a conditional commitment to the Agency;
(ii) The originating lender failed to properly verify and analyze the applicant's income and employment history in accordance with Agency guidelines;
(iii) The originating lender failed to address property deficiencies identified in the appraisal or inspection report that affect the health and safety of the occupants or the structural integrity of the property;
(iv) The originating lender used an appraiser that was not properly licensed or certified, as appropriate, to make residential real estate appraisal in accordance with § 3555.103(a); or,
(2) To indemnify the Agency for the loss regardless of how long ago the loan closed or the default occurred, if the Agency determines that fraud or misrepresentation was involved with the origination of the loan.
(3) In addition, the Agency may use any other legal remedies it has against the originating lender.

§ 3555.109
Qualified mortgage.
A qualified mortgage is a guaranteed loan meeting the requirements of this part and applicable Agency guidance, as well as the requirements in 12 CFR 1026.43(e)(2)(i) through (iii) and 12 CFR 1026.43(e)(3). An extension of credit made pursuant to a program administered by a State Housing Finance Agency is exempt from this requirement as defined in 12 CFR 1026.43(a)(3)(iv). Lenders will be allowed to cure unintentional errors and retain the qualified mortgage status if the conditions set in 12 CFR 1026.31(h) are met.

The report and recordkeeping requirements contained in this subpart are currently with the Office of Management and Budget under review and awaiting approval.

# Subpart D—Underwriting the Applicant
§ 3555.151
Eligibility requirements.
(a)
Income eligibility.
At the time of loan approval, the household's adjusted income must not exceed the applicable moderate income limit. The lender is responsible for documenting the household's income to determine eligibility for the SFHGLP.
(b)
Citizenship status.
Applicants must provide evidence acceptable to the Agency of their status as United States citizens, U.S. non-citizen nationals, or qualified aliens, as defined in § 3555.10.
(c)
Principal residence.
Applicants must agree and have the ability to occupy the dwelling as their principal residence. The Agency may require evidence of this ability. Rural Development will not guarantee loans for investment properties, or temporary, short-term housing.
(d)
Adequate dwelling.
The dwelling must be modest, decent, safe, and sanitary.
(e)
Eligibility of current homeowners.
Current homeowners may be eligible for guaranteed home loans under this part if all the following conditions are met:
(1) The applicants are not financially responsible for another Agency guaranteed or direct home loan by the time the guaranteed home loan is closed;
(2) The current home no longer adequately meets the applicants' needs;
(3) The applicants will occupy the home financed with the SFHGLP loan as their primary residence;
(4) The applicants are without sufficient resources or credit to obtain the dwelling on their own without the guarantee;
(5) No more than one single family housing dwelling other than the one associated with the current loan request may be retained; and
(6) The applicants must be financially qualified to own more than one home. In order for net rental income from the retained dwelling to be considered for the applicant's repayment ability, the consistency of the rental income must be demonstrated for at least the previous 24 months, and the current lease must be for a term of at least 12 months after the loan is closed.
(f)
Legal capacity.
Applicants must have the legal capacity to incur the loan obligation, or have a court-appointed guardian or conservator who is empowered to obligate the applicant in real estate matters.
(g)
Suspension or debarment.
Applicants who are suspended or debarred from participation in Federal programs under 2 CFR parts 180 and 417 are not eligible for loan guarantees.
(h)
Repayment ability.
Applicants must demonstrate adequate repayment ability. Lenders must maintain documentation supporting the repayment ability analysis in the loan file. Refer to § 3555.152(a) for further information.
(1) A repayment ratio will be used to determine an applicant's ability to repay a loan. The Agency will utilize two ratios, principal, interest, taxes and insurance (PITI) ratio and total debt (TD) ratio, to determine adequate repayment for the requested loan. The Agency reserves the right to consider calculation of a single ratio in determining repayment for the requested loan.
(i) An applicant is considered to have adequate repayment ability when the monthly amount required for payment of PITI, homeowners' association dues, the monthly calculation of an annual fee, as applicable, and other real estate assessments does not exceed 29 percent of the applicant's repayment income and the monthly amount of PITI plus recurring monthly debts (total debt) does not exceed 41 percent of the applicant's repayment income.
(ii) For home purchases under the Rural Energy Plus provision of § 3555.209, the Agency reserves the right to allow flexibility in the PITI and TD ratio. The handbook will define what flexibilities can be extended.
(iii) Contributions to personal income taxes, retirement accounts (including the repayment of personal loans from those retirement accounts), savings (including repayment of loans secured by such funds), the cost to commute, membership fees in unions or like organizations, childcare or other voluntary obligations will not be considered in the TD ratio.
(iv) Except for obligations specifically excluded by State law, the debts of non-purchasing spouse must be included in the applicant's repayment ratios if the applicant resides in a community property state.
(2) The repayment ratio may exceed the percentage in paragraph (h)(1) of this section when certain compensating factors exist. The handbook, HB-1-3555, Appendix I, located at
https://www.rd.usda.gov/sites/default/files/hb-1-3555.pdf,
will provide examples of when a debt ratio waiver may be granted. The automated underwriting system will consider any compensating factors in determining when the variance is appropriate. Loans downgraded in the automated underwriting system which must be manually underwritten will require the lender to document compensating factors. The presence of compensating factors does not strengthen a ratio exception when multiple layers of risk are present in the application. Acceptable compensating factors, supporting documentation, and maximum ratio thresholds, will be further defined and clarified in the handbook. Compensating factors include but are not limited to:
(i) A credit score at an acceptable level of 680 or higher for any applicants, unless otherwise provided by the Agency. The Agency reserves the right to change the acceptable level of credit score.
(ii) A minimal increase in housing expense, i.e. the current rent payment
is comparable to the proposed mortgage loan payment PITI and if applicable, homeowner association dues.
(iii) The demonstrated ability to accumulate savings and cash reserves post loan closing.
(iv) Continuous employment with a current primary employer.
(3) Loan ratio exceptions require written approval by Rural Development, or acceptance by an Agency approved automated underwriting system. Flexibilities surrounding loan ratio exceptions will be further clarified in the handbook. Lenders with loans accepted by an Agency approved automated underwriting system need not submit documentation for the need for a ratio waiver.
(4) If an applicant does not meet the repayment ability requirements, the applicant can increase repayment ability by having other eligible household members join the application.
(5) Mortgage Credit Certificates may be considered in determining an applicant's repayment ability.
(6) Section 8 Homeownership Vouchers may be used in determining an applicant's repayment ability. The monthly subsidy may be treated as repayment income in accordance with § 3555.152(a) or offset in the PITI.
(7) A funded buydown account may be used to reduce the borrower's monthly mortgage payment during the early years of repayment when all of the following requirements are met:
(i) The loan will be underwritten at the note rate.
(ii) The interest rate may be bought down to no more than 2 percentage points below the note rate.
(iii) The interest rate paid by the borrower may increase no more frequently than annually.
(iv) The interest rate paid by the borrower may increase no more than 1 percentage point annually.
(v) Funds must be placed in an escrow account with monthly releases scheduled directly to the lender.
(vi) Funds must be placed with a Federal- or state-regulated lender.
(vii) The escrow account must be fully funded for the buydown period.
(viii) The borrower is not permitted to use personal funds or funds borrowed from another source to establish the escrow account for the buydown.
(ix) The borrower must not be required to borrow or repay the funds.
(i)
Credit qualifications.
Applicants generally must have a verifiable credit history that indicates a reasonable ability and willingness to meet their debt obligations as evidenced by an acceptable credit score, a credit report from a recognized credit repository meeting the requirements of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA or VA, and other credit qualifications satisfactory to Rural Development.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(6) of this section, the applicant's credit history must demonstrate a past willingness and ability to meet credit obligations to enable the lender to evaluate each applicant and draw a logical conclusion about the applicant's commitment and ability to handling financial obligations successfully and ability to make payments on the new mortgage obligation.
(2) A loan's acceptance by an Agency approved automated underwriting system eliminates the need for the lender to submit documentation of the credit qualification decision as loan approval requirements will be incorporated in the automated system.
(3) For manually underwritten loans, lenders must submit documentation of the credit qualification decision. Lenders will use credit scores to manually underwrite loan mortgage requests. Lenders are required to validate the credit scores utilized in the underwriting determination. Indicators of significant derogatory credit will require further review and documentation of that review. Indicators of significant derogatory credit include, but are not limited to:
(i) A foreclosure that has been completed in the 36 months prior to application by the applicant.
(ii) A bankruptcy in which debts were discharged within 36 months prior to the date of application by the applicant. A lender may give favorable consideration to applicants who have entered into a bankruptcy debt restructuring plan who have completed 12 months of consecutive payments. The payment performance must have been
satisfactory with all required payments made on time, and the Trustee or the Bankruptcy Judge must approve of the new credit.
(iii) One rent or mortgage payment paid 30 or more days late within the last 12 months prior to application by the applicant.
(iv) A previous Agency loan that resulted in a loss to the Government.
(4) When evidence of significant derogatory credit is present, lenders may consider extenuating circumstances, including but not limited to, whether the problems were caused by factors temporary in nature, if the circumstances leading to the derogatory credit were beyond the control of the applicant, and if the loan would significantly reduce the applicant's housing expenses.
(5) In all cases, the applicant cannot have an outstanding Federal judgment, other than a judgment obtained in the United States Tax Court, or a delinquent non-tax Federal debt that has not been paid in full or otherwise satisfied.
(6) For applicants without an established credit history, alternative methods may be used to evidence an applicant's willingness to pay, such as a non-traditional mortgage credit report or multiple independent verifications of trade references.
(7) A credit report for a non-purchasing spouse must be obtained in order to determine the debt-to-income ratio referenced at § 3555.151(h) if the applicant resides in a community property state.
(8) Lenders are encouraged to offer or provide for home ownership counseling. Lenders may require first-time homebuyers to undergo such counseling if it is reasonably available in the local area. When home ownership counseling is provided or sponsored by Rural Development or another Federal agency in the local area, the Lender must require the borrower to successfully complete the course.
(9) Applicants with delinquent child support payments subject to collection by administrative offset are ineligible unless the payments are brought current, the debt is paid in full, or otherwise satisfied.
(j)
Obtaining credit.
The applicant must be unable to obtain traditional conventional mortgage credit, as defined by the Agency, for the subject loan.

(a)
Repayment income.
Repayment income is the amount of adequate and stable income from all sources that parties to the promissory note are expected to receive. Repayment income is used to determine the applicant's ability to repay a loan.

(2) Lenders must verify employment and income information provided by the applicant for all household members. Lenders will verify the income for each adult household member for the previous 2 years. Written or oral verifications provided by third-party sources or documents prepared by third-party sources are acceptable. Lenders must project the expected annual income for the next 12 months from the verified sources.
(3) The lender remains responsible for the quality and accuracy of all information used to establish a household's eligibility.
(4) Household income from all sources including, but not limited to, income from temporarily absent household members, allowances for tax-exempt income and net family assets as defined in paragraph (d) of this section are to be considered in the calculation of annual income.

(i) Enable a family member or the individual with disabilities to work, to actively seek work, or to further a member's education;
(ii) Are not reimbursed from insurance or another source; and

Rural Development will only guarantee loans made in rural areas designated as rural by Rural Development. However, if a rural area designation is changed to nonrural:
(1) Existing conditional commitments in the former rural area will be honored;
(2) A supplemental loan may be made in accordance with § 3555.101 in conjunction with a transfer and assumption of a guaranteed loan;
(3) Loan requests where the application and purchase contract was complete prior to the area designation change may be approved; and
(4) REO property sales and transfers with assumption may be processed.

(4) The site must be supported by adequate utilities and water and wastewater disposal systems. Certain water and wastewater systems that are privately-owned may be acceptable if the lender determines that the systems are adequate, safe, compliant with applicable codes and requirements, and the cost or feasibility to connect to a public or community system is not reasonable. Certain community-owned water and wastewater systems may be acceptable if the lender determines that the systems are adequate, safe, and compliance with applicable codes and requirements. The Agency may require inspections on individual, central, or privately-owned and operated water or waste systems.
§ 3555.202
Dwelling requirements.
(a)
New dwellings.
New dwellings must be constructed in accordance with certified plans and specifications, and must meet or exceed the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) in effect at the time of construction.

This paragraph does not apply if the development is related to a “combination construction and permanent loan” under § 3555.101(c). If a dwelling is complete with the exception of interior or exterior development work, Rural Development may issue the Loan Note Guarantee on the loan if the following conditions are met:
(1) The incomplete work does not affect the habitability of the dwelling, nor the health or safety of the housing occupants.
(2) The cost of any remaining interior or exterior work is not greater than 10 percent of the final loan amount.
(3) An escrow account is funded in an amount sufficient to assure the completion of the remaining work. This figure must be at least 100 percent of the cost of completion but may be higher if the lender determines a higher amount is needed.
(4) The builder or a licensed contractor has executed a contract providing for completion of the planned
development within 180 days of loan closing. If the borrower will be completing the planned development on an existing dwelling without the services of a contractor, the requirement for an executed contract is waived when all of the following conditions are met:
(i) The estimated cost to complete the work is less than 10 percent of the total loan amount;
(ii) The escrow amount is less than or equal to $10,000; and
(iii) The lender has determined the borrower has the knowledge and skills necessary to complete the work.

(2) Such leaseholds are fully marketable in the area, except in the case of properties located on American Indian restricted land;
(3) The lease has an unexpired term of at least 45 years from the date of loan closing, except in the case of properties located on American Indian restricted land where the lease must have an unexpired term at least equal to the term of the loan. Leases on American Indian restricted land for period of 25 years which are renewable for a second 25 year period are permissible as are leases of a longer duration;
(4) The mortgage must cover both the property improvements and the leasehold interest in the land;
(5) The leasehold estate must constitute real property, be subject to the mortgage lien, be insured by a title policy, be assignable or transferable and cannot be terminated except for nonpayment of lease rents; and

Rural Energy Plus loans.
Loans guaranteed under Rural Energy Plus provisions are for the purchase of energy-efficient homes.

For loans guaranteed under this subpart, the lender will certify that the home meets the most current IECC
standards. The Handbook will define what further flexibilities can be extended.

(c)
Transfer of servicing.

Establish escrow account.
Lenders with the capacity to escrow funds must establish escrow accounts for all guaranteed loans for the payment of taxes and insurance. Escrow accounts must be administered in accordance with the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act (RESPA) of 1974, and insured by the FDIC or the NCUA.
(2)

Lenders that do not have the capacity to escrow funds must implement procedures, subject to Agency approval, to ensure the borrower pays such obligations on a timely basis. In addition, such lenders must accept the responsibility for payment of taxes and insurance that comes due prior to liquidation. Rural Development will not include any taxes or insurance amounts that accrued prior to acceleration in any potential loss claim. Rural Development may revoke the acceptance of the lender's plan if loan performance indicates that delinquency and loss rates are being affected by the lender's inability to escrow for taxes, assessment, and insurance. This alternative is not available to lenders who contract for servicing.
(c)
Insurance.
(1) Until the loan is paid in full, lenders must ensure that borrowers maintain hazard and flood insurance as required, on property securing guaranteed loans. The insurance must be issued by companies in amounts, and on terms and conditions, acceptable to Rural Development. Flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program must be maintained for all property located in special flood or mudslide areas identified by FEMA and must be consistent with mortgage industry standards, as determined by the Agency.
(2) Lenders must ensure that borrowers immediately notify them of any loss or damage to insured property securing guaranteed loans and collect the amount of the loss from the insurance company. Unless the borrower pays off the guaranteed loan using the insurance proceeds, the following requirements must be met:
(i) All repairs and replacements using the insurance proceeds must be planned, performed, and inspected in accordance with Agency construction requirements and procedures.
(ii) When insurance funds remain after payments for all repairs, replacements, and other authorized disbursements have been made, the funds must be applied in the following order: prior liens (including past-due property taxes); past-due amounts; protective advances; and released to the borrower if the lender's debt is adequately secured.
(3) If the insurance claim is de minimis as determined by the Agency, the lender may release the funds directly to the borrower to advance funds to contractors, provided that the account is current and the borrower has a history of timely payments; the borrower occupies the property; and the borrower executes an affidavit agreeing to apply the funds for repairs or reconstruction of the dwelling.

A lender may consent to the lease of mineral rights and subordinate its lien to the lessee's rights and interests in the mineral activity if the security property will remain suitable as a residence, the lender's security interest will not be adversely affected, and Rural Development's environmental requirements are met. Concurrence by Rural Development prior to consenting to the lease of mineral rights is required, unless otherwise provided by the Agency. Subordination of guaranteed loans to a mineral lease does not entitle the leaseholder to any proceeds from the sale of the security property.
(1) If the proposed activity is likely to decrease the value of the security property, the lender may consent to the lease only if the borrower assigns 100 percent of the income from the lease to the lender to be applied to reduce the principal balance, and the total rent to be paid is at least equal to the estimated decrease in the market value of the security property.
(2) If the proposed activity is not likely to decrease the value of the security property, the lender may consent to the lease if the borrower agrees to use any damage compensation received from the lessee to repair damage to the site or dwelling, or to assign it to the lender to be applied to reduce the principal balance.
(b)
Partial release of security property.
A lender may consent to transactions affecting a security property, such as selling or exchanging security property or granting of a right-of-way across the security property, and grant a partial release, provided that the following conditions are met.

(i) For sale of security property, the borrower must receive cash in an amount equal to or greater than the value of the security property being sold or interests being conveyed.
(ii) For exchange of security property, the borrower must receive another parcel of property with value equal to or greater than that being disposed of.

(6) Proceeds from the sale of a portion of the security property, granting an easement or right-of-way, damage compensation, and all similar transactions requiring the lender's consent, will be used in the following order:
(i) To pay customary and reasonable costs related to the transaction that must be paid by the borrower.
(ii) To be applied on a prior lien debt, if any.
(iii) To be applied to the guaranteed indebtedness or used for improvements to the security property consistent with the purposes and limitations applicable for use of guaranteed loan funds. The lender must ensure that the proceeds are used as planned.
(7) The lender will seek Agency concurrence, unless otherwise provided by the Agency, by submitting documentation supporting the borrower's reason for request, the proposed use of the land with supporting plans, specifications, cost estimates, surveys, disclosures of restrictions, legal description modification, title clearance related to the transaction request, as applicable, and any other documents necessary for the Agency to make a determination.

The transferor must pay any recapture as a result of interest subsidy granted, if applicable, owed at the time of the transfer and assumption.
(ii) The transferee must meet the eligibility requirements described in subpart D of this part.
(iii) The property must meet the site and dwelling requirements described in subpart E of this part, or be brought to those standards prior to the transfer.

(ii) A transfer to a relative, joint tenant, or tenant by the entirety resulting from the death of the borrower;
(iii) A transfer to a spouse or ex-spouse resulting from a divorce decree, legal separation agreement, or property settlement agreement;
(iv) A transfer to a person other than a deceased borrower's spouse who wishes to assume the loan for the benefit of persons who were dependent on the deceased borrower at the time of death, if the dwelling will be occupied by one or more persons who were dependent on the borrower at the time of death, and there is a reasonable prospect of repayment; or
(v) A transfer into an inter vivos trust in which the borrower does not transfer rights of occupancy in the property.

(ii) Rural Development will continue with the guarantee, whether or not the transferee assumes the guaranteed loan;

§ 3555.305
Voluntary liquidation.
The lender must have exhausted the servicing options outlined in §§ 3555.302 through 3555.304 to cure the delinquency before considering voluntary liquidation. The methods of voluntary liquidation of the security property outlined in this section may be used to protect the interests of the Government.
(a)
Eligibility.

lender fully documents how the proposal will result in a savings to the Government.
[78 FR 73941, Dec. 9, 2013, as amended at 84 FR 70886, Dec. 26, 2019]
§ 3555.306
Liquidation.
(a)
General.
(1) When a lender determines that a borrower is unable or unwilling to meet loan obligations with servicing options under this subpart, the lender must accelerate the guaranteed loan and, if necessary, foreclose.
(2) Prior to acceleration the lender must have advised the borrower, in writing, of available foreclosure avoidance options and the borrower must have failed to request such options.
(3) The lender must accelerate the guaranteed loan, with a demand letter, when the account is three scheduled payments past due unless there is a reasonable prospect of resolving the delinquency through another method.
(4) The borrower is responsible for all expenses associated with liquidation and acquisition.
(b)
Foreclosure.
(1) The lender must initiate foreclosure within 90 calendar days of the decision to liquidate unless Federal, State, or local law requires that foreclosure action be delayed. When there is a legal delay (such as bankruptcy), foreclosure must be initiated within 90 calendar days after it becomes possible to do so. Foreclosure initiation begins with the first public action required by law such as filing a complaint or petition, recording a notice of default, or publication of a notice of sale.
(2) Lenders must exercise due diligence in completing the liquidation process to ensure the foreclosure is cost effective, expeditious, and completed in an efficient manner, as otherwise provided by the Agency. The lender must choose the foreclosure method representing the best interest of the Federal Government.
(3) The lender's decision to bid at foreclosure and any bid amount will be based upon the property value, whether the property value is sufficient to cover the existing debt and incurred costs, and any potential to recover a deficiency. The lender will encourage third party bidding at a foreclosure sale when the total debt, including the cost of acquiring, managing and disposing of the property, if acquired, is greater than the gross proceeds expected from a foreclosure sale at market value.
(c) Unless State law imposes other requirements, the lender may reinstate an accelerated account if the borrower pays, or makes acceptable arrangements to pay, all past-due amounts, any protective advances, and any foreclosure-related costs incurred by the lender.
(d)
Bankruptcy.
(1) When a borrower files a petition in bankruptcy, the lender must suspend collection and foreclosure actions in accordance with Title 11 of the United States Code.
(2) The lender may accept conveyance of security property by the trustee in the bankruptcy, or the borrower, if the bankruptcy court has approved the transaction, and the lender will acquire title free of all liens and encumbrances except the lender's liens.
(3) Whenever possible after the borrower has filed for protection under Chapter 7 of Title 11 of the United States Code, a reaffirmation agreement will be signed by the borrower and approved by the bankruptcy court prior to discharge, if the lender and the borrower decide to continue with the loan.
(4) The lender must protect the guaranteed loan debt and all collateral securing the loan in bankruptcy proceedings.
(5) The lender can include principal and interest lost as a result of bankruptcy proceedings in any claim filed in accordance with § 3555.354.
(e)
Maintain condition of security property.
The lender must make reasonable and prudent efforts to ensure that the condition of the security property is maintained during any liquidation, acquisition, and sale of the property. These efforts include, but are not limited to, periodic inspections, performing necessary repairs, winterization, securing the property, removing debris, yard maintenance and ensuring the continuance of property insurance. The lender must identify, determine the cause, and document any environmental hazard affecting the value of the security property. The lender must
retain a record of all efforts to maintain the condition of the security property.
(f)
Lender acquisition of title.
If at liquidation, the title to the property is conveyed to the lender, the lender will submit a loss claim package, including a market value appraisal, within 60 days of the foreclosure sale date or the date the lender acquires title. If eviction action is required in order to obtain a market value appraisal, the lender must submit the loss claim package, including the market value appraisal, within 60 days of the date the occupants clear the premises. The lender must submit the loss claim request, including the market value appraisal, in accordance with subpart H.
(g)
Debt settlement reporting.
The lender must report to the IRS and all national credit reporting repositories any debt settled through liquidation.
[78 FR 73941, Dec. 9, 2013, as amended at 81 FR 6430, Feb. 8, 2016; 81 FR 31164, May 18, 2016; 84 FR 70886, Dec. 26, 2019]
§ 3555.307
Assistance in natural disasters.
(a)
Policy.
Servicers must utilize general procedures available under this subpart for servicing borrowers affected by natural disasters, as supplemented by Rural Development, to minimize delinquencies and avoid foreclosure.
(b)
Evaluating the damage.
Servicers are expected to inspect a security property whenever they have reason to believe the property has been damaged.
(c)
Special relief measures.
The servicer must evaluate on an individual case-by-case basis a mortgage that is (or becomes) seriously delinquent as the result of the borrower's incurring extraordinary damages or expenses related to the natural disaster. The servicer should document its individual mortgage file regarding all servicing actions taken during this time period. The lender must consider all special relief alternatives for disaster assistance available to the borrower prior to suspending collection and foreclosure activities. The suspension of servicing actions will expire 90 days from the declaration date of the natural disaster, unless otherwise extended by the Agency.
(d)
Insurance claim settlements.
Prior to release of hazard insurance proceeds because of damage caused by a natural disaster, servicers must complete a cost and benefit analysis on a case-by-case basis to determine if the property can be repaired or rebuilt. The servicer's actions must be based on the status of the mortgage, the amount of insurance proceeds, and the length of time required repairing or reconstructing the property, and the market conditions in the area. If the property will not be repaired or rebuilt, the insurance proceeds must be applied to the unpaid principal loan balance.

# Subpart H—Collecting on the Guarantee
§ 3555.351
Loan guarantee limits.

For the purposes of this section, the term “Original Loan Amount” means the original promissory note amount minus any loans funds not actually disbursed to the borrower or on behalf of the borrower at the time the SFHGLP loan was made or thereafter.
(b)
Maximum loss payment.
The maximum payment for a loss sustained by the lender under the SFHGLP is the lesser of:
(1) 90 percent of the Original Loan Amount; or

§ 3555.353
Net recovery value.
The net recovery value of the property is determined differently for properties that have been sold than for properties that remain in the lender's inventory at the time the loss claim is filed.
(a)
For a property that has been sold.
When a loss claim is filed on a property that was sold to a third party at the foreclosure sale or through an approved pre-foreclosure sale, net recovery value is calculated as follows:
(1) The proceeds from the sale plus any other amounts recovered, minus
(2) The amount of actual liquidation and disposition costs provided those costs are reasonable and customary for the area. Costs incurred by in-house staff may not be included.
(b)
For a property that has been acquired.
When a loss claim is filed on a property acquired by the lender through a foreclosure sale or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, the net recovery value is based on an estimated sales price calculated using a market value appraisal along with holding and disposition costs calculated using the acquisition and management factor (also known as the VA Net Value Factor) published by the VA, and other factors as determined by the Agency. The lender must submit a loss claim package, including a market value appraisal, within 60 days of the foreclosure sale date or the date the lender acquires title. If eviction action is required in order to obtain a market value appraisal, the lender must submit the loss claim package, including the market value appraisal, within 60 days of the date the occupants clear the premises and in accordance with other requirements of this subpart. with any loss claim request in accordance with subpart H.

§ 3555.354
Loss claim procedures.
All lenders must use a web-based automated system designated by the Agency to submit all loss claim requests.
(a)
Sold property.
For property that has been sold, the lender must submit a loss claim within 45 calendar days of the sale. Late claims made beyond this period of time may be rejected or reduced by Rural Development. Instructions and forms may be obtained from Rural Development.
(b)
REO.
If at liquidation, the title to the property is conveyed to the lender, the lender will submit a loss claim package, including a market value appraisal, within 60 days of the foreclosure sale date or the date the lender acquires title. If eviction action is required in order to obtain a market value appraisal, the lender must submit the loss claim package within 60 days of the date the occupants clear the premises. The lender must order a market value appraisal and include the market value appraisal with the loss claim package. The Agency will use the market value appraisal, along with other Agency required documentation, to determine the property value for the basis of the loss claim. The Agency will apply an acquisition and management resale factor to estimate holding and disposition costs, based on the most current VA Management and Acquisition Factor found at
https://www.benefits.va.gov/HOMELOANS/servicers_valeri.asp.
(c)
Deficiency judgments.
The lender must enforce any judgment for which there are current prospects of collection before submitting a loss claim, and amounts collected must be applied against the outstanding debt. Rural Development will process the loss claim if there are no current prospects for collection.
[78 FR 73941, Dec. 9, 2013, as amended at 81 FR 31165, May 18, 2016; 84 FR 70887, Dec. 26, 2019]
§ 3555.355

# Subpart A—General Provisions and Definitions
§ 3560.1
Applicability and purpose.
(a) This part sets forth requirements, policies, and procedures for multi-family housing (MFH) direct loan and grant programs to serve eligible very-low, low- and moderate income households. The programs covered by this part are authorized by title V of the Housing Act of 1949 and are:
(1)
Section 515 Rural Rental Housing, which includes congregate housing, group homes, and Rural Cooperative Housing.
Section 515 loans may be made to finance multi-family units in rural areas as defined in § 3560.11.
(2)
Sections 514 and 516 Farm Labor Housing loans and grants.
Housing under these programs may be built in any area with a need and demand for housing for farm workers.
(3)
Section 521 Rental Assistance.
A project-based tenant rent subsidy which may be provided to Rural Rental Housing and Farm Labor Housing facilities.
(b) The programs covered by this part provide economically designed and constructed rural rental, cooperative, and farm labor housing and related facilities operated and managed in an affordable, decent, safe, and sanitary manner.
(c) Internal Agency procedures containing details for Agency processing under these regulations can be found in the program handbooks, available in any Rural Development office, or from the Rural Development Web site.
§ 3560.2
Civil rights.
(a) As per the Fair Housing Act, as amended and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, all actions taken by recipients of loans and grants will be conducted without regard to race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, age, or disability. These actions include any actions in the sale, rental, or advertising of the dwellings, in the provision of brokerage services, or in residential real estate transactions involving Rural Housing Service (RHS) assistance. It is unlawful for a borrower or grantee or an agent of a borrower or grantee:
(1) To refuse to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services that would provide a person with a disability an opportunity to use or continue to use a dwelling unit and all public and common use areas; or
(2) To refuse to provide a reasonable accommodation at the borrower's expense that would not cause an undue financial or administrative burden, or to refuse to allow an individual with a disability to make reasonable modifications to the unit at their own expense with the understanding that the owner may require the tenant to return the unit to its original condition when the unit is vacated by the tenant making the modifications (see § 3560.104(c)).
(b) Borrowers and grantees must take reasonable steps to ensure that Limited English Proficiency (LEP) persons receive the language assistance necessary to afford them meaningful access to USDA programs and activities, free of charge. Failure to ensure that LEP persons can effectively participate in or benefit from federally-assisted programs and activities may violate the prohibition under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d and Title VI regulations against national origin discrimination. USDA has issued guidance to clarify the responsibilities of recipients and subrecipients who receive financial assistance from USDA and to assist them in fulfilling their responsibilities to LEP persons under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, as amended, and implementing regulations.
(c) Any tenant/member or prospective tenant seeking occupancy in or use of facilities financed by the Agency who believes he or she is being discriminated against because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, or disability may file a complaint in person with, or by mail to the U. S. Department of Agriculture's Office of Civil Rights, Room 326-W, Whitten Building, 14th and Independence Avenue, Washington, DC 20410. Complaints received by Agency employees must be directed to the National Office Civil Rights staff through the State Civil Rights Manager/Coordinator.
(d) Borrowers or grantees that fail to comply with the requirements of federal civil rights requirements are subject to sanctions authorized by law. The following are the major civil rights laws affecting multifamily housing loan and grant programs:
(1) Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA).
(2) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
(3) Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968.
(4) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
(5) Age Discrimination Act of 1975.
(6) Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.
§ 3560.3
Environmental review requirements.
RHS will consider environmental impacts of proposed housing as equal with economic, social, and other factors. By working with applicants, Federal agencies, Indian tribes, state and local governments, interested citizens, and organizations, RHS will formulate actions that advance program goals in a manner that protects, enhances, and restores environmental quality. Actions taken under this part must comply with the environmental review requirements in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970. Servicing actions as defined in § 1970.6 of this title are part of financial assistance already provided and do not require additional NEPA review. However, certain post-financial assistance actions that have the potential to have an effect on the environment, such as lien subordinations, sale or lease of Agency-owned real property, or approval of a substantial change in the scope of a project, as defined in § 1970.8 of this title, are actions for the purposes of this part.
[81 FR 11049, Mar. 2, 2016]
§ 3560.4
Compliance with other Federal requirements.
RHS is responsible for ensuring that the application is in compliance with all applicable Federal requirements, including the following specific requirements:
(a)
Intergovernmental review.
7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, or any successor regulation, including the Agency supplemental administrative instruction, RD Instruction 1970-I, ‘Intergovernmental Review,’ available in any Agency office or on the Agency's Web site.
(b)
National flood insurance.
The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973; the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994; and 7 CFR part 1806, subpart B, or any successor regulation.
(c)
Clean Air Act and Water Pollution Control Act Requirements.
For any contract, all applicable standards, orders or requirements issued under section 306 of the Clean Air Act; section 508 of the Clean Water Act, Executive Order 11738, and 40 CFR part 32.
(d)
Historic preservation requirements.
The provisions of 7 CFR part 1901, subpart F or any successor regulation.
(e)
Lead-based paint requirements.
The applicable provisions of 24 CFR part 35, subparts A through D, J, and R, as published by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
[69 FR 69106, Nov. 26, 2004, as amended at 76 FR 80731, Dec. 27, 2011]
§ 3560.5
State, local or tribal laws.
Borrowers must comply with all applicable state and local laws, and laws of Federally-recognized Indian tribes to the extent they are not inconsistent with this part.
§ 3560.6
Borrower responsibility and requirements.
(a) Borrower responsibilities and requirements specified in this part may be carried out by an individual or entity designated by the borrower to act on behalf of the borrower such as a resident manager or management agent. Ultimate accountability to the Agency, however, is with the borrower whether or not the borrower designated another person or entity to act on the borrower's behalf.
(b) Borrowers who have not executed a loan agreement, and who were not required to execute a loan agreement by the regulations in effect at the time of their loan closing are exempt from the requirements of subparts D through G of this part, as long as the borrower is not in default of any applicable requirement, security instrument, payment, or any other agreement with the Agency. Such borrowers must provide evidence of tenant income eligibility in accordance with § 3560.152(a), except in Farm Labor Housing where the tenant is not paying shelter cost.
§ 3560.7
Delegation of responsibility.
The RHS Administrator may delegate, on an individual or other basis, any decision-making responsibility for Agency programs, unless otherwise noted.
§ 3560.8
Administrator's exception authority.
The RHS Administrator may make an exception to any provision of this part or address any omissions provided that the exception is consistent with the applicable statute, does not adversely affect the interest of the Federal Government, and does not adversely affect the accomplishment of the purposes of the MFH programs or application of the requirement would result in undue hardship on the tenants. Exception requests presented to the RHS Administrator must have the concurrence of a Rural Development Leadership Designee or a Deputy Administrator for MFH.
[69 FR 69106, Nov. 26, 2004, as amended at 87 FR 11279, Mar. 1, 2022]
§ 3560.9
Reviews and appeals.
Rural Housing Service decisions may be appealed pursuant to 7 CFR part 11.
§ 3560.10
Conflict of interest.
To reduce the potential for employee conflict of interest, all RHS activities will be conducted in accordance with 7 CFR part 1900, subpart D.

§ 3560.57
Designated places for section 515 housing.
(a)
Establish a list of designated places.
The Agency will establish a list of designated places from which loan proposals will be accepted. The list is updated each fiscal year and is available when the NOFA is published. The NOFA provides information on obtaining the list. This list will be developed from a list of rural places which the Agency identifies as having the greatest need for multifamily housing based on the following factors:
(1) Qualification as a rural area as defined in § 3560.11,
(2) Lack of mortgage credit, and
(3) Demonstrated need for MFH based on:

The Agency, in states with an active leveraging program and formal partnership agreement with the state agency, may establish a partnership designated place list consisting of places identified by the partnership as high need areas based on criteria consistent with the Agency's and the state's authorizing statutes. The partnership agreement and partnership designated place list must have the concurrence of the Administrator.
(c)
Administrator's discretion.
The Administrator may add to the list of designated places any place that is determined to have a compelling need for MFH, for example, a place that has had a substantial increase in population not reflected in the most recent decennial Census of the United States, or a place that has experienced a loss of affordable housing because of a natural disaster.
(d)
Restrictions on loans in certain designated places.
(1) Initial loan applications will not be requested and final loan applications will not be closed for housing proposals in designated places where any of the following conditions exist:
(i) The Agency has selected another MFH proposal in the designated place for processing.
(ii) A previously funded Agency, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), low-income housing tax credit or other similar assisted MFH in the designated place has not been completed or has not reached projected occupancy levels.
(iii) Existing assisted MFH in the designated place is experiencing high vacancy levels.
(iv) A special note rent or other loan servicing tool is pending or in effect for other assisted housing in the designated place, or
(v) The need in the market area is for additional rental assistance and not additional rental units.
(2) Exceptions to the provisions in § 3560.57(d)(1) may be made:
(i) When a group home is proposed for persons with disabilities in an area where the existing MFH is insufficient or unavailable for their needs; or
(ii) There is a compelling need for additional MFH, for example when the units that have been approved or are under development represent only a small portion of the total units needed in the community.
[69 FR 69106, Nov. 26, 2004, as amended at 80 FR 9912, Feb. 24, 2015]
§ 3560.58
Site requirements.
(a)
Location.
(1) New construction section 515 loans will be made only in designated places selected by the Agency in accordance with the requirements of § 3560.57.
(2) Agency-financed MFH must be located in residential areas as part of established rural communities, except as permitted in § 3560.58(b), and for farm labor housing units financed under sections 514 and 516, which may be developed in any area where a need for farm labor housing exists.
(3) Communities in which Agency-financed MFH is located must have adequate facilities and services to support the needs of tenants.
(4) Housing complexes will not be located in areas where there are undesirable influences such as high activity railroad tracks; adjacent to or near industrial sites; bordering sites or structures which are not decent, safe, or sanitary; or bordering sites which have potential environmental concerns such as processing plants. Sites which are not an integral part of a residential community and do not have reasonable access, either by location or terrain, to essential community facilities such as water, sewerage removal, schools, shopping, employment opportunities, medical facilities, may not be acceptable. Consistent with Federal law and Departmental Regulation, the Agency must conduct an environmental assessment and a civil rights impact analysis before a site can be accepted. Sites may be determined by the Agency to be unacceptable if any of the adverse conditions described in this paragraph exist.
(b)
Structures located in central business areas.
The Agency will consider financing construction or the purchase and substantial rehabilitation of an existing structure located in the central business area of a rural community. With prior consent from the Agency, a
portion of such a structure may be designated for commercial use on a lease basis. RHS funds may not be used to finance any cost associated with the commercial space.
(c)
Site development costs and standards.
The cost of site development must be less than or comparable to the cost of site development at other available sites in the community and the site must be developed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1924, subpart C and any applicable standards imposed by a state or local government.
(d)
Densities.
Allowable site densities will be determined based on the following criteria:
(1) Compatibility and consistency with the community in which the MFH is located;
(2) Impact on the total development costs; and
(3) Size sufficient to accommodate necessary site features.
(e)
Flood or mudslide-prone areas.
(1) The Agency will not approve sites subject to 100-year floods when non-floodplain sites exist. The environmental review process will assess the availability of a reasonable site outside the 100-year floodplain.
(2) Sites located within the 100 year floodplain are not eligible for federal financial assistance unless flood insurance is available through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The Agency will complete Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Form 81-93, Standard Flood Hazard Determination, to document the site's location in relation to the floodplain and the availability of insurance under NFIP.
§ 3560.59
Environmental review requirements.
Under the National Environmental Policy Act, the Agency is required to assess the potential impact of the proposed action on protected environmental resources. Measures to avoid or mitigate adverse impacts to protected resources may require a change in the site or project design. Therefore, a site cannot be approved until the Agency has completed the environmental review requirements in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970. Likewise, the applicant should be informed that the environmental review must be completed and approved before the Agency can make a commitment of resources to the project.
[81 FR 11049, Mar. 2, 2016]
§ 3560.60
Design requirements.
(a)
Standards.
All Agency-financed MFH will be constructed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1924, subpart A and will consist of two or more rental units plus appropriate related facilities. Single family structures may be used for group homes and cooperative housing. Also, manufactured homes may be used to create MFH and single family housing originally financed through section 502 of the Housing Act of 1949 may be converted to MFH. Maintenance requirements are listed in § 3560.103(a)(3).
(b)
Residential design.
All MFH must be residential in character, except as provided for in § 3560.58(b), and must meet the needs of eligible residents.
(c)
Economical construction, operation and maintenance.
Taking into consideration life-cycle costs, all housing must be economical to construct, operate, and maintain and must not be of elaborate design or materials.
(1) Economical construction means construction that results in housing of at least average quality with amenities that are reasonable and customary for the community and necessary to appropriately serve tenants.
(2) Economical operating and maintenance means housing with operational and maintenance costs that allow a basic rent structure less than or consistent with conventional rents for comparable units in the community or in a similar community except that when determined necessary by the Agency to allow for decent, safe and sanitary housing to be provided in market areas where conventional rents are not sufficient to cover necessary operating, maintenance, and reserve costs. Basic rents may be allowed to exceed comparable rents for conventional units, but in no case may the rent exceed 150% of the comparable rent for conventional unit rent level.
(3) In meeting the Agency objective of economical construction, operation and maintenance, housing proposals must:
(i) Contain costs without jeopardizing the quality and marketability of the housing;
(ii) Employ life-cycle cost analyses acceptable to the Agency to determine the types of materials which will reduce overall costs by lowering operation and maintenance costs, even though their initial costs may be higher; and
(iii) Provide assurances that costs will be reduced when the Agency determines that housing costs are not economical. If assurances cannot be provided, funding may be withdrawn.
(4) The housing proposal will give maximum consideration to energy conservation measures and practices.
(d)
Accessibility.
All housing will meet the following accessibility requirements.
(1) For new construction of MFH, at least 5 percent of the units (but not less than one) must be constructed as fully accessible units to persons with disabilities. The Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) will be followed. Individual copies of these standards are available from the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, 1331 F Street, NW, Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20004-1111, Telephone: (202) 272-0080, TTY: (202) 272-0082, e-mail address:
info@access-board.gov.
When calculating how many accessible units are required, always round up to the next whole number to ensure the 5 percent requirement is met.
(2) For existing properties that do not have fully accessible units, the 5 percent requirement will apply when making substantial alterations as defined by UFAS. The UFAS defines substantial alteration as “alteration to any building or facility is to be considered substantial if the total cost for a twelve month period amounts to 50 percent or more of the full and fair cash value of the building * * *” UFAS further defines full and fair cash value as “the assessed valuation of a building or facility as recorded in the assessor's office of the municipality and as equalized at one hundred percent (100%) valuation, or the replacement cost, or the fair market value.” The 5 percent rule will also apply to repair or renovation work on a single unit. For instance, if a unit is damaged by fire and extensive repair is necessary, to the extent possible the unit is to be converted to a fully accessible unit.
(3) The variety of bedroom quantities of fully accessible units will be comparable to the variety of bedroom quantities of units which are not fully accessible. Borrowers will not, however, be required to exceed the 5 percent requirement simply to have an accessible unit of each bedroom quantity. In addition, accessible units should be distributed throughout the complex so not to concentrate the units in one location.
(4) All MFH must meet:
(i) The accessibility requirements as contained in section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973;
(ii) The requirements of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988;
(iii) The requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as applicable; and
(iv) All other Federal, State, and local requirements. When architectural standards differ, the most stringent standard will be followed.

Determining the security value.
The security value for an Agency loan is the lesser of the total development cost (exclusive of any developer's fee as provided by paragraph (d)(2) of this section) or the housing project's security value as determined by an appraisal conducted in accordance with subpart P of this part, minus any prior or parity liens on the housing project. For purposes of determining security value:
(1) Total development cost must be calculated excluding costs not considered allowable under § 3560.54(a), and excluding costs related to compliance with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Act of 1970.
(2) The appraisal, which will determine the market value, subject to restricted rents, will be obtained by the
Agency and conducted in accordance with subpart P of this part.
(b)
Limitations on loan amounts.
The Agency will not make any loans without adequate security. The following limitations will be set on loan amounts:
(1) For all loan applicants who will receive benefits from the low-income housing tax credit program, the amount of Agency financing for the housing will not exceed 95 percent of the security value available for the Agency loan.
(2) For all loan applicants who will not receive low-income housing tax credit benefits and who are comprised solely of nonprofit organizations, consumer cooperatives, or state or local public agencies, the amount of the loan will be limited to the security value available for the Agency loan, plus the 2 percent initial operating capital and any necessary relocation costs incurred.
(3) For all other loan applicants who will not receive low-income housing tax credit benefits, the loan amount will be limited to no more than 97 percent of the security value available for the Agency loan.
(c)
Equity contribution.
Loan applicants, with the exception of nonprofit organizations, consumer cooperatives, or state or local public agencies who will not be receiving tax credits, must make an equity contribution from their own resources.
(1) Loan applicants who will receive benefits from the low-income housing tax credit program must make an equity contribution in the amount of 5 percent of the Agency loan. The maximum Agency loan will be determined in accordance with § 3560.63(b).
(2) Loan applicants who will not receive benefits from the low-income housing tax credit program and are not nonprofit organizations, consumer cooperatives, or state or local public agencies must make an equity contribution in the amount of 3 percent of the Agency loan. The maximum Agency loan will be determined in accordance with § 3560.63(b).
(d)
Review of assistance from multiple sources.
The Agency will analyze Federal Government and other assistance provided to any MFH project to establish the maximum loan amount and to assure that the assistance is not more than the minimum necessary to make the housing affordable, decent, safe, and sanitary to potential tenants.
(1)
Determining minimum assistance.
For purposes of determining minimum assistance, the total amount paid for builder's profit, overhead, and general requirements may not exceed 21 percent of the construction contract. Unless specified differently in a Memorandum of Understanding between the Agency and the state agency that allocates low-income housing tax credits, limits will be those specified in § 3560.53(l).
(2)
Developer's fee.
While, in accordance with § 3560.54(a)(9), payment of a developer's fee is not an eligible use of Agency loan funds, the Agency will include in total development costs a developer's fee paid from other sources when analyzing the Federal Government assistance to the housing. The Agency may recognize a developer's fee paid from other sources on construction or rehabilitation of up to 15 percent of the total development costs authorized for low-income housing tax credit purposes, or by another Federal Government program. Likewise for transfer proposals that include acquisition costs, the developer's fee on the acquisition cost may be recognized up to 8 percent of the acquisition costs only when authorized under a Federal Government program providing assistance. The developer's fee is not included in determining the Agency's maximum debt limit and loan amount.
(e)
Limits on equity loans.
For equity loans to avert prepayment, the amount of the Agency equity loan will be limited to no more than the difference between 90 percent of market value of the property when appraised as conventional unsubsidized MFH and all current unpaid balances. For information on appraisal issues, refer to subpart P of this part.
(f)
Cost overruns.
(1) All applicants must agree in writing to provide funds at no cost to the housing and without pledging the housing as security to pay any cost for completing planned construction after the maximum debt limit is reached.
(2) After loan approval, the Agency will only approve cost increases for housing proposals involving new construction or major rehabilitation when the additional costs will not cause the limits specified in § 3560.53(l) or the maximum debt limit to be exceeded and the cost increases were caused by:
(i) Unforeseen factors that are determined by the Agency to be beyond the borrower's control;
(ii) Design changes required by the Agency, state, or the local government; or
(iii) Financing changes approved by the Agency.
§ 3560.64
Initial operating capital contribution.
Borrowers are required to make an initial operating capital contribution to the general operating account in the amount of at least 2 percent of the total development cost or appraised value, whichever is less.
(a) Borrowers that are nonprofit organizations, consumer cooperatives, or state or local public agencies and are not receiving low-income housing tax credits, may use loan funds for their initial operating capital contribution. All other borrowers must fund the initial operating capital contribution from their own resources.
(b) Borrowers must provide to the Agency for approval a list of materials and equipment to be funded from the general operating account for initial operating expenses. As specified in § 3560.304(b), initial operating capital may be used only to pay for approved budgeted expenses. If total initial operating expenses exceed 2 percent, the additional amount must be paid by the borrower from its own resources, except that borrowers meeting the provisions of § 3560.64(a) who do not have sufficient resources for this purpose may request Agency assistance. Withdrawals from the reserve account will not be approved for such expenses.

General.
Borrowers hold final responsibility for housing project management and must ensure that operations comply with the terms of all loan or grant documents, Agency requirements and applicable local, state and Federal laws and ordinances. Project operations shall be conducted to meet the actual needs and necessary expenses of the property or for any other purpose authorized under Agency regulations. Any party not meeting these responsibilities may be subject to penalties. It is expected that only typical and reasonable expenses be incurred for the services rendered. Consequently, methods to inflate, duplicate, obscure, or failure to disclose the true nature and cost of work performed for the services rendered will cause the Agency to deny budget requests for the services or issue a demand for recovery and reimbursement for unauthorized actions.
(b)
Management plan.
Borrowers must develop and maintain a management plan for each housing project covered
by their loan or grant. The management plan must establish the systems and procedures necessary to ensure that housing project operations comply with Agency requirements in this part.

The management plan must meet the standards set out in this part.
(c)
Management plan effective period.
A management plan remains in effect as long as it accurately reflects housing project operations and the housing project is in compliance with the Agency requirements.
(1) Borrowers must submit an updated management plan to the Agency if operations change or are no longer consistent with the management plan on file with the Agency.
(2) When there are no changes in operations, borrowers must submit a certification to the Agency every 3 years stating that operations are consistent with the management plan and the plan is adequate to assure compliance with the loan and grant documents and Agency requirements or applicable local, state and Federal laws.
(3) If the Agency determines that operations are in compliance with Agency requirements, loan or grant agreements, or applicable local, state, and Federal laws, but are not consistent with the management plan, the Agency will require the borrower to:
(i) Revise the management plan to accurately reflect housing operations;
(ii) Take actions to ensure the management plan is followed; or
(iii) Advise the Agency in writing of the action taken.
(4) When a housing project is being transferred from one borrower to another, the transferee must submit a management plan that addresses the required items identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section in sufficient detail to enable the Agency to give final approval of the transfer.

(1) Revisions to the management plan establishing the changes in housing operations that will be made to restore compliance;
(2) If the borrower determines the compliance violations were due to a failure to follow the management plan, the borrower must certify to the Agency that the management plan is adequate to assure compliance with the applicable requirements of this part and submit a written description of the actions they will take to ensure the management plan is followed; or
(3) If the Agency discovers continued discrepancies between a management plan and housing project operations or compliance violations, the Agency may require the borrower to install a different management agent acceptable to the Agency as described in paragraph (e) of this section.
(e)
Acceptable management agents.
Borrowers must obtain Agency approval of the agent proposed to manage a housing project prior to entering into any formal agreement with the agent and prior to allowing the agent to assume responsibility for housing project operations. Borrowers that plan to self-manage a housing project also must receive Agency approval before assuming responsibility for housing operations.
(1) Borrowers must submit a written request for Agency approval of the proposed management agent at least 45 days prior to the date the agent is to assume responsibility for operations.

(2) The Agency will deny approval of any proposed management agent that cannot provide evidence of at least two years of experience and satisfactory performance in directing and overseeing the management of similar federally-assisted MFH.
(3) The Agency may issue approval of a management agent that does not meet the requirements of § 3560.102(e)(2) if the management agent can provide evidence that indicates the ability to successfully manage a MFH project in accordance with Agency requirements.
(4) If a borrower enters into an agreement with a management agent or begins to self-manage prior to receiving Agency approval, the Agency will place the borrower in non-monetary default status and will require the borrower to immediately terminate the contract with the management agent.
(f)
Self-management.
Borrowers may self-manage a housing project but must receive Agency approval before assuming responsibility for housing operations. Borrowers that plan to self-manage must meet all requirements of § 3560.102, except for paragraph (h) of this section.

(b)
Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan.
(1) Borrowers with housing projects that have five or more rental units must prepare and maintain an Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan (AFHMP) as defined in 24 CFR part 200, subpart M.
(2) Loan or grant applicants must submit an AFHMP for Agency approval prior to loan closing or grant approval. Plans must be updated by the borrower whenever components of the plan change.
(3) Borrowers must post the approved AFHMP for public inspection at the housing project site, rental office, or at any other location where tenant applications for the project are received.
(4) When developing the plan, the following items must be considered by the borrower:
(i)
Direction of marketing activities.
The plan should be designed to attract applications for occupancy from all potentially eligible groups of people in the housing marketing area, regardless
of race, color, religion, sex, age, familial status, national origin, or disability. The plan must show which efforts will be made to reach very low-income or low-income groups who would least likely be expected to apply without special outreach efforts.
(ii)
Marketing program.
The applicant or borrower should determine which methods of marketing such as radio, newspaper, TV, signs, etc., are best suited to reach those very low-income or low-income groups who are in the market area but who are least likely to apply for occupancy. Marketing must not rely on “word of mouth” advertising.
(A)
Advertising.
(
1
)
Frequency.
The borrower should advertise availability of housing units in advance of their availability to allow time to receive and process applications. Advertising by newsprint or electronic media must occur at least annually to promote project visibility, even if there is an adequate waiting list.
(
2
)
Posters, brochures, etc.
Any radio, TV or newspaper advertisement, pamphlets, or brochures used must identify that the complex is operated on an equal housing opportunity basis. This must be done through the use of the equal housing opportunity statement, slogan, or logo type. Copies of the proposed material must be sent when requesting approval of the plan.
(B)
Community contacts.
Community leaders and special interest groups such as community, public interest, religious organizations, and organizations for the disabled must be contacted. Owners and managers of projects with fully accessible apartments must adopt suitable means to ensure that information regarding the availability of accessible units reaches eligible persons with disabilities. In addition, owners and managers of elderly housing must ensure that information regarding eligibility reaches people who are less than 62 years old but who are eligible because they are disabled. Appropriate contacts are with physical rehabilitation centers, hospitals, workshops for the disabled, commissions on aging, and veterans organizations.
(C)
Rental staff.
All staff persons responsible for renting the units must have had training provided on Federal, state, and local fair housing laws and regulations and in the requirements of fair housing marketing and in those actions necessary to carry out the marketing plan. Copies of instructions to the staff regarding fair housing and a summary of the training they have received must be attached to the plan when requesting approval.
(iii)
Marketing records.
Records must be maintained by the borrower reflecting efforts to fulfill the plan. These records will be reviewed by the Agency during civil rights compliance reviews. Plans will be updated as needed.
(c)
Accommodations and communication.
The borrower must take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, tenants, and members of the public with disabilities. At a minimum, the following steps must be taken:
(1) Furnish appropriate auxiliary aids (electronic, mechanical, or personal assistance) where necessary, to afford an individual with disabilities an equal opportunity to participate in and enjoy the benefits of Agency financed housing.
(i) In determining what auxiliary aids are necessary, the borrower must give primary consideration to the requests of individuals with disabilities.
(ii) The borrower is not required to provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.
(2) Where a borrower communicates with applicants and tenants by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons or equally effective communication systems must be available for use.
(3) The borrower must implement procedures to ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information concerning the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities in the housing project and community.
(4) The borrower is required to provide reasonable accommodations at the project's expense unless doing so would result in undue financial or administrative burden on the project. Examples of reasonable accommodations may include such items as the installation of grab bars, ramps, and roll-in
showers. Reasonable accommodations may also include the modification of rules or policies such as permitting a disabled tenant to have a two-bedroom unit to accommodate a resident assistant or to permit a disabled tenant to have a companion animal. The decision whether the requested accommodation is reasonable or unreasonable or whether to provide the accommodation would cause an undue financial or administrative burden lies with the borrower and would be for the borrower to defend should a complaint subsequently be filed. Borrowers may wish to consult with their legal counsel prior to denying a request. If the borrower takes the position that providing an accommodation would cause an undue financial or administrative burden, the borrower must permit the tenant to make reasonable modifications at the tenant's expense. Requests for reasonable accommodations must be handled in accordance with the management plan.
(d)
Housing sign requirements.
(1) A permanent sign identifying the housing project is required for all housing projects approved on or after September 13, 1977. Permanent signs are recommended for all housing projects approved prior to September 13, 1977. The sign must meet the following requirements:
(i) Must be located at the primary site entrance and be readable and recognizable from the roadside;

We encourage and support an affirmative advertising and marketing program in which there are no barriers to obtaining housing because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.” If the logotype is used, the size of the logo must be no less than 5 percent of the total size of the project sign.
(ix) May display the Agency or Department logotype; and
(x) Must comply with state and local codes.
(2) Accessible parking spaces must be reserved for individuals with disabilities by a sign showing the international symbol of accessibility. The sign must be mounted on a post at a height that is readily visible from an occupied vehicle. In snow areas, the sign must be visible above piled snow. If there is an office, the designated parking space must be van accessible.
(3) When the continuous unobstructed ingress or egress disabled accessibility route to a primary building entrance is other than the usual or obvious route, the alternate route for disabled accessibility must be clearly marked with international accessibility symbols and directional signs to aid a disabled person's ingress or egress to the building, through an accessible entrance, and to the accessible common use and public and living areas.

(b)
General insurance requirements.
All insurance policies must meet the requirements established by the loan documents and this section.
(1) At loan closing, prior to loan approval, applicants must provide documentary evidence that insurance requirements have been met.

(4) The Agency must be named as loss co-payee on all property insurance policies where it holds first lien position. The Agency must be named as an additional insured if its lien position is other than first.
(c)
Borrower failure or inability to meet insurance requirements.
The Agency will take the following actions in cases where a borrower is unwilling or unable to meet the Agency's insurance requirements:
(1) The Agency will obtain insurance for Agency financed property if the borrower fails to do so. If borrowers refuse to pay the insurance premium, the Agency will pay the insurance premium and charge the premium payment amount to the borrower's Agency account and will place the borrower in default as described in § 3560.452(c).
(2) If borrowers habitually fail to pay premiums in a timely manner, the Agency will require borrowers to escrow amounts appropriate to pay insurance premiums.
(3) If insurance that meets the Agency's specified requirements is not available (e.g., flood or hurricane insurance), the Agency may accept the insurance policy that most nearly conforms to established requirements.
(4) If the best insurance policy a borrower can obtain at the time the borrower receives the loan or grant contains a loss deductible clause greater than that allowed by paragraph (f)(9) of this section, the insurance policy and an explanation of the reasons why more adequate insurance is not available must be submitted to the Agency prior to loan or grant approval.
(d)
Credits, refunds, or rebates.
Borrowers must credit any refund or rebate from an insurance company to the project's general operating account or reserve account.
(e)
Insurance company requirements.
All insurers, insurance agents, and brokers must meet the following requirements:

(2) Be deemed reputable and financially sound as determined by the Agency.
(f)
Property insurance.
The following conditions apply to property insurance purchased for Agency-financed housing projects.
(1) At a minimum, borrowers must obtain the following types of property insurance:
(i)
Hazard insurance.
A policy which generally covers loss or damage by fire, smoke, lightning, hail, explosion, riot, civil commotion, aircraft, and vehicles. These policies may also be known as “Fire and Extended Coverage,” “Homeowners,” “All Physical Loss,” or “Broad Form” policies.
(ii)
Flood insurance.
This coverage is required for properties located in Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) as defined in 44 CFR part 65, as determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

(i) Windstorm Coverage.
(ii) Earthquake Coverage.
(iii) Sinkhole Insurance or Mine Subsidence Insurance.
(3) For property insurance, the minimum coverage amount must equal the
“Total Estimated Reproduction Cost of New Improvements,” as reflected in the housing project's most recent appraisal. At a minimum, property insurance coverage must be adequate to cover the lesser of the depreciated replacement value of essential buildings or the unpaid balance of all secured debt, unless such coverage is financially unfeasible for the housing project.
(i) If the cost of the minimum level of property insurance coverage exceeds what the housing project can reasonably afford, the borrower, with Agency concurrence, must obtain the maximum amount of property insurance coverage that the housing project can afford.
(ii) If the coverage amount is less than the depreciated replacement value of all essential buildings, borrowers must obtain coverage on one or more of the most essential buildings, as determined by the Agency.

(4) Except for flood insurance, property insurance is not required if the housing project:
(i) Has a depreciated replacement value of $2,500 or less; or
(ii) Is in a condition which the Agency determines makes insurance coverage not economical.
(5) Policies for several buildings or properties located on noncontiguous sites are acceptable if the insurer provides proof that each secured building or property related to the housing project is as fully protected as if a separate policy were issued.
(6) Borrowers must notify the Agency and their insurance company agents of any loss or damage to insured property and collect the amount of the loss.
(7) When the Agency is in the first lien position and an insurance settlement represents a satisfactory adjustment of a loss, the insurance settlement will be deposited in the housing project's general operating account unless the settlement exceeds $5,000. If the settlement exceeds $5,000, the funds will be placed in the reserve account for the housing project.
(i) Insurance settlement funds which remain after all repairs, replacements, and other authorized disbursements have been made retain their status as housing project funds.
(ii) If the indebtedness secured by the insured property has been paid in full or the insurance settlement is in payment for loss of property on which the Agency has no claim; a loss draft which includes the Agency as co-payee may be endorsed by the Agency without recourse and delivered to the borrower.
(8) When the Agency is not in the first lien position and the insurance settlement represents satisfactory adjustment of the loss, the Agency will release the settlement funds to the primary mortgagee upon agreement of all parties to the provisions contained in agreements between the Agency and the primary lienholder.
(9) Allowable deductible amounts are as follows:
(i)
Hazard/Property Insurance.
(A) $1,000 on any housing project with an insurable value under $200,000; or
(B) One-half of one percent (0.0050) of the insurable value, up to $10,000 on housing projects with insurance values over $200,000.
(ii)
Flood Insurance.
The Agency allows a maximum deductible of $5,000 per building.
(iii)
Windstorm Coverage.
When windstorm coverage is excluded from the “All Risk” policy, the deductible must not exceed five percent of the total insured value.
(iv)
Earthquake Coverage.
In the event that the borrower obtains earthquake coverage, the Agency is to be named as a loss payee. The deductible should be no more than 10 percent of the coverage amount.
(v)
Sinkhole Insurance or Mine Subsidence Insurance.
The deductible for sinkhole insurance or mine subsidence insurance should be similar to what would be required for earthquake insurance.
(10) Deductible amounts (excluding flood, windstorm, earthquake and sinkhole insurance, or mine subsidence insurance) must be accounted for in the replacement reserve account, unless the deductible does not exceed the
maximum deductible allowable as indicated in paragraph (f)(9)(i) of this section. Borrowers who wish to increase the deductible amount must deposit an additional amount to the reserve account equal to the difference between the Agency's maximum deductible and the requested new deductible. The Borrower will be required to maintain this additional amount so long as the higher deductible is in force.
(g)
Liability insurance.
The borrower must carry comprehensive general liability insurance with coverage amounts that meet or exceed Agency requirements. This coverage must insure all common areas, commercial space, and public ways in the security premises. Coverage may also include borrower exposure to certain risks such as errors and omissions, environmental damages, or protection against discrimination claims. The insurer's limit of liability per occurrence for personal injury, bodily injury, or property damage under the terms of coverage must be at least $1 million.
(h)
Fidelity coverage.
Borrowers must provide fidelity coverage on any personnel entrusted with the receipt, custody, and disbursement of any housing monies, securities, or readily salable property other than money or securities.

In addition, the following conditions apply to fidelity insurance:
(1) Fidelity insurance coverage must be documented on a bond form acceptable to the Agency.
(2) Fidelity coverage policies must declare in the insuring agreements that the insurance company will provide protection to the insured against the loss of money, securities, and property other than money and securities, through any criminal or dishonest act or acts committed by any employee, whether acting alone or in collusion with others, not to exceed the amount of indemnity stated in the declaration of coverage.

(3) Blanket crime insurance coverage or fidelity bonds are acceptable types of fidelity coverage.
(4) At a minimum, borrowers must provide an endorsement, listing all of the borrower's Agency financed properties and their locations covered under the policy or bond as evidence of required fidelity insurance. The policy or bond may also include properties or operations other than Agency financed properties on separate endorsement listings.
(5) Individual or organizational borrowers must have fidelity coverage when they have employees with access to the MFH complex assets. Borrowers who use a management agent with exclusive access to housing assets must require the agent to have fidelity coverage on all principals and employees with access to the housing assets. If active management reverts to the borrower, the borrower must obtain fidelity coverage, as a first course of business.
(6) Fidelity coverage is not required under the following circumstances:
(i) The borrower is an individual or a general partnership and the individual or general partner will be responsible for the financial activities of the housing project.
(ii) In the case of a land trust where the beneficiary is responsible for management, the beneficiary will be treated as an individual.
(iii) A limited partnership (or its general partners) unless one or more of its general partners perform financial acts within the scope of the usual duties of an “employee.”
(7) The premium for fidelity coverage of employees and general partners at a housing project is an eligible operating account expense.
(i) The premium of a management agent's fidelity coverage for the
agent's principals and employees will be the management agent's business expense (
i.e.
, it is included within the management fee).
(ii) When a housing project employee is covered under the “umbrella” of the management agent's fidelity coverage, the premium may be prorated among the housing projects covered.
(8) Borrowers must review fidelity coverage annually and adjust it as necessary to comply with the requirements of this section.
(i)
Taxes.
The borrower is responsible for paying all taxes and assessments on a housing project before they become delinquent.
(1) An exception to the above may be made if the borrower has formally contested the amount of the property assessment and escrowed the amount of taxes in question in a manner approved by the Agency.
(2) Failure to pay taxes and assessments when due will be considered a default. If a borrower fails to pay outstanding taxes and assessments, the Agency will pay the outstanding balance and charge the tax or assessment amount, assessed penalties, and any additional incurred costs to the borrower's Agency account.
(3) The Agency will require borrowers who have demonstrated an inability to pay taxes in a timely manner to escrow amounts sufficient to pay taxes.

# Subpart D—Multi-Family Housing Occupancy
§ 3560.151
General.
(a)
Applicability.
This subpart contains borrower and tenant requirements and Agency responsibilities related to occupancy of Agency-financed multi-family housing (MFH) projects. Occupancy eligibility requirements apply to the following:
(1) Family housing projects, including farm labor housing;
(2) Elderly housing projects; and
(3) Congregate housing or group homes for persons with special needs.
(b)
Civil rights requirements.
All occupancy policies must meet applicable civil rights requirements, as stated in § 3560.2.
§ 3560.152
Tenant eligibility.
(a)
General requirements.
Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, a tenant eligible for occupancy in Agency-financed housing must either:
(1) Be a United States citizen or qualified alien, and
(2) Qualify as a very low-, low-, or moderate-income household; or
(3) Be eligible under the requirements established to qualify for housing benefits provided by sources other than the Agency, such as U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Section 8 assistance or Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), when a tenant receives such housing benefits.
(b)
Exception.
Households with incomes above the moderate-income level may occupy housing projects with an Agency loan approved prior to 1968 with a loan agreement that does not restrict occupancy by income.
(c)
Requirements for elderly housing, congregate housing, and group homes.
In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, the following occupancy requirements apply to elderly housing and congregate housing or group homes:
(1) For elderly housing and congregate housing, the following provisions apply:
(i) Households must meet the definition of an elderly household in § 3560.11 to be eligible for occupancy in elderly or congregate housing.
(ii) If non-elderly persons are members of a household where the tenant or co-tenant is an elderly person, the non-elderly persons are eligible for occupancy in the tenant's or co-tenant's rental unit.
(iii) Applicants who will agree to participate in the services provided by a congregate housing project may be given occupancy priority.
(2) For group homes, the following provisions apply:
(i) Occupancy may be limited to a specific group of tenants, such as elderly persons or persons with developmental disabilities, or mental impairments, if such an occupancy limitation is contained in the borrower's management plan.
(ii) Tenants must be able to demonstrate a need for the special services provided by the group home.
(iii) Tenants cannot be required to participate in an ongoing training or rehabilitation program.
(iv) Tenants must be selected from the market area prior to considering applicants from other areas.
(d)
Ineligible tenant waiver.
The Agency may authorize the borrower in writing, upon receiving the borrower's written request with the necessary documentation, to rent vacant units to ineligible persons for temporary periods to protect the financial interest of the Government. Likewise, this provision may extend to a cooperative. This authority will be for the entire project for periods not to exceed one year. Within the period of the lease, the tenant may not be required to move to allow an eligible applicant to obtain occupancy, should one become available. The Agency must make the following determinations:
(1) There are no eligible persons on a waiting list.
(2) The borrower provided documentation that a diligent but unsuccessful effort to rent any vacant units to an eligible tenant household has been made. Such documentation may consist of advertisements in appropriate publications, posting notices in several public places, including places where persons seeking rental housing would likely make contacts, holding open houses, making appropriate contacts with public housing agencies and organizations, Chambers of Commerce, and real estate agencies.
(3) The borrower agrees to continue with aggressive efforts to locate eligible tenants and retain documentation of all marketing.
(4) The borrower is temporarily unable to achieve or maintain a level of occupancy sufficient to prevent financial default and foreclosure. The Agency's approval of the waiver would then be for a limited duration.
(5) The lease agreement will not be more than 12 months and at its expiration will convert to a month-to-month lease. The monthly lease will require that the unit be vacated upon 30 days notice when an eligible applicant is available.
(6) Tenants residing in Rural Rental Housing (RRH) units who are ineligible because their adjusted annual income exceeds the maximum for the RRH project will be charged the Rural Housing Service (RHS) approved note rent for the size of unit occupied in a Plan II RRH project. In projects operated under Plan I, ineligible tenants will be charged a rental surcharge of 25 percent of the approved note rent.
(e)
Tenant certification and verification.
Tenants and borrowers must execute an Agency-approved tenant certification form establishing the tenant's eligibility prior to occupancy. In addition, tenant households must be recertified and must execute a tenant certification form at least annually or whenever a change in household income of $100 or more per month occurs. Borrowers must recertify for changes of $50 per month, if the tenant requests that such a change be made.
(1)
Tenant requirements.
(i) Tenants must provide borrowers with the necessary income and other household information required by the Agency to determine eligibility.
(ii) Tenants must authorize borrowers to verify information provided to establish their eligibility or determination of tenant contribution.
(iii) Tenants must report all changes in household status that may affect their eligibility to borrowers.
(iv) Tenants who fail to comply with tenant certification and recertification requirements will be considered ineligible for occupancy and will be subject
to unauthorized assistance claims, if applicable, as specified in subpart O of this part.
(2)
Borrower requirements.
(i) Borrowers must verify household income and other information necessary to establish tenant eligibility for the requested rental unit type, in a format approved by the Agency, prior to a tenant's initial occupancy and prior to annual or other recertifications.
(ii) Borrowers must review all reported changes in household status and assess the impact of these changes on the tenant's eligibility or tenant contribution.
(iii) Borrowers must submit initial or updated tenant certification forms to the Agency within 10 days of the effective date of an initial certification or any changes in a tenant's status. The effective date of an initial or updated tenant certification form will always be a first day of the month.
(iv) Since tenant certifications are used to document interest credit and rental assistance eligibility and are a basic responsibility of the borrower under the loan documents, borrowers who fail to submit annual or updated tenant certification forms within the time period specified in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section will be charged overage, as specified in § 3560.203(c) and lost rental assistance. Unauthorized assistance, if any, will be handled in accordance with subpart O of this part.
(v) Borrowers must submit tenant certification forms to the Agency using a format approved by the Agency.
(vi) Borrowers must retain executed tenant certification forms and any supporting documentation in the tenant file for at least 3 years or until the next Agency monitoring visit or compliance review, whichever is longer.
(3) The Agency maintains the right to independently verify tenant eligibility information.

(2) Leases must contain a clause permitting escalation in the tenant contribution when there is an Agency-approved change in basic or note rate rents prior to the expiration of the lease. The escalation clause also must specify that the tenant contribution may be changed prior to expiration of the lease if the change is due to changes in tenant status, as documented on the tenant certification form, or the tenant's failure to properly recertify.
(3) Leases must specify that no change in the tenant contribution will occur due to monetary or non-monetary default or when rental assistance or interest credit, is suspended, canceled, or terminated due to the borrower's fault. For information on tenant contributions when a borrower prepays the Agency loan, refer to subpart N of this part.

“It is understood that the use, or possession, manufacture, sale, or distribution of an illegal controlled substance (as defined by local, State, Tribal or Federal law) while in or on any part of this apartment complex premises or cooperative is an illegal act. It is further understood that such action is a material lease violation. Such violations (hereafter called a “drug violation”) may be evidenced upon the admission to or conviction of the use, possession, manufacture, sale, or distribution of a controlled substance (as defined by local, State, Tribal, or Federal law) in any local, State, Tribal or Federal court.
The landlord may require any lessee or other adult member of the tenant household occupying the unit (or other adult or non-adult person outside the tenant household who is using the unit) who commits a drug violation to vacate the leased unit permanently, within timeframes set by the landlord, and not thereafter to enter upon the landlord's premises or the lessee's unit without the landlord's prior consent as a condition for continued occupancy by the remaining members of the tenant's household. The landlord may deny consent for entry unless the person agrees to not commit a drug violation in the future and is either actively participating in a counseling or recovery program, complying with court orders related to a drug violation, or has successfully completed a counseling or recovery program.
The landlord may require any lessee to show evidence that any non-adult member of the tenant household occupying the unit, who committed a drug violation, agrees not to commit a drug violation in the future, and to show evidence that the person is either actively seeking or receiving assistance through a counseling or recovery program, complying with court orders related to a drug violation, or has successfully completed a counseling or recovery program within timeframes specified by the landlord as a condition for continued occupancy in the unit.
Should a further drug violation be committed by any non-adult person occupying the unit the landlord may require the person to be severed from tenancy as a condition for continued occupancy by the lessee.
If a person vacating the unit, as a result of the above policies, is one of the lessees, the person shall be severed from the tenancy and the lease shall continue among any other remaining lessees and the landlord. The landlord may also, at the option of the landlord, permit another adult member of the household to be a lessee.
Should any of the above provisions governing a drug violation be found to violate any of the laws of the land the remaining enforceable provisions shall remain in effect. The provisions set out above do not supplant any rights of tenants afforded by law.”
(16) Leases for rental units accessible to individuals with disabilities occupied by those not needing the accessibility features must establish the tenant's responsibility to move to another unit within 30-days of written notification that the unit is needed by an eligible qualified person with disabilities who requires the accessibility features of the unit. Additionally, the lease clause must ensure that the household may remain in the rental unit with accessibility features until an appropriately sized vacant unit within the project becomes available and then must move or vacate within 30 days of notification from borrower.
(17) If loan prepayment occurs and the housing project is subject to restrictive use provisions, leases and renewals must be amended to include a clause specifying the tenant protections required under subpart N of this part.
(18) All leases must contain the following information and provisions:
(i) The name of the tenant, any co-tenants, and all members of the household residing in the rental unit;
(ii) The identification of the rental unit;

In elderly housing, borrowers must not prohibit tenants from keeping domestic animals in their rental units as pets.
(f)
Tenant organizations.
Borrowers must not infringe on the rights of tenants to organize an association of tenants. Borrowers (or a designated management representative) should be available and willing to work with a tenant organization.

(2) Surviving or remaining members of the household may remain in the housing project, taking into consideration the conditions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, but must move to a suitably sized rental unit within 30 days of its availability.
(3) After the death of a tenant or co-tenant in elderly housing, the surviving members of the household, regardless of age but taking into consideration the conditions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may remain in
the rental unit in which they were residing at the time of the tenant's or co-tenant's death, even if the household is over housed according to the housing project's occupancy rules except as follows:

Termination of occupancy.
(a)
Tenants in violation of lease.

Prior to terminating a lease, the borrower must give the tenant written notice of the violation and give the tenant an opportunity to correct the violation. Subsequently, termination may only occur when the incidences related to the termination are documented and there is documentation that the tenant was given notice prior to the initiation of the termination action that their activities would result in occupancy termination.
(1) Material non-compliance with lease provisions or occupancy rules, for purposes of occupancy termination by a borrower, includes actions such as:
(i) Violations of lease provisions or occupancy rules that are substantial and/or repeated;
(ii) Non-payment or repeated late payment of rent or other financial obligations due under the lease or occupancy rules; or
(iii) Admission to or conviction for use, attempted use, possession, manufacture, selling, or distribution of an illegal controlled substance when such activity occurred on the housing project's premises by the tenant, a member of the tenant's household, a guest of the tenant, or any other person under the tenant's control at the time of the activity.
(2) Good causes, for purposes of occupancy terminations by a borrower, include actions such as:
(i) Actions by the tenant or a member of the tenant's household which disrupt the livability of the housing by threatening the health and safety of other persons or the right of other persons to enjoyment of the premises and related facilities;

Notice will be provided in accordance with § 3560.160(e) of this chapter. All notices of lease termination required by this section due to a tenant's failure to pay rent must also include the following:

Lease expiration or tenant eligibility.
A tenant's occupancy in an Agency-financed housing project may not be terminated by a borrower when the lease agreement expires unless the tenant's actions meet the conditions described in paragraph (a) of this section, or the tenant is no longer eligible for occupancy in the housing. Borrowers must handle terminations of occupancy due to a change in tenant eligibility status in accordance with § 3560.158. At a minimum, the occupancy termination notice must include the following information:
(1) A specific date by which lease termination will occur;
(2) A statement of the basis for lease termination with specific reference to the provisions of the lease or occupancy rules that, in the borrower's judgment, have been violated by the tenant in a manner constituting material non-compliance or good cause; and
(3) A statement explaining the conditions under which the borrower may initiate judicial action to enforce the lease termination notice.
(c)
Other terminations.
Should occupancy be terminated due to conditions which are beyond the control of the tenant, such as a condition related to required repair or rehabilitation of the building, or a natural disaster, and prior to expiration of the disaster declaration, the tenants who are affected by such a circumstance are entitled to benefits under the Uniform Relocation Act and may request a Letter of Priority Entitlement (LOPE) from the Agency. If tenants need additional time to secure replacement housing, the Agency may, at the tenant's request, extend the LOPE entitlement period.
(d)
Criminal activity.
Borrowers may terminate tenancy for criminal activity or alcohol abuse by household members in accordance with the provisions of 24 CFR 5.858, 5.859, 5.860, and 5.861.

§ 3560.202
Establishing rents and utility allowances.
(a)
General.
Rents and utility allowances for rental units in Agency-financed housing projects are set by the borrower and must be based on the operating, management and maintenance expenses and other costs related to the housing project including loan payment amounts due to the Agency.

Agency approval.
All rents and utility allowances set by borrowers are subject to Agency approval.
(c)
Rents.
As applicable, borrowers must establish the following rents:

Utility allowances.
In projects where tenants pay the utilities, borrowers must establish utility allowances for each size and type of rental unit in the housing project based on estimated utility costs. Borrowers must review utility allowances annually, adjust for accuracy, and submit any utility allowance changes to the Agency for approval. If no changes are needed, the borrower must notify the Agency that no changes were made. Documentation to justify utility allowances must be maintained in the housing project files.
(e)
Funds contributed to reduce rents.
If borrowers use funds contributed from sources other than the Agency (e.g., state or local grants, private contributions) to reduce general operating and management expenses, housing project rents must be reduced to reflect the funding being used to offset housing project expenses. When funds contributed from sources other than the Agency are used for housing project expenses, the borrower must certify to the Agency, in writing, that the funds provided will not need to be repaid with Agency funds. Funds from borrower contributions or rehabilitation loans will not be counted towards reducing rents.
(f)
Rents for resident manager, caretaker, or owner-occupied unit.
(1) If approved as a part of a management plan, a borrower may occupy a rental unit in a housing project when they are acting as a management agent or resident manager as specified in § 3560.102(e).
(2) If the rental unit being occupied by a borrower or resident manager is designated as a revenue-producing unit, borrowers must calculate the rental charge to the borrower or resident manager in the same manner as tenant contributions.
(3) If the rental unit being occupied by a borrower or resident manager is designated as a non-revenue producing unit, borrowers must treat the cost of providing the unit the same as other non-revenue producing portions of the housing project.
(g)
LIHTC.
Borrowers who receive LIHTCs may establish rents in accordance with LIHTC requirements. However, borrowers are obligated to ensure that sufficient annual funds are available to cover expenses in the housing project's approved budget, including the required payments on the borrower's Agency loan. Borrowers must not use housing project funds to make up any difference between rents required under Agency program requirements and the maximum allowed rents under the LIHTC program.
§ 3560.203
Tenant contributions.
(a)
Tenant contributions.
A tenant's contribution to rent charged for a rental unit in an Agency financed housing project is based on the tenant's income, as calculated on the Agency's tenant certification forms, and the availability of Agency or non-Agency rental subsidies.

i.e.,
representing a general partner or limited partner to defend their individual owner interest is not allowable);
(v) Fines, penalties, and legal fees where the borrower or a borrower's representative has been found guilty of violating laws, including, but not limited to, civil rights, and building codes.

The party responsible generally pays such expenses for violating the standards or by their insurance carriers;
(vi) Association dues unless related to training for site managers or management agents. To the extent that association dues can document training for site managers or management agents related to project activities by actual cost or pro-ration, a reasonable expense may be billed to the project;

purchasing equipment or software for use by a site manager that is clearly beyond that needed to support project operations). Note that computer learning center activities benefiting tenants are not covered in this prohibition; or
(xi) Costs of tenant services.
(c)
Priorities.
The priority order of planned and actual budget expenditures will be:
(1) Senior position lienholder, if any;
(2) Operating and maintenance expenses, including taxes and insurance;
(3) Agency debt payments;
(4) Reserve account requirements;
(5) All accounts payable;
(6) Other authorized expenditures; and
(7) Return on owner investment.
(d)
Determining if expenses are reasonable.
Generally, expenses charged to project operations, whether for management agent services or other expenses, must be reasonable, typical, necessary and show a clear benefit to the residents of the property. Services and expenses charged to the property must show value added and be for authorized purposes. If such value is not apparent, the service or expense should be examined.
(1) Administrative expenses for project operations exceeding 23 percent, or those typical for the area, of gross potential basic rents and revenues (
i.e.,
referred to as gross potential rents in industry publications) highlight a need for closer review for unnecessary expenditures. Budget approval is required, and project resources may not always permit an otherwise allowable expense to be incurred
if it is not fiscally prudent in the market.
(2) Excessive administrative expenses can result in inadequate funds to meet other essential project needs, including expenditures for repair and maintenance needed to keep the project in sound physical condition. Actions that are improper or not fiscally prudent may warrant budget denial and/or a demand for recovery action.
(e)
Agency review and approval.
(1) The Agency will only approve housing project budgets that meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.
(2) If no rent change is requested, borrowers must submit budget documents for Agency approval 60 calendar days prior to the start of the housing project's fiscal year. The Agency will notify borrowers if the budget submission does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. The borrower will have 10 days to submit the additional material.
(3) If a rent change is requested, the borrower must submit budget documents to the Agency and notify tenants of the requested rent change at least 90 calendar days prior to the start of the housing project's fiscal year.
(i) The Agency will notify borrowers if the budget submission does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, or if the rent and utility allowance request has been denied in accordance with § 3560.205(f). The borrower will have 10 days to submit the additional material to address any issues raised by the Agency.
(ii) The rent change is not approved until the Agency issues a written approval. If there is no response from the Agency within the 30-day period, the rent change is considered automatic. The following budgets are not eligible for automatic approval:
(A) Budgets with rent increases above $25 per unit; and
(B) Budgets that are submitted late or that miss other deadlines set by the Agency.
(4) If the Agency denies the budget approval, the Agency will notify the borrower in writing.
(5) If budget approval is denied, the borrower shall continue to operate the housing project based on the most recently approved budget.

§ 3560.304
Initial operating capital.
(a)
Purpose.
To provide a source of capital for start-up costs, such as the purchase of equipment, and paying operating, maintenance, and debt service expenses. Borrowers are required to make an initial operating capital contribution to the general operating account as described in § 3560.64.
(b)
Authorized uses of initial operating capital.
Initial operating capital may be used only to pay for approved budgeted expenses.
(c)
Withdrawal of initial operating capital.
Initial operating capital funds may be withdrawn by a borrower if:
(1) The initial operating capital was provided from the borrower's own funds;
(2) The borrower requests the withdrawal after the second year of housing project operations and prior to the 7th year of operations;
(3) The housing project has had a 90 percent occupancy rate for a period of 12 months prior to the withdrawal request;
(4) The withdrawal will not affect the financial viability of the housing project;
(5) Contributions to the reserve account are at authorized levels;
(6) The withdrawal request will not result in rent increases; and
(7) There are no outstanding deficiencies in management's physical maintenance of the housing project.
§ 3560.305
Return on investment.
(a)
Borrower's return on investment.
Borrowers may receive a return on their investment (ROI) in accordance with the terms of their loan agreement and the following:
(1) If there is a positive net cash flow in housing project operations, the ROI may be taken by the borrower after the housing project's fiscal year, provided that the balance of the reserve account is equal to or greater than required deposits minus authorized withdrawals. If the annual financial reports indicate that an ROI should not have been taken, borrowers will be required to return any unauthorized ROI.
(2) If there is negative cash flow in housing project operations, the Agency may authorize the borrower to take the ROI only after the Agency has reviewed the housing project's annual financial reports and determines:
(i) Surplus cash exists in either the general operating account as defined in § 3560.306(d)(1) or the reserve account, if the balance is greater than the required deposits minus authorized withdrawals.
(ii) The housing project has sufficient funds to address identified capital or operational needs.
(b)
Unpaid return on investment.
An earned, but unpaid ROI for the previous year only may be requested by the borrower and authorized by the Agency under the provisions of § 3560.305(a)(2) provided the current year's ROI has been paid first and a rent increase is not required to generate funds to pay the unpaid ROI.
§ 3560.306
Reserve account.
(a)
Purpose.
To meet the major capital expense needs of a housing project, borrowers must establish and maintain a reserve account, unless escrowed by the Agency.
(b)
Financial management of the reserve account.
Unless otherwise approved by the Agency, borrower management of the reserve account is subject to the requirements of 7 CFR part 1902, subpart A, regarding supervised bank accounts.
(c)
Funding of the reserve account.
Borrowers must make payments to the reserve account in the amount established in loan documents, beginning with the first loan payment or a date specified in loan documents.
(d)
Transfer of surplus general operating account funds.
(1) The general operating account will be deemed to contain surplus funds when the balance at the end of the housing project's fiscal year, after all payables and priorities, exceeds 20 percent of the operating and maintenance expenses. If the borrower is escrowing taxes and insurance premiums, include the amount that should be escrowed by year end and subtract such tax and insurance premiums from operating and maintenance expenses used to calculate 20 percent of the operating and maintenance expenses.
(2) If a housing project's general operating account has surplus funds at the end of the housing project's fiscal year per paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the borrower will be required to use such surplus for one of the following (not in priority order): use the surplus funds to address capital needs, make a deposit in the reserve account or reduce the debt service on the borrower's loans, including Agency-approved third-party debt. The prior written consent of the Agency must be obtained before surplus funds may be used to pay debt service on third-party debt. At the end of the borrower's fiscal year, if the borrower is required to transfer surplus funds from the general operating account to the reserve account, the transfer does not change the future required contributions to the reserve account.
(e)
Account requirements.
Borrowers must establish and maintain the reserve account according to § 3560.65, § 3560.302(c)(5), and the following requirements:
(1) Reserve accounts must be deposited in interest-bearing accounts or securities; and
(2) Reserve accounts must be supervised accounts that require the Agency to approve all withdrawals; except, this requirement is not applicable when loan funds guaranteed by the Section 538 GRRH program are used for the construction and/or rehabilitation of a direct MFH loan project. Direct MFH loan borrowers, who are exempted from the supervised account requirement, as described in this section, must follow Section 538 GRRH program regulatory requirements pertaining to reserve accounts. In all cases, Section 538 lenders must get prior written approval from the Agency before reserve account funds involving a direct MFH loan project can be disbursed to the borrower.
(f)
Funds invested in securities.
In addition to the requirements specified in paragraph (e) of this section, the following requirements apply when reserve funds are invested in securities:
(1) The reserve account must be held either at a Federally insured domestic institution such as a bank, savings and loan association, credit union, or at a
domestic institution authorized to sell securities.
(2) The borrower must record the price actually paid for the securities. When designated as a reserve deposit, the price paid must equal the required contribution to reserves.
(3) Borrowers must be knowledgeable about industry practices and consider the impact of typical fees and charges for purchases and sales and maintenance of an account when making investment decisions. Such fees may be paid for out of reserves, only with the consent of the Agency. Housing project funds may not be used to pay for a financial advisor.
(g)
Use of the reserve account.
(1) Borrowers must request Agency approval of reserve account withdrawals prior to the withdrawal. Borrowers must inform the Agency of planned uses of reserve accounts in their annual capital budget if known at budget planning time. Any item on the approved capital budget does not require additional pre-approval by the Agency.
(2) Borrowers should include any needed capital improvements based on the needs identified in an Agency approved Capital Needs Assessment (if obtained) are completed within a reasonable timeframe.
(3) The Agency will indicate any conditions governing withdrawals from a reserve account at the time it approves the withdrawal.
(4) In emergency situations, the Agency may specify special procedures to provide an expedited approval process for the use of the reserve account.
(5) The Agency may approve the use of reserve funds for operating costs when circumstances that are determined by the Agency to be beyond the borrower's control have resulted in a shortfall in the housing project's general operating account.
(6) Funds from the replacement reserve account cannot be used to pay any fees associated with the Section 538 GRRH loan guarantee, as determined by the Agency.
(h)
Allowable uses.
Allowable uses of reserve funds include the following:
(1) Major capital improvements and replacements.
(2) Housing project operating expenses provided the requirement of paragraph (g)(4) of this section has been met, including:
(i) Payments due on the loan, or
(ii) Payment of a return on investment at the end of the borrower's fiscal year if such payment comes from surplus operating funds in the reserve account.
(3) With Agency approval, borrowers operating on a for-profit or a limited profit basis may make an annual withdrawal from the reserve account, equal to no more than 25 percent of the interest earned on a reserve account during the prior year.
(4) For other purposes, which in the judgment of the Agency will promote the loan purposes, strengthen the security or facilitate, improve, or maintain the housing and the orderly collection of the loan without jeopardizing the loan or impairing the adequacy of the security.
(i)
Records.
Borrowers must maintain records documenting all expenses that were paid by withdrawals from the reserve account.
(j)
Changes to reserve requirements.
(1) As projects age, the required reserve account level may be adjusted to meet anticipated “life-cycle” needs, including equipment and facility replacement costs, by amending the loan agreement/resolution.
(2) The Agency will allow for an annual adjustment to increase reserve account funding levels by Operating Cost Adjustment Factor (OCAF) as published by HUD annually. This will require a modification to the Loan agreement and the increase documented with budget submission as outlined in § 3560.303.
(3) The Agency may approve a change in the reserve account funding level based on the findings of an approved capital needs assessment. The approval to increase reserve account funding levels will take into consideration the housing project's approved budget and the housing project's ability to support increased reserve account deposits without causing basic rents to exceed conventional rents for comparable units in the area.
(k)
Excess reserves.
Amounts in the reserve account which exceed the total
required by the loan or grant agreement must be used, at the direction of the Agency, for any of the following:
(1) Pay for expenses specified in a long-term capital plan;
(2) Make payments and reamortize the Agency loan;
(3) Reduce rents by a transfer to the general operating account;
(4) Fund preservation incentives authorized in subpart N of this part; or
(5) Cover other expenditures determined to be related to the purpose of the housing project and in the best interest of the Federal Government.
(l)
Procurement.
The requirements of § 3560.102(g), (j), and (k), and all other Agency requirements relating to procurement, bidding, identity-of-interest, cost-reasonableness, and construction management apply to any work or services paid out of reserve funds. Structural repairs and other significant work on major building systems such as heating or air conditioning must be done in accordance with the requirements of 7 CFR part 1924, subpart A.

[69 FR 69106, Nov. 26, 2004, as amended at 82 FR 49286, Oct. 25, 2017; 89 FR 96859, Dec. 6, 2024]
§ 3560.309
Advancement (loan) of funds to a RRH project by the owner, member of the organization, or agent of the owner.
(a) Prior written approval by the Servicing Office is required. Such advances may be authorized when justified by unusual short-term conditions. When conditions are not short-term in nature, a servicing plan may be developed and advances may be approved in accordance with the provisions set out in § 3560.453 of this part.

# Subpart H—Agency Monitoring
§ 3560.351
General.
This subpart contains policies for Agency monitoring of operations and management at multi-family housing (MFH) projects.
§ 3560.352
Agency monitoring scope, purpose, and borrower responsibilities.
(a)
Scope of Agency monitoring activities.
The Agency will review reports, records, and other materials related to the housing project, including borrower
financial reports, housing project records, and other communications. The Agency also will review material related to a housing project submitted by a tenant or other source. To assess conditions such as a housing project's physical condition, record keeping procedures, and operations and management activities, including borrower compliance with Federal, state, and local laws and Agency requirements, the Agency will conduct periodic on-site monitoring reviews of a housing project.
(b)
Purpose of Agency monitoring activities.
Agency monitoring activities are designed to assess borrower and tenant compliance with Agency requirements, and to:
(1) Ensure housing projects are managed in accordance with the goals and objectives of the Agency's MFH programs and are maintained in accordance with Agency requirements for affordable, decent, safe, and sanitary housing;
(2) Preserve the value of the Agency-financed housing projects;
(3) Detect waste, fraud, and abuse in housing project operations or management and to ensure the cost of operations and management are necessary and reasonable;
(4) Verify compliance with Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing requirements, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, other applicable Federal laws, and Agency requirements related to occupancy and tenant eligibility.
(c)
Borrower responsibilities.
The borrower is responsible for cooperating fully and promptly with Agency monitoring activities. Agency monitoring activities do not diminish borrower operation and management responsibilities and do not relieve borrowers from any Agency requirements including, but not limited to, borrower requirements to comply with:
(1) The terms of all agreements with the Agency, including the loan or grant agreement, assurance agreement, loan resolution, promissory note, mortgage, interest credit agreement, rental assistance agreement, mitigation measures contained in the environmental review document, and workout agreement;
(2) The requirements contained in this part;

(4) Applicable Federal, state, and local laws.
§ 3560.353
Scheduling of on-site monitoring reviews.
Generally, the Agency will provide the borrower prior notice of an on-site monitoring review and will conduct the on-site monitoring review in the presence of the borrower. However, the Agency may visit a housing project, without prior notice, to observe physical conditions, operations and management activities, or other borrower or tenant activities. In addition, the Agency may conduct on-site reviews without the presence of the borrower, the management agent, or other designated representative of the borrower.
§ 3560.354
Borrower response to monitoring review notifications.
The Agency will notify borrowers, in writing, whenever Agency monitoring activities result in deficiency findings or compliance violations. The monitoring review notification will describe the deficiencies findings or compliance violations and will specify a time period by which corrective action must be taken by the borrower. The notification will offer borrowers an opportunity to discuss the reported deficiency findings or compliance violations with the Agency and will explain enforcement actions that the Agency may take if corrective action is not taken within the time period specified in the monitoring review notification. When civil rights non-compliance is found, the State Civil Rights Coordinator or Manager (SCRC/M) will be notified. If voluntary compliance cannot be obtained, appropriate enforcement or remedial action will be taken.

# Subpart J—Special Servicing, Enforcement, Liquidation, and Other Actions
§ 3560.451
General.
This subpart contains special servicing, enforcement, liquidation, and other actions that the borrower may request or the Agency may implement when compliance violations, monetary defaults, or non-monetary defaults cannot be resolved through regular servicing.
(a)
Agency obligations.
The Agency is under no obligation to offer or agree to any special servicing actions.
(b)
Relationship to workout agreements.
Special servicing actions may be implemented either as a part of a workout agreement, developed in accordance with § 3560.453, or as an action approved by the Agency separate from a workout agreement unless indicated otherwise in this subpart.
§ 3560.452
Monetary and non-monetary defaults.
(a)
General.
Borrowers are in default when they have received a compliance violation notice, issued in accordance with § 3560.354, and have failed to correct the compliance violation identified in the compliance violation notice within the time period specified in the notice. Compliance violations include, but are not limited to, violations of promissory note provisions, loan or grant agreement provisions, regulatory, or other Agency requirements, including requirements imposed on a borrower through a workout agreement developed in accordance with § 3560.453.
(b)
Monetary defaults.
A monetary default exists when any amount due to the Agency or a third party (such as real estate taxes and insurance) under a promissory note, loan or grant agreement, workout agreement, or other agreement remains due more than 30 days after the due date.
(c)
Nonmonetary defaults.
A nonmonetary default exists when a borrower fails to correct a compliance violation, other than a monetary amount past due, within the time period specified in a compliance violation notice issued in accordance with § 3560.354. Nonmonetary defaults include, but are not limited to, failure to:
(1) Operate and manage a housing project in accordance with the Agency approved management plan or Agency requirements;
(2) Maintain the physical condition of a housing project in a decent, safe, and sanitary manner and in accordance with Agency requirements;
(3) Keep general operating expense, reserve, and other financial accounts related to a housing project at required funding levels;
(4) Occupy rental units with eligible tenants, unless granted an exception by the Agency;
(5) Charge correct rents or to correctly calculate net tenant contributions, utility allowances, or rental assistance payments or to properly administer the Agency rental assistance assigned to the housing project;
(6) Submit required annual financial reports to the Agency within time periods specified in § 3560.308;
(7) Submit management plans, leases, occupancy rules, and other required materials to the Agency in accordance with Agency requirements; and,
(8) Comply with applicable Federal laws including laws related to civil rights, fair housing, disabilities, and environmental conditions.
(d)
Default notice.
When borrowers are in default, the Agency will notify borrowers, in writing, that they are in default. The default notice will identify the compliance violation that led to the default, will specify actions necessary to cure the default, and will establish a date by which the default must be cured to preclude Agency initiation of enforcement actions, liquidation, or other actions.
(e)
Agency action.
If a borrower fails to cure a default within the time period specified in the default notice, the Agency may initiate the enforcement actions described in § 3560.461 or liquidation as described in § 3560.456. Also, Agency compliance violation notices and related default notices may be referred to Federal, state, and local agencies with jurisdictions related to the violations for handling, in accordance with their requirements.
§ 3560.453
Workout agreements.
(a)
General.
(1) Prevention or resolution of compliance violations or default cures are a borrower's responsibility.
(2) A borrower may develop and submit to the Agency for approval a workout agreement that proposes actions to be taken over a period of time to prevent or correct a compliance violation or to cure a monetary or non-monetary default.
(3) A borrower developed workout agreement may propose, but is not limited to, the following actions:
(i) A combination of one or more of the special servicing actions outlined in §§ 3560.454 and 3560.455;
(ii) A change in operations and management at a housing project; or
(iii) A commitment of additional financial resources to the housing project with the amount and source of the additional resources to be committed to the housing project specifically identified.
(b)
Workout agreement approval.
(1) The Agency is under no obligation to approve a workout agreement as submitted by a borrower or to act with forbearance when a housing project is in monetary or non-monetary default.
(2) Borrower developed workout agreements may not be implemented until the borrower receives written approval from the Agency.
(3) The Agency will only approve a workout agreement if the Agency determines that the actions proposed are likely to prevent or correct compliance violations or cure a default and approval is in the best interest of the Federal Government and tenants.
(4) The Agency will only approve a workout agreement if the proposed actions are consistent with the borrower's management plan. If proposed actions are not consistent with the borrower's management plan, applicable revisions to the borrower's management plan must be made before approval of the workout agreement is given.
(c)
Workout agreement required content.
(1) Workout agreements submitted to the Agency for approval must be in writing and signed by the borrower. Workout agreements must describe proposed actions in sufficient detail to demonstrate the likelihood of the actions to prevent or correct compliance violations or cure defaults.
(2) At a minimum, workout agreements must include the following.
(i) The name and address of the housing project, project number, borrower's tax identification number, and other information necessary to identify the housing project.
(ii) A description of the potential or actual compliance violation or default situation, including an explanation of related causes, such as cash flow concerns, budget revisions, deferred maintenance, vacancies, or violations of statutes.
(iii) A definition and description of the housing project's market area, including information on housing availability, rents, and vacancy rates in the market area.
(iv) A description of the proposed actions to prevent or correct compliance violations or to cure defaults along with a date specific schedule indicating
when interim and final actions will be taken to correct the compliance violation or cure the default.
(v) A description of financial and other resources necessary to prevent or correct the compliance violation or cure the default including an identification of the sources for such resources.
(d)
Workout agreement budgets.
Budget revisions submitted as a part of a workout agreement for a housing project experiencing cash flow problems must prioritize cash disbursements in the following order:
(1) Prior lienholder, if any;
(2) Critical operating and maintenance expenses, including taxes and insurance;
(3) Agency debt payments;
(4) Reserve account requirements; and
(5) Other authorized expenditures.
(e)
Workout agreement terms and cancellation.
(1) Workout agreements shall be in effect for no longer than a 2-year time period, beginning on the date of Agency approval. If an approved workout agreement calls for actions that extend beyond a 2-year period, borrowers must submit an updated and, if necessary, revised workout agreement to the Agency for approval. The updated workout agreement must be submitted to the Agency, 30 days prior to the expiration of the workout agreement in effect.
(2) The Agency may cancel a workout agreement at any time if the borrower fails to comply with the terms of the agreement. The Agency will provide notice to the borrower upon cancellation of the workout agreement.
§ 3560.454
Special servicing actions related to housing operations.
(a)
Changing rents or revising budgets.
The Agency may approve a borrower request for a rent change, rent incentives, or a revised budget, at any time during a housing project's fiscal year.
(b)
Occupancy waivers.
If the Agency determines that a housing project with high vacancies could be kept operationally and financially viable by allowing the borrower to accept as tenants persons with incomes above the income eligibility standards specified in § 3560.152(a), the Agency, in writing, may grant the borrower an occupancy waiver to allow such persons as tenants. Occupancy waivers will be in effect only during the time period specified by the Agency when the waiver is granted. In addition, borrowers must rent to all eligible applicants on the housing projects waiting list prior to accepting persons with incomes above the Agency standards as tenants.
(c)
Additional rental assistance (RA).
If the Agency determines that a housing project with high vacancies could be kept operationally and financially viable by increasing the amount of RA allocated to the housing project, the Agency, subject to available funds, may offer the housing project RA as a means of preventing or correcting a compliance violation or curing a default.
(d)
Special note rents.
When a Plan II housing project is experiencing severe vacancies due to market conditions, the Agency may approve a rent less than the note rent to attract and keep tenants whose incomes, according to the formula in § 3560.203, would require them to pay the note rent. The reduced rent is called a Special Note Rent (SNR) and, as noted in § 3560.210, approval of an SNR may affect approvals of loan proposals submitted to the Agency for the market area where the SNR is in effect.
(1) An SNR rent may only be requested as a part of a proposed workout agreement and must include documentation of market conditions, the housing project's vacancy rates, evidence of marketing efforts, and other concerns necessitating the request for an SNR.
(2) Borrowers must forego the annual return to owner for each housing project's fiscal year that an SNR is in effect for all or part of a fiscal year at a housing project.
(3) SNR's may be increased, decreased, or terminated any time during a housing project's fiscal year when market conditions, vacancy rates, or other concerns that necessitated the SNR warrant a change.
(4) In addition to any state lease law requirements that might be related to the implementation of an SNR, the borrower must notify each tenant of
any change in rents or utility allowances that result from approval of an SNR, in accordance with § 3560.205(c) and must submit the appropriate budget changes to the Agency for approval.
(e)
Termination of management agreement.
If the Agency determines that a compliance violation or loan default was caused, in full or in part, by actions or inactions of the housing project's management agent, the Agency will require the borrower to terminate the management agreement with that agent, or in the case of a borrower managed housing project, to enter an agreement with a third-party non-identity of interest management agent, unless the borrower and the Agency agree on a written plan to prevent reoccurrence of the violation. Housing project funds may not be used to pay a management fee to a management agent after the Agency has directed the borrower to terminate a management agreement with that agent, except during an Agency approved transition period.
§ 3560.455
Special servicing actions related to loan accounts.
(a)
General.
To prevent or correct a compliance violation or to prevent or cure a default in a situation that cannot be resolved through regular servicing, the Agency may approve a deferral of loan payments or a loan restructuring. Nothing herein precludes the Agency from initiating appropriate legal action to correct a compliance violation if the Agency determines such action is more in the Government's interest than entering into a special servicing agreement as provided for in this section. Procedures for debt collection are discussed in § 3560.460. As part of a workout agreement, the Agency may agree to accept less than full monthly payment installments due on an Agency loan for a specified period of time, not to exceed the effective period of the workout agreement.
(b)
Loan reamortizations.
A loan reamortization is a restructuring of loan terms and conditions over a period of time that does not exceed the remaining useful life of the housing project.
(1) Loan reamortizations will only be approved when they are in the best interest of the Federal Government and tenants and when the following conditions are met.
(i) The Agency determines that the borrower will be unable to meet their obligations without a reduction in monthly payment installments; and
(ii) The Agency is satisfied that the security, including the potential income for debt service, will be adequate to protect the Agency's interest over the term of the reamortization and that the reamortization will not adversely affect the Federal Government's lien priority.
(2) If the Agency approves a reamortization of a loan under this section, it will be at the existing note rate, or the current interest rate at the time of reamortization closing or approval, whichever is less.
(3) Loan reamortization may be used to:
(i) Restructure loan repayments to prevent or correct a compliance violation or cure a default caused by circumstances beyond the borrower's control in situations where the borrower is otherwise in compliance with Agency requirements;
(ii) Repay principal, outstanding interest, overage, and advances made by the Agency for recoverable cost items when less than full payments were authorized under the provisions of an Agency approved workout agreement;
(iii) Restructure a borrower's loan payments in conjunction with an incentive package developed in accordance with § 3560.656 to prevent prepayment of the loan;
(iv) Restructure an existing loan in conjunction with a subsequent loan for rehabilitation; or
(v) Restructure remaining debt when a portion of the property serving as loan security is sold and there is a need to reestablish the financial stability of the housing project.
(c)
Loan writedowns.
A loan writedown is a reduction of a borrower's debt approved by the Agency.
(1) Loan writedowns will only be approved when they are in the best interest of the Federal Government and when the following conditions exist:
(i) Sound management of the housing project is evident or sound management practices are proposed for correction in accordance with an Agency approved workout agreement; and
(ii) The housing project's financial stability is being affected by conditions beyond the borrower's control, such as market weaknesses, unforeseen site problems, or natural disasters.
(2) Prior to Agency approval for a loan writedown, the borrower must obtain an appraisal of the housing project that concludes the “ ‘as-is’ market value,” subject to restricted rents, conducted in accordance with subpart P of this part. The Agency will not approve a loan write-down unless the appraisal indicates the Federal Government's interests are secured at the proposed writedown level.
(3) Any writedown will be conditioned on a finding that the borrower does not have the ability to pay a higher loan payment, even if the loan is reamortized.
(4) Loan writedowns may be used to allow for a loan transfer and assumption for less than the total amount of outstanding debt.
§ 3560.456
Liquidation.
Prior to any servicing action which might lead to the acquisition of real property by the Agency, the Agency must complete a due diligence report to assess any potential contamination of the property from hazardous substances, hazardous wastes, or petroleum products. The borrower must cooperate with the Agency in the development of this report.
(a)
Before acceleration.
Before accelerating a project loan, the Agency will consider the possibility that the borrower is forcing an acceleration to circumvent the prepayment process. If it is found that this is the borrower's motivation, the Agency will consider alternatives to acceleration, such as suing for specific performance under loan and management documents.
(b)
Acceleration.
When a borrower is in monetary or non-monetary default, the Agency will accelerate the loan unless the Agency decides other enforcement measures are more appropriate.
(1) If the borrower does not pay the full account balance and meet the other terms of the acceleration notice within the time period set forth in the acceleration notice, the Agency will foreclose or acquire the security property through deed in lieu of foreclosure.
(2) The Agency will suspend interest credit and rental assistance.
(3) The Agency will not accept partial payment of an accelerated loan unless required by state law.
(c)
Voluntary liquidation.
After acceleration, borrowers may voluntarily liquidate through either of the following mechanisms:
(1) Deed in lieu of foreclosure. RHS may accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure to convey title to the security property only after the debt has been accelerated and when it is in the Government's best interest.
(2) Offer by third party. If a junior lienholder or cosigner makes an offer in the amount of at least the net recovery value, RHS may assign the note and mortgage after all appeal rights have expired.
(d)
Foreclosure.
(1) The Agency will initiate foreclosure when a borrower is in monetary or non-monetary default and foreclosure is in the best interest of the Federal Government.
(2) When a junior lienholder foreclosure does not result in payment in full of the Agency debt but the property is sold subject to the Agency lien, the Agency will liquidate the account.
(e)
Acquisition of chattel properties.
(1) The Agency will accept voluntary conveyance of chattel property only when the borrower can convey ownership free of other liens and the Agency has agreed to release the borrower from further liability on the account.
(2) If the Agency decides to accept an offer of voluntary conveyance of chattel property, the borrower must provide an itemized listing of each chattel property item being conveyed and provide title to vehicles or other equipment, where applicable.
§ 3560.457
Negotiated debt settlement.
(a)
Borrower proposals to settle debt.
A borrower who cannot pay the full amount of loan payments may propose an offer to settle an outstanding debt for less than the full amount of that
debt. The Agency may approve a negotiated debt settlement only in cases where a default is evident and doing so is in the best interest of the Federal Government and tenants.
(b)
Required information.
Borrowers requesting debt settlement must submit complete and accurate information from which a full determination of financial condition can be made. Debt settlement offers will not be approved by the Agency unless the financial information submitted by the borrower indicates that the borrower will be able to make the debt settlement payments as proposed.
(c)
Effective date of approval.
Debt settlement offers will not be accepted until the borrower receives written approval from the Agency.
(d)
Appraisal requirement.
No debt settlement offer will be accepted for less than the net recovery value of the security as determined by a licensed appraiser or other qualified official, and concurred in by the Agency's qualified appraisal review official or other qualified official.
(e)
Disposition of security prior to offer.
Borrowers are not required to dispose of security prior to making a debt settlement offer. However, if a borrower has disposed of security prior to making a debt settlement offer, the proceeds from the disposed security must be applied to the borrower's account prior to any negotiations on the debt settlement offer.
(f)
Final release condition.
Upon full payment of the approved debt settlement, the Agency will release the borrower from liability.
§ 3560.458
Special property circumstances.
(a)
Abandonment.
When the Agency determines that a borrower has abandoned security for a loan under this part, the Agency will take the steps necessary to protect the Federal Government's interest in the security. Costs associated with managing abandoned property are the responsibility of the borrower and will be charged to the borrower's account until liquidation is completed.
(b)
Other security.
The Agency will service security such as collateral assignments, assignments of rents, Housing Assistance Payments Contracts, and notices of lienholder interest according to acceptable practices in the respective states.
(c)
Taking of additional security to protect Agency interests.
The Agency may require borrowers to provide additional security in the form of real estate, cash reserves, letters of credit, or other security when needed to improve the chances that the Agency will not suffer a loss, and when:
(1) The account is in default; or
(2) The property has not been properly managed or maintained.
(d)
Due diligence.
When the Agency has completed an environmental site assessment in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970, and decides not to acquire security property through liquidation action or chooses to abandon its security interest in real property, whether due in whole or in part, to releases of or the presence of contamination from hazardous substances, hazardous wastes, or petroleum products, the Agency will provide the appropriate environmental authorities with a copy of its environmental site assessment.
[69 FR 69106, Nov. 26, 2004, as amended at 81 FR 11049, Mar. 2, 2016]
§ 3560.459
Special borrower circumstances.
(a)
Deceased borrower, bankruptcy, insolvency, and divorce actions.
The Agency will address borrower accounts affected by special circumstances such as death, bankruptcy, insolvency, and divorce on a case-by-case basis. The Agency will make servicing decisions in such cases on the basis of best interest to the Federal Government and tenants. The Agency will bring a legal action to establish the legal capacity of the borrower to administer the project if found necessary to protect the government's interests. In order for the Agency to make servicing decisions in such cases, the borrower or the borrower's representative will provide to the Agency:
(1) On the part of the heirs or executor of the borrower's estate, evidence of legal action due to a will or court actions that establish who is to become the owner;
(2) The financial status of the borrower and any member pledging additional security for the debt;
(3) The status of the security property; and
(4) The impact of the identified actions on the operation of the project.
(b)
Membership liability agreements.
If a borrower's note is endorsed by individuals other than the borrower or a borrower has security agreements with members of the organization for the purchase of shares of stock or for the payment of a pro rata share of the loan in the event of default, or has individual liability agreements, which are usually assigned to and held by the Agency as additional security for the loan, the security and liability agreements must be adequate to protect the Agency's interest.
(c)
Security issues in participation loans.
When a multi-family housing (MFH) project is receiving financing or a subsidy from sources other than the Agency, the Agency will service the account in accordance with the participation agreements made with the Agency and the other funding sources under § 3560.65.
§ 3560.460
Double damages.
(a)
Action to recover assets or income.
(1) The Agency may request to the Attorney General to bring an action in a United States district court to recover any assets or income used by any person in violation of the provisions of a loan made by the Agency under this section or in violation of any applicable statute or regulation.
(2) For the purposes of this section, a use of assets or income in violation of the applicable loan, statute, or regulation includes any use for which the documentation in the books and accounts does not establish that the use was made for a reasonable operating expense or necessary repair of the project or for which the documentation has not been maintained in accordance with the requirements of the Agency and in reasonable condition for proper audit.
(3) For the purposes of this section, the term “person” means:
(i) Any individual or entity that borrows funds in accordance with programs authorized by this section;
(ii) Any individual or entity holding 25 percent or more interest in any entity that the Agency funds in accordance with programs authorized by this section; and
(iii) Any officer, director, or partner of an entity that borrows funds in accordance with programs authorized by this section.

(1) In any judgment favorable to the United States entered under this section, the Attorney General may recover double the value of the assets and income of the project that the court determines to have been used in violation of the provisions of a loan made by the Agency under this section or any applicable statute or regulation, plus all costs related to the actions, including reasonable attorney and auditing fees.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the Agency may use amounts recovered under this section for activities authorized under this section and such funds must remain available for such use until expended.
(c)
Time limitation.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, an action under this section may be commenced at any time during the six-year period beginning on the date that the Agency discovered or should have discovered the violation of the provisions of this section or any related statutes or regulations.

# Subpart K—Management and Disposition of Real Estate Owned (REO) Properties
§ 3560.501
General.
This subpart contains Agency procedures and other policies related to the management and disposition of multi-family housing (MFH) projects in the Agency's inventory (Real Estate Owned (REO) property). Housing projects will not be accepted into the Agency's inventory unless one of the following has occurred:
(a) The borrower has abandoned the housing project and the Agency has performed the required steps to take the housing project into custody.
(b) The housing project title has been transferred to the Agency as a result of foreclosure, voluntary conveyance, redemption, or other action.
§ 3560.502
Tenant notifications and assistance.
Each tenant in an REO property designated to be sold as a non-program property will be notified by the Agency, in writing, of the housing projects' non-program designation and will be given an opportunity to obtain a Letter Of Priority Entitlement (LOPE) as specified in § 3560.159(c).
§ 3560.503
Disposition of REO property.
(a) Preference will be given to offers from bidders who are determined eligible by the Agency to purchase REO property designated to be sold as program property. It is the Agency's priority that property previously operated as program property prior to becoming REO inventory property be sold as program property. However, REO property may be sold under whatever Agency program is most appropriate for the property and the community needs regardless of the program under which the property was originally financed or whether the property was being used to secure loans under more than one Agency program.
(b) When the Agency determines that the REO property to be sold is not decent, safe, and sanitary and/or does not meet cost effective energy conservation standards, it will disclose the basis for this determination to prospective purchasers. The deed by which such an REO property is conveyed will contain a covenant restricting it from residential use until it is decent, safe, and sanitary, and meets the Agency's cost effective conservation standards. The Agency will also notify any potential purchaser of any known lead based paint hazards.
§ 3560.504
Sales price and bidding process.
(a) The loan documents related to REO property sold for program purposes must contain the restrictive-use language specified in § 3560.662(a).
(b) Entities bidding on REO property designated to be sold as program property must submit a loan application package that meets the requirements specified in subpart B of this part.
(1) Bidders on REO property designated to be sold as program property must meet the eligibility requirements established under § 3560.55.
(2) Bidders determined by the Agency to be ineligible to purchase REO property designated to be sold as program property will be notified in writing. The bidding process will continue regardless of pending appeals.
(3) All offers from bidders determined to be eligible to purchase REO property designated to be sold as program property will be considered in the bidding process and must provide evidence of financial stability and credit worthiness.
(c) The Agency will determine the successful bidder on REO property designated to be sold as program property by conducting a drawing of sealed bids.
