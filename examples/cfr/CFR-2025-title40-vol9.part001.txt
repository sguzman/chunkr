The test methods in this appendix are referred to in § 60.8 (Performance Tests) and § 60.11 (Compliance With Standards and Maintenance Requirements) of 40 CFR part 60, subpart A (General Provisions). Specific uses of these test methods are described in the standards of performance contained in the subparts, beginning with Subpart D.
Within each standard of performance, a section title “Test Methods and Procedures” is provided to: (1) Identify the test methods
to be used as reference methods to the facility subject to the respective standard and (2) identify any special instructions or conditions to be followed when applying a method to the respective facility. Such instructions (for example, establish sampling rates, volumes, or temperatures) are to be used either in addition to, or as a substitute for procedures in a test method. Similarly, for sources subject to emission monitoring requirements, specific instructions pertaining to any use of a test method as a reference method are provided in the subpart or in Appendix B.
Inclusion of methods in this appendix is not intended as an endorsement or denial of their applicability to sources that are not subject to standards of performance. The methods are potentially applicable to other sources; however, applicability should be confirmed by careful and appropriate evaluation of the conditions prevalent at such sources.
The approach followed in the formulation of the test methods involves specifications for equipment, procedures, and performance. In concept, a performance specification approach would be preferable in all methods because this allows the greatest flexibility to the user. In practice, however, this approach is impractical in most cases because performance specifications cannot be established. Most of the methods described herein, therefore, involve specific equipment specifications and procedures, and only a few methods in this appendix rely on performance criteria.
Minor changes in the test methods should not necessarily affect the validity of the results and it is recognized that alternative and equivalent methods exist. section 60.8 provides authority for the Administrator to specify or approve (1) equivalent methods, (2) alternative methods, and (3) minor changes in the methodology of the test methods. It should be clearly understood that unless otherwise identified all such methods and changes must have prior approval of the Administrator. An owner employing such methods or deviations from the test methods without obtaining prior approval does so at the risk of subsequent disapproval and retesting with approved methods.
Within the test methods, certain specific equipment or procedures are recognized as being acceptable or potentially acceptable and are specifically identified in the methods. The items identified as acceptable options may be used without approval but must be identified in the test report. The potentially approvable options are cited as “subject to the approval of the Administrator” or as “or equivalent.” Such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives may be used at the discretion of the owner without prior approval. However, detailed descriptions for applying these potentially approvable techniques or alternatives are not provided in the test methods. Also, the potentially approvable options are not necessarily acceptable in all applications. Therefore, an owner electing to use such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives is responsible for: (1) assuring that the techniques or alternatives are in fact applicable and are properly executed; (2) including a written description of the alternative method in the test report (the written method must be clear and must be capable of being performed without additional instruction, and the degree of detail should be similar to the detail contained in the test methods); and (3) providing any rationale or supporting data necessary to show the validity of the alternative in the particular application. Failure to meet these requirements can result in the Administrator's disapproval of the alternative.

S content of fuel gas streams at petroleum refineries.
1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 A sample is extracted from a source and passed through a series of midget impingers containing a cadmium sulfate (CdSO
4
) solution; H
2
S is absorbed, forming cadmium sulfide (CdS). The latter compound is then measured iodometrically.

# 3.0 Definitions
[Reserved]

# 4.0 Interferences
4.1 Any compound that reduces iodine (I
2
) or oxidizes the iodide ion will interfere in this procedure, provided it is collected in the CdSO
4
impingers. Sulfur dioxide in concentrations of up to 2,600 mg/m
3
is removed
with an impinger containing a hydrogen peroxide (H
2
O
2
) solution. Thiols precipitate with H
2
S. In the absence of H
2
S, only traces of thiols are collected. When methane-and ethane-thiols at a total level of 300 mg/m
3
are present in addition to H
2
S, the results vary from 2 percent low at an H
2
S concentration of 400 mg/m
3
to 14 percent high at an H
2
S concentration of 100 mg/m
3
. Carbonyl sulfide at a concentration of 20 percent does not interfere. Certain carbonyl-containing compounds react with iodine and produce recurring end points. However, acetaldehyde and acetone at concentrations of 1 and 3 percent, respectively, do not interfere.
4.2 Entrained H
2
O
2
produces a negative interference equivalent to 100 percent of that of an equimolar quantity of H
2
S. Avoid the ejection of H
2
O

into the CdSO
4
impingers.

# 5.0 Safety
5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.
5.2 Corrosive reagents. The following reagents are hazardous. Personal protective equipment and safe procedures are useful in preventing chemical splashes. If contact occurs, immediately flush with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. Remove clothing under shower and decontaminate. Treat residual chemical burns as thermal burns.
5.2.1 Hydrogen Peroxide. Irritating to eyes, skin, nose, and lungs. 30% H
2
O
2
is a strong oxidizing agent. Avoid contact with skin, eyes, and combustible material. Wear gloves when handling.
5.2.2 Hydrochloric Acid. Highly toxic. Vapors are highly irritating to eyes, skin, nose, and lungs, causing severe damage. May cause bronchitis, pneumonia, or edema of lungs. Exposure to concentrations of 0.13 to 0.2 percent can be lethal in minutes. Will react with metals, producing hydrogen.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
6.1 Sample Collection. The following items are needed for sample collection:
6.1.1 Sampling Line. Teflon tubing, 6- to 7- mm (
1/4
-in.) ID, to connect the sampling train to the sampling valve.
6.1.2 Impingers. Five midget impingers, each with 30-ml capacity. The internal diameter of the impinger tip must be 1 mm ±0.05 mm. The impinger tip must be positioned 4 to 6 mm from the bottom of the impinger.
6.1.3 Tubing. Glass or Teflon connecting tubing for the impingers.
6.1.4 Ice Water Bath. To maintain absorbing solution at a low temperature.
6.1.5 Drying Tube. Tube packed with 6- to 16- mesh indicating-type silica gel, or equivalent, to dry the gas sample and protect the meter and pump. If the silica gel has been used previously, dry at 175 °C (350 °F) for 2 hours. New silica gel may be used as received. Alternatively, other types of desiccants (equivalent or better) may be used, subject to approval of the Administrator.

# Note:
Do not use more than 30 g of silica gel. Silica gel adsorbs gases such as propane from the fuel gas stream, and use of excessive amounts of silica gel could result in errors in the determination of sample volume.
6.1.6 Sampling Valve. Needle valve, or equivalent, to adjust gas flow rate. Stainless steel or other corrosion-resistant material.
6.1.7 Volume Meter. Dry gas meter (DGM), sufficiently accurate to measure the sample volume within 2 percent, calibrated at the selected flow rate (about 1.0 liter/min) and conditions actually encountered during sampling. The meter shall be equipped with a temperature sensor (dial thermometer or equivalent) capable of measuring temperature to within 3 °C (5.4 °F). The gas meter should have a petcock, or equivalent, on the outlet connector which can be closed during the leak-check. Gas volume for one revolution of the meter must not be more than 10 liters.
6.1.8 Rate Meter. Rotameter, or equivalent, to measure flow rates in the range from 0.5 to 2 liters/min (1 to 4 ft
3
/hr).
6.1.9 Graduated Cylinder. 25-ml size.
6.1.10 Barometer. Mercury, aneroid, or other barometer capable of measuring atmospheric pressure to within 2.5 mm Hg (0.1 in. Hg). In many cases, the barometric reading may be obtained from a nearby National Weather Service station, in which case, the station value (which is the absolute barometric pressure) shall be requested and an adjustment for elevation differences between the weather station and the sampling point shall be applied at a rate of minus 2.5 mm Hg (0.1 in Hg) per 30 m (100 ft) elevation increase or vice-versa for elevation decrease.
6.1.11 U-tube Manometer. 0-; to 30-cm water column, for leak-check procedure.
6.1.12 Rubber Squeeze Bulb. To pressurize train for leak-check.
6.1.13 Tee, Pinchclamp, and Connecting Tubing. For leak-check.
6.1.14 Pump. Diaphragm pump, or equivalent. Insert a small surge tank between the pump and rate meter to minimize the pulsation effect of the diaphragm pump on the rate meter. The pump is used for the air purge at the end of the sample run; the pump is not ordinarily used during sampling, because fuel gas streams are usually sufficiently pressurized to force sample gas
through the train at the required flow rate. The pump need not be leak-free unless it is used for sampling.
6.1.15 Needle Valve or Critical Orifice. To set air purge flow to 1 liter/min.
6.1.16 Tube Packed with Active Carbon. To filter air during purge.
6.1.17 Volumetric Flask. One 1000-ml.
6.1.18 Volumetric Pipette. One 15-ml.
6.1.19 Pressure-Reduction Regulator. Depending on the sampling stream pressure, a pressure-reduction regulator may be needed to reduce the pressure of the gas stream entering the Teflon sample line to a safe level.
6.1.20 Cold Trap. If condensed water or amine is present in the sample stream, a corrosion-resistant cold trap shall be used immediately after the sample tap. The trap shall not be operated below 0 °C (32 °F) to avoid condensation of C
3
or C
4
hydrocarbons.
6.2 Sample Recovery. The following items are needed for sample recovery:
6.2.1 Sample Container. Iodine flask, glass-stoppered, 500-ml size.
6.2.2 Volumetric Pipette. One 50-ml.

Test starch indicator solution for decomposition by titrating with 0.01 N I
2
solution, 4 ml of starch solution in 200 ml of water that contains 1 g of KI. If more than 4 drops of the 0.01 N I
2
solution are required to obtain the blue color, a fresh solution must be prepared.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
8.1 Sampling Train Preparation. Assemble the sampling train as shown in Figure 11-1, connecting the five midget impingers in series. Place 15 ml of 3 percent H
2
O
2
solution in the first impinger. Leave the second impinger empty. Place 15 ml of the CdSO
4
solution in the third, fourth, and fifth impingers. Place the impinger assembly in an ice water bath container, and place water and crushed ice around the impingers. Add more ice during the run, if needed.
8.2 Leak-Check Procedure.
8.2.1 Connect the rubber bulb and manometer to the first impinger, as shown in Figure 11-1. Close the petcock on the DGM outlet. Pressurize the train to 25 cm water with the bulb, and close off the tubing connected to the rubber bulb. The train must hold 25 cm water pressure with not more than a 1 cm drop in pressure in a 1-minute interval. Stopcock grease is acceptable for sealing ground glass joints.
8.2.2 If the pump is used for sampling, it is recommended, but not required, that the pump be leak-checked separately, either prior to or after the sampling run. To leak-check the pump, proceed as follows: Disconnect the drying tube from the impinger assembly. Place a vacuum gauge at the inlet to either the drying tube or the pump, pull a vacuum of 250 mm Hg (10 in. Hg), plug or pinch off the outlet of the flow meter, and then turn off the pump. The vacuum should remain stable for at least 30 seconds. If performed prior to the sampling run, the pump leak-check should precede the leak-check of the sampling train described immediately above; if performed after the sampling run, the pump leak-check should follow the sampling train leak-check.
8.3 Purge the connecting line between the sampling valve and the first impinger by disconnecting the line from the first impinger, opening the sampling valve, and allowing process gas to flow through the line for one to two minutes. Then, close the sampling valve, and reconnect the line to the impinger train. Open the petcock on the dry gas meter outlet. Record the initial DGM reading.
8.4 Open the sampling valve, and then adjust the valve to obtain a rate of approximately 1 liter/min (0.035 cfm). Maintain a constant (±10 percent) flow rate during the test. Record the DGM temperature.
8.5 Sample for at least 10 minutes. At the end of the sampling time, close the sampling valve, and record the final volume and temperature readings. Conduct a leak-check as described in Section 8.2. A yellow color in the final cadmium sulfate impinger indicates depletion of the absorbing solution. An additional cadmium sulfate impinger should be added for subsequent samples and the sample with yellow color in the final impinger should be voided.
8.6 Disconnect the impinger train from the sampling line. Connect the charcoal tube and the pump as shown in Figure 11-1. Purge the train [at a rate of 1 liter/min (0.035 ft
3
/min)] with clean ambient air for 15 minutes to ensure that all H
2
S is removed from the H
2
O
2
. For sample recovery, cap the open ends, and remove the impinger train to a clean area that is away from sources of heat. The area should be well lighted, but not exposed to direct sunlight.
8.7 Sample Recovery.
8.7.1 Discard the contents of the H
2
O
2
impinger. Carefully rinse with water the contents of the third, fourth, and fifth impingers into a 500-ml iodine flask.

# Note:
The impingers normally have only a thin film of CdS remaining after a water rinse. If Antifoam B was not used or if significant quantities of yellow CdS remain in the impingers, the alternative recovery procedure in section 11.2 must be used.
8.7.2 Proceed to section 11 for the analysis.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization

# Note:
Maintain a log of all calibrations.
10.1 Calibration. Calibrate the sample collection equipment as follows.
10.1.1 Dry Gas Meter.
10.1.1.1 Initial Calibration. The DGM shall be calibrated before its initial use in the field. Proceed as follows: First, assemble the following components in series: Drying tube, needle valve, pump, rotameter, and DGM.
Then, leak-check the metering system as follows: Place a vacuum gauge (at least 760 mm Hg) at the inlet to the drying tube, and pull a vacuum of 250 mm Hg (10 in. Hg); plug or pinch off the outlet of the flow meter, and then turn off the pump. The vacuum shall remain stable for at least 30 seconds. Carefully release the vacuum gauge before releasing the flow meter end. Next, calibrate the DGM (at the sampling flow rate specified by the method) as follows: Connect an appropriately sized wet-test meter (
e.g.,
1 liter per revolution) to the inlet of the drying tube. Make three independent calibration runs, using at least five revolutions of the DGM per run. Calculate the calibration factor, Y (wet-test meter calibration volume divided by the DGM volume, both volumes adjusted to the same reference temperature and pressure), for each run, and average the results. If any Y value deviates by more than 2 percent from the average, the DGM is unacceptable for use. Otherwise, use the average as the calibration factor for subsequent test runs.
10.1.1.2 Post-Test Calibration Check. After each field test series, conduct a calibration check as in section 10.1.1.1, above, except for the following two variations: (a) three or more revolutions of the DGM may be used and (b) only two independent runs need be made. If the calibration factor does not deviate by more than 5 percent from the initial calibration factor (determined in section 10.1.1.1), then the DGM volumes obtained during the test series are acceptable. If the calibration factor deviates by more than 5 percent, recalibrate the DGM as in section 10.1.1.1, and for the calculations, use the calibration factor (initial or recalibration) that yields the lower gas volume for each test run.
10.1.2 Temperature Sensors. Calibrate against mercury-in-glass thermometers. An alternative mercury-free thermometer may be used if the thermometer is at a minimum equivalent in terms of performance or suitably effective for the specific temperature measurement application.
10.1.3 Rate Meter. The rate meter need not be calibrated, but should be cleaned and maintained according to the manufacturer's instructions.
10.1.4 Barometer. Calibrate against a mercury barometer.
10.2 Standardization.
10.2.1 Iodine Solution Standardization. Standardize the 0.01 N I

In a 500-ml iodine flask, dissolve approximately 3 g of KI in 45 ml of water, then add 10 ml of 3 M HCl solution. Pipette 50 ml of the dichromate solution into this mixture. Gently swirl the contents of the flask once, and allow it to stand in the dark for 5 minutes.

Conduct the titration analyses in a clean area away from direct sunlight.
11.1 Pipette exactly 50 ml of 0.01 N I
2
solution into a 125-ml Erlenmeyer flask. Add 10 ml of 3 M HCl to the solution. Quantitatively rinse the acidified I
2
into the iodine flask. Stopper the flask immediately, and shake briefly.
11.2 Use these alternative procedures if Antifoam B was not used or if significant quantities of yellow CdS remain in the impingers. Extract the remaining CdS from the third, fourth, and fifth impingers using the acidified I
2
solution. Immediately after pouring the acidified I
2
into an impinger, stopper it and shake for a few moments, then transfer the liquid to the iodine flask. Do not transfer any rinse portion from one impinger to another; transfer it directly to the iodine flask. Once the acidified I
2
solution has been poured into any glassware containing CdS, the container must be tightly stoppered at all times except when adding more solution, and this must be done as quickly and carefully as possible. After adding any acidified I
2
solution to the iodine flask, allow a few minutes for absorption of the H
2
S before adding any further rinses. Repeat the I
2
extraction until all CdS is removed from the impingers. Extract that part of the connecting glassware that contains visible CdS. Quantitatively rinse all the I
2
from the impingers, connectors, and the beaker into the iodine flask using water. Stopper the flask and shake briefly.
11.3 Allow the iodine flask to stand about 30 minutes in the dark for absorption of the H
2
S into the I
2
, then complete the titration analysis as outlined in sections 11.5 and 11.6.

# Note:
Iodine evaporates from acidified I
2
solutions. Samples to which acidified I
2
has been added may not be stored, but must be analyzed in the time schedule stated above.
11.4 Prepare a blank by adding 45 ml of CdSO
4
absorbing solution to an iodine flask. Pipette exactly 50 ml of 0.01 N I
2
solution into a 125-ml Erlenmeyer flask. Add 10 ml of 3 M HCl. Stopper the flask, shake briefly, let stand 30 minutes in the dark, and titrate with the samples.

# Note:
The blank must be handled by exactly the same procedure as that used for the samples.

# Method 12—Determination of Inorganic Lead Emissions From Stationary Sources

# Note:
This method does not include all of the specifications (
e.g.,
equipment and supplies) and procedures (
e.g.,
sampling and analytical) essential to its performance. Some material is incorporated by reference from other methods in this part. Therefore, to obtain reliable results, persons using this method should have a thorough knowledge of at least the following additional test methods: Method 1, Method 2, Method 3, and Method 5.

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1 Analytes.

see section 13.3.
1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of inorganic lead emissions from stationary sources, only as specified in an applicable subpart of the regulations.
1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 Particulate and gaseous Pb emissions are withdrawn isokinetically from the source and are collected on a filter and in dilute nitric acid. The collected samples are digested in acid solution and are analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry using an air/acetylene flame.

# 3.0 Definitions
[Reserved]

# 4.0 Interferences
4.1 Copper. High concentrations of copper may interfere with the analysis of Pb at 217.0 nm. This interference can be avoided by analyzing the samples at 283.3 nm.
4.2 Matrix Effects. Analysis for Pb by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry is sensitive to the chemical composition and to the physical properties (
e.g.,
viscosity, pH) of the sample. The analytical procedure requires the use of the Method of Standard Additions to check for these matrix effects, and requires sample analysis using the Method of Standard Additions if significant matrix effects are found to be present.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
8.1 Pretest Preparation. Follow the same general procedure given in Method 5, section 8.1, except that the filter need not be weighed.
8.2 Preliminary Determinations. Follow the same general procedure given in Method 5, section 8.2.
8.3 Preparation of Sampling Train. Follow the same general procedure given in Method 5, section 8.3, except place 100 ml of 0.1 N HNO
3
(instead of water) in each of the first two impingers. As in Method 5, leave the third impinger empty and transfer approximately 200 to 300 g of preweighed silica gel from its container to the fourth impinger. Set up the train as shown in Figure 12-1.
8.4 Leak-Check Procedures. Same as Method 5, section 8.4.
8.5 Sampling Train Operation. Same as Method 5, section 8.5.
8.6 Calculation of Percent Isokinetic. Same as Method 5, section 8.6.
8.7 Sample Recovery. Same as Method 5, sections 8.7.1 through 8.7.6.1, with the addition of the following:
8.7.1 Container No. 2 (Probe).
8.7.1.1 Taking care that dust on the outside of the probe or other exterior surfaces does not get into the sample, quantitatively recover sample matter and any condensate from the probe nozzle, probe fitting, probe liner, and front half of the filter holder by washing these components with 0.1 N HNO
3
and placing the wash into a glass sample storage container. Measure and record (to the nearest 2 ml) the total amount of 0.1 N HNO
3
used for these rinses. Perform the 0.1 N HNO
3
rinses as follows:
8.7.1.2 Carefully remove the probe nozzle, and rinse the inside surfaces with 0.1 N HNO
3
from a wash bottle while brushing with a stainless steel, Nylon-bristle brush. Brush until the 0.1 N HNO
3
rinse shows no visible particles, then make a final rinse of the inside surface with 0.1 N HNO
3
.
8.7.1.3 Brush and rinse with 0.1 N HNO
3
the inside parts of the Swagelok fitting in a similar way until no visible particles remain.
8.7.1.4 Rinse the probe liner with 0.1 N HNO
3
. While rotating the probe so that all inside surfaces will be rinsed with 0.1 N HNO
3
, tilt the probe, and squirt 0.1 N HNO
3
into its upper end. Let the 0.1 N HNO
3
drain from the lower end into the sample container. A glass funnel may be used to aid in transferring liquid washes to the container. Follow the rinse with a probe brush. Hold the probe in an inclined position, squirt 0.1 N HNO
3
into the upper end of the probe as the probe brush is being pushed with a twisting action through the probe; hold the sample container underneath the lower end of the probe, and catch any 0.1 N HNO
3
and sample matter that is brushed from the probe. Run the brush through the probe three times or more until no visible sample matter is carried out with the 0.1 N HNO
3
and none remains on the probe liner on visual inspection. With stainless steel or other metal probes, run the brush through in the above prescribed manner at least six times, since metal probes have small crevices in which sample matter can be entrapped. Rinse the brush with 0.1 N HNO
3
, and quantitatively collect these washings in the sample container. After the brushing, make a final rinse of the probe as described above.
8.7.1.5 It is recommended that two people clean the probe to minimize loss of sample. Between sampling runs, keep brushes clean and protected from contamination.
8.7.1.6 Brush and rinse with 0.1 N HNO
3
the inside of the front half of the filter holder. Brush and rinse each surface three times or more, if needed, to remove visible sample matter. Make a final rinse of the brush and filter holder. After all 0.1 N HNO
3
washings and sample matter are collected in the sample container, tighten the lid on the sample container so that the fluid will not leak out when it is shipped to the laboratory. Mark the height of the fluid level to determine whether leakage occurs during transport. Label the container to identify its contents clearly.
8.7.2 Container No. 3 (Silica Gel). Note the color of the indicating silica gel to determine if it has been completely spent, and make a notation of its condition. Transfer the silica gel from the fourth impinger to the original container, and seal. A funnel may be used to pour the silica gel from the impinger and a rubber policeman may be used to remove the silica gel from the impinger. It is not necessary to remove the small amount of particles that may adhere to the walls and are difficult to remove. Since the gain in weight is to be used for moisture calculations, do not use any water or other liquids to transfer the silica gel. If a balance is available in the field, follow the procedure for Container No. 3 in section 11.4.2.
8.7.3 Container No. 4 (Impingers). Due to the large quantity of liquid involved, the impinger solutions may be placed in several containers. Clean each of the first three impingers and connecting glassware in the following manner:
8.7.3.1 Cap the impinger ball joints.
8.7.3.2 Rotate and agitate each impinger, so that the impinger contents might serve as a rinse solution.
8.7.3.3 Treat the impingers as follows: Make a notation of any color or film in the liquid catch. Measure the liquid that is in the first three impingers by weighing it to within 0.5 g at a minimum by using a balance. Record the weight of liquid present. The liquid weight is needed, along with the silica gel data, to calculate the stack gas moisture content (see Method 5, Figure 5-6).
8.7.3.4 Transfer the contents to Container No. 4.

# Note:
In sections 8.7.3.5 and 8.7.3.6, measure and record the total amount of 0.1 N HNO
3
used for rinsing.
8.7.3.5 Pour approximately 30 ml of 0.1 N HNO
3
into each of the first three impingers and agitate the impingers. Drain the 0.1 N HNO
3
through the outlet arm of each impinger into Container No. 4. Repeat this operation a second time; inspect the impingers for any abnormal conditions.
8.7.3.6 Rinse the insides of each piece of connecting glassware for the impingers twice with 0.1 N HNO
3
; transfer this rinse into Container No. 4. Do not rinse or brush the glass-fritted filter support. Mark the height of the fluid level to determine whether leakage occurs during transport. Label the container to identify its contents clearly.
8.8 Blanks.
8.8.1 Nitric Acid. Save 200 ml of the 0.1 N HNO
3
used for sampling and cleanup as a blank. Take the solution directly from the bottle being used and place into a glass sample container labeled “0.1 N HNO
3
blank.”
8.8.2 Filter. Save two filters from each lot of filters used in sampling. Place these filters in a container labeled “filter blank.”

10.1 Sampling Equipment. Same as Method 5, section 10.0.
10.2 Spectrophotometer.
10.2.1 Measure the absorbance of the standard solutions using the instrument settings recommended by the spectrophotometer manufacturer. Repeat until good agreement (±3 percent) is obtained between two consecutive readings. Plot the absorbance (y-axis) versus concentration in µg Pb/ml (x-axis). Draw or compute a straight line through the linear portion of the curve. Do not force the calibration curve through zero, but if the curve does not pass through the origin or at least lie closer to the origin than ±0.003 absorbance units, check for incorrectly prepared standards and for curvature in the calibration curve.
10.2.2 To determine stability of the calibration curve, run a blank and a standard after every five samples, and recalibrate as necessary.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedures
11.1 Sample Loss Check. Prior to analysis, check the liquid level in Containers Number 2 and Number 4. Note on the analytical data sheet whether leakage occurred during transport. If a noticeable amount of leakage occurred, either void the sample or take steps, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to adjust the final results.
11.2 Sample Preparation.
11.2.1 Container No. 1 (Filter). Cut the filter into strips and transfer the strips and all loose particulate matter into a 125-ml Erlenmeyer flask. Rinse the petri dish with 10 ml of 50 percent HNO
3
to ensure a quantitative transfer, and add to the flask.

# Note:
If the total volume required in section 11.2.3 is expected to exceed 80 ml, use a 250-ml flask in place of the 125-ml flask.
11.2.2 Containers No. 2 and No. 4 (Probe and Impingers). Combine the contents of Containers No. 2 and No. 4, and evaporate to dryness on a hot plate.
11.2.3 Sample Extraction for Lead.
11.2.3.1 Based on the approximate stack gas particulate concentration and the total volume of stack gas sampled, estimate the total weight of particulate sample collected. Next, transfer the residue from Containers No. 2 and No. 4 to the 125-ml Erlenmeyer flask that contains the sampling filter using a rubber policeman and 10 ml of 50 percent HNO
3
for every 100 mg of sample collected in the train or a minimum of 30 ml of 50 percent HNO
3
, whichever is larger.
11.2.3.2 Place the Erlenmeyer flask on a hot plate, and heat with periodic stirring for 30 minutes at a temperature just below boiling. If the sample volume falls below 15 ml, add more 50 percent HNO
3
. Add 10 ml of 3 percent H
2
O
2
, and continue heating for 10 minutes. Add 50 ml of hot (80 °C, 176 °F) water, and heat for 20 minutes. Remove the flask from the hot plate, and allow to cool. Filter the sample through a Millipore membrane filter, or equivalent, and transfer the filtrate to a 250-ml volumetric flask. Dilute to volume with water.
11.2.4 Filter Blank. Cut each filter into strips, and place each filter in a separate 125-ml Erlenmeyer flask. Add 15 ml of 50 percent HNO
3
, and treat as described in section 11.2.3 using 10 ml of 3 percent H
2

and 50 ml of hot water. Dilute to a total volume of 100 ml using water.
11.3 Spectrophotometer Preparation. Turn on the power; set the wavelength, slit width, and lamp current; and adjust the background corrector as instructed by the manufacturer's manual for the particular atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Adjust the burner and flame characteristics as necessary.
11.4 Analysis.
11.4.1 Lead Determination. Calibrate the spectrophotometer as outlined in section 10.2, and determine the absorbance for each source sample, the filter blank, and 0.1 N HNO
3
blank. Analyze each sample three times in this manner. Make appropriate dilutions, as needed, to bring all sample Pb concentrations into the linear absorbance range of the spectrophotometer. Because instruments vary between manufacturers, no detailed operating instructions will be given here. Instead, the instructions provided with the particular instrument should be followed. If the Pb concentration of a sample is at the low end of the calibration curve and high accuracy is required, the sample can be taken to dryness on a hot plate and the residue dissolved in the appropriate volume of water to bring it into the optimum range of the calibration curve.
11.4.2 Container No. 3 (Silica Gel). This step may be conducted in the field. Weigh the spent silica gel (or silica gel plus impinger) to the nearest 0.5 g; record this weight.
11.5 Check for Matrix Effects. Use the Method of Standard Additions as follows to check at least one sample from each source for matrix effects on the Pb results:
11.5.1 Add or spike an equal volume of standard solution to an aliquot of the sample solution.
11.5.2 Measure the absorbance of the resulting solution and the absorbance of an aliquot of unspiked sample.
11.5.3 Calculate the Pb concentration C
m
in µg/ml of the sample solution using Equation 12-1 in section 12.5.
Volume corrections will not be required if the solutions as analyzed have been made to the same final volume. Therefore, C
m
and C
a
represent Pb concentration before dilutions.
Method of Standard Additions procedures described on pages 9-4 and 9-5 of the section entitled “General Information” of the Perkin Elmer Corporation Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry Manual, Number 303-0152 (Reference 1 in section 17.0) may also be used. In any event, if the results of the Method of Standard Additions procedure used on the single source sample do not agree to within ±5 percent of the value obtained by the routine atomic absorption analysis, then reanalyze all samples from the source using the Method of Standard Additions procedure.

1/2
in.) ID glass tube extending to 1.3 cm (
1/2
in.) from the bottom of the flask. For the second impinger, use a Greenburg-Smith impinger with the standard tip. Modifications (
e.g.,
flexible connections between the impingers or materials other than glass) may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. Place a temperature sensor, capable of measuring temperature to within 1 °C (2 °F), at the outlet of the fourth impinger for monitoring purposes.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards
Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents are to conform to the specifications established by the Committee on Analytical Reagents of the American Chemical Society, where such specifications are available. Otherwise, use the best available grade.
7.1 Sample Collection. The following reagents are needed for sample collection:
7.1.1 Filters.
7.1.1.1 If the filter is located between the third and fourth impingers, use a Whatman No. 1 filter, or equivalent, sized to fit the filter holder.
7.1.1.2 If the filter is located between the probe and first impinger, use any suitable medium (
e.g.,

of filter area). Before the test series, determine the average F
−
blank value of at least three filters (from the lot to be used for sampling) using the applicable procedures described in sections 8.3 and 8.4 of this method. In general, glass fiber filters have high and/or variable F

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
8.1 Pretest Preparation. Follow the general procedure given in Method 5, section 8.1, except that the filter need not be weighed.
8.2 Preliminary Determinations. Follow the general procedure given in Method 5, section 8.2, except that the nozzle size must be selected such that isokinetic sampling rates below 28 liters/min (1.0 cfm) can be maintained.
8.3 Preparation of Sampling Train. Follow the general procedure given in Method 5, section 8.3, except for the following variation: Assemble the train as shown in Figure 13A-1 with the filter between the third and fourth impingers. Alternatively, if a 20-mesh stainless steel screen is used for the filter support, the filter may be placed between the probe and first impinger. A filter heating system to prevent moisture condensation may be used, but shall not allow the temperature to exceed 120 ±14 °C (248 ±25 °F). Record the filter location on the data sheet (see section 8.5).
8.4 Leak-Check Procedures. Follow the leak-check procedures given in Method 5, section 8.4.
8.5 Sampling Train Operation. Follow the general procedure given in Method 5, section 8.5, keeping the filter and probe temperatures (if applicable) at 120 ±14 °C (248 ±25 °F) and isokinetic sampling rates below 28 liters/min (1.0 cfm). For each run, record the data required on a data sheet such as the one shown in Method 5, Figure 5-3.
8.6 Sample Recovery. Proper cleanup procedure begins as soon as the probe is removed from the stack at the end of the sampling period. Allow the probe to cool.
8.6.1 When the probe can be safely handled, wipe off all external particulate matter near the tip of the probe nozzle, and place a cap over it to keep from losing part of the sample. Do not cap off the probe tip tightly while the sampling train is cooling down as this would create a vacuum in the filter holder, thus drawing water from the impingers into the filter holder.
8.6.2 Before moving the sample train to the cleanup site, remove the probe from the sample train, wipe off any silicone grease, and cap the open outlet of the probe. Be careful not to lose any condensate that might be present. Remove the filter assembly, wipe off any silicone grease from the filter holder inlet, and cap this inlet. Remove the umbilical cord from the last impinger, and cap the impinger. After wiping off any silicone grease, cap off the filter holder outlet and any open impinger inlets and outlets. Ground-glass stoppers, plastic caps, or serum caps may be used to close these openings.
8.6.3 Transfer the probe and filter-impinger assembly to the cleanup area. This area should be clean and protected from the wind so that the chances of contaminating or losing the sample will be minimized.
8.6.4 Inspect the train prior to and during disassembly, and note any abnormal conditions. Treat the samples as follows:
8.6.4.1 Container No. 1 (Probe, Filter, and Impinger Catches).
8.6.4.1.1 Using a graduated cylinder, measure to the nearest ml, and record the volume of the water in the first three impingers; include any condensate in the probe in this determination. Transfer the impinger water from the graduated cylinder into a polyethylene container. Add the filter to this container. (The filter may be handled separately using procedures subject to the Administrator's approval.) Taking care that dust on the outside of the probe or other exterior surfaces does not get into the sample, clean all sample-exposed surfaces (including the probe nozzle, probe fitting, probe liner, first three impingers, impinger connectors, and filter holder) with water. Use less than 500 ml for the entire wash. Add the washings to the sample container. Perform the water rinses as follows:
8.6.4.1.2 Carefully remove the probe nozzle and rinse the inside surface with water from a wash bottle. Brush with a Nylon bristle brush, and rinse until the rinse shows no visible particles, after which make a final rinse of the inside surface. Brush and rinse the inside parts of the Swagelok fitting with water in a similar way.
8.6.4.1.3 Rinse the probe liner with water. While squirting the water into the upper end of the probe, tilt and rotate the probe so that all inside surfaces will be wetted with water. Let the water drain from the lower end into the sample container. A funnel (glass or polyethylene) may be used to aid in transferring the liquid washes to the container. Follow the rinse with a probe brush. Hold the probe in an inclined position, and squirt water into
the upper end as the probe brush is being pushed with a twisting action through the probe. Hold the sample container underneath the lower end of the probe, and catch any water and particulate matter that is brushed from the probe. Run the brush through the probe three times or more. With stainless steel or other metal probes, run the brush through in the above prescribed manner at least six times since metal probes have small crevices in which particulate matter can be entrapped. Rinse the brush with water, and quantitatively collect these washings in the sample container. After the brushing, make a final rinse of the probe as described above.
8.6.4.1.4 It is recommended that two people clean the probe to minimize sample losses. Between sampling runs, keep brushes clean and protected from contamination.
8.6.4.1.5 Rinse the inside surface of each of the first three impingers (and connecting glassware) three separate times. Use a small portion of water for each rinse, and brush each sample-exposed surface with a Nylon bristle brush, to ensure recovery of fine particulate matter. Make a final rinse of each surface and of the brush.
8.6.4.1.6 After ensuring that all joints have been wiped clean of the silicone grease, brush and rinse with water the inside of the filter holder (front-half only, if filter is positioned between the third and fourth impingers). Brush and rinse each surface three times or more if needed. Make a final rinse of the brush and filter holder.
8.6.4.1.7 After all water washings and particulate matter have been collected in the sample container, tighten the lid so that water will not leak out when it is shipped to the laboratory. Mark the height of the fluid level to transport. Label the container clearly to identify its contents.
8.6.4.2 Container No. 2 (Sample Blank). Prepare a blank by placing an unused filter in a polyethylene container and adding a volume of water equal to the total volume in Container No. 1. Process the blank in the same manner as for Container No. 1.
8.6.4.3 Container No. 3 (Silica Gel). Note the color of the indicating silica gel to determine whether it has been completely spent, and make a notation of its condition. Transfer the silica gel from the fourth impinger to its original container, and seal. A funnel may be used to pour the silica gel and a rubber policeman to remove the silica gel from the impinger. It is not necessary to remove the small amount of dust particles that may adhere to the impinger wall and are difficult to remove. Since the gain in weight is to be used for moisture calculations, do not use any water or other liquids to transfer the silica gel. If a balance is available in the field, follow the analytical procedure for Container No. 3 in section 11.4.2.

# Note:
Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.
10.1 Sampling Equipment. Calibrate the probe nozzle, pitot tube, metering system, probe heater, temperature sensors, and barometer according to the procedures outlined in Method 5, sections 10.1 through 10.6. Conduct the leak-check of the metering system according to the procedures outlined in Method 5, section 8.4.1.
10.2 Spectrophotometer.
10.2.1 Prepare the blank standard by adding 10 ml of SPADNS mixed reagent to 50 ml of water.
10.2.2 Accurately prepare a series of standards from the 0.01 mg F
−
/ml standard fluoride solution (Section 7.3.10) by diluting 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 ml to 100 ml with deionized, distilled water. Pipet 50 ml from each solution, and transfer each to a separate 100-ml beaker. Then add 10 ml of SPADNS mixed reagent (Section 7.3.13) to each. These standards will contain 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 µg F
−
(0 to 1.4 µg/ml), respectively.
10.2.3 After mixing, place the blank and calibration standards in a constant temperature bath for 30 minutes before reading the absorbance with the spectrophotometer. Adjust all samples to this same temperature before analyzing.
10.2.4 With the spectrophotometer at 570 nm, use the blank standard to set the absorbance to zero. Determine the absorbance of the standards.
10.2.5 Prepare a calibration curve by plotting µg F
−
/50 ml versus absorbance on linear graph paper. Prepare the standard curve initially and thereafter whenever the SPADNS mixed reagent is newly made. Also, run a
calibration standard with each set of samples and, if it differs from the calibration curve by more than ±2 percent, prepare a new standard curve.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedures
11.1 Sample Loss Check. Note the liquid levels in Containers No. 1 and No. 2, determine whether leakage occurred during transport, and note this finding on the analytical data sheet. If noticeable leakage has occurred, either void the sample or use methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to correct the final results.
11.2 Sample Preparation. Treat the contents of each sample container as described below:
11.2.1 Container No. 1 (Probe, Filter, and Impinger Catches). Filter this container's contents, including the sampling filter, through Whatman No. 541 filter paper, or equivalent, into a 1500-ml beaker.
11.2.1.1 If the filtrate volume exceeds 900 ml, make the filtrate basic (red to phenolphthalein) with NaOH, and evaporate to less than 900 ml.
11.2.1.2 Place the filtered material (including sampling filter) in a nickel crucible, add a few ml of water, and macerate the filters with a glass rod.
11.2.1.2.1 Add 100 mg CaO to the crucible, and mix the contents thoroughly to form a slurry. Add two drops of phenolphthalein indicator. Place the crucible in a hood under infrared lamps or on a hot plate at low heat. Evaporate the water completely. During the evaporation of the water, keep the slurry basic (red to phenolphthalein) to avoid loss of F
−
. If the indicator turns colorless (acidic) during the evaporation, add CaO until the color turns red again.
11.2.1.2.2 After evaporation of the water, place the crucible on a hot plate under a hood, and slowly increase the temperature until the Whatman No. 541 and sampling filters char. It may take several hours to char the filters completely.
11.2.1.2.3 Place the crucible in a cold muffle furnace. Gradually (to prevent smoking) increase the temperature to 600 °C (1100 °F), and maintain this temperature until the contents are reduced to an ash. Remove the crucible from the furnace, and allow to cool.
11.2.1.2.4 Add approximately 4 g of crushed NaOH to the crucible, and mix. Return the crucible to the muffle furnace, and fuse the sample for 10 minutes at 600 °C.
11.2.1.2.5 Remove the sample from the furnace, and cool to ambient temperature. Using several rinsings of warm water, transfer the contents of the crucible to the beaker containing the filtrate. To ensure complete sample removal, rinse finally with two 20-ml portions of 25 percent H
2
SO
4
, and carefully add to the beaker. Mix well, and transfer to a 1-liter volumetric flask. Dilute to volume with water, and mix thoroughly. Allow any undissolved solids to settle.
11.2.2 Container No. 2 (Sample Blank). Treat in the same manner as described in section 11.2.1 above.
11.2.3 Adjustment of Acid/Water Ratio in Distillation Flask. Place 400 ml of water in the distillation flask, and add 200 ml of concentrated H
2
SO
4
. Add some soft glass beads and several small pieces of broken glass tubing, and assemble the apparatus as shown in Figure 13A-2. Heat the flask until it reaches a temperature of 175 °C (347 °F) to adjust the acid/water ratio for subsequent distillations. Discard the distillate.
Caution:
Use a protective shield when carrying out this procedure. Observe standard precautions when mixing H
2
SO
4
with water. Slowly add the acid to the flask with constant swirling.
11.3 Distillation.
11.3.1 Cool the contents of the distillation flask to below 80 °C (180 °F). Pipet an aliquot of sample containing less than 10.0 mg F
−
directly into the distillation flask, and add water to make a total volume of 220 ml added to the distillation flask. (To estimate the appropriate aliquot size, select an aliquot of the solution, and treat as described in section 11.4.1. This will be an approximation of the F
−
content because of possible interfering ions.)

# Note:
If the sample contains chloride, add 5 mg of Ag
2
SO
4
to the flask for every mg of chloride.
11.3.2 Place a 250-ml volumetric flask at the condenser exit. Heat the flask as rapidly as possible with a Bunsen burner, and collect all the distillate up to 175 °C (347 °F). During heatup, play the burner flame up and down the side of the flask to prevent bumping. Conduct the distillation as rapidly as possible (15 minutes or less). Slow distillations have been found to produce low F
−
recoveries. Be careful not to exceed 175 °C (347 °F) to avoid causing H
2
SO
4
to distill over. If F
−
distillation in the mg range is to be followed by a distillation in the fractional mg range, add 220 ml of water and distill it over as in the acid adjustment step to remove residual F
−
from the distillation system.
11.3.3 The acid in the distillation flask may be used until there is carry-over of interferences or poor F
−
recovery. Check for interference and for recovery efficiency every tenth distillation using a water blank and a standard solution. Change the acid whenever the F
−
recovery is less than 90 percent or the blank value exceeds 0.1 µg/ml.
11.4 Sample Analysis.
11.4.1 Containers No. 1 and No. 2.
11.4.1.1 After distilling suitable aliquots from Containers No. 1 and No. 2 according to section 11.3, dilute the distillate in the volumetric flasks to exactly 250 ml with water, and mix thoroughly. Pipet a suitable aliquot
of each sample distillate (containing 10 to 40 µg F
−
/ml) into a beaker, and dilute to 50 ml with water. Use the same aliquot size for the blank. Add 10 ml of SPADNS mixed reagent (Section 7.3.13), and mix thoroughly.
11.4.1.2 After mixing, place the sample in a constant-temperature bath containing the standard solutions for 30 minutes before reading the absorbance on the spectrophotometer.

# Note:
After the sample and colorimetric reagent are mixed, the color formed is stable for approximately 2 hours. Also, a 3 °C (5.4 °F) temperature difference between the sample and standard solutions produces an error of approximately 0.005 mg F
−
/liter. To avoid this error, the absorbencies of the sample and standard solutions must be measured at the same temperature.
11.4.1.3 Set the spectrophotometer to zero absorbance at 570 nm with the zero reference solution (Section 7.3.12), and check the spectrophotometer calibration with the standard solution (Section 7.3.10). Determine the absorbance of the samples, and determine the concentration from the calibration curve. If the concentration does not fall within the range of the calibration curve, repeat the procedure using a different size aliquot.
11.4.2 Container No. 3 (Silica Gel). Weigh the spent silica gel (or silica gel plus impinger) to the nearest 0.5 g using a balance. This step may be conducted in the field.

Pipet a 25-ml aliquot from each of the distillate into separate beakers. Add an equal volume of TISAB, and mix. The sample should be at the same temperature as the calibration standards when measurements are made. If ambient laboratory temperature fluctuates more than ±2 °C from the temperature at which the calibration standards were measured, condition samples and standards in a constant-temperature bath before measurement. Stir the sample with a magnetic stirrer during measurement to minimize electrode response time. If the stirrer generates enough heat to change solution temperature, place a piece of temperature insulating material, such as cork, between the stirrer and the beaker. Hold dilute samples (below 10

Same as section 4.0 of either Method 13A or Method 13B, with the addition of the following:
4.1 Magnetic Field Effects. Anemometer readings can be affected by potroom magnetic field effects. section 6.1 provides for minimization of this interference through proper shielding or encasement of anemometer components.

5.2 Corrosive Reagents. Same as section 5.2 of either Method 13A or Method 13B.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
Same as section 6.0 of either Method 13A or Method 13B, as applicable, with the addition of the following:
6.1 Velocity Measurement Apparatus.
6.1.1 Anemometer Specifications. Propeller anemometers, or equivalent. Each anemometer shall meet the following specifications:
6.1.1.1 Its propeller shall be made of polystyrene, or similar material of uniform density. To ensure uniformity of performance among propellers, it is desirable that all propellers be made from the same mold.
6.1.1.2 The propeller shall be properly balanced, to optimize performance.
6.1.1.3 When the anemometer is mounted horizontally, its threshold velocity shall not exceed 15 m/min (50 ft/min).
6.1.1.4 The measurement range of the anemometer shall extend to at least 600 m/min (2,000 ft/min).
6.1.1.5 The anemometer shall be able to withstand prolonged exposure to dusty and corrosive environments; one way of achieving this is to purge the bearings of the anemometer continuously with filtered air during operation.
6.1.1.6 All anemometer components shall be properly shielded or encased, such that the performance of the anemometer is uninfluenced by potroom magnetic field effects.
6.1.1.7 A known relationship shall exist between the electrical output signal from the anemometer generator and the propeller shaft rpm (see section 10.2.1). Anemometers having other types of output signals (
e.g.,
optical) may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. If other types of anemometers are used, there must be a known relationship between output signal and shaft rpm (see section 10.2.2).
6.1.1.8 Each anemometer shall be equipped with a suitable readout system (see section 6.1.3).
6.1.2 Anemometer Installation Requirements.
6.1.2.1 Single, Isolated Potroom. If the affected facility consists of a single, isolated potroom (or potroom segment), install at least one anemometer for every 85 m (280 ft) of roof monitor length. If the length of the roof monitor divided by 85 m (280 ft) is not a whole number, round the fraction to the nearest whole number to determine the number of anemometers needed. For monitors that are less than 130 m (430 ft) in length, use at least two anemometers. Divide the monitor cross-section into as many equal areas as anemometers, and locate an anemometer at the centroid of each equal area. See exception in section 6.1.2.3.
6.1.2.2 Two or More Potrooms. If the affected facility consists of two or more potrooms (or potroom segments) ducted to a common control device, install anemometers in each potroom (or segment) that contains a sampling manifold. Install at least one anemometer for every 85 m (280 ft) of roof monitor length of the potroom (or segment). If the potroom (or segment) length divided by 85 m (280 ft) is not a whole number, round the fraction to the nearest whole number to determine the number of anemometers needed. If the potroom (or segment) length is less than 130 m (430 ft), use at least two anemometers. Divide the potroom (or segment) monitor cross-section into as many equal areas as anemometers, and locate an anemometer at the centroid of each equal area. See exception in section 6.1.2.3.
6.1.2.3 Placement of Anemometer at the Center of Manifold. At least one anemometer shall be installed in the immediate vicinity (
i.e.,
within 10 m (33 ft)) of the center of the manifold (see section 6.2.1). For its placement in relation to the width of the monitor, there are two alternatives. The first is to make a velocity traverse of the width of the roof monitor where an anemometer is to be placed and install the anemometer at a point of average velocity along this traverse. The traverse may be made with any suitable low velocity measuring device, and shall be made during normal process operating conditions. The second alternative is to install the anemometer half-way across the width of the roof monitor. In this latter case, the velocity traverse need not be conducted.
6.1.3 Recorders. Recorders that are equipped with suitable auxiliary equipment (
e.g.,
transducers) for converting the output signal from each anemometer to a continuous recording of air flow velocity or to an integrated measure of volumetric flowrate shall be used. A suitable recorder is one that allows the output signal from the propeller anemometer to be read to within 1 percent when the velocity is between 100 and 120 m/min (330 and 390 ft/min). For the purpose of recording velocity, “continuous” shall mean one readout per 15-minute or shorter time interval. A constant amount of time shall elapse between readings. Volumetric flow rate may be determined by an electrical count of anemometer revolutions. The recorders or counters shall permit identification of the velocities or flowrates measured by each individual anemometer.
6.1.4 Pitot Tube. Standard-type pitot tube, as described in section 6.7 of Method 2, and having a coefficient of 0.99 ±0.01.
6.1.5 Pitot Tube (Optional). Isolated, Type S pitot, as described in section 6.1 of Method 2, and having a known coefficient, determined as outlined in section 4.1 of Method 2.
6.1.6 Differential Pressure Gauge. Inclined manometer, or equivalent, as described in section 6.1.2 of Method 2.
6.2 Roof Monitor Air Sampling System.
6.2.1 Manifold System and Ductwork. A minimum of one manifold system shall be installed for each potroom group. The manifold
system and ductwork shall meet the following specifications:
6.2.1.1 The manifold system and connecting duct shall be permanently installed to draw an air sample from the roof monitor to ground level. A typical installation of a duct for drawing a sample from a roof monitor to ground level is shown in Figure 14-1 in section 17.0. A plan of a manifold system that is located in a roof monitor is shown in Figure 14-2. These drawings represent a typical installation for a generalized roof monitor. The dimensions on these figures may be altered slightly to make the manifold system fit into a particular roof monitor, but the general configuration shall be followed.
6.2.1.2 There shall be eight nozzles, each having a diameter of 0.40 to 0.50 m.
6.2.1.3 The length of the manifold system from the first nozzle to the eighth shall be 35 m (115 ft) or eight percent of the length of the potroom (or potroom segment) roof monitor, whichever is greater. Deviation from this requirement is subject to the approval of the Administrator.
6.2.1.4 The duct leading from the roof monitor manifold system shall be round with a diameter of 0.30 to 0.40 m (1.0 to 1.3 ft). All connections in the ductwork shall be leak-free.
6.2.1.5 As shown in Figure 14-2, each of the sample legs of the manifold shall have a device, such as a blast gate or valve, to enable adjustment of the flow into each sample nozzle.
6.2.1.6 The manifold system shall be located in the immediate vicinity of one of the propeller anemometers (see section 8.1.1.4) and as close as possible to the midsection of the potroom (or potroom segment). Avoid locating the manifold system near the end of a potroom or in a section where the aluminum reduction pot arrangement is not typical of the rest of the potroom (or potroom segment). The sample nozzles shall be centered in the throat of the roof monitor (see Figure 14-1).
6.2.1.7 All sample-exposed surfaces within the nozzles, manifold, and sample duct shall be constructed with 316 stainless steel. Alternatively, aluminum may be used if a new ductwork is conditioned with fluoride-laden roof monitor air for a period of six weeks before initial testing. Other materials of construction may be used if it is demonstrated through comparative testing, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that there is no loss of fluorides in the system.
6.2.1.8 Two sample ports shall be located in a vertical section of the duct between the roof monitor and the exhaust fan (see section 6.2.2). The sample ports shall be at least 10 duct diameters downstream and three diameters upstream from any flow disturbance such as a bend or contraction. The two sample ports shall be situated 90° apart. One of the sample ports shall be situated so that the duct can be traversed in the plane of the nearest upstream duct bend.
6.2.2 Exhaust Fan. An industrial fan or blower shall be attached to the sample duct at ground level (see Figure 14-1). This exhaust fan shall have a capacity such that a large enough volume of air can be pulled through the ductwork to maintain an isokinetic sampling rate in all the sample nozzles for all flow rates normally encountered in the roof monitor. The exhaust fan volumetric flow rate shall be adjustable so that the roof monitor gases can be drawn isokinetically into the sample nozzles. This control of flow may be achieved by a damper on the inlet to the exhauster or by any other workable method.
6.3 Temperature Measurement Apparatus. To monitor and record the temperature of the roof monitor effluent gas, and consisting of the following:
6.3.1 Temperature Sensor. A temperature sensor shall be installed in the roof monitor near the sample duct. The temperature sensor shall conform to the specifications outlined in Method 2, section 6.3.
6.3.2 Signal Transducer. Transducer, to change the temperature sensor voltage output to a temperature readout.
6.3.3 Thermocouple Wire. To reach from roof monitor to signal transducer and recorder.
6.3.4 Recorder. Suitable recorder to monitor the output from the thermocouple signal transducer.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards
Same as section 7.0 of either Method 13A or Method 13B, as applicable.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
8.1 Roof Monitor Velocity Determination.
8.1.1 Velocity Estimate(s) for Setting Isokinetic Flow. To assist in setting isokinetic flow in the manifold sample nozzles, the anticipated average velocity in the section of the roof monitor containing the sampling manifold shall be estimated before each test run. Any convenient means to make this estimate may be used (
e.g.,
the velocity indicated by the anemometer in the section of the roof monitor containing the sampling manifold may be continuously monitored during the 24-hour period before the test run). If there is question as to whether a single estimate of average velocity is adequate for an entire test run (
e.g.,
if velocities are anticipated to be significantly different during different potroom operations), the test run may be divided into two or more “sub-runs,” and a different estimated average velocity may be used for each sub-run (see section 8.4.2).
8.1.2 Velocity Determination During a Test Run. During the actual test run, record the
velocity or volumetric flowrate readings of each propeller anemometer in the roof monitor. Readings shall be taken from each anemometer at equal time intervals of 15 minutes or less (or continuously).
8.2 Temperature Recording. Record the temperature of the roof monitor effluent gases at least once every 2 hours during the test run.
8.3 Pretest Ductwork Conditioning. During the 24-hour period immediately preceding the test run, turn on the exhaust fan, and draw roof monitor air through the manifold system and ductwork. Adjust the fan to draw a volumetric flow through the duct such that the velocity of gas entering the manifold nozzles approximates the average velocity of the air exiting the roof monitor in the vicinity of the sampling manifold.
8.4 Manifold Isokinetic Sample Rate Adjustment(s).
8.4.1 Initial Adjustment. Before the test run (or first sub-run, if applicable; see sections 8.1.1 and 8.4.2), adjust the fan such that air enters the manifold sample nozzles at a velocity equal to the appropriate estimated average velocity determined under section 8.1.1. Use Equation 14-1 (Section 12.2.2) to determine the correct stream velocity needed in the duct at the sampling location, in order for sample gas to be drawn isokinetically into the manifold nozzles. Next, verify that the correct stream velocity has been achieved, by performing a pitot tube traverse of the sample duct (using either a standard or Type S pitot tube); use the procedure outlined in Method 2.
8.4.2 Adjustments During Run. If the test run is divided into two or more “sub-runs” (see section 8.1.1), additional isokinetic rate adjustment(s) may become necessary during the run. Any such adjustment shall be made just before the start of a sub-run, using the procedure outlined in section 8.4.1 above.

# Note:
Isokinetic rate adjustments are not permissible during a sub-run.
8.5 Pretest Preparation, Preliminary Determinations, Preparation of Sampling Train, Leak-Check Procedures, Sampling Train Operation, and Sample Recovery. Same as Method 13A, sections 8.1 through 8.6, with the exception of the following:
8.5.1 A single train shall be used for the entire sampling run. Alternatively, if two or more sub-runs are performed, a separate train may be used for each sub-run; note, however, that if this option is chosen, the area of the sampling nozzle shall be the same (±2 percent) for each train. If the test run is divided into sub-runs, a complete traverse of the duct shall be performed during each sub-run.
8.5.2 Time Per Run. Each test run shall last 8 hours or more; if more than one run is to be performed, all runs shall be of approximately the same (±10 percent) length. If questions exist as to the representativeness of an 8-hour test, a longer period should be selected. Conduct each run during a period when all normal operations are performed underneath the sampling manifold. For most recently-constructed plants, 24 hours are required for all potroom operations and events to occur in the area beneath the sampling manifold. During the test period, all pots in the potroom group shall be operated such that emissions are representative of normal operating conditions in the potroom group.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization
Same as section 10.0 of either Method 13A or Method 13B, as applicable, with the addition of the following:
10.1 Manifold Intake Nozzles. The manifold intake nozzles shall be calibrated when the manifold system is installed or, alternatively, the manifold may be preassembled and the nozzles calibrated on the ground prior to installation. The following procedures shall be observed:
10.1.1 Adjust the exhaust fan to draw a volumetric flow rate (refer to Equation 14-1) such that the entrance velocity into each manifold nozzle approximates the average effluent velocity in the roof monitor.
10.1.2 Measure the velocity of the air entering each nozzle by inserting a standard pitot tube into a 2.5 cm or less diameter hole (see Figure 14-2) located in the manifold between each blast gate (or valve) and nozzle. Note that a standard pitot tube is used, rather
than a type S, to eliminate possible velocity measurement errors due to cross-section blockage in the small (0.13 m diameter) manifold leg ducts. The pitot tube tip shall be positioned at the center of each manifold leg duct. Take care to ensure that there is no leakage around the pitot tube, which could affect the indicated velocity in the manifold leg.
10.1.3 If the velocity of air being drawn into each nozzle is not the same, open or close each blast gate (or valve) until the velocity in each nozzle is the same. Fasten each blast gate (or valve) so that it will remain in position, and close the pitot port holes.
10.2 Initial Calibration of Propeller Anemometers.
10.2.1 Anemometers that meet the specifications outlined in section 6.1.1 need not be calibrated, provided that a reference performance curve relating anemometer signal output to air velocity (covering the velocity range of interest) is available from the manufacturer. If a reference performance curve is not available from the manufacturer, such a curve shall be generated.
For the purpose of this method, a “reference” performance curve is defined as one that has been derived from primary standard calibration data, with the anemometer mounted vertically. “Primary standard” data are obtainable by: (a) direct calibration of one or more of the anemometers by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST); (b) NIST-traceable calibration; or (c) Calibration by direct measurement of fundamental parameters such as length and time (
e.g.,
by moving the anemometers through still air at measured rates of speed, and recording the output signals).
10.2.2 Anemometers having output signals other than electrical (
e.g.,
optical) may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. If other types of anemometers are used, a reference performance curve shall be generated, using procedures subject to the approval of the Administrator.
10.2.3 The reference performance curve shall be derived from at least the following three points: 60 ±15, 900 ±100, and 1800 ±100 rpm.
10.3 Initial Performance Checks. Conduct these checks within 60 days before the first performance test.
10.3.1 Anemometers. A performance-check shall be conducted as outlined in sections 10.3.1.1 through 10.3.1.3. Alternatively, any other suitable method that takes into account the signal output, propeller condition, and threshold velocity of the anemometer may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.
10.3.1.1 Check the signal output of the anemometer by using an accurate rpm generator (see Figure 14-3) or synchronous motors to spin the propeller shaft at each of the three rpm settings described in section 10.2.3, and measuring the output signal at each setting. If, at each setting, the output signal is within 5 percent of the manufacturer's value, the anemometer can be used. If the anemometer performance is unsatisfactory, the anemometer shall either be replaced or repaired.
10.3.1.2 Check the propeller condition, by visually inspecting the propeller, making note of any significant damage or warpage; damaged or deformed propellers shall be replaced.
10.3.1.3 Check the anemometer threshold velocity as follows: With the anemometer mounted as shown in Figure 14-4(A), fasten a known weight (a straight-pin will suffice) to the anemometer propeller at a fixed distance from the center of the propeller shaft. This will generate a known torque; for example, a 0.1-g weight, placed 10 cm from the center of the shaft, will generate a torque of 1.0 g-cm. If the known torque causes the propeller to rotate downward, approximately 90° [see Figure 14-4(B)], then the known torque is greater than or equal to the starting torque; if the propeller fails to rotate approximately 90°, the known torque is less than the starting torque. By trying different combinations of weight and distance, the starting torque of a particular anemometer can be satisfactorily estimated. Once an estimate of the starting torque has been obtained, the threshold velocity of the anemometer (for horizontal mounting) can be estimated from a graph such as Figure 14-5 (obtained from the manufacturer). If the horizontal threshold velocity is acceptable [
15 m/min (50 ft/min), when this technique is used], the anemometer can be used. If the threshold velocity of an anemometer is found to be unacceptably high, the anemometer shall either be replaced or repaired.
10.3.2 Recorders and Counters. Check the calibration of each recorder and counter (see section 6.1.2) at a minimum of three points, approximately spanning the expected range of velocities. Use the calibration procedures recommended by the manufacturer, or other suitable procedures (subject to the approval of the Administrator). If a recorder or counter is found to be out of calibration by an average amount greater than 5 percent for the three calibration points, replace or repair the system; otherwise, the system can be used.
10.3.3 Temperature Measurement Apparatus. Check the calibration of the Temperature Measurement Apparatus, using the procedures outlined in section 10.3 of Method 2, at temperatures of 0, 100, and 150 °C (32, 212, and 302 °F). If the calibration is off by more than 5 °C (9 °F) at any of the temperatures, repair or replace the apparatus; otherwise, the apparatus can be used.
10.4 Periodic Performance Checks. Repeat the procedures outlined in section 10.3 no
more than 12 months after the initial performance checks. If the above systems pass the performance checks (
i.e.,
if no repair or replacement of any component is necessary), continue with the performance checks on a 12-month interval basis. However, if any of the above systems fail the performance checks, repair or replace the system(s) that failed, and conduct the periodic performance checks on a 3-month interval basis, until sufficient information (to the satisfaction of the Administrator) is obtained to establish a modified performance check schedule and calculation procedure.

If any of the above systems fails the 12-month periodic performance checks, the data for the past year need not be recalculated.

2.0
Summary of Method
2.1 Total fluorides, in the form of solid and gaseous fluorides, are withdrawn from the ascending air stream inside of an aluminum reduction potroom and, prior to exiting the potroom roof monitor, into a specific cassette arrangement. The cassettes are connected by tubing to flowmeters and a manifold system that allows for the equal distribution of volume pulled through each cassette, and finally to a dry gas meter. The cassettes have a specific internal arrangement of one unaltered cellulose filter and support pad in the first section of the cassette for solid fluoride retention and two cellulose filters with support pads that are impregnated with sodium formate for the chemical absorption of gaseous fluorides in the following two sections of the cassette. A minimum of eight cassettes shall be used for a potline and shall be strategically located at equal intervals across the potroom roof so as to encompass a minimum of 8 percent of the total length of the potroom. A greater number of cassettes may be used should the regulated facility choose to do so. The mass flow rate of pollutants is determined with anemometers and temperature sensing devices located immediately below the opening of the roof monitor and spaced evenly within the cassette group.

4.0
Interferences and Known Limitations
4.1 There are two principal categories of limitations that must be addressed when using this method. The first category is sampling bias and the second is analytical bias. Biases in sampling can occur when there is an insufficient number of cassettes located along the roof monitor of a potroom or if the distribution of those cassettes is spatially unequal. Known sampling biases also can occur when there are leaks within the cassette arrangement and if anemometers and temperature devices are not providing accurate data. Applicable instruments must be properly calibrated to avoid sampling bias. Analytical biases can occur when instrumentation is not calibrated or fails calibration and the instrument is used out of proper calibration. Additionally, biases can occur in the laboratory if fusion crucibles retain residual fluorides over lengthy periods of use. This condition could result in falsely elevated fluoride values. Maintaining a clean work environment in the laboratory is crucial to producing accurate values.
4.2 Biases during sampling can be avoided by properly spacing the appropriate number of cassettes along the roof monitor, conducting leak checks of the cassette arrangement, calibrating the dry gas meter every 30 days, verifying the accuracy of individual flowmeters (so that there is no more than 5 percent difference in the volume pulled between any two flowmeters), and calibrating or replacing anemometers and temperature sensing devices as necessary to maintain true data generation.
4.3 Analytical biases can be avoided by calibrating instruments according to the manufacturer's specifications prior to conducting any analyses, by performing internal and external audits of up to 10 percent of all samples analyzed, and by rotating individual crucibles as the “blank” crucible to detect any potential residual fluoride carry-over to samples. Should any contamination be discovered in the blank crucible, the crucible shall be thoroughly cleaned to remove any detected residual fluorides and a “blank” analysis conducted again to evaluate the effectiveness of the cleaning. The crucible
shall remain in service as long as no detectable residual fluorides are present.

Equipment and Supplies
6.1 Sampling.
6.1.1 Cassette arrangement. The cassette itself is a three-piece, styrene acrylonitrile cassette unit (a Gelman Sciences product), 37 millimeter (mm), with plastic connectors. In the first section (the intake section), an untreated Gelman Sciences 37 mm, 0.8 micrometer (µm) DM-800 metricel membrane filter and cellulose support pad, or equivalent, is situated. In the second and third segments of the cassette there is placed one each of Gelman Sciences 37 mm, 5 µm GLA-5000 low-ash PVC filter with a cellulose support pad or equivalent product. Each of these two filters and support pads shall have been immersed in a solution of 10 percent sodium formate (volume/volume in an ethyl alcohol solution). The impregnated pads shall be placed in the cassette segments while still wet and heated at 50 °C (122 °F) until the pad is completely dry. It is important to check for a proper fit of the filter and support pad to the cassette segment to ensure that there are no areas where gases could bypass the filter. Once all of the cassette segments have been prepared, the cassette shall be assembled and a plastic plug shall be inserted into the exhaust hole of the cassette. Prior to placing the cassette into service, the space between each segment shall be taped with an appropriately durable tape to prevent the infiltration of gases through the points of connection, and an aluminum nozzle shall be inserted into the intake hole of the cassette. The aluminum nozzle shall have a short section of tubing placed over the opening of the nozzle, with the tubing plugged to prevent dust from entering the nozzle and to prepare the nozzle for the cassette arrangement leak check. An alternate nozzle type can be used if historical results or scientific demonstration of applicability can be shown.
6.1.2 Anemometers and temperature sensing devices. To calculate the mass flow rate of TF from the roof monitor under standard conditions, anemometers that meet the specifications in section 2.1.1 in Method 14 of this appendix or an equivalent device yielding equivalent information shall be used. A recording mechanism capable of accurately recording the exit gas temperature at least every 2 hours shall be used.
6.1.3 Barometer. To correct the volumetric flow from the potline roof monitor to standard conditions, a mercury (Hg), aneroid, or other barometer capable of measuring atmospheric pressure to within 2.5 mm [0.1 inch (in)] Hg shall be used.

# Note:
The barometric reading may be obtained from a nearby National Weather Service Station. In this case, the station value (which is absolute barometric pressure) shall be requested and an adjustment for elevation differences between the weather station and the sampling point shall be made at a rate of minus 2.5 mm (0.1 in) Hg per 30 meters (m) [100 feet (ft)] elevation increase or plus 2.5 mm (0.1 in) Hg per 30 m (100 ft) elevation decrease.

If the audit stock solution is purchased from a commercial supplier, the standard solution must be accompanied by a certificate of analysis or an equivalent proof of fluoride concentration.
8.0
Sample Collection and Analysis
8.1 Preparing cassette arrangement for sampling. The cassettes are initially connected to flexible tubing. The tubing is connected to flowmeters and a manifold system. The manifold system is connected to a dry gas meter (Research Appliance Company model 201009 or equivalent). The length of tubing is managed by pneumatically or electrically operated hoists located in the roof monitor, and the travel of the tubing is controlled by encasing the tubing in aluminum conduit. The tubing is lowered for cassette insertion by operating a control box at floor level. Once the cassette has been securely inserted into the tubing and the leak check performed, the tubing and cassette are raised to the roof monitor level using the floor level control box. Arrangements similar to the one described are acceptable if the scientific sample collection principles are followed.
8.2 Test run sampling period. A test run shall comprise a minimum of a 24-hour sampling event encompassing at least eight cassettes per potline (or four cassettes per potroom group). Monthly compliance shall be based on three test runs during the month. Test runs of greater than 24 hours are allowed; however, three such runs shall be conducted during the month.
8.3 Leak-check procedures.
8.3.1 Pretest leak check. A pretest leak-check is recommended; however, it is not required. To perform a pretest leak-check after the cassettes have been inserted into the tubing, isolate the cassette to be leak-checked by turning the valves on the manifold to stop all flows to the other sampling points connected to the manifold and meter. The cassette, with the plugged tubing section securing the intake of the nozzle, is subjected to the highest vacuum expected during the run. If no leaks are detected, the tubing plug can be briefly removed as the dry gas meter is rapidly turned off.
8.3.2 Post-test leak check. A leak check is required at the conclusion of each test run for each cassette. The leak check shall be performed in accordance with the procedure outlined in section 8.3.1 of this method except that it shall be performed at a vacuum greater than the maximum vacuum reached during the test run. If the leakage rate is found to be no greater than 4 percent of the average sampling rate, the results are acceptable. If the leakage rate is greater than 4 percent of the average sampling rate, either record the leakage rate and correct the sampling volume as discussed in section 12.4 of this method or void the test run if the minimum number of cassettes were used. If the number of cassettes used was greater than the minimum required, discard the leaking cassette and use the remaining cassettes for the emission determination.
8.3.3 Anemometers and temperature sensing device placement. Install the recording mechanism to record the exit gas temperature. Anemometers shall be installed as required in section 6.1.2 of Method 14 of this appendix, except replace the word “manifold” with “cassette group” in section 6.1.2.3. These two different instruments shall be located near each other along the roof monitor. See conceptual configurations in Figures 14A-1, 14A-2, and 14A-3 of this method. Fewer temperature devices than anemometers may be used if at least one temperature device is located within the span of the cassette group. Other anemometer location siting scenarios may be acceptable as long as the exit velocity of the roof monitor gases is representative of the entire section of the potline being sampled.
8.4 Sampling. The actual sample run shall begin with the removal of the tubing and plug from the cassette nozzle. Each cassette is then raised to the roof monitor area, the dry gas meter is turned on, and the flowmeters are set to the calibration point, which allows an equal volume of sampled gas to enter each cassette. The dry gas meter shall be set to a range suitable for the specific potroom type being sampled that will yield valid data known from previous experience or a range determined by the use of the calculation in section 12 of this method. Parameters related to the test run that shall be recorded, either during the test run or after the test run if recording devices are used, include: anemometer data, roof monitor exit gas temperature, dry gas meter temperature, dry gas meter volume, and barometric pressure. At the conclusion of the test run, the cassettes shall be lowered, the dry gas meter turned off, and the volume registered on the dry gas meter recorded. The post-test leak check procedures described in section 8.3.2 of this method shall be performed. All data relevant to the test shall be recorded on a field data sheet and maintained on file.
8.5 Sample recovery.
8.5.1 The cassettes shall be brought to the laboratory with the intake nozzle contents protected with the section of plugged tubing previously described. The exterior of cassettes shall carefully be wiped free of any dust or debris, making sure that any falling dust or debris does not present a potential laboratory contamination problem.
8.5.2 Carefully remove all tape from the cassettes and remove the initial filter, support pad, and all loose solids from the first (intake) section of the cassette. Fold the filter and support pad several times and, along with all loose solids removed from the interior of the first section of the cassette, place them into a nickel crucible. Using water, wash the interior of the nozzle into the same nickel crucible. Add 0.1 gram (g) [±0.1 milligram (mg)] of calcium oxide and a sufficient amount of water to make a loose slurry. Mix the contents of the crucible thoroughly with a Teflon” stirring rod. After rinsing any adhering residue from the stirring rod back into the crucible, place the crucible on a hot plate or in a muffle furnace until all liquid is evaporated and allow the mixture to gradually char for 1 hour.
8.5.3 Transfer the crucible to a cold muffle furnace and ash at 600 °C (1,112 °F). Remove the crucible after the ashing phase and, after the crucible cools, add 3.0 g (±0.1 g) of NaOH pellets. Place this mixture in a muffle furnace at 600 °C (1,112 °F) for 3 minutes. Remove the crucible and roll the melt so as to reach all of the ash with the molten NaOH. Let the melt cool to room temperature. Add 10 to 15 ml of water to the crucible and place it on a hot plate at a low temperature setting until the melt is soft or suspended. Transfer the contents of the crucible to a 50-ml volumetric flask. Rinse the crucible with 20 ml of 1:1 perchloric acid or 20 ml of 1:1 sulfuric acid in two (2) 10 ml portions. Pour the acid rinse slowly into the volumetric flask and swirl the flask after each addition. Cool to room temperature. The product of this procedure is particulate fluorides.
8.5.4 Gaseous fluorides can be isolated for analysis by folding the gaseous fluoride filters and support pads to approximately
1/4
of their original size and placing them in a 50-ml plastic vial. To the vial add exactly 10 ml of water and leach the sample for a minimum of 1 hour. The leachate from this process yields the gaseous fluorides for analysis.
9.0
Quality Control
9.1 Laboratory auditing. Laboratory audits of specific and known concentrations of fluoride shall be submitted to the laboratory with each group of samples submitted for analysis. An auditor shall prepare and present the audit samples as a “blind” evaluation of laboratory performance with each group of samples submitted to the laboratory. The audits shall be prepared to represent concentrations of fluoride that could be expected to be in the low, medium and high range of actual results. Average recoveries of all three audits must equal 90 to 110 percent for acceptable results; otherwise, the laboratory must investigate procedures and instruments for potential problems.

# Note:
The analytical procedure allows for the analysis of individual or combined filters and pads from the cassettes provided that equal volumes (±10 percent) are sampled through each cassette.

# 10.0 Calibrations
10.1 Equipment evaluations. To ensure the integrity of this method, periodic calibrations and equipment replacements are necessary.
10.1.1 Metering system. At 30-day intervals the metering system shall be calibrated. Connect the metering system inlet to the outlet of a wet test meter that is accurate to 1 percent. Refer to Figure 5-4 of Method 5 of this appendix. The wet-test meter shall have a capacity of 30 liters/revolution [1 cubic foot (ft
3
)/revolution]. A spirometer of 400 liters (14 ft
3
) or more capacity, or equivalent, may be used for calibration; however, a wet-test meter is usually more practical. The wet-test meter shall be periodically tested with a spirometer or a liquid displacement meter to ensure the accuracy. Spirometers or wet-test meters of other sizes may be used, provided that the specified accuracies of the procedure are maintained. Run the metering system pump for about 15 min. with the orifice manometer indicating a median reading as expected in field use to allow the pump to warm up and to thoroughly wet the interior of the wet-test meter. Then, at each of a minimum of three orifice manometer settings, pass an exact quantity of gas through the wet-test meter and record the volume indicated by the dry gas meter. Also record the barometric pressure, the temperatures of the wet test meter, the inlet temperatures of the dry gas meter, and the temperatures of the outlet of the dry gas meter. Record all calibration data on a form similar to the one shown in Figure 5-5 of Method 5 of this appendix and calculate Y, the dry gas meter calibration factor, and ΔH@, the orifice calibration factor at each orifice setting. Allowable tolerances for Y and ΔH@ are given in Figure 5-6 of Method 5 of this appendix. Allowable tolerances for Y and ΔH@ are given in Figure 5-5 of Method 5 of this appendix.
10.1.2 Estimating volumes for initial test runs. For a facility's initial test runs, the regulated facility must have a target or desired volume of gases to be sampled and a target range of volumes to use during the calibration of the dry gas meter. Use Equations 14A-1 and 14A-2 in section 12 of this method to derive the target dry gas meter volume (F
v
) for these purposes.
10.1.3 Calibration of anemometers and temperature sensing devices. If the standard anemometers in Method 14 of this appendix are used, the calibration and integrity evaluations in sections 10.3.1.1 through 10.3.1.3 of Method 14 of this appendix shall be used as well as the recording device described in section 2.1.3 of Method 14. The calibrations or complete change-outs of anemometers shall take place at a minimum of once per year.
The temperature sensing and recording devices shall be calibrated according to the manufacturer's specifications.
10.1.4 Calibration of flowmeters. The calibration of flowmeters is necessary to ensure that an equal volume of sampled gas is entering each of the individual cassettes and that no large differences, which could possibly bias the sample, exist between the cassettes.
10.1.4.1 Variable area, 65 mm flowmeters or equivalent shall be used. These flowmeters can be mounted on a common base for convenience. These flowmeters shall be calibrated by attaching a prepared cassette, complete with filters and pads, to the flowmeter and then to the system manifold. This manifold is an aluminum cylinder with valved inlets for connections to the flowmeters/cassettes and one outlet to a dry gas meter. The connection is then made to the wet-test meter and finally to a dry gas meter. All connections are made with tubing.
10.1.4.2 Turn the dry gas meter on for 15 min. in preparation for the calibration. Turn the dry gas meter off and plug the intake hole of the cassette. Turn the dry gas meter back on to evaluate the entire system for leaks. If the dry gas meter shows a leakage rate of less than 0.02 ft
3
/min at 10 in. of Hg vacuum as noted on the dry gas meter, the system is acceptable to further calibration.
10.1.4.3 With the dry gas meter turned on and the flow indicator ball at a selected flow rate, record the exact amount of gas pulled through the flowmeter by taking measurements from the wet test meter after exactly 10 min. Record the room temperature and barometric pressure. Conduct this test for all flowmeters in the system with all flowmeters set at the same indicator ball reading. When all flowmeters have gone through the procedure above, correct the volume pulled through each flowmeter to standard conditions. The acceptable difference between the highest and lowest flowmeter rate is 5 percent. Should one or more flowmeters be outside of the acceptable limit of 5 percent, repeat the calibration procedure at a lower or higher indicator ball reading until all flowmeters show no more than 5 percent difference among them.
10.1.4.4 This flowmeter calibration shall be conducted at least once per year.
10.1.5 Miscellaneous equipment calibrations. Miscellaneous equipment used such as an automatic recorder/ printer used to measure dry gas meter temperatures shall be calibrated according to the manufacturer's specifications in order to maintain the accuracy of the equipment.
11.0 Analytical Procedure
11.1 The preferred primary analytical determination of the individual isolated samples or the combined particulate and gaseous samples shall be performed by an automated methodology. The analytical method for this technology shall be based on the manufacturer's instructions for equipment operation and shall also include the analysis of five standards with concentrations in the expected range of the actual samples. The results of the analysis of the five standards shall have a coefficient of correlation of at least 0.99. A check standard shall be analyzed as the last sample of the group to determine if instrument drift has occurred. The acceptable result for the check standard is 95 to 105 percent of the standard's true value.
11.2 The secondary analytical method shall be by specific ion electrode if the samples are distilled or if a TISAB IV buffer is used to eliminate aluminum interferences. Five standards with concentrations in the expected range of the actual samples shall be analyzed, and a coefficient of correlation of at least 0.99 is the minimum acceptable limit for linearity. An exception for this limit for linearity is a condition when low-level standards in the range of 0.01 to 0.48 µg fluoride/ml are analyzed. In this situation, a minimum coefficient of correlation of 0.97 is required. TISAB II shall be used for low-level analyses.

12.3 Calculations of TF emissions from field and laboratory data that would yield a production related emission rate can be calculated as follows:
12.3.1 Obtain a standard cubic feet (scf) value for the volume pulled through the dry gas meter for all cassettes by using the field and calibration data and Equation 5-1 of Method 5 of this appendix.
12.3.2 Derive the average quantity of TF per cassette (in µg TF/cassette) by adding all laboratory data for all cassettes and dividing this value by the total number of cassettes used. Divide this average TF value by the corrected dry gas meter volume for each cassette; this value then becomes TF

of 3,000/75 = 5 µg/ft

# Method 15—Determination of Hydrogen Sulfide, Carbonyl Sulfide, and Carbon Disulfide Emissions From Stationary Sources

# Note:
This method is not inclusive with respect to specifications (
e.g.,
equipment and supplies) and procedures (
e.g.,
sampling and analytical) essential to its performance. Some material is incorporated by reference from other methods in this part. Therefore, to obtain reliable results, persons using this method should have a thorough knowledge of gas chromatography techniques.

1.2 Applicability.
1.2.1 This method applies to the determination of emissions of reduced sulfur compounds from tail gas control units of sulfur recovery plants, H
2
S in fuel gas for fuel gas combustion devices, and where specified in other applicable subparts of the regulations.
1.2.2 The method described below uses the principle of gas chromatographic (GC) separation and flame photometric detection (FPD). Since there are many systems or sets of operating conditions that represent useable methods for determining sulfur emissions, all systems which employ this principle, but differ only in details of equipment and operation, may be used as alternative methods, provided that the calibration precision and sample-line loss criteria are met.
1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 A gas sample is extracted from the emission source and diluted with clean dry air (if necessary). An aliquot of the diluted sample is then analyzed for CS
2
, COS, and H
2
S by GC/FPD.

# 3.0 Definitions
[Reserved]

# 4.0 Interferences
4.1 Moisture Condensation. Moisture condensation in the sample delivery system, the analytical column, or the FPD burner block can cause losses or interferences. This potential is eliminated by heating the probe, filter box, and connections, and by maintaining the SO
2
scrubber in an ice water bath. Moisture is removed in the SO
2
scrubber and heating the sample beyond this point is not necessary provided the ambient temperature is above 0 °C (32 °F). Alternatively, moisture may be eliminated by heating the sample line, and by conditioning the sample with dry dilution air to lower its dew point below the operating temperature of the GC/FPD analytical system prior to analysis.
4.2 Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Carbon Dioxide (CO
2
). CO and CO
2
have substantial desensitizing effects on the FPD even after 9:1 dilution. (Acceptable systems must demonstrate that they have eliminated this interference by some procedure such as eluting CO and CO
2
before any of the sulfur compounds to be measured.) Compliance with this requirement can be demonstrated by submitting chromatograms of calibration gases with and without CO
2
in the diluent gas. The CO
2
level should be approximately 10 percent for the case with CO
2
present. The two chromatograms should show agreement within the precision limits of section 13.3.
4.3 Elemental Sulfur. The condensation of sulfur vapor in the sampling system can lead to blockage of the particulate filter. This problem can be minimized by observing the filter for buildup and changing as needed.
4.4 Sulfur Dioxide (SO
2
). SO
2
is not a specific interferent but may be present in such large amounts that it cannot be effectively separated from the other compounds of interest. The SO
2
scrubber described in section 6.1.3 will effectively remove SO
2
from the sample.
4.5 Alkali Mist. Alkali mist in the emissions of some control devices may cause a rapid increase in the SO
2
scrubber pH, resulting in low sample recoveries. Replacing the SO
2
scrubber contents after each run will minimize the chances of interference in these cases.

# 5.0 Safety
5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations to performing this test.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
6.1 Sample Collection. See Figure 15-1. The sampling train component parts are discussed in the following sections:
6.1.1 Probe. The probe shall be made of Teflon or Teflon-lined stainless steel and heated to prevent moisture condensation. It shall be designed to allow calibration gas to enter the probe at or near the sample point entry. Any portion of the probe that contacts the stack gas must be heated to prevent moisture condensation. The probe described in section 6.1.1 of Method 16A having a nozzle directed away from the gas stream is recommended for sources having particulate or mist emissions. Where very high stack temperatures prohibit the use of Teflon probe components, glass or quartz-lined probes may serve as substitutes.
6.1.2 Particulate Filter. 50-mm Teflon filter holder and a 1- to 2-micron porosity Teflon filter (available through Savillex Corporation, 5325 Highway 101, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55343). The filter holder must be maintained in a hot box at a temperature of at least 120 °C (248 °F).
6.1.3 SO
2
Scrubber. Three 300-ml Teflon segment impingers connected in series with flexible, thick-walled, Teflon tubing. (Impinger parts and tubing available through Savillex.) The first two impingers contain 100 ml of citrate buffer, and the third impinger is initially dry. The tip of the tube inserted into the solution should be constricted to less than 3-mm (
1/8
-in.) ID and should be immersed to a depth of at least 50 cm (2 in.). Immerse the impingers in an ice water bath and maintain near 0 °C. The scrubber solution will normally last for a 3-hour run before needing replacement. This will depend upon the effects of moisture and particulate matter on the solution strength and pH. Connections between the probe, particulate filter, and SO
2
scrubber shall be made of Teflon and as short in length as possible. All portions of the probe, particulate filter, and connections prior to the SO
2
scrubber (or alternative point of moisture removal) shall be maintained at a temperature of at least 120 °C (248 °F).
6.1.4 Sample Line. Teflon, no greater than 13-mm (
1/2
-in.) ID. Alternative materials, such as virgin Nylon, may be used provided the line-loss test is acceptable.
6.1.5 Sample Pump. The sample pump shall be a leakless Teflon-coated diaphragm type or equivalent.
6.2 Analysis. The following items are needed for sample analysis:
6.2.1 Dilution System. The dilution system must be constructed such that all sample contacts are made of Teflon, glass, or stainless steel. It must be capable of approximately a 9:1 dilution of the sample.
6.2.2 Gas Chromatograph (see Figure 15-2). The gas chromatograph must have at least the following components:
6.2.2.1 Oven. Capable of maintaining the separation column at the proper operating temperature ±1 °C.
6.2.2.2 Temperature Gauge. To monitor column oven, detector, and exhaust temperature ±1 °C.

. To demonstrate that adequate resolution has been achieved, a chromatogram of a calibration gas containing all three reduced sulfur compounds in the concentration range of the applicable standard must be submitted. Adequate resolution will be defined as base line separation of adjacent peaks when the amplifier attenuation is set so that the smaller peak is at least 50 percent of full scale. Base line separation is defined as a return to zero (±5 percent) in the interval between peaks. Systems not meeting this criteria may be considered alternate methods subject to the approval of the Administrator.
6.3 Calibration System (See Figure 15-3). The calibration system must contain the following components:
6.3.1 Flow System. To measure air flow over permeation tubes within 2 percent. Each flowmeter shall be calibrated after each complete test series with a wet-test meter. If the flow measuring device differs from the wet-test meter by more than 5 percent, the completed test shall be discarded. Alternatively, use the flow data that will yield the lowest flow measurement. Calibration with a wet-test meter before a test is optional. Flow over the permeation device may also be determined using a soap bubble flowmeter.
6.3.2 Constant Temperature Bath. Device capable of maintaining the permeation tubes at the calibration temperature within 0.1 °C.
6.3.3 Temperature Sensor. Thermometer or equivalent to monitor bath temperature within 0.1 °C.

7.2 Combustion Gas. Oxygen (O
2
) or air, research purity or better.
7.3 Carrier Gas. Prepurified grade or better.
7.4 Diluent. Air containing less than 0.5 ppmv total sulfur compounds and less than 10 ppmv each of moisture and total hydrocarbons.
7.5 Calibration Gases.

S, COS, and CS

, gravimetrically calibrated and certified at some convenient operating temperature. These tubes consist of hermetically sealed FEP Teflon tubing in which a liquified gaseous substance is enclosed. The enclosed gas permeates through the tubing wall at a constant rate. When the temperature is constant, calibration gases covering a wide range of known concentrations can be generated by varying and accurately measuring the flow rate of diluent gas passing over the tubes. These calibration gases are used to calibrate the GC/FPD system and the dilution system.
7.5.2 Cylinder Gases. Cylinder gases may be used as alternatives to permeation devices. The gases must be traceable to a primary standard (such as permeation tubes) and not used beyond the certification expiration date.
7.6 Citrate Buffer. Dissolve 300 g of potassium citrate and 41 g of anhydrous citric acid in 1 liter of water. Alternatively, 284 g of sodium citrate may be substituted for the potassium citrate. Adjust the pH to between 5.4 and 5.6 with potassium citrate or citric acid, as required.
8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage
8.1 Pretest Procedures. After the complete measurement system has been set up at the site and deemed to be operational, the following procedures should be completed before sampling is initiated. These procedures are not required, but would be helpful in preventing any problem which might occur later to invalidate the entire test.
8.1.1 Leak-Check. Appropriate leak-check procedures should be employed to verify the integrity of all components, sample lines, and connections. The following procedure is suggested: For components upstream of the sample pump, attach the probe end of the sample line to a manometer or vacuum gauge, start the pump and pull a vacuum greater than 50 mm (2 in.) Hg, close off the pump outlet, and then stop the pump and ascertain that there is no leak for 1 minute. For components after the pump, apply a slight positive pressure and check for leaks by applying a liquid (detergent in water, for example) at each joint. Bubbling indicates the presence of a leak. As an alternative to the initial leak-test, the sample line loss test described in section 8.3.1 may be performed to verify the integrity of components.
8.1.2 System Performance. Since the complete system is calibrated at the beginning and end of each day of testing, the precise calibration of each component is not critical. However, these components should be verified to operate properly. This verification can be performed by observing the response of flowmeters or of the GC output to changes in flow rates or calibration gas concentrations, respectively, and ascertaining the response to be within predicted limits. If any component or the complete system fails to respond in a normal and predictable manner, the source of the discrepancy should be identified and corrected before proceeding.
8.2 Sample Collection and Analysis
8.2.1 After performing the calibration procedures outlined in section 10.0, insert the sampling probe into the test port ensuring that no dilution air enters the stack through the port. Begin sampling and dilute the sample approximately 9:1 using the dilution system. Note that the precise dilution factor is the one determined in section 10.4. Condition the entire system with sample for a minimum of 15 minutes before beginning the analysis. Inject aliquots of the sample into the GC/FPD analyzer for analysis. Determine the concentration of each reduced sulfur compound directly from the calibration curves or from the equation for the least-squares line.
8.2.2 If reductions in sample concentrations are observed during a sample run that cannot be explained by process conditions, the sampling must be interrupted to determine if the probe or filter is clogged with particulate matter. If either is found to be clogged, the test must be stopped and the results up to that point discarded. Testing may resume after cleaning or replacing the probe and filter. After each run, the probe and filter shall be inspected and, if necessary, replaced.
8.2.3 A sample run is composed of 16 individual analyses (injects) performed over a period of not less than 3 hours or more than 6 hours.
8.3 Post-Test Procedures.
8.3.1 Sample Line Loss. A known concentration of H
2
S at the level of the applicable standard, ±20 percent, must be introduced into the sampling system at the opening of the probe in sufficient quantities to ensure that there is an excess of sample which must be vented to the atmosphere. The sample must be transported through the entire sampling system to the measurement system in the same manner as the emission samples. The resulting measured concentration is compared to the known value to determine
the sampling system loss. For sampling losses greater than 20 percent, the previous sample run is not valid. Sampling losses of 0-20 percent must be corrected by dividing the resulting sample concentration by the fraction of recovery. The known gas sample may be calibration gas as described in section 7.5. Alternatively, cylinder gas containing H
2
S mixed in nitrogen and verified according to section 7.1.4 of Method 16A may be used. The optional pretest procedures provide a good guideline for determining if there are leaks in the sampling system.
8.3.2 Determination of Calibration Drift. After each run, or after a series of runs made within a 24-hour period, perform a partial recalibration using the procedures in section 10.0. Only H
2
S (or other permeant) need be used to recalibrate the GC/FPD analysis system and the dilution system. Partial recalibration may be performed at the midlevel calibration gas concentration or at a concentration measured in the samples but not less than the lowest calibration standard used in the initial calibration. Compare the calibration curves obtained after the runs to the calibration curves obtained under section 10.3. The calibration drift should not exceed the limits set forth in section 13.4. If the drift exceeds this limit, the intervening run or runs should be considered invalid. As an option, the calibration data set that gives the highest sample values may be chosen by the tester.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization
Prior to any sampling run, calibrate the system using the following procedures. (If more than one run is performed during any 24-hour period, a calibration need not be performed prior to the second and any subsequent runs. However, the calibration drift must be determined as prescribed in section 8.3.2 after the last run is made within the 24-hour period.)

# Note:
This section outlines steps to be followed for use of the GC/FPD and the dilution system. The calibration procedure does not include detailed instructions because the operation of these systems is complex, and it requires an understanding of the individual system being used. Each system should include a written operating manual describing in detail the operating procedures associated with each component in the measurement system. In addition, the operator should be familiar with the operating principles of the components, particularly the GC/FPD. The references in section 16.0 are recommended for review for this purpose.
10.1 Calibration Gas Permeation Tube Preparation.
10.1.1 Insert the permeation tubes into the tube chamber. Check the bath temperature to assure agreement with the calibration temperature of the tubes within 0.1 °C. Allow 24 hours for the tubes to equilibrate. Alternatively, equilibration may be verified by injecting samples of calibration gas at 1-hour intervals. The permeation tubes can be assumed to have reached equilibrium when consecutive hourly samples agree within 5 percent of their mean.
10.1.2 Vary the amount of air flowing over the tubes to produce the desired concentrations for calibrating the analytical and dilution systems. The air flow across the tubes must at all times exceed the flow requirement of the analytical systems. The concentration in ppmv generated by a tube containing a specific permeant can be calculated using Equation 15-1 in section 12.2.
10.2 Calibration of Analytical System. Generate a series of three or more known concentrations spanning the linear range of the FPD (approximately 0.5 to 10 ppmv for a 1-ml sample) for each of the three major sulfur compounds. Bypassing the dilution system, inject these standards into the GC/FPD and monitor the responses until three consecutive injections for each concentration agree within 5 percent of their mean. Failure to attain this precision indicates a problem in the calibration or analytical system. Any such problem must be identified and corrected before proceeding.
10.3 Calibration Curves. Plot the GC/FPD response in current (amperes) versus their causative concentrations in ppmv on log-log coordinate graph paper for each sulfur compound. Alternatively, a least-squares equation may be generated from the calibration data using concentrations versus the appropriate instrument response units.
10.4 Calibration of Dilution System. Generate a known concentration of H
2
S using the permeation tube system. Adjust the flow rate of diluent air for the first dilution stage
so that the desired level of dilution is approximated. Inject the diluted calibration gas into the GC/FPD system until the results of three consecutive injections for each dilution agree within 5 percent of their mean. Failure to attain this precision in this step is an indication of a problem in the dilution system. Any such problem must be identified and corrected before proceeding. Using the calibration data for H
2
S (developed under section 10.3), determine the diluted calibration gas concentration in ppmv. Then calculate the dilution factor as the ratio of the calibration gas concentration before dilution to the diluted calibration gas concentration determined under this section. Repeat this procedure for each stage of dilution required. Alternatively, the GC/FPD system may be calibrated by generating a series of three or more concentrations of each sulfur compound and diluting these samples before injecting them into the GC/FPD system. These data will then serve as the calibration data for the unknown samples and a separate determination of the dilution factor will not be necessary. However, the precision requirements are still applicable.

# 13.0 Method Performance
13.1 Range. Coupled with a GC system using a 1-ml sample size, the maximum limit of the FPD for each sulfur compound is approximately 10 ppmv. It may be necessary to
dilute samples from sulfur recovery plants a hundredfold (99:1), resulting in an upper limit of about 1000 ppmv for each compound.
13.2 Sensitivity. The minimum detectable concentration of the FPD is also dependent on sample size and would be about 0.5 ppmv for a 1-ml sample.
13.3 Calibration Precision. A series of three consecutive injections of the same calibration gas, at any dilution, shall produce results which do not vary by more than 5 percent from the mean of the three injections.
13.4 Calibration Drift. The calibration drift determined from the mean of three injections made at the beginning and end of any run or series of runs within a 24-hour period shall not exceed 5 percent.

Therefore, to obtain reliable results, persons using this method should have a thorough knowledge of at least the following additional test methods: Method 1, Method 6, Method 15, and Method 16A.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 An integrated gas sample is extracted from the stack, and combustion air is added to the oxygen (O
2
)-deficient gas at a known rate. The reduced sulfur compounds [including carbon disulfide (CS
2
), carbonyl sulfide (COS), and hydrogen sulfide (H
2
S)] are thermally oxidized to sulfur dioxide (SO
2
), which is then collected in hydrogen peroxide as sulfate ion and analyzed according to the Method 6 barium-thorin titration procedure.

# 3.0 Definitions
[Reserved]

# 4.0 Interferences
4.1 Reduced sulfur compounds, other than CS
2
, COS, and H
2
S, that are present in the emissions will also be oxidized to SO
2
, causing a positive bias relative to emission standards that limit only the three compounds listed above. For example, thiophene has been identified in emissions from a Stretford unit and produced a positive bias of 30 percent in the Method 15A result. However, these biases may not affect the outcome of the test at units where emissions are low relative to the standard.
4.2 Calcium and aluminum have been shown to interfere in the Method 6 titration procedure. Since these metals have been identified in particulate matter emissions from Stretford units, a Teflon filter is required to minimize this interference.
4.3 Dilution of the hydrogen peroxide (H
2
O
2
) absorbing solution can potentially reduce collection efficiency, causing a negative bias. When used to sample emissions containing 7 percent moisture or less, the midget impingers have sufficient volume to contain the condensate collected during sampling. Dilution of the H
2
O
2
does not affect the collection of SO
2
. At higher moisture contents, the potassium citrate-citric acid buffer system used with Method 16A should be used to collect the condensate.

# 5.0 Safety
5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.
5.2 Corrosive reagents. The following reagents are hazardous. Personal protective equipment and safe procedures are useful in preventing chemical splashes.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
6.1 Sample Collection. The sampling train used in performing this method is shown in Figure 15A-1, and component parts are discussed below. Modifications to this sampling train are acceptable provided that the system performance check is met.
6.1.1 Probe. 6.4-mm (
1/4
-in.) OD Teflon tubing sequentially wrapped with heat-resistant fiber strips, a rubberized heating tape (with a plug at one end), and heat-resistant adhesive tape. A flexible thermocouple or some other suitable temperature-measuring device shall be placed between the Teflon tubing and the fiber strips so that the temperature can be monitored. The probe should be sheathed in stainless steel to provide in-stack rigidity. A series of bored-out stainless steel fittings placed at the front of the sheath will prevent flue gas from entering between the probe and sheath. The sampling probe is depicted in Figure 15A-2.
6.1.2 Particulate Filter. A 50-mm Teflon filter holder and a 1- to 2-mm porosity Teflon filter (available through Savillex Corporation, 5325 Highway 101, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55345). The filter holder must be
maintained in a hot box at a temperature high enough to prevent condensation.
6.1.3 Combustion Air Delivery System. As shown in the schematic diagram in Figure 15A-3. The rate meter should be selected to measure an air flow rate of 0.5 liter/min (0.02 ft
3
/min).
6.1.4 Combustion Tube. Quartz glass tubing with an expanded combustion chamber 2.54 cm (1 in.) in diameter and at least 30.5 cm (12 in.) long. The tube ends should have an outside diameter of 0.6 cm (
1/4
in.) and be at least 15.3 cm (6 in.) long. This length is necessary to maintain the quartz-glass connector near ambient temperature and thereby avoid leaks. Alternatively, the outlet may be constructed with a 90 degree glass elbow and socket that would fit directly onto the inlet of the first peroxide impinger.
6.1.5 Furnace. Of sufficient size to enclose the combustion tube. The furnace must have a temperature regulator capable of maintaining the temperature at 1100 ±50 °C (2,012 ±90 °F). The furnace operating temperature must be checked with a thermocouple to ensure accuracy. Lindberg furnaces have been found to be satisfactory.
6.1.6 Peroxide Impingers, Stopcock Grease, Temperature Sensor, Drying Tube, Valve, Pump, and Barometer. Same as in Method 6, sections 6.1.1.2, 6.1.1.4, 6.1.1.5, 6.1.1.6, 6.1.1.7, 6.1.1.8, and 6.1.2, respectively, except that the midget bubbler of Method 6, section 6.1.1.2 is not required.
6.1.7 Vacuum Gauge and Rate Meter. At least 760 mm Hg (30 in. Hg) gauge and rotameter, or equivalent, capable of measuring flow rate to ±5 percent of the selected flow rate and calibrated as in section 10.2.
6.1.8 Volume Meter. Dry gas meter capable of measuring the sample volume under the particular sampling conditions with an accuracy of 2 percent.
6.1.9 U-tube manometer. To measure the pressure at the exit of the combustion gas dry gas meter.
6.2 Sample Recovery and Analysis. Same as Method 6, sections 6.2 and 6.3, except a 10-ml buret with 0.05-ml graduations is required for titrant volumes of less than 10.0 ml, and the spectrophotometer is not needed.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards

# Note:
Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents must conform to the specifications established by the Committee on Analytical Reagents of the American Chemical Society. When such specifications are not available, the best available grade shall be used.
7.1 Sample Collection. The following reagents and standards are required for sample analysis:
7.1.1 Water. Same as Method 6, section 7.1.1.
7.1.2 Hydrogen Peroxide (H
2
O
2
), 3 Percent by Volume. Same as Method 6, section 7.1.3 (40 ml is needed per sample).
7.1.3 Recovery Check Gas. Carbonyl sulfide in nitrogen [100 parts per million by volume (ppmv) or greater, if necessary] in an aluminum cylinder. Concentration certified by the manufacturer with an accuracy of ±2 percent or better, or verified by gas chromatography where the instrument is calibrated with a COS permeation tube.
7.1.4 Combustion Gas. Air, contained in a gas cylinder equipped with a two-stage regulator. The gas shall contain less than 50 ppb of reduced sulfur compounds and less than 10 ppm total hydrocarbons.
7.2 Sample Recovery and Analysis. Same as Method 6, sections 7.2 and 7.3.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
8.1 Preparation of Sampling Train. For the Method 6 part of the train, measure 20 ml of 3 percent H
2
O
2
into the first and second midget impingers. Leave the third midget impinger empty and add silica gel to the fourth impinger. Alternatively, a silica gel drying tube may be used in place of the fourth impinger. Place crushed ice and water around all impingers. Maintain the oxidation furnace at 1100 ±50 °C (2,012 ±90 °F) to ensure 100 percent oxidation of COS. Maintain the probe and filter temperatures at a high enough level (no visible condensation) to prevent moisture condensation and monitor the temperatures with a thermocouple.
8.2 Leak-Check Procedure. Assemble the sampling train and leak-check as described in Method 6, section 8.2. Include the combustion air delivery system from the needle valve forward in the leak-check.
8.3 Sample Collection. Adjust the pressure on the second stage of the regulator on the combustion air cylinder to 10 psig. Adjust the combustion air flow rate to 0.5 ±0.05 L/min (1.1 ±0.1 ft
3
/hr) before injecting combustion air into the sampling train. Then inject combustion air into the sampling train, start the sample pump, and open the stack sample gas valve. Carry out these three operations within 15 to 30 seconds to avoid pressurizing the sampling train. Adjust the total sample flow rate to 2.0 ±0.2 L/min (4.2 ±0.4 ft
3
/hr). These flow rates produce an O
2
concentration of 5.0 percent in the stack gas, which must be maintained constantly to allow oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds to SO
2
. Adjust these flow rates during sampling as necessary. Monitor and record the combustion air manometer reading at regular intervals during the sampling period. Sample for 1 or 3 hours. At the end of sampling, turn off the sample pump and combustion air simultaneously (within 30 seconds of each other). All other procedures are the same as in Method 6, section 8.3, except that the sampling train should not be purged. After collecting the
sample, remove the probe from the stack and conduct a leak-check according to the procedures outlined in section 8.2 of Method 6 (mandatory). After each 3-hour test run (or after three 1-hour samples), conduct one system performance check (see section 8.5). After this system performance check and before the next test run, it is recommended that the probe be rinsed and brushed and the filter replaced.

# Note:
In Method 15, a test run is composed of 16 individual analyses (injects) performed over a period of not less than 3 hours or more than 6 hours. For Method 15A to be consistent with Method 15, the following may be used to obtain a test run: (1) Collect three 60-minute samples or (2) collect one 3-hour sample. (Three test runs constitute a test.)
8.4 Sample Recovery. Recover the hydrogen peroxide-containing impingers as detailed in Method 6, section 8.4.
8.5 System Performance Check.
8.5.1 A system performance check is done (1) to validate the sampling train components and procedure (before testing, optional) and (2) to validate a test run (after a run, mandatory). Perform a check in the field before testing consisting of at least two samples (optional), and perform an additional check after each 3-hour run or after three 1-hour samples (mandatory).
8.5.2 The checks involve sampling a known concentration of COS and comparing the analyzed concentration with the known concentration. Mix the recovery gas with N
2
as shown in Figure 15A-4 if dilution is required. Adjust the flow rates to generate a COS concentration in the range of the stack gas or within 20 percent of the applicable standard at a total flow rate of at least 2.5 L/min (5.3 ft
3
/hr). Use Equation 15A-4 (see section 12.5) to calculate the concentration of recovery gas generated. Calibrate the flow rate from both sources with a soap bubble flow tube so that the diluted concentration of COS can be accurately calculated. Collect 30-minute samples, and analyze in the same manner as the emission samples. Collect the samples through the probe of the sampling train using a manifold or some other suitable device that will ensure extraction of a representative sample.
8.5.3 The recovery check must be performed in the field before replacing the particulate filter and before cleaning the probe. A sample recovery of 100 ±20 percent must be obtained for the data to be valid and should be reported with the emission data, but should not be used to correct the data. However, if the performance check results do not affect the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility, the Administrator may decide to accept the results of the compliance test. Use Equation 15A-5 (see section 12.6) to calculate the recovery efficiency.

# 13.0 Method Performance
13.1 Analytical Range. The lower detectable limit is 0.1 ppmv when sampling at 2 lpm for 3 hours or 0.3 ppmv when sampling at 2 lpm for 1 hour. The upper concentration limit of the method exceeds concentrations of reduced sulfur compounds generally encountered in sulfur recovery plants.
13.2 Precision. Relative standard deviations of 2.8 and 6.9 percent have been obtained when sampling a stream with a reduced sulfur compound concentration of 41 ppmv as SO
2
for 1 and 3 hours, respectively.
13.3 Bias. No analytical bias has been identified. However, results obtained with this method are likely to contain a positive bias relative to emission regulations due to the presence of nonregulated sulfur compounds (that are present in petroleum) in the emissions. The magnitude of this bias varies accordingly, and has not been quantified.

The test methods in this appendix are referred to in § 60.8 (Performance Tests) and § 60.11 (Compliance With Standards and Maintenance Requirements) of 40 CFR part 60, subpart A (General Provisions). Specific uses of these test methods are described in the standards of performance contained in the subparts, beginning with Subpart D.
Within each standard of performance, a section title “Test Methods and Procedures” is provided to: (1) Identify the test methods to be used as reference methods to the facility subject to the respective standard and (2) identify any special instructions or conditions to be followed when applying a method to the respective facility. Such instructions (for example, establish sampling rates, volumes, or temperatures) are to be used either in addition to, or as a substitute for procedures in a test method. Similarly, for sources subject to emission monitoring requirements, specific instructions pertaining to any use of a test method as a reference method are provided in the subpart or in Appendix B.
Inclusion of methods in this appendix is not intended as an endorsement or denial of their applicability to sources that are not subject to standards of performance. The methods are potentially applicable to other sources; however, applicability should be confirmed by careful and appropriate evaluation of the conditions prevalent at such sources.
The approach followed in the formulation of the test methods involves specifications for equipment, procedures, and performance. In concept, a performance specification approach would be preferable in all methods because this allows the greatest flexibility to the user. In practice, however, this approach is impractical in most cases because performance specifications cannot be established. Most of the methods described herein, therefore, involve specific equipment specifications and procedures, and only a few methods in this appendix rely on performance criteria.
Minor changes in the test methods should not necessarily affect the validity of the results and it is recognized that alternative and equivalent methods exist. section 60.8 provides authority for the Administrator to specify or approve (1) equivalent methods, (2) alternative methods, and (3) minor changes in the methodology of the test methods. It should be clearly understood that unless otherwise identified all such methods and changes must have prior approval of the Administrator. An owner employing such methods or deviations from the test methods without obtaining prior approval does so at the risk of subsequent disapproval and retesting with approved methods.
Within the test methods, certain specific equipment or procedures are recognized as being acceptable or potentially acceptable and are specifically identified in the methods. The items identified as acceptable options may be used without approval but must be identified in the test report. The potentially approvable options are cited as “subject to the approval of the Administrator” or as “or equivalent.” Such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives may be used at the discretion of the owner without prior approval. However, detailed descriptions for applying these potentially approvable techniques or alternatives are not provided in the test methods. Also, the potentially approvable options are not necessarily acceptable in all applications. Therefore, an owner electing to use such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives is responsible for: (1) assuring that the techniques or alternatives are in fact applicable and are properly executed; (2) including a written description of the alternative method in the test report (the written method must be clear and must be capable of being performed without additional instruction, and the degree of detail should be similar to the detail contained in the test methods); and (3) providing any rationale or supporting data necessary to show the validity of the alternative in the particular application. Failure to meet these requirements can result in the Administrator's disapproval of the alternative.

at least the following additional test methods: Method 1, Method 4, Method 15, and Method 16A.

1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of total reduced sulfur (TRS) compounds from recovery furnaces, lime kilns, and smelt dissolving tanks at kraft pulp mills and fuel gas combustion devices at petroleum refineries.

# Note:
The method described below uses the principle of gas chromatographic (GC) separation and flame photometric detection (FPD). Since there are many systems or sets of operating conditions that represent useable methods of determining sulfur emissions, all systems which employ this principle, but differ only in details of equipment and operation, may be used as alternative methods, provided that the calibration precision and sample line loss criteria are met.
1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 A gas sample is extracted from the emission source and an aliquot is analyzed for hydrogen sulfide (H
2
S), methyl mercaptan (MeSH), dimethyl sulfide (DMS), and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) by GC/FPD. These four compounds are known collectively as TRS.

# 3.0 Definitions
[Reserved]

# 4.0 Interferences
4.1 Moisture. Moisture condensation in the sample delivery system, the analytical column, or the FPD burner block can cause losses or interferences. This is prevented by maintaining the probe, filter box, and connections at a temperature of at least 120 °C (248 °F). Moisture is removed in the SO
2
scrubber and heating the sample beyond this point is not necessary when the ambient temperature is above 0 °C (32 °F). Alternatively, moisture may be eliminated by heating the sample line, and by conditioning the sample with dry dilution air to lower its dew point below the operating temperature of the GC/FPD analytical system prior to analysis.
4.2 Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Carbon Dioxide (CO
2
). CO and CO
2
have a substantial desensitizing effect on the flame photometric detector even after dilution. Acceptable systems must demonstrate that they have eliminated this interference by some procedure such as eluting these compounds before any of the compounds to be measured. Compliance with this requirement can be demonstrated by submitting chromatograms of calibration gases with and without CO
2
in the diluent gas. The CO
2
level should be approximately 10 percent for the case with CO
2
present. The two chromatograms should show agreement within the precision limits of section 10.2.
4.3 Particulate Matter. Particulate matter in gas samples can cause interference by eventual clogging of the analytical system. This interference is eliminated by using the Teflon filter after the probe.
4.4 Sulfur Dioxide (SO
2
). Sulfur dioxide is not a specific interferant but may be present in such large amounts that it cannot effectively be separated from the other compounds of interest. The SO
2
scrubber described in section 6.1.3 will effectively remove SO
2
from the sample.

# 5.0 Safety
5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.
5.2 Hydrogen Sulfide. A flammable, poisonous gas with the odor of rotten eggs. H
2
S is extremely hazardous and can cause collapse, coma, and death within a few seconds of one or two inhalations at sufficient concentrations. Low concentrations irritate the mucous membranes and may cause nausea, dizziness, and headache after exposure.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
6.1. Sample Collection. The following items are needed for sample collection.
6.1.1 Probe. Teflon or Teflon-lined stainless steel. The probe must be heated to prevent moisture condensation. It must be designed to allow calibration gas to enter the probe at or near the sample point entry. Any portion of the probe that contacts the stack gas
must be heated to prevent moisture condensation. Figure 16-1 illustrates the probe used in lime kilns and other sources where significant amounts of particulate matter are present. The probe is designed with the deflector shield placed between the sample and the gas inlet holes to reduce clogging of the filter and possible adsorption of sample gas. As an alternative, the probe described in section 6.1.1 of Method 16A having a nozzle directed away from the gas stream may be used at sources having significant amounts of particulate matter.
6.1.2 Particulate Filter. 50-mm Teflon filter holder and a 1- to 2-micron porosity Teflon filter (available through Savillex Corporation, 5325 Highway 101, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55343). The filter holder must be maintained in a hot box at a temperature of at least 120 °C (248 °F).
6.1.3 SO
2
Scrubber. Three 300-ml Teflon segmented impingers connected in series with flexible, thick-walled, Teflon tubing. (Impinger parts and tubing available through Savillex.) The first two impingers contain 100 ml of citrate buffer and the third impinger is initially dry. The tip of the tube inserted into the solution should be constricted to less than 3 mm (
1/8
in.) ID and should be immersed to a depth of at least 5 cm (2 in.). Immerse the impingers in an ice water bath and maintain near 0 °C (32 °F). The scrubber solution will normally last for a 3-hour run before needing replacement. This will depend upon the effects of moisture and particulate matter on the solution strength and pH. Connections between the probe, particulate filter, and SO
2
scrubber must be made of Teflon and as short in length as possible. All portions of the probe, particulate filter, and connections prior to the SO
2
scrubber (or alternative point of moisture removal) must be maintained at a temperature of at least 120 °C (248 °F).
6.1.4 Sample Line. Teflon, no greater than 1.3 cm (
1/2
in.) ID. Alternative materials, such as virgin Nylon, may be used provided the line loss test is acceptable.
6.1.5 Sample Pump. The sample pump must be a leakless Teflon-coated diaphragm type or equivalent.
6.2 Analysis. The following items are needed for sample analysis:
6.2.1 Dilution System. Needed only for high sample concentrations. The dilution system must be constructed such that all sample contacts are made of Teflon, glass, or stainless steel.
6.2.2 Gas Chromatograph. The gas chromatograph must have at least the following components:
6.2.2.1 Oven. Capable of maintaining the separation column at the proper operating temperature ±1 °C (2 °F).
6.2.2.2 Temperature Gauge. To monitor column oven, detector, and exhaust temperature ±1 °C (2 °F).
6.2.2.3 Flow System. Gas metering system to measure sample, fuel, combustion gas, and carrier gas flows.
6.2.2.4 Flame Photometric Detector.
6.2.2.4.1 Electrometer. Capable of full scale amplification of linear ranges of 10
−9
to 10
−4
amperes full scale.
6.2.2.4.2 Power Supply. Capable of delivering up to 750 volts.
6.2.2.4.3 Recorder. Compatible with the output voltage range of the electrometer.
6.2.2.4.4 Rotary Gas Valves. Multiport Teflon-lined valves equipped with sample loop. Sample loop volumes must be chosen to provide the needed analytical range. Teflon tubing and fittings must be used throughout to present an inert surface for sample gas. The gas chromatograph must be calibrated with the sample loop used for sample analysis.
6.2.3 Gas Chromatogram Columns. The column system must be demonstrated to be capable of resolving the four major reduced sulfur compounds: H
2
S, MeSH, DMS, and DMDS. It must also demonstrate freedom from known interferences. To demonstrate that adequate resolution has been achieved, submit a chromatogram of a calibration gas containing all four of the TRS compounds in the concentration range of the applicable standard. Adequate resolution will be defined as base line separation of adjacent peaks when the amplifier attenuation is set so that the smaller peak is at least 50 percent of full scale. Baseline separation is defined as a return to zero ±5 percent in the interval between peaks. Systems not meeting this criteria may be considered alternate methods subject to the approval of the Administrator.
6.3 Calibration. A calibration system, containing the following components, is required (see Figure 16-2).
6.3.1 Tube Chamber. Chamber of glass or Teflon of sufficient dimensions to house permeation tubes.
6.3.2 Flow System. To measure air flow over permeation tubes at ±2 percent. Flow over the permeation device may also be determined using a soap bubble flowmeter.
6.3.3 Constant Temperature Bath. Device capable of maintaining the permeation tubes at the calibration temperature within 0.1 °C (0.2 °F).
6.3.4 Temperature Gauge. Thermometer or equivalent to monitor bath temperature within 1 °C (2 °F).

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards
7.1 Fuel. Hydrogen (H
2
), prepurified grade or better.
7.2 Combustion Gas. Oxygen (O
2
) or air, research purity or better.
7.3 Carrier Gas. Prepurified grade or better.
7.4 Diluent (if required). Air containing less than 50 ppb total sulfur compounds and less than 10 ppmv each of moisture and total hydrocarbons.
7.5 Calibration Gases
7.5.1 Permeation tubes, one each of H
2
S, MeSH, DMS, and DMDS, gravimetrically calibrated and certified at some convenient operating temperature. These tubes consist of hermetically sealed FEP Teflon tubing in which a liquified gaseous substance is enclosed. The enclosed gas permeates through the tubing wall at a constant rate. When the temperature is constant, calibration gases covering a wide range of known concentrations can be generated by varying and accurately measuring the flow rate of diluent gas passing over the tubes. These calibration gases are used to calibrate the GC/FPD system and the dilution system.
7.5.2 Cylinder Gases. Cylinder gases may be used as alternatives to permeation devices. The gases must be traceable to a primary standard (such as permeation tubes) and not used beyond the certification expiration date.
7.6 Citrate Buffer and Sample Line Loss Gas. Same as Method 15, sections 7.6 and 7.7.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
Same as Method 15, section 8.0, except that the references to the dilution system may not be applicable.

# 9.0 Quality Control
Section
Quality control measure
Effect
8.0
Sample line loss check
Ensures that uncorrected negative bias introduced by sample loss is no greater than 20 percent, and provides for correction of bias of 20 percent or less.
8.0
Calibration drift test
Ensures that bias introduced by drift in the measurement system output during the run is no greater than 5 percent.
10.0
Analytical calibration
Ensures precision of analytical results within 5 percent.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization
Same as Method 15, section 10.0, with the following addition and exceptions:
10.1 Use the four compounds that comprise TRS instead of the three reduced sulfur compounds measured by Method 15.
10.2 Flow Meter. Calibration before each test run is recommended, but not required; calibration following each test series is mandatory. Calibrate each flow meter after each complete test series with a wet-test meter. If the flow measuring device differs from the wet-test meter by 5 percent or more, the completed test runs must be voided. Alternatively, the flow data that yield the lower flow measurement may be used. Flow over the permeation device may also be determined using a soap bubble flowmeter.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedure
Sample collection and analysis are concurrent for this method (see section 8.0).

# 12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations
12.1 Concentration of Reduced Sulfur Compounds. Calculate the average concentration of each of the four analytes (
i.e.,
DMDS, DMS, H
2
S, and MeSH) over the sample run (specified in section 8.2 of Method 15 as 16 injections).

1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of TRS emissions from recovery boilers, lime kilns, and smelt dissolving tanks at kraft pulp mills, reduced sulfur compounds (H
2
S, carbonyl sulfide, and carbon disulfide) from sulfur recovery units at onshore natural gas processing facilities, and from other sources when specified in an applicable subpart of the regulations. The flue gas must contain at least 1 percent oxygen for complete oxidation of all TRS to SO
2
. Note: If sources other than kraft pulp mills experience low oxygen levels in the emissions, the method results may be biased low.
1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 An integrated gas sample is extracted from the stack. SO
2
is removed selectively from the sample using a citrate buffer solution. TRS compounds are then thermally oxidized to SO
2
, collected in hydrogen peroxide as sulfate, and analyzed by the Method 6 barium-thorin titration procedure.

# 3.0 Definitions
[Reserved]

# 4.0 Interferences
4.1 Reduced sulfur compounds other than those regulated by the emission standards, if present, may be measured by this method. Therefore, carbonyl sulfide, which is partially oxidized to SO
2
and may be present in a lime kiln exit stack, would be a positive interferant.
4.2 Particulate matter from the lime kiln stack gas (primarily calcium carbonate) can cause a negative bias if it is allowed to enter the citrate scrubber; the particulate matter will cause the pH to rise and H
2
S to be absorbed prior to oxidation. Furthermore, if the calcium carbonate enters the hydrogen peroxide impingers, the calcium will precipitate sulfate ion. Proper use of the particulate filter described in section 6.1.3 will eliminate this interference.

# 5.0 Safety
5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.
5.2 Corrosive reagents. The following reagents are hazardous. Personal protective equipment and safe procedures are useful in preventing chemical splashes. If contact occurs, immediately flush with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. Remove clothing under shower and decontaminate. Treat residual chemical burns as thermal burns.
5.2.1 Hydrogen Peroxide (H

). Irritating to eyes, skin, nose, and lungs.

5.2.3 Sulfuric Acid (H

will cause lung damage in uninitiated. 1 mg/m
3
for 8 hours will cause lung damage or, in higher concentrations, death. Provide ventilation to limit inhalation. Reacts violently with metals and organics.
5.3 Hydrogen Sulfide (H

2
S is extremely hazardous and can cause collapse, coma, and death within a few seconds of one or two inhalations at sufficient concentrations. Low concentrations irritate the mucous membranes and may cause nausea, dizziness, and headache after exposure.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
6.1 Sample Collection. The sampling train is shown in Figure 16A-1 and component parts are discussed below. Modifications to this sampling train are acceptable provided the system performance check is met (see section 8.5).
6.1.1 Probe. Teflon tubing, 6.4-mm (
1/4
-in.) diameter, sequentially wrapped with heat-resistant fiber strips, a rubberized heat tape
(plug at one end), and heat-resistant adhesive tape. A flexible thermocouple or other suitable temperature measuring device should be placed between the Teflon tubing and the fiber strips so that the temperature can be monitored to prevent softening of the probe. The probe should be sheathed in stainless steel to provide in-stack rigidity. A series of bored-out stainless steel fittings placed at the front of the sheath will prevent moisture and particulate from entering between the probe and sheath. A 6.4-mm (
1/4
-in.) Teflon elbow (bored out) should be attached to the inlet of the probe, and a 2.54 cm (1 in.) piece of Teflon tubing should be attached at the open end of the elbow to permit the opening of the probe to be turned away from the particulate stream; this will reduce the amount of particulate drawn into the sampling train. The probe is depicted in Figure 16A-2.
6.1.2 Probe Brush. Nylon bristle brush with handle inserted into a 3.2-mm (
1/8
-in.) Teflon tubing. The Teflon tubing should be long enough to pass the brush through the length of the probe.
6.1.3 Particulate Filter. 50-mm Teflon filter holder and a 1- to 2-µm porosity, Teflon filter (available through Savillex Corporation, 5325 Highway 101, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55343). The filter holder must be maintained in a hot box at a temperature sufficient to prevent moisture condensation. A temperature of 121 °C (250 °F) was found to be sufficient when testing a lime kiln under sub-freezing ambient conditions.
6.1.4 SO
2
Scrubber. Three 300-ml Teflon segmented impingers connected in series with flexible, thick-walled, Teflon tubing. (Impinger parts and tubing available through Savillex.) The first two impingers contain 100 ml of citrate buffer and the third impinger is initially dry. The tip of the tube inserted into the solution should be constricted to less than 3 mm (
1/8
-in.) ID and should be immersed to a depth of at least 5 cm (2 in.).
6.1.5 Combustion Tube. Quartz glass tubing with an expanded combustion chamber 2.54 cm (1 in.) in diameter and at least 30.5 cm (12 in.) long. The tube ends should have an outside diameter of 0.6 cm (
1/4
in.) and be at least 15.3 cm (6 in.) long. This length is necessary to maintain the quartz-glass connector near ambient temperature and thereby avoid leaks. Alternatively, the outlet may be constructed with a 90-degree glass elbow and socket that would fit directly onto the inlet of the first peroxide impinger.
6.1.6 Furnace. A furnace of sufficient size to enclose the combustion chamber of the combustion tube with a temperature regulator capable of maintaining the temperature at 800 ±100 °C (1472 ±180 °F). The furnace operating temperature should be checked with a thermocouple to ensure accuracy.
6.1.7 Peroxide Impingers, Stopcock Grease, Temperature Sensor, Drying Tube, Valve, Pump, and Barometer. Same as Method 6, sections 6.1.1.2, 6.1.1.4, 6.1.1.5, 6.1.1.6, 6.1.1.7, 6.1.1.8, and 6.1.2, respectively, except that the midget bubbler of Method 6, section 6.1.1.2 is not required.
6.1.8 Vacuum Gauge. At least 760 mm Hg (30 in. Hg) gauge.
6.1.9 Rate Meter. Rotameter, or equivalent, accurate to within 5 percent at the selected flow rate of approximately 2 liters/min (4.2 ft
3
/hr).
6.1.10 Volume Meter. Dry gas meter capable of measuring the sample volume under the sampling conditions of 2 liters/min (4.2 ft
3
/hr) with an accuracy of 2 percent.
6.2 Sample Recovery. Polyethylene Bottles, 250-ml (one per sample).
6.3 Sample Preparation and Analysis. Same as Method 6, section 6.3, except a 10-ml buret with 0.05-ml graduations is required, and the spectrophotometer is not needed.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards

# Note:
Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents must conform to the specifications established by the Committee on Analytical Reagents of the American Chemical Society. When such specifications are not available, the best available grade must be used.
7.1 Sample Collection. The following reagents are required for sample analysis:
7.1.1 Water. Same as in Method 6, section 7.1.1.
7.1.2 Citrate Buffer. Dissolve 300 g of potassium citrate (or 284 g of sodium citrate) and 41 g of anhydrous citric acid in 1 liter of water (200 ml is needed per test). Adjust the pH to between 5.4 and 5.6 with potassium citrate or citric acid, as required.
7.1.3 Hydrogen Peroxide, 3 percent. Same as in Method 6, section 7.1.3 (40 ml is needed per sample).
7.1.4 Recovery Check Gas. Hydrogen sulfide (100 ppmv or less) in nitrogen, stored in aluminum cylinders. Verify the concentration by Method 11 or by gas chromatography where the instrument is calibrated with an H
2
S permeation tube as described below. For Method 11, the relative standard deviation should not exceed 5 percent on at least three 20-minute runs.

# Note:
Alternatively, hydrogen sulfide recovery gas generated from a permeation device gravimetrically calibrated and certified at some convenient operating temperature may be used. The permeation rate of the device must be such that at a dilution gas flow rate of 3 liters/min (6.4 ft
3
/hr), an H
2
S concentration in the range of the stack gas or within 20 percent of the standard can be generated.
7.1.5 Combustion Gas. Gas containing less than 50 ppb reduced sulfur compounds and less than 10 ppmv total hydrocarbons. The
gas may be generated from a clean-air system that purifies ambient air and consists of the following components: Diaphragm pump, silica gel drying tube, activated charcoal tube, and flow rate measuring device. Flow from a compressed air cylinder is also acceptable.
7.2 Sample Recovery and Analysis. Same as Method 6, sections 7.2.1 and 7.3, respectively.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
8.1 Preparation of Sampling Train.
8.1.1 For the SO
2
scrubber, measure 100 ml of citrate buffer into the first and second impingers; leave the third impinger empty. Immerse the impingers in an ice bath, and locate them as close as possible to the filter heat box. The connecting tubing should be free of loops. Maintain the probe and filter temperatures sufficiently high to prevent moisture condensation, and monitor with a suitable temperature sensor.
8.1.2 For the Method 6 part of the train, measure 20 ml of 3 percent hydrogen peroxide into the first and second midget impingers. Leave the third midget impinger empty, and place silica gel in the fourth midget impinger. Alternatively, a silica gel drying tube may be used in place of the fourth impinger. Maintain the oxidation furnace at 800 ±100 °C (1472 ±180 °F). Place crushed ice and water around all impingers.
8.2 Citrate Scrubber Conditioning Procedure. Condition the citrate buffer scrubbing solution by pulling stack gas through the Teflon impingers and bypassing all other sampling train components. A purge rate of 2 liters/min for 10 minutes has been found to be sufficient to obtain equilibrium. After the citrate scrubber has been conditioned, assemble the sampling train, and conduct (optional) a leak-check as described in Method 6, section 8.2.
8.3 Sample Collection. Same as in Method 6, section 8.3, except the sampling rate is 2 liters/min (±10 percent) for 1 or 3 hours. After the sample is collected, remove the probe from the stack, and conduct (mandatory) a post-test leak-check as described in Method 6, section 8.2. The 15-minute purge of the train following collection should not be performed. After each 3-hour test run (or after three 1-hour samples), conduct one system performance check (see section 8.5) to determine the reduced sulfur recovery efficiency through the sampling train. After this system performance check and before the next test run, rinse and brush the probe with water, replace the filter, and change the citrate scrubber (optional but recommended).

# Note:
In Method 16, a test run is composed of 16 individual analyses (injects) performed over a period of not less than 3 hours or more than 6 hours. For Method 16A to be consistent with Method 16, the following may be used to obtain a test run: (1) collect three 60-minute samples or (2) collect one 3-hour sample. (Three test runs constitute a test.)
8.4 Sample Recovery. Disconnect the impingers. Quantitatively transfer the contents of the midget impingers of the Method 6 part of the train into a leak-free polyethylene bottle for shipment. Rinse the three midget impingers and the connecting tubes with water and add the washings to the same storage container. Mark the fluid level. Seal and identify the sample container.
8.5 System Performance Check.
8.5.1 A system performance check is done (1) to validate the sampling train components and procedure (prior to testing; optional) and (2) to validate a test run (after a run). Perform a check in the field prior to testing consisting of at least two samples (optional), and perform an additional check after each 3 hour run or after three 1-hour samples (mandatory).
8.5.2 The checks involve sampling a known concentration of H
2
S and comparing the analyzed concentration with the known concentration. Mix the H
2
S recovery check gas (Section 7.1.4) and combustion gas in a dilution system such as that shown in Figure 16A-3. Adjust the flow rates to generate an H
2
S concentration in the range of the stack gas or within 20 percent of the applicable standard and an oxygen concentration greater than 1 percent at a total flow rate of at least 2.5 liters/min (5.3 ft
3
/hr). Use Equation 16A-3 to calculate the concentration of recovery gas generated. Calibrate the flow rate from both sources with a soap bubble flow meter so that the diluted concentration of H
2
S can be accurately calculated.
8.5.3 Collect 30-minute samples, and analyze in the same manner as the emission samples. Collect the sample through the probe of the sampling train using a manifold or some other suitable device that will ensure extraction of a representative sample.
8.5.4 The recovery check must be performed in the field prior to replacing the SO
2
scrubber and particulate filter and before the probe is cleaned. Use Equation 16A-4 (see section 12.5) to calculate the recovery efficiency. Report the recovery efficiency with the emission data; do not correct the emission data for the recovery efficiency. A sample recovery of 100 ±20 percent must be obtained for the emission data to be valid. However, if the recovery efficiency is not in the 100 ±20 percent range but the results do not affect the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility, the Administrator may decide to accept the results of the compliance test.

16.7 Pre-test Procedures.
16.7.1 Selection of Gas Sample Volumes. This procedure has been validated for estimating the volume of cylinder gas sample needed when the H
2
S concentration is in the range of 5 to 1500 ppmv. The sample volume ranges were selected in order to ensure a 35 to 60 percent consumption of the 20 ml of 0.01 N iodine (thus ensuring a 0.01 N Na
2
S

O
3
titer of approximately 7 to 12 ml). The sample volumes for various H
2
S concentrations can be estimated by dividing the approximate ppm-liters desired for a given concentration range by the H
2
S concentration stated by the manufacturer. For example, for analyzing a cylinder gas containing approximately 10 ppmv H
2
S, the optimum sample volume is 65 liters (650 ppm-liters/10 ppmv). For analyzing a cylinder gas containing approximately 1000 ppmv H
2
S, the optimum sample volume is 1 liter (1000 ppm-liters/1000 ppmv).

16.7.4 Determination of Critical Orifice Approximate Flow Rate. Connect the critical orifice to the sampling system as shown in Figure 16A-4 but without the H
2
S cylinder. Connect a rotameter in the line to the first impinger. Turn on the pump, and adjust the
valve to give a reading of about half atmospheric pressure. Observe the rotameter reading. Slowly increase the vacuum until a stable flow rate is reached, and record this as the critical vacuum. The measured flow rate indicates the expected critical flow rate of the orifice. If this flow rate is in the range shown in section 16.7.2, proceed with the critical orifice calibration according to section 16.12.4.
16.7.5 Determination of Approximate Sampling Time. Determine the approximate sampling time for a cylinder of known concentration. Use the optimum sample volume obtained in section 16.7.1.
ER17oc00.288
16.8 Sample Collection.
16.8.1 Connect the Teflon tubing, Teflon tee, and rotameter to the flow control needle valve as shown in Figure 16A-4. Vent the rotameter to an exhaust hood. Plug the open end of the tee. Five to 10 minutes prior to sampling, open the cylinder valve while keeping the flow control needle valve closed. Adjust the delivery pressure to 20 psi. Open the needle valve slowly until the rotameter shows a flow rate approximately 50 to 100 ml above the flow rate of the critical orifice being used in the system.
16.8.2 Place 50 ml of zinc acetate solution in two of the impingers, connect them and the empty third impinger (dropout bottle) and the rest of the equipment as shown in Figure 16A-4. Make sure the ground-glass fittings are tight. The impingers can be easily stabilized by using a small cardboard box in which three holes have been cut, to act as a holder. Connect the Teflon sample line to the first impinger. Cover the impingers with a dark cloth or piece of plastic to protect the absorbing solution from light during sampling.
16.8.3 Record the temperature and barometric pressure. Note the gas flow rate through the rotameter. Open the closed end of the tee. Connect the sampling tube to the tee, ensuring a tight connection. Start the sampling pump and stopwatch simultaneously. Note the decrease in flow rate through the excess flow rotameter. This decrease should equal the known flow rate of the critical orifice being used. Continue sampling for the period determined in section 16.7.5.
16.8.4 When sampling is complete, turn off the pump and stopwatch. Disconnect the sampling line from the tee and plug it. Close the needle valve followed by the cylinder valve. Record the sampling time.
16.9 Blank Analysis. While the sample is being collected, run a blank as follows: To a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask, add 100 ml of zinc acetate solution, 20.0 ml of 0.01 N iodine solution, and 2 ml HCl solution. Titrate, while stirring, with 0.01 N Na
2
S
2
O
3
until the solution is light yellow. Add starch, and continue titrating until the blue color disappears. Analyze a blank with each sample, as the blank titer has been observed to change over the course of a day.

# Note:
Iodine titration of zinc acetate solutions is difficult to perform because the solution turns slightly white in color near the end point, and the disappearance of the blue color is hard to recognize. In addition, a blue color may reappear in the solution about 30 to 45 seconds after the titration endpoint is reached. This should not be taken to mean the original endpoint was in error. It is recommended that persons conducting this test perform several titrations to be able to correctly identify the endpoint. The importance of this should be recognized because the results of this analytical procedure are extremely sensitive to errors in titration.
16.10 Sample Analysis. Sample treatment is similar to the blank treatment. Before detaching the stems from the bottoms of the impingers, add 20.0 ml of 0.01 N iodine solution through the stems of the impingers holding the zinc acetate solution, dividing it between the two (add about 15 ml to the first impinger and the rest to the second). Add 2 ml HCl solution through the stems, dividing it as with the iodine. Disconnect the sampling line, and store the impingers for 30 minutes. At the end of 30 minutes, rinse the impinger stems into the impinger bottoms. Titrate the impinger contents with 0.01 N Na

S

. Do not transfer the contents of the impinger to a flask because this may result in a loss of iodine and cause a positive bias.
16.11 Post-test Orifice Calibration. Conduct a post-test critical orifice calibration run using the calibration procedures outlined in section 16.12.4. If the Q
std
obtained before and after the test differs by more than 5 percent, void the sample; if not, proceed to perform the calculations.

Repeat the titration until replicate values agree within 0.05 ml. Take the average volume to calculate the normality to three decimal figures using Equation 16A-6.

S cylinder and vent rotameter. Connect the soap bubble meter to the Teflon line that is connected to the first impinger. Turn on the pump, and adjust the needle valve until the vacuum is higher than the critical vacuum determined in section 16.7.4. Record the time required for gas flow to equal the soap bubble meter volume (use the 100-ml soap bubble meter for gas flow rates below 100 ml/min, otherwise use the 500-ml soap bubble meter). Make three runs, and record the data listed in Table 16A-1. Use these data to calculate the volumetric flow rate of the orifice.

Therefore, to obtain reliable results, persons using this method should have a knowledge of at least the following additional test methods: Method 6C, Method 16, and Method 16A.

1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for determining TRS emissions from recovery furnaces (boilers), lime kilns, and smelt dissolving tanks at kraft pulp mills, and from other sources when specified in an applicable subpart of the regulations. The flue gas must contain at least 1 percent oxygen for complete oxidation of all TRS to SO
2
.
1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 A gas sample is extracted from the stack. The SO
2
is removed selectively from the sample using a citrate buffer solution. The TRS compounds are then thermally oxidized to SO
2
and analyzed as SO
2
by gas chromatography (GC) using flame photometric detection (FPD).

# 3.0 Definitions
[Reserved]

# 4.0 Interferences
4.1 Reduced sulfur compounds other than those regulated by the emission standards, if present, may be measured by this method. Therefore, carbonyl sulfide, which is partially oxidized to SO
2
and may be present in a lime kiln exit stack, would be a positive interferant.
4.2 Particulate matter from the lime kiln stack gas (primarily calcium carbonate) can cause a negative bias if it is allowed to enter the citrate scrubber; the particulate matter will cause the pH to rise and H
2
S to be absorbed before oxidation. Proper use of the particulate filter, described in section 6.1.3 of Method 16A, will eliminate this interference.
4.3 Carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO
2
) have substantial desensitizing effects on the FPD even after dilution. Acceptable systems must demonstrate that they have eliminated this interference by some procedure such as eluting these compounds before the SO
2
. Compliance with this requirement can be demonstrated by submitting chromatograms of calibration gases with and without CO
2
in diluent gas. The CO
2
level should be approximately 10 percent for the case with CO
2
present. The two chromatograms should show agreement within the precision limits of section 13.0.

# 5.0 Safety
5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.
5.2 Hydrogen Sulfide (H
2
S). A flammable, poisonous gas with the odor of rotten eggs. H
2
S is extremely hazardous and can cause collapse, coma, and death within a few seconds of one or two inhalations at sufficient concentrations. Low concentrations irritate the mucous membranes and may cause nausea, dizziness, and headache after exposure.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
6.1 Sample Collection. The sampling train is shown in Figure 16B-1. Modifications to the apparatus are accepted provided the system performance check in section 8.3.1 is met.
6.1.1 Probe, Probe Brush, Particulate Filter, SO
2
Scrubber, Combustion Tube, and Furnace. Same as in Method 16A, sections 6.1.1 to 6.1.6.
6.1.2 Sampling Pump. Leakless Teflon-coated diaphragm type or equivalent.
6.2 Analysis.
6.2.1 Dilution System (optional), Gas Chromatograph, Oven, Temperature Gauges, Flow System, Flame Photometric Detector, Electrometer, Power Supply, Recorder, Calibration System, Tube Chamber, Flow System, and Constant Temperature Bath. Same as in Method 16, sections 6.2.1, 6.2.2, and 6.3.
6.2.2 Gas Chromatograph Columns. Same as in Method 16, section 6.2.3. Other columns with demonstrated ability to resolve SO
2
and be free from known interferences are acceptable alternatives. Single column systems such as a 7-ft Carbsorb B HT 100 column have been found satisfactory in resolving SO
2
from CO
2
.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards
Same as in Method 16, section 7.0, except for the following:
7.1 Calibration Gas. SO
2
permeation tube gravimetrically calibrated and certified at some convenient operating temperature. These tubes consist of hermetically sealed FEP Teflon tubing in which a liquefied gaseous substance is enclosed. The enclosed gas permeates through the tubing wall at a constant rate. When the temperature is constant, calibration gases covering a wide range of known concentrations can be generated by varying and accurately measuring the flow rate of diluent gas passing over the tubes. In place of SO
2
permeation tubes, cylinder gases containing SO
2
in nitrogen may be used for calibration. The cylinder gas concentration must be verified according to section 8.2.1 of Method 6C. The calibration gas is used to calibrate the GC/FPD system and the dilution system.
7.2 Recovery Check Gas.
7.2.1 Hydrogen sulfide [100 parts per million by volume (ppmv) or less] in nitrogen, stored in aluminum cylinders. Verify the concentration by Method 11, the procedure discussed in section 16.0 of Method 16A, or gas chromatography where the instrument is calibrated with an H
2
S permeation tube as described below. For the wet-chemical methods, the standard deviation should not exceed 5 percent on at least three 20-minute runs.
7.2.2 Hydrogen sulfide recovery gas generated from a permeation device gravimetrically calibrated and certified at some convenient operation temperature may be used. The permeation rate of the device must be such that at a dilution gas flow rate of 3 liters/min (64 ft
3
/hr), an H
2
S concentration in the range of the stack gas or within 20 percent of the emission standard can be generated.
7.3 Combustion Gas. Gas containing less than 50 ppbv reduced sulfur compounds and less than 10 ppmv total hydrocarbons. The gas may be generated from a clean-air system that purifies ambient air and consists of the following components: diaphragm pump, silica gel drying tube, activated charcoal tube, and flow rate measuring device. Gas from a compressed air cylinder is also acceptable.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
8.1 Pretest Procedures. Same as in Method 15, section 8.1.
8.2 Sample Collection. Before any source sampling is performed, conduct a system performance check as detailed in section 8.3.1 to validate the sampling train components and procedures. Although this test is optional, it would significantly reduce the possibility of rejecting tests as a result of failing the post-test performance check. At the completion of the pretest system performance check, insert the sampling probe into the test port making certain that no dilution air enters the stack though the port. Condition the entire system with sample for a minimum of 15 minutes before beginning analysis. If the sample is diluted, determine the dilution factor as in section 10.4 of Method 15.
8.3. Post-Test Procedures
8.3.1 System Performance Check. Same as in Method 16A, section 8.5. A sufficient number of sample injections should be made so that the precision requirements of section 13.2 are satisfied.

# 13.0 Method Performance.
13.1 Range and Sensitivity. Coupled with a GC using a 1-ml sample size, the maximum limit of the FPD for SO
2
is approximately 10 ppmv. This limit is extended by diluting the sample gas before analysis or by reducing the sample aliquot size. For sources with emission levels between 10 and 100 ppm, the measuring range can be best extended by reducing the sample size.
13.2 GC/FPD Calibration and Precision. A series of three consecutive injections of the sample calibration gas, at any dilution, must produce results which do not vary by more than 5 percent from the mean of the three injections.
13.3 Calibration Drift. The calibration drift determined from the mean of the three injections made at the beginning and end of any run or series of runs within a 24-hour period must not exceed 5 percent.
13.4 System Calibration Accuracy. Losses through the sample transport system must be measured and a correction factor developed to adjust the calibration accuracy to 100 percent.
13.5 Field tests between this method and Method 16A showed an average difference of less than 4.0 percent. This difference was not determined to be significant.

# Method 16C—Determination of Total Reduced Sulfur Emissions From Stationary Sources

# 1.0 Scope and Application

# What is Method 16C?
Method 16C is a procedure for measuring total reduced sulfur (TRS) in stationary source emissions using a continuous instrumental analyzer. Quality assurance and quality control requirements are included to assure that you, the tester, collect data of known quality. You must document your adherence to these specific requirements for equipment, supplies, sample collection and analysis, calculations, and data analysis. This method does not completely describe all equipment, supplies, and sampling and analytical procedures you will need but refers to
other methods for some of the details. Therefore, to obtain reliable results, you should also have a thorough knowledge of these additional test methods which are found in appendix A to this part:
(a) Method 6C—Determination of Sulfur Dioxide Emissions from Stationary Sources (Instrumental Analyzer Procedure)
(b) Method 7E—Determination of Nitrogen Oxides Emissions from Stationary Sources (Instrumental Analyzer Procedure)

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 An integrated gas sample is extracted from the stack. The SO
2
is removed selectively from the sample using a citrate buffer solution. The TRS compounds are then thermally oxidized to SO
2
and determined as SO
2
by an instrumental analyzer. This method is a combination of the sampling procedures of Method 16A and the analytical procedures of Method 6C (referenced in Method 7E), with minor modifications to facilitate their use together.

and
Test
are the same as used in Methods 16A and 6C.

# 4.0 Interferences
4.1 Reduced sulfur compounds other than those defined as TRS, if present, may be measured by this method. Compounds like carbonyl sulfide, which is partially oxidized to SO
2
and may be present in a lime kiln exit stack, would be a positive interferent. Interferences may vary among instruments, and instrument-specific interferences must be evaluated through the interference check.
4.2 Particulate matter from the lime kiln stack gas (primarily calcium carbonate) can cause a negative bias if it is allowed to enter the citrate scrubber; the particulate matter will cause the pH to rise and H
2
S to be absorbed before oxidation. Proper use of the particulate filter, described in section 6.1.3 of Method 16A, will eliminate this interference.

# 5.0 Safety
5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices before performing this test method.
5.2 Hydrogen Sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide is a flammable, poisonous gas with the odor of rotten eggs. Hydrogen sulfide is extremely hazardous and can cause collapse, coma, and death within a few seconds of one or two inhalations at sufficient concentrations. Low concentrations irritate the mucous membranes and may cause nausea, dizziness, and headache after exposure. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies

# What do I need for the measurement system?
The measurement system is similar to those applicable components in Methods 16A and 6C. Modifications to the apparatus are accepted provided the performance criteria in section 13.0 are met.
6.1 Probe. Teflon tubing, 6.4-mm (
1/4
in.) diameter, sequentially wrapped with heat-resistant fiber strips, a rubberized heat tape (plug at one end), and heat-resistant adhesive tape. A flexible thermocouple or other suitable temperature measuring device must be placed between the Teflon tubing and the fiber strips so that the temperature can be monitored to prevent softening of the probe. The probe must be sheathed in stainless steel to provide in-stack rigidity. A series of bored-out stainless steel fittings placed at the front of the sheath will prevent moisture and particulate from entering between the probe and sheath. A 6.4-mm (
1/4
in.) Teflon elbow (bored out) must be attached to the inlet of the probe, and a 2.54 cm (1 in.) piece of Teflon tubing must be attached at the open end of the elbow to permit the opening of the probe to be turned away from the particulate stream; this will reduce the amount of particulate drawn into the sampling train. The probe is depicted in Figure 16A-2 of Method 16A.
6.2 Probe Brush. Nylon bristle brush with handle inserted into a 3.2-mm (
1/8
in.) Teflon
tubing. The Teflon tubing should be long enough to pass the brush through the length of the probe.
6.3 Particulate Filter. 50-mm Teflon filter holder and a 1- to 2-µm porosity, Teflon filter (may be available through Savillex Corporation, 5325 Highway 101, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55343, or other suppliers of filters). The filter holder must be maintained in a hot box at a temperature sufficient to prevent moisture condensation. A temperature of 121 °C (250 °F) was found to be sufficient when testing a lime kiln under sub-freezing ambient conditions.
6.4 SO
2
Scrubber. Three 300-ml Teflon segmented impingers connected in series with flexible, thick-walled, Teflon tubing. (Impinger parts and tubing may be available through Savillex or other suppliers.) The first two impingers contain 100 ml of citrate buffer, and the third impinger is initially dry. The tip of the tube inserted into the solution should be constricted to less than 3 mm (
1/8
in.) ID and should be immersed to a depth of at least 5 cm (2 in.).
6.5 Combustion Tube. Quartz glass tubing with an expanded combustion chamber 2.54 cm (1 in.) in diameter and at least 30.5 cm (12 in.) long. The tube ends should have an outside diameter of 0.6 cm (
1/4
in.) and be at least 15.3 cm (6 in.) long. This length is necessary to maintain the quartz-glass connector near ambient temperature and thereby avoid leaks. Alternative combustion tubes are acceptable provided they are shown to combust TRS at concentrations encountered during tests.
6.6 Furnace. A furnace of sufficient size to enclose the combustion chamber of the combustion tube with a temperature regulator capable of maintaining the temperature at 800 ±100 °C (1472 ±180 °F). The furnace operating temperature should be checked with a thermocouple to ensure accuracy.
6.7 Sampling Pump. A leak-free pump is required to pull the sample gas through the system at a flow rate sufficient to minimize the response time of the measurement system and must be constructed of material that is non-reactive to the gas it contacts. For dilution-type measurement systems, an eductor pump may be used to create a vacuum that draws the sample through a critical orifice at a constant rate.
6.8 Calibration Gas Manifold. The calibration gas manifold must allow the introduction of calibration gases either directly to the gas analyzer in direct calibration mode or into the measurement system, at the probe, in system calibration mode, or both, depending upon the type of system used. In system calibration mode, the system must be able to flood the sampling probe and vent excess gas. Alternatively, calibration gases may be introduced at the calibration valve following the probe. Maintain a constant pressure in the gas manifold. For in-stack dilution-type systems, a gas dilution subsystem is required to transport large volumes of purified air to the sample probe, and a probe controller is needed to maintain the proper dilution ratio.
6.9 Sample Gas Manifold. The sample gas manifold diverts a portion of the sample to the analyzer, delivering the remainder to the by-pass discharge vent. The manifold should also be able to introduce calibration gases directly to the analyzer. The manifold must be made of material that is non-reactive to SO
2
and be configured to safely discharge the bypass gas.
6.10 SO
2
Analyzer. You must use an instrument that uses an ultraviolet, non-dispersive infrared, fluorescence, or other detection principle to continuously measure SO
2
in the gas stream provided it meets the performance specifications in section 13.0.
6.11 Data Recording. A strip chart recorder, computerized data acquisition system, digital recorder, or data logger for recording measurement data must be used.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards

# Note:
Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents must conform to the specifications established by the Committee on Analytical Reagents of the American Chemical Society. When such specifications are not available, the best available grade must be used.
7.1 Water. Deionized distilled water must conform to ASTM Specification D 1193-77 or 91 Type 3 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17). The KMnO
4
test for oxidizable organic matter may be omitted when high concentrations of organic matter are not expected to be present.
7.2 Citrate Buffer. Dissolve 300 g of potassium citrate (or 284 g of sodium citrate) and 41 g of anhydrous citric acid in 1 liter of water (200 ml is needed per test). Adjust the pH to between 5.4 and 5.6 with potassium citrate or citric acid, as required.
7.3 Calibration Gas. Refer to section 7.1 of Method 7E (as applicable) for the calibration gas requirements. Example calibration gas mixtures are listed below.
(a) SO
2
in nitrogen (N
2
).
(b) SO
2
in air.
(c) SO
2
and carbon dioxide (CO

For fluorescence-based analyzers, the O
2
and CO
2
concentrations of the calibration gases as introduced to the analyzer must be within 1.0 percent (absolute) O
2
and 1.0 percent (absolute) CO
2
of the O
2
and CO
2
concentrations of the effluent samples as introduced to the analyzer. Alternatively, for fluorescence-based analyzers, use calibration blends of SO
2
in air and the nomographs provided by
the vendor to determine the quenching correction factor (the effluent O
2
and CO
2
concentrations must be known). This requirement does not apply to ambient-level fluorescence analyzers that are used in conjunction with sample dilution systems. Alternatively, H
2
S in O
2
or air may be used to calibrate the analyzer through the tube furnace.
7.4 System Performance Check Gas. You must use H
2
S (100 ppmv or less) stored in aluminum cylinders with the concentration certified by the manufacturer. Hydrogen sulfide in nitrogen is more stable than H
2
S in air, but air may be used as the balance gas.

# Note:
Alternatively, H
2
S recovery gas generated from a permeation device gravimetrically calibrated and certified at some convenient operating temperature may be used. The permeation rate of the device must be such that at the appropriate dilution gas flow rate, an H
2
S concentration can be generated in the range of the stack gas or within 20 percent of the emission standard.
7.5 Interference Check. Examples of test gases for the interference check are listed in Table 7E-3 of Method 7E.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
8.1 Pre-sampling Tests. Before measuring emissions, perform the following procedures:
(a) Calibration gas verification,
(b) Calibration error test,
(c) System performance check,
(d) Verification that the interference check has been satisfied.
8.1.1 Calibration Gas Verification. Obtain a certificate from the gas manufacturer documenting the quality of the gas. Confirm that the manufacturer certification is complete and current. Ensure that your calibration gas certifications have not expired. This documentation should be available on-site for inspection. To the extent practicable, select a high-level gas concentration that will result in the measured emissions being between 20 and 100 percent of the calibration span.
8.1.2 Analyzer Calibration Error Test. After you have assembled, prepared, and calibrated your sampling system and analyzer, you must conduct a 3-point analyzer calibration error test before the first run and again after any failed system performance check or failed drift test to ensure the calibration is acceptable. Introduce the low-, mid-, and high-level calibration gases sequentially to the analyzer in direct calibration mode. For each calibration gas, calculate the analyzer calibration error using Equation 16C-1 in section 12.2. The calibration error for the low-, mid-, and high-level gases must not exceed 5.0 percent or 0.5 ppmv. If the calibration error specification is not met, take corrective action and repeat the test until an acceptable 3-point calibration is achieved.
8.1.3 System Performance Check. A system performance check is done (1) to validate the sampling train components and procedure (prior to testing), and (2) to validate a test run (after a run). You must conduct a performance check in the field prior to testing, and after each 3-hour run or after three 1-hour runs. A performance check consists of sampling and analyzing a known concentration of H
2
S (system performance check gas) and comparing the analyzed concentration to the known concentration. To conduct the system performance check, mix the system performance check gas (Section 7.4) and ambient air, that has been conditioned to remove moisture and sulfur-containing gases, in a dilution system such as that shown in Figure 16A-3 of Method 16A. Alternatively, ultra-high purity (UHP) grade air may be used. Adjust the gas flow rates to generate an H
2
S concentration in the range of the stack gas or within 20 percent of the applicable standard and an oxygen concentration greater than 1 percent at a total flow rate of at least 2.5 liters/min (5.3 ft3/hr). Use Equation 16A-3 from Method 16A to calculate the concentration of system performance check gas generated. Calibrate the flow rate from both gas sources with a soap bubble flow meter so that the diluted concentration of H
2
S can be accurately calculated. Alternatively, mass flow controllers with documented calibrations may be used if UHP grade air is being used. Sample duration should be sufficiently long to ensure a stable response from the analyzer. Analyze in the same manner as the emission samples. Collect the sample through the probe of the sampling train using a manifold or other suitable device that will ensure extraction of a representative sample. The TRS sample concentration measured between system performance checks is corrected by the average of the pre- and post-system performance checks.
8.1.4 Interference Check. Same as in Method 7E, section 8.2.7.
8.2 Measurement System Preparation.
8.2.1 For the SO
2
scrubber, measure 100 ml of citrate buffer into the first and second impingers; leave the third impinger empty. Immerse the impingers in an ice bath, and locate them as close as possible to the filter heat box. The connecting tubing should be free of loops. Maintain the probe and filter temperatures sufficiently high to prevent moisture condensation, and monitor with a suitable temperature sensor. Prepare the oxidation furnace and maintain at 800 ±100 °C (1472 ±180 °F).
8.2.2 Citrate Scrubber Conditioning Procedure. Condition the citrate buffer scrubbing solution by pulling stack gas through the Teflon impingers as described in section 8.4.1.
8.3 Pretest Procedures. After the complete measurement system has been set up at the site and deemed to be operational, the following procedures must be completed before sampling is initiated.
8.3.1 Leak-Check. Appropriate leak-check procedures must be employed to verify the integrity of all components, sample lines, and connections. For components upstream of the sample pump, attach the probe end of the sample line to a manometer or vacuum gauge, start the pump and pull a vacuum greater than 50 mm (2 in.) Hg, close off the pump outlet, and then stop the pump and ascertain that there is no leak for 1 minute. For components after the pump, apply a slight positive pressure and check for leaks by applying a liquid (detergent in water, for example) at each joint. Bubbling indicates the presence of a leak.
8.3.2 Initial System Performance Check. A system performance check using the test gas (Section 7.4) is performed prior to testing to validate the sampling train components and procedure.
8.4 Sample Collection and Analysis.
8.4.1 After performing the required pretest procedures described in section 8.1, insert the sampling probe into the test port ensuring that no dilution air enters the stack through the port. Condition the sampling system and citrate buffer solution for a minimum of 15 minutes before beginning analysis. Begin sampling and analysis. A source test consists of three test runs. A test run shall consist of a single sample collected over a 3-hour period or three separate 1-hour samples collected over a period not to exceed six hours.
8.5 Post-Run Evaluations.
8.5.1 System Performance Check. Perform a post-run system performance check before replacing the citrate buffer solution and particulate filter and before the probe is cleaned. The check results must not exceed the 100 ±20 percent limit set forth in section 13.2. If this limit is exceeded, the intervening run is considered invalid. However, if the recovery efficiency is not in the 100 ±20 percent range, but the results do not affect the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility, the Administrator may decide to accept the results of the compliance test.
8.5.2 Calibration Drift. After a run or series of runs, not to exceed a 24-hour period after initial calibration, perform a calibration drift test using a calibration gas (preferably the level that best approximates the sample concentration) in direct calibration mode. This drift must not differ from the initial calibration error percent by more than 3.0 percent or 0.5 ppm. If the drift exceeds this limit, the intervening run or runs are considered valid, but a new analyzer calibration error test must be performed and passed before continuing sampling.

# Method 17—Determination of Particulate Matter Emissions From Stationary Sources

# Note:
This method does not include all of the specifications (
e.g.,
equipment and supplies) and procedures (
e.g.,
sampling and analytical) essential to its performance. Some material is incorporated by reference from other methods in this part. Therefore, to obtain reliable results, persons using this method should have a thorough knowledge of at least the following additional test methods: Method 1, Method 2, Method 3, Method 5.

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1 Analyte. Particulate matter (PM). No CAS number assigned.

# Note:
Particulate matter is not an absolute quantity. It is a function of temperature and pressure. Therefore, to prevent variability in PM emission regulations and/or associated test methods, the temperature and pressure at which PM is to be measured must be carefully defined. Of the two variables (
i.e.,
temperature and pressure), temperature has the greater effect upon the amount of PM in an effluent gas stream; in most stationary source categories, the effect of pressure appears to be negligible. In Method 5, 120 °C (248 °F) is established as a nominal reference temperature. Thus, where Method 5 is specified in an applicable subpart of the standard, PM is defined with respect to temperature. In order to maintain a collection temperature of 120 °C (248 °F), Method 5 employs a heated glass sample probe and a heated filter holder. This equipment is somewhat cumbersome and requires care in its operation. Therefore, where PM concentrations (over the normal range of temperature associated with a specified source category) are known to be independent of temperature, it is desirable to eliminate the glass probe and the heating systems, and to sample at stack temperature.
1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of PM emissions, where PM concentrations are known to be independent of temperature over the normal range of temperatures characteristic of emissions from a specified source category. It is intended to be used only when specified by an applicable subpart of the standards, and only within the applicable temperature limits (if specified), or when otherwise approved by the Administrator. This method is not applicable to stacks that contain liquid droplets or are saturated with water vapor. In addition, this method shall not be used as written if the projected cross-sectional area of the probe extension-filter holder assembly covers more than 5 percent of the stack cross-sectional area (see section 8.1.2).
1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 Particulate matter is withdrawn isokinetically from the source and collected on a glass fiber filter maintained at stack temperature. The PM mass is determined gravimetrically after the removal of uncombined water.

# 3.0 Definitions

# 5.0 Safety
5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
6.1 Sampling Train. A schematic of the sampling train used in this method is shown in Figure 17-1. The sampling train components and operation and maintenance are very similar to Method 5, which should be consulted for details.
6.1.1 Probe Nozzle, Differential Pressure Gauge, Metering System, Barometer, Gas Density Determination Equipment. Same as in Method 5, sections 6.1.1, 6.1.4, 6.1.8, 6.1.9, and 6.1.10, respectively.
6.1.2 Filter Holder. The in-stack filter holder shall be constructed of borosilicate or quartz glass, or stainless steel. If a gasket is used, it shall be made of silicone rubber, Teflon, or stainless steel. Other holder and gasket materials may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. The filter holder shall be designed to provide a positive seal against leakage from the outside or around the filter.
6.1.3 Probe Extension. Any suitable rigid probe extension may be used after the filter holder.
6.1.4 Pitot Tube. Same as in Method 5, section 6.1.3.
6.1.4.1 It is recommended (1) that the pitot tube have a known baseline coefficient, determined as outlined in section 10 of Method 2; and (2) that this known coefficient be preserved by placing the pitot tube in an interference-free arrangement with respect to the sampling nozzle, filter holder, and temperature sensor (see Figure 17-1). Note that the 1.9 cm (
3/4
-in.) free-space between the nozzle and pitot tube shown in Figure 17-1, is based
on a 1.3 cm (
1/2
-in.) ID nozzle. If the sampling train is designed for sampling at higher flow rates than that described in APTD-0581, thus necessitating the use of larger sized nozzles, the free-space shall be 1.9 cm (
3/4
-in.) with the largest sized nozzle in place.
6.1.4.2 Source-sampling assemblies that do not meet the minimum spacing requirements of Figure 17-1 (or the equivalent of these requirements,
e.g.,
Figure 2-4 of Method 2) may be used; however, the pitot tube coefficients of such assemblies shall be determined by calibration, using methods subject to the approval of the Administrator.
6.1.5 Condenser. It is recommended that the impinger system or alternatives described in Method 5 be used to determine the moisture content of the stack gas. Flexible tubing may be used between the probe extension and condenser. Long tubing lengths may affect the moisture determination.
6.2 Sample Recovery. Probe-liner and probe-nozzle brushes, wash bottles, glass sample storage containers, petri dishes, graduated cylinder and/or balance, plastic storage containers, funnel and rubber policeman, funnel. Same as in Method 5, sections 6.2.1 through 6.2.8, respectively.
6.3 Sample Analysis. Glass weighing dishes, desiccator, analytical balance, balance, beakers, hygrometer, temperature sensor. Same as in Method 5, sections 6.3.1 through 6.3.7, respectively.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards
7.1 Sampling. Filters, silica gel, water, crushed ice, stopcock grease. Same as in Method 5, sections 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 7.1.3, 7.1.4, and 7.1.5, respectively. Thimble glass fiber filters may also be used.
7.2 Sample Recovery. Acetone (reagent grade). Same as in Method 5, section 7.2.
7.3 Sample Analysis. Acetone and Desiccant. Same as in Method 5, sections 7.3.1 and 7.3.2, respectively.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
8.1 Sampling.
8.1.1 Pretest Preparation. Same as in Method 5, section 8.1.1.
8.1.2 Preliminary Determinations. Same as in Method 5, section 8.1.2, except as follows: Make a projected-area model of the probe extension-filter holder assembly, with the pitot tube face openings positioned along the centerline of the stack, as shown in Figure 17-2. Calculate the estimated cross-section blockage, as shown in Figure 17-2. If the blockage exceeds 5 percent of the duct cross sectional area, the tester has the following options exist: (1) a suitable out-of-stack filtration method may be used instead of in-stack filtration; or (2) a special in-stack arrangement, in which the sampling and velocity measurement sites are separate, may be used; for details concerning this approach, consult with the Administrator (see also Reference 1 in section 17.0). Select a probe extension length such that all traverse points can be sampled. For large stacks, consider sampling from opposite sides of the stack to reduce the length of probes.
8.1.3 Preparation of Sampling Train. Same as in Method 5, section 8.1.3, except the following: Using a tweezer or clean disposable surgical gloves, place a labeled (identified) and weighed filter in the filter holder. Be sure that the filter is properly centered and the gasket properly placed so as not to allow the sample gas stream to circumvent the filter. Check filter for tears after assembly is completed. Mark the probe extension with heat resistant tape or by some other method to denote the proper distance into the stack or duct for each sampling point. Assemble the train as in Figure 17-1, using a very light coat of silicone grease on all ground glass joints and greasing only the outer portion (see APTD-0576) to avoid possibility of contamination by the silicone grease. Place crushed ice around the impingers.
8.1.4 Leak-Check Procedures. Same as in Method 5, section 8.1.4, except that the filter holder is inserted into the stack during the sampling train leak-check. To do this, plug the inlet to the probe nozzle with a material that will be able to withstand the stack temperature. Insert the filter holder into the stack and wait approximately 5 minutes (or longer, if necessary) to allow the system to come to equilibrium with the temperature of the stack gas stream.
8.1.5 Sampling Train Operation. The operation is the same as in Method 5. Use a data sheet such as the one shown in Figure 5-3 of Method 5, except that the filter holder temperature is not recorded.
8.1.6 Calculation of Percent Isokinetic. Same as in Method 5, section 12.11.
8.2 Sample Recovery.
8.2.1 Proper cleanup procedure begins as soon as the probe extension assembly is removed from the stack at the end of the sampling period. Allow the assembly to cool.
8.2.2 When the assembly can be safely handled, wipe off all external particulate matter near the tip of the probe nozzle and place a cap over it to prevent losing or gaining particulate matter. Do not cap off the probe tip tightly while the sampling train is cooling down as this would create a vacuum in the filter holder, forcing condenser water backward.
8.2.3 Before moving the sample train to the cleanup site, disconnect the filter holder-probe nozzle assembly from the probe extension; cap the open inlet of the probe extension. Be careful not to lose any condensate, if present. Remove the umbilical cord from the condenser outlet and cap the outlet. If a
flexible line is used between the first impinger (or condenser) and the probe extension, disconnect the line at the probe extension and let any condensed water or liquid drain into the impingers or condenser. Disconnect the probe extension from the condenser; cap the probe extension outlet. After wiping off the silicone grease, cap off the condenser inlet. Ground glass stoppers, plastic caps, or serum caps (whichever are appropriate) may be used to close these openings.
8.2.4 Transfer both the filter holder-probe nozzle assembly and the condenser to the cleanup area. This area should be clean and protected from the wind so that the chances of contaminating or losing the sample will be minimized.
8.2.5 Save a portion of the acetone used for cleanup as a blank. Take 200 ml of this acetone from the wash bottle being used and place it in a glass sample container labeled “acetone blank.” Inspect the train prior to and during disassembly and not any abnormal conditions. Treat the sample as discussed in Method 5, section 8.2.

# Method 18—Measurement of Gaseous Organic Compound Emissions By Gas Chromatography

# Note:
This method is not inclusive with respect to specifications (
e.g.,
equipment and supplies) and procedures (
e.g.,
sampling and analytical) essential to its performance. Some material is incorporated by reference from other methods in this part. Therefore, to obtain reliable results, persons using this method should have a thorough knowledge of at least the following additional test methods: Method 1, Method 2, Method 3.

# Note:
This method should not be attempted by persons unfamiliar with the performance characteristics of gas chromatography, nor by those persons who are unfamiliar with source sampling. Particular care
should be exercised in the area of safety concerning choice of equipment and operation in potentially explosive atmospheres.

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1 Analyte. Total gaseous organic compounds.
1.2 Applicability.
1.2.1 This method is designed to measure gaseous organics emitted from an industrial source. While designed for ppm level sources, some detectors are quite capable of detecting compounds at ambient levels,
e.g.,
ECD, ELCD, and helium ionization detectors. Some other types of detectors are evolving such that the sensitivity and applicability may well be in the ppb range in only a few years.
1.2.2 This method will not determine compounds that (1) are polymeric (high molecular weight), (2) can polymerize before analysis, or (3) have very low vapor pressures at stack or instrument conditions.
1.3 Range. The lower range of this method is determined by the sampling system; adsorbents may be used to concentrate the sample, thus lowering the limit of detection below the 1 part per million (ppm) typically achievable with direct interface or bag sampling. The upper limit is governed by GC detector saturation or column overloading; the upper range can be extended by dilution of sample with an inert gas or by using smaller volume gas sampling loops. The upper limit can also be governed by condensation of higher boiling compounds.
1.4 Sensitivity. The sensitivity limit for a compound is defined as the minimum detectable concentration of that compound, or the concentration that produces a signal-to-noise ratio of three to one. The minimum detectable concentration is determined during the presurvey calibration for each compound.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
The major organic components of a gas mixture are separated by gas chromatography (GC) and individually quantified by flame ionization, photoionization, electron capture, or other appropriate detection principles. The retention times of each separated component are compared with those of known compounds under identical conditions. Therefore, the analyst confirms the identity and approximate concentrations of the organic emission components beforehand. With this information, the analyst then prepares or purchases commercially available standard mixtures to calibrate the GC under conditions identical to those of the samples. The analyst also determines the need for sample dilution to avoid detector saturation, gas stream filtration to eliminate particulate matter, and prevention of moisture condensation.

# 3.0 Definitions
[Reserved]

# 4.0 Interferences
4.1 Resolution interferences that may occur can be eliminated by appropriate GC column and detector choice or by shifting the retention times through changes in the column flow rate and the use of temperature programming.
4.2 The analytical system is demonstrated to be essentially free from contaminants by periodically analyzing blanks that consist of hydrocarbon-free air or nitrogen.
4.3 Sample cross-contamination that occurs when high-level and low-level samples or standards are analyzed alternately is best dealt with by thorough purging of the GC sample loop between samples.
4.4 To assure consistent detector response, calibration gases are contained in dry air. To adjust gaseous organic concentrations when water vapor is present in the sample, water vapor concentrations are determined for those samples, and a correction factor is applied.
4.5 The gas chromatograph run time must be sufficient to clear all eluting peaks from the column before proceeding to the next run (in order to prevent sample carryover).

# 5.0 Safety
5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.

8.2 Final Sampling and Analysis Procedure. Considering safety (flame hazards) and the source conditions, select an appropriate sampling and analysis procedure (Section 8.2.1, 8.2.2, 8.2.3 or 8.2.4). In situations where a hydrogen flame is a hazard and no intrinsically safe GC is suitable, use the flexible bag collection technique or an adsorption technique.
8.2.1 Integrated Bag Sampling and Analysis.
8.2.1.1 Evacuated Container Sampling Procedure. In this procedure, the bags are filled by evacuating the rigid air-tight container holding the bags. Use a field sample data sheet as shown in Figure 18-10. Collect triplicate samples from each sample location.
8.2.1.1.1 Apparatus.
8.2.1.1.1.1 Probe. Stainless steel, Pyrex glass, or Teflon tubing probe, according to the duct temperature, with Teflon tubing of sufficient length to connect to the sample bag. Use stainless steel or Teflon unions to connect probe and sample line.
8.2.1.1.1.2 Quick Connects. Male (2) and female (2) of stainless steel construction.
8.2.1.1.1.3 Needle Valve. To control gas flow.
8.2.1.1.1.4 Pump. Leakless Teflon-coated diaphragm-type pump or equivalent. To deliver at least 1 liter/min.
8.2.1.1.1.5 Charcoal Adsorption Tube. Tube filled with activated charcoal, with glass wool plugs at each end, to adsorb organic vapors.
8.2.1.1.1.6 Flowmeter. 0 to 500-ml flow range; with manufacturer's calibration curve.
8.2.1.1.2 Sampling Procedure. To obtain a sample, assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 18-9. Leak-check both the bag and the container. Connect the vacuum line from the needle valve to the Teflon sample line from the probe. Place the end of the probe at the centroid of the stack or at a point no closer to the walls than 1 in., and start the pump. Set the flow rate so that the final volume of the sample is approximately 80 percent of the bag capacity. After allowing sufficient time to purge the line several times, connect the vacuum line to the bag, and evacuate until the rotameter indicates no flow. Then position the sample and vacuum lines for sampling, and begin the actual sampling, keeping the rate proportional to the stack velocity. As a precaution, direct the gas exiting the rotameter away from sampling personnel. At the end of the sample period, shut off the pump, disconnect the sample line from the bag, and disconnect the vacuum line from the bag container. Record the source temperature, barometric pressure, ambient temperature, sampling flow rate, and initial and final sampling time on the data sheet shown in Figure 18-10. Protect the bag and its container from sunlight. Record the time lapsed between sample collection and analysis, and then conduct the recovery procedure in Section 8.4.2.
8.2.1.2 Direct Pump Sampling Procedure. Follow 8.2.1.1, except place the pump and needle valve between the probe and the bag. Use a pump and needle valve constructed of inert material not affected by the stack gas. Leak-check the system, and then purge with stack gas before connecting to the previously evacuated bag.
8.2.1.3 Explosion Risk Area Bag Sampling Procedure. Follow 8.2.1.1 except replace the pump with another evacuated can (see Figure 18-9a). Use this method whenever there is a possibility of an explosion due to pumps, heated probes, or other flame producing equipment.
8.2.1.4 Other Modified Bag Sampling Procedures. In the event that condensation is observed in the bag while collecting the sample and a direct interface system cannot be used, heat the bag during collection and maintain it at a suitably elevated temperature during all subsequent operations. (Note: Take care to leak-check the system prior to the dilutions so as not to create a potentially explosive atmosphere.) As an alternative, collect the sample gas, and simultaneously dilute it in the bag.
8.2.1.4.1 First Alternative Procedure. Heat the box containing the sample bag to 120 °C (±5 °C). Then transport the bag as rapidly as possible to the analytical area while maintaining the heating, or cover the box with an insulating blanket. In the analytical area, keep the box heated to 120 °C (±5 °C) until analysis. Be sure that the method of heating the box and the control for the heating circuit are compatible with the safety restrictions required in each area.
8.2.1.4.2 Second Alternative Procedure. Prefill the bag with a known quantity of inert gas. Meter the inert gas into the bag according to the procedure for the preparation of gas concentration standards of volatile liquid materials (Section 10.1.2.2), but eliminate the midget impinger section. Take the partly filled bag to the source, and meter the source gas into the bag through heated sampling lines and a heated flowmeter, or Teflon positive displacement pump. Verify the dilution factors before sampling each bag through dilution and analysis of gases of known concentration.
8.2.1.5 Analysis of Bag Samples.
8.2.1.5.1 Apparatus. Same as section 8.1. A minimum of three gas standards are required.
8.2.1.5.2 Procedure.
8.2.1.5.2.1 Establish proper GC operating conditions as described in section 10.2, and record all data listed in Figure 18-7. Prepare the GC so that gas can be drawn through the sample valve. Flush the sample loop with
calibration gas mixture, and activate the valve (sample pressure at the inlet to the GC introduction valve should be similar during calibration as during actual sample analysis). Obtain at least three chromatograms for the mixture. The results are acceptable when the peak areas for the three injections agree to within 5 percent of their average. If they do not agree, run additional samples or correct the analytical techniques until this requirement is met. Then analyze the other two calibration mixtures in the same manner. Prepare a calibration curve as described in section 10.2.
8.2.1.5.2.2 Analyze the three source gas samples by connecting each bag to the sampling valve with a piece of Teflon tubing identified with that bag. Analyze each bag sample three times. Record the data in Figure 18-11. If certain items do not apply, use the notation “N.A.” If the bag has been maintained at an elevated temperature as described in section 8.2.1.4, determine the stack gas water content by Method 4. After all samples have been analyzed, repeat the analysis of the mid-level calibration gas for each compound. Compare the average response factor of the pre- and post-test analysis for each compound. If they differ by
5percent, analyze the other calibration gas levels for that compound, and prepare a calibration curve using all the pre- and post-test calibration gas mixture values. If the two response factor averages (pre-and post-test) differ by less than 5 percent from their mean value, the tester has the option of using only the pre-test calibration curve to generate the concentration values.
8.2.1.6 Determination of Bag Water Vapor Content. Measure the ambient temperature and barometric pressure near the bag. From a water saturation vapor pressure table, determine and record the water vapor content of the bag as a decimal figure. (Assume the relative humidity to be 100 percent unless a lesser value is known.) If the bag has been maintained at an elevated temperature as described in section 8.2.1.4, determine the stack gas water content by Method 4.
8.2.1.8 Emission Calculations. From the calibration curve described in section 8.2.1.5, select the value of C
s
that corresponds to the peak area. Calculate the concentration C
c
in ppm, dry basis, of each organic in the sample using Equation 18-5 in section 12.6.
8.2.2 Direct Interface Sampling and Analysis Procedure. The direct interface procedure can be used provided that the moisture content of the gas does not interfere with the analysis procedure, the physical requirements of the equipment can be met at the site, and the source gas concentration falls within the linear range of the detector. Adhere to all safety requirements with this method.
8.2.2.1 Apparatus.
8.2.2.1.1 Probe. Constructed of stainless steel, Pyrex glass, or Teflon tubing as dictated by duct temperature and reactivity of target compounds. A filter or glass wool plug may be needed if particulate is present in the stack gas. If necessary, heat the probe with heating tape or a special heating unit capable of maintaining a temperature greater than 110 °C.
8.2.2.1.2 Sample Lines. 6.4-mm OD (or other diameter as needed) Teflon lines, heat-traced to prevent condensation of material (greater than 110 °C).
8.2.2.1.3 Quick Connects. To connect sample line to gas sampling valve on GC instrument and to pump unit used to withdraw source gas. Use a quick connect or equivalent on the cylinder or bag containing calibration gas to allow connection of the calibration gas to the gas sampling valve.
8.2.2.1.4 Thermocouple Readout Device. Potentiometer or digital thermometer, to measure source temperature and probe temperature.
8.2.2.1.5 Heated Gas Sampling Valve. Of two-position, six-port design, to allow sample loop to be purged with source gas or to direct source gas into the GC instrument.
8.2.2.1.6 Needle Valve. To control gas sampling rate from the source.
8.2.2.1.7 Pump. Leakless Teflon-coated diaphragm-type pump or equivalent, capable of at least 1 liter/minute sampling rate.
8.2.2.1.8 Flowmeter. Of suitable range to measure sampling rate.
8.2.2.1.9 Charcoal Adsorber. To adsorb organic vapor vented from the source to prevent exposure of personnel to source gas.
8.2.2.1.10 Gas Cylinders. Carrier gas, oxygen and fuel as needed to run GC and detector.
8.2.2.1.11 Gas Chromatograph. Capable of being moved into the field, with detector, heated gas sampling valve, column required to complete separation of desired components, and option for temperature programming.
8.2.2.1.12 Recorder/Integrator. To record results.
8.2.2.2 Procedure. Calibrate the GC using the procedures in section 8.2.1.5.2.1. To obtain a stack gas sample, assemble the sampling system as shown in Figure 18-12. Make sure all connections are tight. Turn on the probe and sample line heaters. As the temperature of the probe and heated line approaches the target temperature as indicated on the thermocouple readout device, control the heating to maintain a temperature greater than 110 °C. Conduct a 3-point calibration of the GC by analyzing each gas mixture in triplicate. Generate a calibration curve. Place the inlet of the probe at the centroid of the duct, or at a point no closer to the walls than 1 m, and draw source gas into the probe, heated line, and sample loop. After thorough flushing, analyze the stack gas sample using the same conditions as for
the calibration gas mixture. For each run, sample, analyze, and record five consecutive samples. A test consists of three runs (five samples per run times three runs, for a total of fifteen samples). After all samples have been analyzed, repeat the analysis of the mid-level calibration gas for each compound. For each calibration standard, compare the pre- and post-test average response factors (RF) for each compound. If the two calibration RF values (pre- and post-analysis) differ by more than 5 percent from their mean value, then analyze the other calibration gas levels for that compound and determine the stack gas sample concentrations by comparison to both calibration curves (this is done by preparing a calibration curve using all the pre- and post-test calibration gas mixture values.) If the two calibration RF values differ by less than 5 percent from their mean value, the tester has the option of using only the pre-test calibration curve to generate the concentration values. Record this calibration data and the other required data on the data sheet shown in Figure 18-11, deleting the dilution gas information.

# Note:
Take care to draw all samples and calibration mixtures through the sample loop at the same pressure.
8.2.2.3 Determination of Stack Gas Moisture Content. Use Method 4 to measure the stack gas moisture content.
8.2.2.5 Emission Calculations. Same as section 8.2.1.8.
8.2.3 Dilution Interface Sampling and Analysis Procedure. Source samples that contain a high concentration of organic materials may require dilution prior to analysis to prevent saturating the GC detector. The apparatus required for this direct interface procedure is basically the same as that described in the section 8.2.2, except a dilution system is added between the heated sample line and the gas sampling valve. The apparatus is arranged so that either a 10:1 or 100:1 dilution of the source gas can be directed to the chromatograph. A pump of larger capacity is also required, and this pump must be heated and placed in the system between the sample line and the dilution apparatus.
8.2.3.1 Apparatus. The equipment required in addition to that specified for the direct interface system is as follows:
8.2.3.1.1 Sample Pump. Leakless Teflon-coated diaphragm-type that can withstand being heated to 120 °C and deliver 1.5 liters/minute.
8.2.3.1.2 Dilution Pumps. Two Model A-150 Komhyr Teflon positive displacement type delivering 150 cc/minute, or equivalent. As an option, calibrated flowmeters can be used in conjunction with Teflon-coated diaphragm pumps.
8.2.3.1.3 Valves. Two Teflon three-way valves, suitable for connecting to Teflon tubing.
8.2.3.1.4 Flowmeters. Two, for measurement of diluent gas.
8.2.3.1.5 Diluent Gas with Cylinders and Regulators. Gas can be nitrogen or clean dry air, depending on the nature of the source gases.
8.2.3.1.6 Heated Box. Suitable for being heated to 120 °C, to contain the three pumps, three-way valves, and associated connections. The box should be equipped with quick connect fittings to facilitate connection of: (1) the heated sample line from the probe, (2) the gas sampling valve, (3) the calibration gas mixtures, and (4) diluent gas lines. A schematic diagram of the components and connections is shown in Figure 18-13. The heated box shown in Figure 18-13 is designed to receive a heated line from the probe. An optional design is to build a probe unit that attaches directly to the heated box. In this way, the heated box contains the controls for the probe heaters, or, if the box is placed against the duct being sampled, it may be possible to eliminate the probe heaters. In either case, a heated Teflon line is used to connect the heated box to the gas sampling valve on the chromatograph.

# Note:
Care must be taken to leak-check the system prior to the dilutions so as not to create a potentially explosive atmosphere.
8.2.3.2 Procedure.
8.2.3.2.1 Assemble the apparatus by connecting the heated box, shown in Figure 18-13, between the heated sample line from the probe and the gas sampling valve on the chromatograph. Vent the source gas from the gas sampling valve directly to the charcoal filter, eliminating the pump and rotameter. Heat the sample probe, sample line, and heated box. Insert the probe and source thermocouple at the centroid of the duct, or to a point no closer to the walls than 1 m. Measure the source temperature, and adjust all heating units to a temperature 0 to 3 °C above this temperature. If this temperature is above the safe operating temperature of the Teflon components, adjust the heating to maintain a temperature high enough to prevent condensation of water and organic compounds (greater than 110 °C). Calibrate the GC through the dilution system by following the procedures in section 8.2.1.5.2.1. Determine the concentration of the diluted calibration gas using the dilution factor and the certified concentration of the calibration gas. Record the pertinent data on the data sheet shown in Figure 18-11.
8.2.3.2.2 Once the dilution system and GC operations are satisfactory, proceed with the analysis of source gas, maintaining the same dilution settings as used for the standards.
8.2.3.2.3 Analyze the audit samples using either the dilution system, or directly connect to the gas sampling valve as required. Record all data and report the results to the audit supervisor.
8.2.3.3 Determination of Stack Gas Moisture Content. Same as section 8.2.2.3.
8.2.3.4 Quality Assurance. Same as section 8.2.2.4.
8.2.3.5 Emission Calculations. Same as section 8.2.2.5, with the dilution factor applied.
8.2.4 Adsorption Tube Procedure. Any commercially available adsorbent is allowed for the purposes of this method, as long as the recovery study criteria in section 8.4.3 are met. Help in choosing the adsorbent may be found by calling the distributor, or the tester may refer to National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) methods for the particular organics to be sampled. For some adsorbents, the principal interferent will be water vapor. If water vapor is thought to be a problem, the tester may place a midget impinger in an ice bath before the adsorbent tubes. If this option is chosen, the water catch in the midget impinger shall be analyzed for the target compounds. Also, the spike for the recovery study (in section 8.4.3) shall be conducted in both the midget impinger and the adsorbent tubes. The combined recovery (add the recovered amount in the impinger and the adsorbent tubes to calculate R) shall then meet the criteria in section 8.4.3.

# Note:
Post-test leak-checks are not allowed for this technique since this can result in sample contamination.
8.2.4.1 Additional Apparatus. The following items (or equivalent) are suggested.
8.2.4.1.1 Probe. Borosilicate glass or stainless steel, approximately 6-mm ID, with a heating system if water condensation is a problem, and a filter (either in-stack or out-of-stack, heated to stack temperature) to remove particulate matter. In most instances, a plug of glass wool is a satisfactory filter.
8.2.4.1.2 Flexible Tubing. To connect probe to adsorption tubes. Use a material that exhibits minimal sample adsorption.
8.2.4.1.3 Leakless Sample Pump. Flow controlled, constant rate pump, with a set of limiting (sonic) orifices.
8.2.4.1.4 Bubble-Tube Flowmeter. Volume accuracy within 1 percent, to calibrate pump.
8.2.4.1.5 Stopwatch. To time sampling and pump rate calibration.
8.2.4.1.6 Adsorption Tubes. Precleaned adsorbent, with mass of adsorbent to be determined by calculating breakthrough volume and expected concentration in the stack.
8.2.4.1.7 Barometer. Accurate to 5 mm Hg, to measure atmospheric pressure during sampling and pump calibration.
8.2.4.1.8 Rotameter. O to 100 cc/min, to detect changes in flow rate during sampling.
8.2.4.2 Sampling and Analysis.
8.2.4.2.1 Calibrate the pump and limiting orifice flow rate through adsorption tubes with the bubble tube flowmeter before sampling. The sample system can be operated as a “recirculating loop” for this operation. Record the ambient temperature and barometric pressure. Then, during sampling, use the rotameter to verify that the pump and orifice sampling rate remains constant.
8.2.4.2.2 Use a sample probe, if required, to obtain the sample at the centroid of the duct or at a point no closer to the walls than 1 m. Minimize the length of flexible tubing between the probe and adsorption tubes. Several adsorption tubes can be connected in series, if the extra adsorptive capacity is needed. Adsorption tubes should be maintained vertically during the test in order to prevent channeling. Provide the gas sample to the sample system at a pressure sufficient for the limiting orifice to function as a sonic orifice. Record the total time and sample flow rate (or the number of pump strokes), the barometric pressure, and ambient temperature. Obtain a total sample volume commensurate with the expected concentration(s) of the volatile organic(s) present and recommended sample loading factors (weight sample per weight adsorption media). Laboratory tests prior to actual sampling may be necessary to predetermine this volume. If water vapor is present in the sample at concentrations above 2 to 3 percent, the adsorptive capacity may be severely reduced. Operate the gas chromatograph according to the manufacturer's instructions. After establishing optimum conditions, verify and document these conditions during all operations. Calibrate the instrument and then analyze the emission samples.
8.2.4.3 Standards and Calibration. If using thermal desorption, obtain calibration gases using the procedures in section 10.1. If using solvent extraction, prepare liquid standards in the desorption solvent. Use a minimum of three different standards; select the concentrations to bracket the expected average sample concentration. Perform the calibration before and after each day's sample analyses using the procedures in section 8.2.1.5.2.1.
8.2.4.4 Quality Assurance.
8.2.4.4.1 Determine the recovery efficiency of the pollutants of interest according to section 8.4.3.
8.2.4.4.2 Determination of Sample Collection Efficiency (Optional). If sample breakthrough is thought to be a problem, a routine procedure for determining breakthrough is to analyze the primary and backup portions of the adsorption tubes separately. If the backup portion exceeds 10 percent of the total amount (primary and back-up), it is usually a sign of sample breakthrough. For the purposes of this method, only the recovery efficiency value (Section 8.4.3) is used to determine the appropriateness of the sampling and analytical procedure.
8.2.4.4.3 Volume Flow Rate Checks. Perform this check immediately after sampling with all sampling train components in place.
Use the bubble-tube flowmeter to measure the pump volume flow rate with the orifice used in the test sampling, and record the result. If it has changed by more than 5 but less than 20 percent, calculate an average flow rate for the test. If the flow rate has changed by more than 20 percent, recalibrate the pump and repeat the sampling.
8.2.4.4.4 Calculations. Correct all sample volumes to standard conditions. If a sample dilution system has been used, multiply the results by the appropriate dilution ratio. Correct all results according to the applicable procedure in section 8.4.3. Report results as ppm by volume, dry basis.
8.3 Reporting of Results. At the completion of the field analysis portion of the study, ensure that the data sheets shown in Figure 18-11 have been completed. Summarize this data on the data sheets shown in Figure 18-15.
8.4 Recovery Study. After conducting the presurvey and identifying all of the pollutants of interest, conduct the appropriate recovery study during the test based on the sampling system chosen for the compounds of interest.
8.4.1 Recovery Study for Direct Interface or Dilution Interface Sampling. If the procedures in section 8.2.2 or 8.2.3 are to be used to analyze the stack gas, conduct the calibration procedure as stated in section 8.2.2.2 or 8.2.3.2, as appropriate. Upon successful completion of the appropriate calibration procedure, attach the mid-level calibration gas for at least one target compound to the inlet of the probe or as close as possible to the inlet of the probe, but before the filter. Repeat the calibration procedure by sampling and analyzing the mid-level calibration gas through the entire sampling and analytical system in triplicate. The mean of the calibration gas response sampled through the probe shall be within 10 percent of the analyzer response. If the difference in the two means is greater than 10 percent, check for leaks throughout the sampling system and repeat the analysis of the standard through the sampling system until this criterion is met.
8.4.2 Recovery Study for Bag Sampling.
8.4.2.1 Follow the procedures for the bag sampling and analysis in section 8.2.1. After analyzing all three bag samples, choose one of the bag samples and tag this bag as the spiked bag. Spike the chosen bag sample with a known mixture (gaseous or liquid) of all of the target pollutants. The theoretical concentration, in ppm, of each spiked compound in the bag shall be 40 to 60 percent of the average concentration measured in the three bag samples. If a target compound was not detected in the bag samples, the concentration of that compound to be spiked shall be 5 times the limit of detection for that compound. Store the spiked bag for the same period of time as the bag samples collected in the field. After the appropriate storage time has passed, analyze the spiked bag three times. Calculate the average fraction recovered (R) of each spiked target compound with the equation in section 12.7.
8.4.2.2 For the bag sampling technique to be considered valid for a compound, 0.70 ≤R ≤1.30. If the R value does not meet this criterion for a target compound, the sampling technique is not acceptable for that compound, and therefore another sampling technique shall be evaluated for acceptance (by repeating the recovery study with another sampling technique). Report the R value in the test report and correct all field measurements with the calculated R value for that compound by using the equation in section 12.8.
8.4.3 Recovery Study for Adsorption Tube Sampling. If following the adsorption tube procedure in section 8.2.4, conduct a recovery study of the compounds of interest during the actual field test. Set up two identical sampling trains. Collocate the two sampling probes in the stack. The probes shall be placed in the same horizontal plane, where the first probe tip is 2.5 cm from the outside edge of the other. One of the sampling trains shall be designated the spiked train and the other the unspiked train. Spike all of the compounds of interest (in gaseous or liquid form) onto the adsorbent tube(s) in the spiked train before sampling. The mass of each spiked compound shall be 40 to 60 percent of the mass expected to be collected with the unspiked train. Sample the stack gas into the two trains simultaneously. Analyze the adsorbents from the two trains utilizing identical analytical procedures and instrumentation. Determine the fraction of spiked compound recovered (R) using the equations in section 12.9.
8.4.3.1 Repeat the procedure in section 8.4.3 twice more, for a total of three runs. In order for the adsorbent tube sampling and analytical procedure to be acceptable for a compound, 0.70≤R≤1.30 (R in this case is the average of three runs). If the average R value does not meet this criterion for a target compound, the sampling technique is not acceptable for that compound, and therefore another sampling technique shall be evaluated for acceptance (by repeating the recovery study with another sampling technique). Report the R value in the test report and correct all field measurements with the calculated R value for that compound by using the equation in section 12.8.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization.
10.1 Calibration Standards. Obtain calibration gas standards for each target compound to be analyzed. Commercial cylinder gases certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within 1 percent of the certified label value are preferable, although cylinder gases certified by the manufacturer to 2 percent accuracy are allowed. Another option allowed by this method is for the tester to obtain high concentration certified cylinder gases and then use a dilution system meeting the requirements of Test Method 205, 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix M to make multi-level calibration gas standards. Prepare or obtain enough calibration standards so that there are three different concentrations of each organic compound expected to be measured in the source sample. For each organic compound, select those concentrations that bracket the concentrations expected in the source samples. A calibration standard may contain more than one organic compound. If samples are collected in adsorbent tubes and extracted using solvent extraction, prepare or obtain standards in the same solvent used for the sample extraction procedure. Verify the stability of all standards for the time periods they are used.
10.2 Preparation of Calibration Curves.
10.2.1 Establish proper GC conditions, then flush the sampling loop for 30 seconds. Allow the sample loop pressure to equilibrate to atmospheric pressure, and activate the injection valve. Record the standard concentration, attenuator factor, injection time, chart speed, retention time, peak area, sample loop temperature, column temperature, and carrier gas flow rate. Analyze each standard in triplicate.
10.2.2 Repeat this procedure for each standard. Prepare a graphical plot of concentration (C
s
) versus the calibration area values. Perform a regression analysis, and draw the least square line.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedures
11.1 Analysis Development
11.1.1 Selection of GC Parameters
11.1.1.1 Column Choice. Based on the initial contact with plant personnel concerning the plant process and the anticipated emissions, choose a column that provides good resolution and rapid analysis time. The choice of an appropriate column can be aided by a literature search, contact with manufacturers of GC columns, and discussion with personnel at the emission source.

# Note:
Most column manufacturers keep excellent records on their products. Their technical service departments may be able to recommend appropriate columns and detector type for separating the anticipated compounds, and they may be able to provide information on interferences, optimum operating conditions, and column limitations. Plants with analytical laboratories may be able to provide information on their analytical procedures.
11.1.1.2 Preliminary GC Adjustment. Using the standards and column obtained in section 11.1.1.1, perform initial tests to determine appropriate GC conditions that provide good resolution and minimum analysis time for the compounds of interest.
11.1.1.3 Preparation of Presurvey Samples. If the samples were collected on an adsorbent, extract the sample as recommended by the manufacturer for removal of the compounds with a solvent suitable to the type of GC analysis. Prepare other samples in an appropriate manner.
11.1.1.4 Presurvey Sample Analysis.
11.1.1.4.1 Before analysis, heat the presurvey sample to the duct temperature to vaporize any condensed material. Analyze the samples by the GC procedure, and compare the retention times against those of the calibration samples that contain the components expected to be in the stream. If any compounds cannot be identified with certainty by this procedure, identify them by other means such as GC/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) or GC/infrared techniques. A GC/MS system is recommended.
11.1.1.4.2 Use the GC conditions determined by the procedure of section 11.1.1.2 for the first injection. Vary the GC parameters during subsequent injections to determine the optimum settings. Once the optimum settings have been determined, perform repeat injections of the sample to determine the retention time of each compound. To inject a sample, draw sample through the loop at a constant rate (100 ml/min for 30 seconds). Be careful not to pressurize the gas in the loop. Turn off the pump and allow the gas in the sample loop to come to ambient pressure. Activate the sample valve, and record injection time, loop temperature, column temperature, carrier flow rate, chart speed, and attenuator setting. Calculate the retention
time of each peak using the distance from injection to the peak maximum divided by the chart speed. Retention times should be repeatable within 0.5 seconds.
11.1.1.4.3 If the concentrations are too high for appropriate detector response, a smaller sample loop or dilutions may be used for gas samples, and, for liquid samples, dilution with solvent is appropriate. Use the standard curves (Section 10.2) to obtain an estimate of the concentrations.
11.1.1.4.4 Identify all peaks by comparing the known retention times of compounds expected to be in the retention times of peaks in the sample. Identify any remaining unidentified peaks which have areas larger than 5 percent of the total using a GC/MS, or estimation of possible compounds by their retention times compared to known compounds, with confirmation by further GC analysis.

# 13.0 Method Performance
13.1 Since a potential sample may contain a variety of compounds from various sources, a specific precision limit for the analysis of field samples is impractical. Precision in the range of 5 to 10 percent relative standard deviation (RSD) is typical for gas chromatographic techniques, but an experienced GC operator with a reliable instrument can readily achieve 5 percent RSD. For this method, the following combined GC/operator values are required.
(a) Precision. Triplicate analyses of calibration standards fall within 5 percent of their mean value.
(b) Recovery. After developing an appropriate sampling and analytical system for the pollutants of interest, conduct the procedure in section 8.4. Conduct the appropriate recovery study in section 8.4 at each sampling point where the method is being applied. Submit the data and results of the recovery procedure with the reporting of results under section 8.3.

16.1.2.8 Zero Gas. Hydrocarbon free air or nitrogen, to be used for dilutions, blank preparation, and standard preparation.
16.1.3 Sampling.
16.1.3.1 Collection of Samples with Glass Sampling Flasks. Presurvey samples may be collected in precleaned 250-ml double-ended glass sampling flasks. Teflon stopcocks, without grease, are preferred. Flasks should be cleaned as follows: Remove the stopcocks from both ends of the flasks, and wipe the parts to remove any grease. Clean the stopcocks, barrels, and receivers with methylene chloride (or other non-target pollutant solvent, or heat and humidified air). Clean all glass ports with a soap solution, then rinse with tap and deionized distilled water. Place the flask in a cool glass annealing furnace, and apply heat up to 500 °C. Maintain at this temperature for 1 hour. After this time period, shut off and open the furnace to allow the flask to cool. Return the stopcocks to the flask receivers. Purge the assembly with high-purity nitrogen for 2 to 5 minutes. Close off the stopcocks after purging to maintain a slight positive nitrogen pressure. Secure the stopcocks with tape. Presurvey samples can be obtained either by drawing the gases into the previously evacuated flask or by drawing the gases into and purging the flask with a rubber suction bulb.
16.1.3.1.1 Evacuated Flask Procedure. Use a high-vacuum pump to evacuate the flask to the capacity of the pump; then close off the stopcock leading to the pump. Attach a 6-mm outside diameter (OD) glass tee to the flask inlet with a short piece of Teflon tubing. Select a 6-mm OD borosilicate sampling probe, enlarged at one end to a 12-mm OD and of sufficient length to reach the centroid of the duct to be sampled. Insert a glass wool plug in the enlarged end of the probe to remove particulate matter. Attach the other end of the probe to the tee with a short piece of Teflon tubing. Connect a rubber suction bulb to the third leg of the tee. Place the filter end of the probe at the centroid of the duct, and purge the probe with the rubber suction bulb. After the probe is completely purged and filled with duct gases, open the stopcock to the grab flask until the pressure in the flask reaches duct pressure. Close off the stopcock, and remove the probe from the duct. Remove the tee from the flask and tape the stopcocks to prevent leaks during shipment. Measure and record the duct temperature and pressure.
16.1.3.1.2 Purged Flask Procedure. Attach one end of the sampling flask to a rubber suction bulb. Attach the other end to a 6-mm OD glass probe as described in section 8.3.3.1.1. Place the filter end of the probe at the centroid of the duct, or at a point no closer to the walls than 1 m, and apply suction with the bulb to completely purge the probe and flask. After the flask has been purged, close off the stopcock near the suction bulb, and then close off the stopcock near the probe. Remove the probe from the duct, and disconnect both the probe and suction bulb. Tape the stopcocks to prevent leakage during shipment. Measure and record the duct temperature and pressure.
16.1.3.2 Flexible Bag Procedure. Any leak-free plastic (e.g., Tedlar, Mylar, Teflon) or plastic-coated aluminum (e.g., aluminized Mylar) bag, or equivalent, can be used to obtain the pre-survey sample. Use new bags, and leak-check them before field use. In addition, check the bag before use for contamination by filling it with nitrogen or air and analyzing the gas by GC at high sensitivity. Experience indicates that it is desirable to allow the inert gas to remain in the bag about 24 hours or longer to check for desorption of organics from the bag. Follow the leak-check and sample collection procedures given in Section 8.2.1.
16.1.3.3 Determination of Moisture Content. For combustion or water-controlled processes, obtain the moisture content from plant personnel or by measurement during the presurvey. If the source is below 59 °C, measure the wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures, and calculate the moisture content using a psychrometric chart. At higher temperatures, use Method 4 to determine the moisture content.
16.1.4 Determination of Static Pressure. Obtain the static pressure from the plant personnel or measurement. If a type S pitot tube and an inclined manometer are used, take care to align the pitot tube 90° from the direction of the flow. Disconnect one of the tubes to the manometer, and read the static pressure; note whether the reading is positive or negative.
16.1.5 Collection of Presurvey Samples with Adsorption Tube. Follow section 8.2.4 for presurvey sampling.

The test methods in this appendix are referred to in § 60.8 (Performance Tests) and § 60.11 (Compliance With Standards and Maintenance Requirements) of 40 CFR part 60, subpart A (General Provisions). Specific uses of these test methods are described in the standards of performance contained in the subparts, beginning with Subpart D.
Within each standard of performance, a section title “Test Methods and Procedures” is provided to: (1) Identify the test methods to be used as reference methods to the facility subject to the respective standard and (2) identify any special instructions or conditions to be followed when applying a method to the respective facility. Such instructions (for example, establish sampling rates, volumes, or temperatures) are to be used either in addition to, or as a substitute for procedures in a test method. Similarly, for sources subject to emission monitoring requirements, specific instructions pertaining to any use of a test method as a reference method are provided in the subpart or in Appendix B.
Inclusion of methods in this appendix is not intended as an endorsement or denial of their applicability to sources that are not subject to standards of performance. The methods are potentially applicable to other sources; however, applicability should be confirmed by careful and appropriate evaluation of the conditions prevalent at such sources.
The approach followed in the formulation of the test methods involves specifications for equipment, procedures, and performance. In concept, a performance specification approach would be preferable in all methods because this allows the greatest flexibility to the user. In practice, however, this approach is impractical in most cases because performance specifications cannot be established. Most of the methods described herein, therefore, involve specific equipment specifications and procedures, and only a few methods in this appendix rely on performance criteria.
Minor changes in the test methods should not necessarily affect the validity of the results and it is recognized that alternative and equivalent methods exist. section 60.8 provides authority for the Administrator to specify or approve (1) equivalent methods, (2) alternative methods, and (3) minor changes in the methodology of the test methods. It should be clearly understood that unless otherwise identified all such methods and changes must have prior approval of the Administrator. An owner employing such methods or deviations from the test methods without obtaining prior approval does so at the risk of subsequent disapproval and retesting with approved methods.
Within the test methods, certain specific equipment or procedures are recognized as being acceptable or potentially acceptable and are specifically identified in the methods. The items identified as acceptable options may be used without approval but must be identified in the test report. The potentially approvable options are cited as “subject to the approval of the Administrator” or as “or equivalent.” Such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives may be used at the discretion of the owner without prior approval. However, detailed descriptions for applying these potentially approvable techniques or alternatives are not provided in the test methods. Also, the potentially approvable options are not necessarily acceptable in all applications. Therefore, an owner electing to use such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives is responsible for: (1) assuring that the techniques or alternatives are in fact applicable and are properly executed; (2) including a written description of the alternative method in the test report (the written method must be clear and must be capable of being performed without additional instruction, and the degree of detail should be similar to the detail contained in the test methods); and (3) providing any rationale or supporting data necessary to show the validity of the alternative in the particular application. Failure to meet these requirements can result in the Administrator's disapproval of the alternative.

) and CO
2
concentration is measured on a wet basis (%CO

12.3.2.3 Use ASTM D 3176-74 or 89 (all cited ASTM standards are incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) for ultimate analysis of the fuel.
12.3.2.4 Use applicable methods in section 12.5.2.1 or 12.5.2.2 to determine the heat content of solid or liquid fuels. For gaseous fuels, use ASTM D 1826-77 or 94 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) to determine the heat content.
12.3.3 F Factors for Combination of Fuels. If combinations of fuels are burned, use the following equations, as applicable unless otherwise specified in an applicable subpart:
ER17OC00.336
ER17OC00.337
ER17OC00.338
12.4 Determination of Average Pollutant Rates.
12.4.1 Average Pollutant Rates from Hourly Values. When hourly average pollutant rates (E
h
), inlet or outlet, are obtained (
e.g.,
CEMS values), compute the average pollutant rate (E
a
) for the performance test period (
e.g.,
30 days) specified in the applicable regulation using the following equation:
ER17OC00.339
12.4.2 Average Pollutant Rates from Other than Hourly Averages. When pollutant rates are determined from measured values representing longer than 1-hour periods (

a
) for the performance test period (
e.g.,

f
) for the averaging period (
e.g.,
90 days) as specified in the applicable regulation using the following equation:
ER17OC00.343

# Note:
In calculating %R
f
, include %S and GCV values for all fuel lots that are not pretreated and are used during the averaging period.
12.5.2.1 Solid Fossil (Including Waste) Fuel/Sampling and Analysis.

# Note:
For the purposes of this method, raw fuel (coal or oil) is the fuel delivered to the desulfurization (pretreatment) facility. For oil, the input oil to the oil desulfurization process (
e.g.,
hydrotreatment) is considered to be the raw fuel.
12.5.2.1.1 Sample Increment Collection. Use ASTM D 2234-76, 96, 97a, or 98 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17), Type I, Conditions A, B, or C, and systematic spacing. As used in this method, systematic spacing is intended to include evenly spaced increments in time or increments based on equal weights of coal passing the collection area. As a minimum, determine the number and weight of increments required per gross sample representing each coal lot according to Table 2 or Paragraph 7.1.5.2 of ASTM D 2234. Collect one gross sample for each lot of raw coal and one gross sample for each lot of product coal.
12.5.2.1.2 ASTM Lot Size. For the purpose of section 12.5.2 (fuel pretreatment), the lot size of product coal is the weight of product coal from one type of raw coal. The lot size of raw coal is the weight of raw coal used to produce one lot of product coal. Typically, the lot size is the weight of coal processed in a 1-day (24-hour) period. If more than one type of coal is treated and produced in 1 day, then gross samples must be collected and analyzed for each type of coal. A coal lot size equaling the 90-day quarterly fuel quantity for a steam generating unit may be used if representative sampling can be conducted for each raw coal and product coal.

# Note:
Alternative definitions of lot sizes may be used, subject to prior approval of the Administrator.
12.5.2.1.3 Gross Sample Analysis. Use ASTM D 2013-72 or 86 to prepare the sample, ASTM D 3177-75 or 89 or ASTM D 4239-85, 94, or 97 to determine sulfur content (%S), ASTM D 3173-73 or 87 to determine moisture content, and ASTM D 2015-77 (Reapproved 1978) or 96, D 3286-85 or 96, or D 5865-98 or 10 to determine gross calorific value (GCV) (all standards cited are incorporated by reference—see
§ 60.17 for acceptable versions of the standards) on a dry basis for each gross sample.
12.5.2.2 Liquid Fossil Fuel-Sampling and Analysis. See Note under section 12.5.2.1.
12.5.2.2.1 Sample Collection. Follow the procedures for continuous sampling in ASTM D 270 or D 4177-95 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) for each gross sample from each fuel lot.
12.5.2.2.2 Lot Size. For the purpose of section 12.5.2 (fuel pretreatment), the lot size of a product oil is the weight of product oil from one pretreatment facility and intended as one shipment (ship load, barge load, etc.). The lot size of raw oil is the weight of each crude liquid fuel type used to produce a lot of product oil.

# Note:
Alternative definitions of lot sizes may be used, subject to prior approval of the Administrator.
12.5.2.2.3 Sample Analysis. Use ASTM D 129-64, 78, or 95, ASTM D 1552-83 or 95, or ASTM D 4057-81 or 95 to determine the sulfur content (%S) and ASTM D 240-76 or 92 (all standards cited are incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) to determine the GCV of each gross sample. These values may be assumed to be on a dry basis. The owner or operator of an affected facility may elect to determine the GCV by sampling the oil combusted on the first steam generating unit operating day of each calendar month and then using the lowest GCV value of the three GCV values per quarter for the GCV of all oil combusted in that calendar quarter.
12.5.2.3 Use appropriate procedures, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to determine the fraction of total mass input derived from each type of fuel.
12.5.3 Control Device Removal Efficiency. Compute the percent removal efficiency (%R
g
) of the control device using the following equation:
ER17OC00.344
12.5.3.1 Use continuous emission monitoring systems or test methods, as appropriate, to determine the outlet SO
2
rates and, if appropriate, the inlet SO
2
rates. The rates may be determined as hourly (E
h
) or other sampling period averages (E
d
). Then, compute the average pollutant rates for the performance test period (E
ao
and E
ai
) using the procedures in section 12.4.
12.5.3.2 As an alternative, as-fired fuel sampling and analysis may be used to determine inlet SO
2
rates as follows:
12.5.3.2.1 Compute the average inlet SO
2
rate (E
di
) for each sampling period using the following equation:
ER17OC00.345
Where:
ER17OC00.346
After calculating E
di
, use the procedures in section 12.4 to determine the average inlet SO
2
rate for the performance test period (E
ai
).
12.5.3.2.2 Collect the fuel samples from a location in the fuel handling system that provides a sample representative of the fuel bunkered or consumed during a steam generating unit operating day. For the purpose of as-fired fuel sampling under section 12.5.3.2 or section 12.6, the lot size for coal is the weight of coal bunkered or consumed during each steam generating unit operating day. The lot size for oil is the weight of oil supplied to the “day” tank or consumed during each steam generating unit operating day. For reporting and calculation purposes, the gross sample shall be identified with the calendar day on which sampling began. For steam generating unit operating days when a coal-fired steam generating unit is operated without coal being added to the bunkers, the coal analysis from the previous “as bunkered” coal sample shall be used until coal is bunkered again. For steam generating unit operating days when an oil-fired steam generating unit is operated without oil being added to the oil “day” tank, the oil analysis from the previous day shall be used until the “day” tank is filled again. Alternative definitions of fuel lot size may be used, subject to prior approval of the Administrator.
12.5.3.2.3 Use ASTM procedures specified in section 12.5.2.1 or 12.5.2.2 to determine %S and GCV.
12.5.4 Daily Geometric Average Percent Reduction from Hourly Values. The geometric average percent reduction (%R
ga
) is computed using the following equation:
ER17OC00.347

# Note:
The calculation includes only paired data sets (hourly average) for the inlet and outlet pollutant measurements.
12.6 Sulfur Retention Credit for Compliance Fuel. If fuel sampling and analysis procedures in section 12.5.2.1 are being used to determine average SO
2
emission rates (E
as
) to the atmosphere from a coal-fired steam generating unit when there is no SO
2
control device, the following equation may be used to adjust the emission rate for sulfur retention credits (no credits are allowed for oil-fired systems) (E
di
) for each sampling period using the following equation:
ER17OC00.348
Where:
ER17OC00.349
After calculating E
di
, use the procedures in section 12.4.2 to determine the average SO
2
emission rate to the atmosphere for the performance test period (E
ao
).
12.7 Determination of Compliance When Minimum Data Requirement Is Not Met.
12.7.1 Adjusted Emission Rates and Control Device Removal Efficiency. When the minimum data requirement is not met, the Administrator may use the following adjusted emission rates or control device removal efficiencies to determine compliance with the applicable standards.
12.7.1.1 Emission Rate. Compliance with the emission rate standard may be determined by using the lower confidence limit of the emission rate (E
ao
*) as follows:
ER17OC00.350
12.7.1.2 Control Device Removal Efficiency. Compliance with the overall emission reduction (%R
o
) may be determined by using the lower confidence limit of the emission rate (E
ao
*) and the upper confidence limit of the inlet pollutant rate (E
ai
*) in calculating the control device removal efficiency (%R
g
) as follows:
ER17OC00.351
ER17OC00.352
12.7.2 Standard Deviation of Hourly Average Pollutant Rates. Compute the standard deviation (S
e
) of the hourly average pollutant rates using the following equation:
ER17OC00.353
Equation 19-19 through 19-31 may be used to compute the standard deviation for both the outlet (S
o
) and, if applicable, inlet (S
i
) pollutant rates.

# Method 21—Determination of Volatile Organic Compound Leaks

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1 Analytes.
Analyte
CAS No.
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC)
No CAS number assigned.
1.2 Scope. This method is applicable for the determination of VOC leaks from process equipment. These sources include, but are not limited to, valves, flanges and other connections, pumps and compressors, pressure relief devices, process drains, open-ended valves, pump and compressor seal system degassing vents, accumulator vessel vents, agitator seals, and access door seals.
1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 A portable instrument is used to detect VOC leaks from individual sources. The instrument detector type is not specified, but it must meet the specifications and performance criteria contained in section 6.0. A leak definition concentration based on a reference compound is specified in each applicable regulation. This method is intended to locate and classify leaks only, and is not to be used as a direct measure of mass emission rate from individual sources.

# 3.0 Definitions
3.1
Calibration gas
means the VOC compound used to adjust the instrument meter reading to a known value. The calibration gas is usually the reference compound at a known concentration approximately equal to the leak definition concentration.
3.2
Calibration precision
means the degree of agreement between measurements of the same known value, expressed as the relative percentage of the average difference between the meter readings and the known concentration to the known concentration.
3.3
Leak definition concentration
means the local VOC concentration at the surface of a leak source that indicates that a VOC emission (leak) is present. The leak definition is an instrument meter reading based on a reference compound.
3.4
No detectable emission
means a local VOC concentration at the surface of a leak source, adjusted for local VOC ambient concentration, that is less than 2.5 percent of the specified leak definition concentration. that indicates that a VOC emission (leak) is not present.
3.5
Reference compound
means the VOC species selected as the instrument calibration basis for specification of the leak definition concentration. (For example, if a leak definition concentration is 10,000 ppm as methane, then any source emission that results in a local concentration that yields a meter reading of 10,000 on an instrument meter calibrated with methane would be classified as a leak. In this example, the leak definition concentration is 10,000 ppm and the reference compound is methane.)
3.6
Response factor
means the ratio of the known concentration of a VOC compound to the observed meter reading when measured using an instrument calibrated with the reference compound specified in the applicable regulation.
3.7
Response time
means the time interval from a step change in VOC concentration at the input of the sampling system to the time at which 90 percent of the corresponding final value is reached as displayed on the instrument readout meter.

# 4.0 Interferences
[Reserved]

# 5.0 Safety
5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.
5.2 Hazardous Pollutants. Several of the compounds, leaks of which may be determined by this method, may be irritating or corrosive to tissues (
e.g.,
heptane) or may be toxic (
e.g.,
benzene, methyl alcohol). Nearly all are fire hazards. Compounds in emissions should be determined through familiarity with the source. Appropriate precautions can be found in reference documents, such as reference No. 4 in section 16.0.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
A VOC monitoring instrument meeting the following specifications is required:
6.1 The VOC instrument detector shall respond to the compounds being processed. Detector types that may meet this requirement include, but are not limited to, catalytic oxidation, flame ionization, infrared absorption, and photoionization.
6.2 The instrument shall be capable of measuring the leak definition concentration specified in the regulation.
6.3 The scale of the instrument meter shall be readable to ±2.5 percent of the specified leak definition concentration.
6.4 The instrument shall be equipped with an electrically driven pump to ensure that a sample is provided to the detector at a constant flow rate. The nominal sample flow rate, as measured at the sample probe tip, shall be 0.10 to 3.0 l/min (0.004 to 0.1 ft
3
/min) when the probe is fitted with a glass wool plug or filter that may be used to prevent plugging of the instrument.
6.5 The instrument shall be equipped with a probe or probe extension or sampling not to exceed 6.4 mm (
1/4
in) in outside diameter, with a single end opening for admission of sample.
6.6 The instrument shall be intrinsically safe for operation in explosive atmospheres as defined by the National Electrical Code by the National Fire Prevention Association or other applicable regulatory code for operation in any explosive atmospheres that may be encountered in its use. The instrument shall, at a minimum, be intrinsically safe for Class 1, Division 1 conditions, and/or Class 2, Division 1 conditions, as appropriate, as defined by the example code. The instrument shall not be operated with any safety device, such as an exhaust flame arrestor, removed.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards
7.1 Two gas mixtures are required for instrument calibration and performance evaluation:
7.1.1 Zero Gas. Air, less than 10 parts per million by volume (ppmv) VOC.
7.1.2 Calibration Gas. For each organic species that is to be measured during individual source surveys, obtain or prepare a known standard in air at a concentration approximately equal to the applicable leak definition specified in the regulation.
7.2 Cylinder Gases. If cylinder calibration gas mixtures are used, they must be analyzed and certified by the manufacturer to be within 2 percent accuracy, and a shelf life must be specified. Cylinder standards must be either reanalyzed or replaced at the end of the specified shelf life.
7.3 Prepared Gases. Calibration gases may be prepared by the user according to any accepted gaseous preparation procedure that will yield a mixture accurate to within 2 percent. Prepared standards must be replaced each day of use unless it is demonstrated that degradation does not occur during storage.
7.4 Mixtures with non-Reference Compound Gases. Calibrations may be performed using a compound other than the reference compound. In this case, a conversion factor must be determined for the alternative compound such that the resulting meter readings during source surveys can be converted to reference compound results.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
8.1 Instrument Performance Evaluation. Assemble and start up the instrument according to the manufacturer's instructions for recommended warmup period and preliminary adjustments.
8.1.1 Response Factor. A response factor must be determined for each compound that is to be measured, either by testing or from reference sources. The response factor tests are required before placing the analyzer into service, but do not have to be repeated at subsequent intervals.
8.1.1.1 Calibrate the instrument with the reference compound as specified in the applicable regulation. Introduce the calibration gas mixture to the analyzer and record the observed meter reading. Introduce zero gas until a stable reading is obtained. Make a total of three measurements by alternating between the calibration gas and zero gas. Calculate the response factor for each repetition and the average response factor.
8.1.1.2 The instrument response factors for each of the individual VOC to be measured shall be less than 10 unless otherwise specified in the applicable regulation. When no instrument is available that meets this specification when calibrated with the reference VOC specified in the applicable regulation, the available instrument may be calibrated with one of the VOC to be measured, or any other VOC, so long as the instrument then has a response factor of less than 10 for each of the individual VOC to be measured.
8.1.1.3 Alternatively, if response factors have been published for the compounds of interest for the instrument or detector type, the response factor determination is not required, and existing results may be referenced. Examples of published response factors for flame ionization and catalytic oxidation detectors are included in References 1-3 of section 17.0.
8.1.2 Calibration Precision. The calibration precision test must be completed prior to placing the analyzer into service and at subsequent 3-month intervals or at the next use, whichever is later.
8.1.2.1 Make a total of three measurements by alternately using zero gas and the specified calibration gas. Record the meter readings. Calculate the average algebraic difference between the meter readings and the known value. Divide this average difference by the known calibration value and multiply by 100 to express the resulting calibration precision as a percentage.
8.1.2.2 The calibration precision shall be equal to or less than 10 percent of the calibration gas value.
8.1.3 Response Time. The response time test is required before placing the instrument into service. If a modification to the sample pumping system or flow configuration is made that would change the response time, a new test is required before further use.
8.1.3.1 Introduce zero gas into the instrument sample probe. When the meter reading has stabilized, switch quickly to the specified calibration gas. After switching, measure the time required to attain 90 percent of the final stable reading. Perform this test sequence three times and record the results. Calculate the average response time.
8.1.3.2 The instrument response time shall be equal to or less than 30 seconds. The instrument pump, dilution probe (if any), sample probe, and probe filter that will be used during testing shall all be in place during the response time determination.
8.2 Instrument Calibration. Calibrate the VOC monitoring instrument according to section 10.0.
8.3 Individual Source Surveys.
8.3.1 Type I—Leak Definition Based on Concentration. Place the probe inlet at the surface of the component interface where leakage could occur. Move the probe along the interface periphery while observing the instrument readout. If an increased meter reading is observed, slowly sample the interface where leakage is indicated until the maximum meter reading is obtained. Leave the probe inlet at this maximum reading location for approximately two times the instrument response time. If the maximum observed meter reading is greater than the leak definition in the applicable regulation, record and report the results as specified in the regulation reporting requirements. Examples of the application of this general technique to specific equipment types are:
8.3.1.1 Valves. The most common source of leaks from valves is the seal between the stem and housing. Place the probe at the interface where the stem exits the packing gland and sample the stem circumference. Also, place the probe at the interface of the packing gland take-up flange seat and sample the periphery. In addition, survey valve housings of multipart assembly at the surface of all interfaces where a leak could occur.
8.3.1.2 Flanges and Other Connections. For welded flanges, place the probe at the outer edge of the flange-gasket interface and sample the circumference of the flange. Sample other types of nonpermanent joints (such as threaded connections) with a similar traverse.
8.3.1.3 Pumps and Compressors. Conduct a circumferential traverse at the outer surface of the pump or compressor shaft and seal interface. If the source is a rotating shaft, position the probe inlet within 1 cm of the shaft-seal interface for the survey. If the housing configuration prevents a complete traverse of the shaft periphery, sample all accessible portions. Sample all other joints on the pump or compressor housing where leakage could occur.
8.3.1.4 Pressure Relief Devices. The configuration of most pressure relief devices prevents sampling at the sealing seat interface. For those devices equipped with an enclosed extension, or horn, place the probe inlet at approximately the center of the exhaust area to the atmosphere.
8.3.1.5 Process Drains. For open drains, place the probe inlet at approximately the center of the area open to the atmosphere. For covered drains, place the probe at the surface of the cover interface and conduct a peripheral traverse.
8.3.1.6 Open-ended Lines or Valves. Place the probe inlet at approximately the center of the opening to the atmosphere.
8.3.1.7 Seal System Degassing Vents and Accumulator Vents. Place the probe inlet at approximately the center of the opening to the atmosphere.
8.3.1.8 Access door seals. Place the probe inlet at the surface of the door seal interface and conduct a peripheral traverse.
8.3.2 Type II—“No Detectable Emission”. Determine the local ambient VOC concentration around the source by moving the probe randomly upwind and downwind at a distance of one to two meters from the source. If an interference exists with this determination due to a nearby emission or leak, the local ambient concentration may be determined at distances closer to the source, but in no case shall the distance be less than 25 centimeters. Then move the probe inlet to the surface of the source and determine the concentration as outlined in section 8.3.1. The difference between these concentrations determines whether there are no detectable emissions. Record and report the results as specified by the regulation. For those cases where the regulation requires a specific device installation, or that specified vents be ducted or piped to a control device, the existence of these conditions shall be visually confirmed. When the regulation also requires that no detectable emissions exist, visual observations and sampling surveys are required. Examples of this technique are:
8.3.2.1 Pump or Compressor Seals. If applicable, determine the type of shaft seal. Perform a survey of the local area ambient VOC concentration and determine if detectable emissions exist as described in section 8.3.2.
8.3.2.2 Seal System Degassing Vents, Accumulator Vessel Vents, Pressure Relief Devices. If applicable, observe whether or not the applicable ducting or piping exists. Also, determine if any sources exist in the ducting or piping where emissions could occur upstream of the control device. If the required ducting or piping exists and there are no sources where the emissions could be vented to the atmosphere upstream of the control device, then it is presumed that no detectable emissions are present. If there are sources in the ducting or piping where emissions could be vented or sources where leaks could occur, the sampling surveys described in section 8.3.2 shall be used to determine if detectable emissions exist.
8.3.3 Alternative Screening Procedure.
8.3.3.1 A screening procedure based on the formation of bubbles in a soap solution that is sprayed on a potential leak source may be used for those sources that do not have continuously moving parts, that do not have surface temperatures greater than the boiling point or less than the freezing point of the soap solution, that do not have open areas to the atmosphere that the soap solution cannot bridge, or that do not exhibit evidence of liquid leakage. Sources that have these conditions present must be surveyed using the instrument technique of section 8.3.1 or 8.3.2.
8.3.3.2 Spray a soap solution over all potential leak sources. The soap solution may be a commercially available leak detection solution or may be prepared using concentrated detergent and water. A pressure sprayer or squeeze bottle may be used to dispense the solution. Observe the potential leak sites to determine if any bubbles are formed. If no bubbles are observed, the source is presumed to have no detectable emissions or leaks as applicable. If any bubbles are observed, the instrument techniques of section 8.3.1 or 8.3.2 shall be used to determine if a leak exists, or if the source has detectable emissions, as applicable.

# Method 22—Visual Determination of Fugitive Emissions From Material Sources and Smoke Emissions From Flares

# Note:
This method is not inclusive with respect to observer certification. Some material is incorporated by reference from Method 9.

# 1.0 Scope and Application
This method is applicable for the determination of the frequency of fugitive emissions from stationary sources, only as specified in an applicable subpart of the regulations. This method also is applicable for the
determination of the frequency of visible smoke emissions from flares.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 Fugitive emissions produced during material processing, handling, and transfer operations or smoke emissions from flares are visually determined by an observer without the aid of instruments.
2.2 This method is used also to determine visible smoke emissions from flares used for combustion of waste process materials.
2.3 This method determines the amount of time that visible emissions occur during the observation period (
i.e.,
the accumulated emission time). This method does not require that the opacity of emissions be determined. Since this procedure requires only the determination of whether visible emissions occur and does not require the determination of opacity levels, observer certification according to the procedures of Method 9 is not required. However, it is necessary that the observer is knowledgeable with respect to the general procedures for determining the presence of visible emissions. At a minimum, the observer must be trained and knowledgeable regarding the effects of background contrast, ambient lighting, observer position relative to lighting, wind, and the presence of uncombined water (condensing water vapor) on the visibility of emissions. This training is to be obtained from written materials found in References 1 and 2 or from the lecture portion of the Method 9 certification course.

# 3.0 Definitions
3.1
Emission frequency
means the percentage of time that emissions are visible during the observation period.
3.2
Emission time
means the accumulated amount of time that emissions are visible during the observation period.
3.3
Fugitive emissions
means emissions generated by an affected facility which is not collected by a capture system and is released to the atmosphere. This includes emissions that (1) escape capture by process equipment exhaust hoods; (2) are emitted during material transfer; (3) are emitted from buildings housing material processing or handling equipment; or (4) are emitted directly from process equipment.
3.4
Observation period
means the accumulated time period during which observations are conducted, not to be less than the period specified in the applicable regulation.
3.5
Smoke emissions
means a pollutant generated by combustion in a flare and occurring immediately downstream of the flame. Smoke occurring within the flame, but not downstream of the flame, is not considered a smoke emission.

# 4.0 Interferences
4.1 Occasionally, fugitive emissions from sources other than the affected facility (
e.g.,
road dust) may prevent a clear view of the affected facility. This may particularly be a problem during periods of high wind. If the view of the potential emission points is obscured to such a degree that the observer questions the validity of continuing observations, then the observations shall be terminated, and the observer shall clearly note this fact on the data form.

# 5.0 Safety
5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.

# 6.0 Equipment
6.1 Stopwatches (two). Accumulative type with unit divisions of at least 0.5 seconds.
6.2 Light Meter. Light meter capable of measuring illuminance in the 50 to 200 lux range, required for indoor observations only.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedure
11.1 Selection of Observation Location. Survey the affected facility, or the building or structure housing the process to be observed, and determine the locations of potential emissions. If the affected facility is located inside a building, determine an observation location that is consistent with the requirements of the applicable regulation (
i.e.,
outside observation of emissions escaping the building/structure or inside observation of emissions directly emitted from the affected facility process unit). Then select a position that enables a clear view of the potential emission point(s) of the affected facility or of the building or structure housing the affected facility, as appropriate for the applicable subpart. A position at least 4.6 m (15 feet), but not more than 400 m (0.25 miles), from the emission source is recommended. For outdoor locations, select a position where the sunlight is not shining directly in the observer's eyes.
11.2 Field Records.
11.2.1 Outdoor Location. Record the following information on the field data sheet
(Figure 22-1): Company name, industry, process unit, observer's name, observer's affiliation, and date. Record also the estimated wind speed, wind direction, and sky condition. Sketch the process unit being observed, and note the observer location relative to the source and the sun. Indicate the potential and actual emission points on the sketch. Alternatively, digital photography as described in section 11.2.3 may be used for a subset of the recordkeeping requirements of this section.
11.2.2 Indoor Location. Record the following information on the field data sheet (Figure 22-2): Company name, industry, process unit, observer's name, observer's affiliation, and date. Record as appropriate the type, location, and intensity of lighting on the data sheet. Sketch the process unit being observed, and note the observer location relative to the source. Indicate the potential and actual fugitive emission points on the sketch. Alternatively, digital photography as described in section 11.2.3 may be used for a subset of the recordkeeping requirements of this section.
11.2.3 Digital Photographic Records. Digital photographs, annotated or unaltered, may be used to record and report sky conditions, observer's location relative to the source, observer's location relative to the sun, process unit being observed, potential emission points and actual emission points for the requirements in sections 11.2.1 and 11.2.2. The image must have the proper lighting, field of view and depth of field to properly distinguish the sky condition (if applicable), process unit, potential emission point and actual emission point. At least one digital photograph must be from the point of the view of the observer. The photograph(s) representing the environmental conditions including the sky conditions and the position of the sun relative to the observer and the emission point must be taken within a reasonable time of the observation (
i.e.,
15 minutes). When observations are taken from exactly the same observation point on a routine basis (
i.e.,
daily) and as long as there are no modifications to the units depicted, only a single photograph each is necessary to document the observer's location relative to the emissions source, the process unit being observed, and the location of potential and actual emission points. Any photographs altered or annotated must be retained in an unaltered format for recordkeeping purposes.
11.3 Indoor Lighting Requirements. For indoor locations, use a light meter to measure the level of illumination at a location as close to the emission source(s) as is feasible. An illumination of greater than 100 lux (10 foot candles) is considered necessary for proper application of this method.
11.4 Observations.
11.4.1 Procedure. Record the clock time when observations begin. Use one stopwatch to monitor the duration of the observation period. Start this stopwatch when the observation period begins. If the observation period is divided into two or more segments by process shutdowns or observer rest breaks (see section 11.4.3), stop the stopwatch when a break begins and restart the stopwatch without resetting it when the break ends. Stop the stopwatch at the end of the observation period. The accumulated time indicated by this stopwatch is the duration of observation period. When the observation period is completed, record the clock time. During the observation period, continuously watch the emission source. Upon observing an emission (condensed water vapor is not considered an emission), start the second accumulative stopwatch; stop the watch when the emission stops. Continue this procedure for the entire observation period. The accumulated elapsed time on this stopwatch is the total time emissions were visible during the observation period (
i.e.,
the emission time.)
11.4.2 Observation Period. Choose an observation period of sufficient length to meet the requirements for determining compliance with the emission standard in the applicable subpart of the regulations. When the length of the observation period is specifically stated in the applicable subpart, it may not be necessary to observe the source for this entire period if the emission time required to indicate noncompliance (based on the specified observation period) is observed in a shorter time period. In other words, if the regulation prohibits emissions for more than 6 minutes in any hour, then observations may (optional) be stopped after an emission time of 6 minutes is exceeded. Similarly, when the regulation is expressed as an emission frequency and the regulation prohibits emissions for greater than 10 percent of the time in any hour, then observations may (optional) be terminated after 6 minutes of emission are observed since 6 minutes is 10 percent of an hour. In any case, the observation period shall not be less than 6 minutes in duration. In some cases, the process operation may be intermittent or cyclic. In such cases, it may be convenient for the observation period to coincide with the length of the process cycle.
11.4.3 Observer Rest Breaks. Do not observe emissions continuously for a period of more than 15 to 20 minutes without taking a rest break. For sources requiring observation periods of greater than 20 minutes, the observer shall take a break of not less than 5 minutes and not more than 10 minutes after every 15 to 20 minutes of observation. If continuous observations are desired for extended time periods, two observers can alternate between making observations and taking breaks.
11.5 Recording Observations. Record the accumulated time of the observation period
on the data sheet as the observation period duration. Record the accumulated time emissions were observed on the data sheet as the emission time. Record the clock time the observation period began and ended, as well as the clock time any observer breaks began and ended.

# 12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations
If the applicable subpart requires that the emission rate be expressed as an emission frequency (in percent), determine this value as follows: Divide the accumulated emission time (in seconds) by the duration of the observation period (in seconds) or by any minimum observation period required in the applicable subpart, if the actual observation period is less than the required period, and multiply this quotient by 100.

# Method 23—Determination of Polychlorinated Dibenzo-
p

# -Dioxins, Polychlorinated Dibenzofurans, Polychlorinated Biphenyls, and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons From Stationary Sources

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1 Applicability.
This method applies to the measurement of polychlorinated dibenzo-
p
-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDF), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), and/or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in emissions from stationary sources. Using this method, you can measure these analyte groups individually or in any combination using a single sample acquisition unless otherwise specified in a rule, regulation, or permit. Tables 23-1 through 23-3 of this method list the applicable target
analytes for Method 23. If all 209 PCB are analyzed, the 17 toxic PCB congeners should be resolved and reported while the other PCB can be reported as totals by homolog, for example, total trichlorobiphenyl (TrCB).
1.2 Scope.
This method describes the sampling and analytical procedures used to measure selected PCDD and PCDF in stationary sources when required in an applicable subpart. This method also describes how the same sampling and analysis technology can be used to measure selected PCB and PAH from stationary source in combination or as each individual compound class when required in an applicable subpart. However, Method 23 incorporates by reference some of the specifications (
e.g.,
equipment and supplies) and procedures (
e.g.,
sampling and analytical) from other methods in this part that are essential to conducting Method 23. To obtain reliable samples, source sampling teams should be trained and experienced with the following additional EPA test methods: Method 1, Method 2, Method 3, Method 4, and Method 5 of Appendices A-1, A-2, and A-3 to 40 CFR part 60. Laboratory analysis teams should be trained and experienced with Method 1668C (found at:
https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-09/documents/method_1668c_2010.pdf)
and Method 1613B of 40 CFR part 136 Appendix A and have a working knowledge of isotope dilution and the use of high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS).
1.3 The HRGC/HRMS
portions of this method are for use by laboratory analysts experienced with HRGC/HRMS analysis of PCDD, PCDF, PCB, and PAH or under the close supervision of such qualified persons. Each source testing team, including the sampling and laboratory organization(s) that use this method, must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results that meet the performance criteria in Section 13 of this method.
1.4 This method is “performance-based” and includes acceptability criteria for assessing sampling and analytical procedures.
Users may modify the method to overcome interferences or to substitute superior materials and equipment, provided that they meet all performance criteria in this method. Section 13 of this method presents requirements for method performance.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
This method identifies and determines the concentration of specific PCDD, PCDF, PCB, and PAH compounds. Gaseous and particulate bound target pollutants are withdrawn from the gas stream isokinetically and collected in the sample probe, on a glass fiber or quartz filter, and on a packed column of adsorbent material. This method is not intended to differentiate between target compounds in particulate or vapor fractions. The target compounds are extracted from the combined sample collection media. Portions of the extract are chromatographically fractionated to remove interferences, separated into individual compounds or simple mixtures by HRGC, and measured with HRMS. This method uses isotopically labeled standards to improve method accuracy and precision through isotope dilution quantitation.

A procedure that expresses the toxicity of PCDD, PCDF, and PCB in terms of the most toxic dioxin, as specified in applicable regulations, permits, or other requirements.

# 4.0 Interferences
Despite interferences, confidence of the data is based on the enhanced selectivity of fractionation, gas chromatograph (GC) separation and detector resolving power, the QC check ions, and monitoring PCDPE.
4.1 PCB and PCDPE have similar molecular weight and chromatographic properties to PCDD and PCDF.
PCB may produce fragment ions at interfering mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) when losing chlorine (Cl
2
) or 2 Cl
2
during ionization processes. With HRMS, GC separation, and fractionation, PCB should not pose a problem for PCDD/PCDF identification and quantitation. PCDPE, when losing Cl
2,
also produce interfering m/z values in the PCDF homolog group with two fewer chlorine atoms (
i.e.,
an octachlorinated PCDPE can interfere with a hexachlorinated PCDF). The latter interferences are potentially detected by monitoring an m/z corresponding to the potentially interfering PCDPE; however, the fragmentation patterns of all PCDPE may not be known, complicating any attempt to quantify the extent of ether interference.
Note:
Consider monitoring 328 m/z if high levels of PCB are expected.
4.2 Very high amounts of other organic compounds in the matrix may interfere with the analysis.
This method provides examples of column-chromatographic cleanup as procedures to reduce, but not necessarily eliminate, matrix effects due to high concentrations of organic compounds (International Agency for Research on Cancer 1991).
4.3 Target compound contaminants
or related organics in solvents, reagents, glassware, isotopically labeled spiking standards, and other sample processing hardware are potential method interferences. Routinely evaluate all these materials to demonstrate that they are either free from interferences under the conditions of the analysis, or that the interference does not compromise the quality of the analysis results. Evaluate chemical interference through the preparation and analysis of an LMB. Use high purity reagents, solvents, and standards to minimize interferences in sample analysis.
4.4 PAH
are subject to degradation when exposed to ultraviolet light. Take precautions to shield samples from sunlight or fluorescent light sources during sample collection, recovery, extraction, cleanup, and concentration.

# 5.0 Safety
Note:
Develop a strict laboratory safety program for the handling of PCDD, PCDF, PCB, and/or PAH.
5.1 Compounds in the PCDD and PCDF
classes such as 2,3,7,8-TeCDD are aneugenic, carcinogenic, and teratogenic in laboratory animal studies. Other PCDD and PCDF containing chlorine atoms in positions 2,3,7,8
have toxicities comparable to that of 2,3,7,8-TeCDD.
5.2 PCB and benzo[a]pyrene
are classified as known or suspected human or mammalian carcinogens. Be aware of the potential for inhalation and ingestion exposure to laboratory analysts.
5.3
This method recommends that the laboratory purchase dilute standard solutions of the analytes required for this method. However, if preparing primary solutions, use a hood or glove box. Laboratory personnel handling primary solutions should wear personal protective equipment including a toxic gas respirator mask fitted with charcoal filters approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)/Mine Safety Health Administration (MSHA) to prevent the inhalation of airborne particulates if not working in an approved hood or glove box.
5.4
The toxicity or carcinogenicity of other reagents or chemicals used in this method is not precisely defined. However, treat each chemical as a potential health hazard and minimize exposure to these chemicals. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. Ensure that a reference file or list of internet sites that contain safety data sheets (SDS) is available to all personnel involved in the sampling and chemical analysis of samples known or suspected to contain PCDD, PCDF, PCB, and PAH.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
Note:
Brand names, suppliers, and part numbers are for illustration purposes only and no endorsement is implied. Apparatus and materials other than those specified in this method may achieve equivalent performance. Meeting the performance requirements of this method is the responsibility of the source testing team and laboratory team.
6.1 Sampling Apparatus.
Figure 23-1 of this method shows a schematic of the Method 23 sampling train. Do not use sealing greases or brominated flame retardant-coated tape in assembling the train. Do not use silicon tubing in direct contact with flue gases. The train is identical to that described in Section 6.1.1 of Method 5 of Appendix A-3 to 40 CFR part 60 with the following additions:
6.1.1 Nozzle. The nozzle must be made of quartz, borosilicate glass, or titanium. Stainless steel nozzles should not be used.
6.1.2 Probe Liner. Use either polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), borosilicate, or quartz glass probe liners with a heating system capable of maintaining a probe gas temperature of 120 ± 14 °C (248 ± 25 °F) during sampling, or such other temperature as specified by an applicable subpart of the standards or as approved by the Administrator. Use a PTFE ferrule or single-use PTFE coated O-ring to achieve the seal at the nozzle end of the probe for stack temperatures up to about 300 °C (572 °F). Use a quartz glass liner and integrated quartz nozzle for stack temperatures between 300 and 1,200 °C (572 and 2,192 °F).
6.1.3 Filter Holder. Use a filter holder of borosilicate glass with a PTFE frit or PTFE-coated wire filter support. The holder design should provide a positive seal against leakage from the outside or around the filter. The holder should be durable, easy to load, leak-free in normal applications, and positioned immediately following the probe and cyclone bypass (or cyclone, if used) with the active side of the filter perpendicular to the source of the flow.
6.1.4 Filter Heating System. Use any heating system capable of monitoring and maintaining the temperature around the filter to ensure that the sample gas temperature exiting the filter is 120 ± 14 °C (248 ± 25 °F) during sampling or such other temperature as specified by an applicable subpart of the standards or approved by the Administrator for a particular application.
6.1.5 Filter Temperature Sensor. Install a temperature sensor capable of measuring temperature to within ±3 °C (5.4 °F) so that the sensing tip protrudes at least 1.3 centimeters (cm) (1-2 in.) into the sample gas exiting the filter. Encase the sensing tip of the sensor in glass or PTFE, if needed.
6.1.6 Sample Transfer Line. The sample transfer line transports gaseous emissions from the heated filter holder to the condenser and must be heat traced and constructed of glass or PTFE with connecting fittings that form leak-free, vacuum-tight connections without using sealing greases or tapes. Keep the sample transfer lines as short as possible and maintain the lines at a temperature of 120 °C ± 14 °C (248 °F ± 25 °F) using active heating when necessary. Orient the sample transfer lines with the downstream end lower than the upstream end so that any condensate will flow away from the filter and into the condenser.
6.1.7 Condenser. Glass, water-jacketed, coil-type with compatible fittings. Orient the condenser to cause moisture to flow down to the adsorbent module to facilitate condensate drainage. Figure 23-2 of this method shows a schematic diagram of the condenser.
6.1.8 Water Circulating Bath. Use a bath pump circulating system capable of providing chilled water flow to the condenser and adsorbent module water jackets. Typically, a submersible pump is placed in the impinger ice water bath to circulate the ice water contained in the bath. Verify the function of this system by measuring the gas
temperature at the entrance to the adsorbent module. Maintain this temperature at
20 °C (68 °F).
6.1.9 Adsorbent Module. Use a water-jacketed glass container to hold up to 40 grams (g) of the solid adsorbent. Figure 23-2 of this method shows a schematic diagram of the adsorbent module. Other physical configurations of the adsorbent resin module/condenser assembly are acceptable if the configuration contains the requisite amount of solid adsorbent and maintains the minimum length-to-width adsorbent bed ratio of two-to-one. Orient the adsorbent module vertically to facilitate condensate drainage. The connecting fittings must form leak-free, vacuum-tight seals. Include a coarse glass frit in the adsorbent module to retain the adsorbent.
6.1.10 Impingers. Use five impingers connected in series with leak-free ground glass fittings or any similar leak-free noncontaminating fittings. The first impinger must be a short-stem (water-dropout) design or equivalent. The second, fourth, and fifth impingers must be of the Greenburg-Smith design, modified by replacing the tip with a 1.3 cm (
1/2
in.) inside diameter (ID) glass tube extending to approximately 1.3 cm (
1/2
in.) from the bottom of the flask. The third impinger must be of the Greenburg-Smith design with the standard tip. The second and third impingers must contain known quantities of water, and the fifth impinger must contain a known weight of silica gel or equivalent desiccant. Alternatively, you may omit the first impinger if you do not expect excess moisture in the sample gas.
6.2 Sample Recovery Equipment.
6.2.1 Fitting Caps. Use leak-free ground glass fittings or any similar leak-free non-contaminating fitting to cap the sections of the sampling train exposed to the sample gas. Alternatively, use PTFE tape or contaminant-free aluminum foil for this purpose (see Section 6.2.6 of this method).
6.2.2 Wash Bottles. Use PTFE bottles.
6.2.3 Probe-Liner, Probe-Nozzle, and Filter-Holder Brushes. Use inert bristle brushes with precleaned stainless steel or PTFE handles. Extensions of the probe brush must be made of stainless steel or PTFE and be at least as long as the probe. Use brushes that are properly sized and shaped to remove accumulated material from the nozzle and probe liner if used.
6.2.4 Filter Storage Container. Use a sealed filter holder, wide-mouth amber glass jar with PTFE-lined cap, or glass petri dish sealed with PTFE tape. Purchase precleaned amber glass jars and petri dishes, or clean according to the glassware cleaning procedures listed in Section 8.1.1.1 of this method.
6.2.5 Field Balance. Use a weighing device capable of measurements to an accuracy of 0.5 g.
6.2.6 Aluminum Foil. Use heavy duty aluminum foil cleaned by rinsing three times with hexane or toluene and stored in a pre-cleaned glass petri dish or glass jar. Do not use aluminum foil to wrap or contact filter samples due to the possibility of reaction between the sample and the aluminum.
6.2.7 Silica Adsorbent Storage Container. Use an air-tight container to store silica gel.
6.2.8 Glass Sample Storage Container. Recover samples in amber glass bottles, 500- or 1000-milliliters (mL) with leak-free PTFE-lined caps. Either purchase precleaned bottles or clean containers according to glassware cleaning procedures listed in Section 8.1.1.1 of this method.
6.3 Sample Extraction Equipment.
6.3.1 Sample Container. Use 125- and 250-mL amber glass bottles with PTFE-lined caps.
6.3.2 Test Tubes. Use glass test tubes or small (
e.g.,
5 to 10 mL) amber vials.
6.3.3 Soxhlet/Dean-Stark Extraction Apparatus.
6.3.3.1 Soxhlet Apparatus. Use 200-mL capacity thimble holder capable of holding 43 × 123-millimeter (mm) extraction thimbles, with receiving flask (typically round-bottom).
6.3.3.2 Moisture Trap. Use Dean-Stark or Barret with fluoropolymer stopcock trap to fit between the Soxhlet extractor body and the condenser as shown in Figure 23-3 of this method.
Note:
Dean-Stark or Barret traps are used to remove water with extraction solvents that are less dense and insoluble in water.
6.3.3.3 Extraction Thimble. Use quartz, glass, or glass fiber thimble, typically 43 × 123 mm to fit Soxhlet apparatus. The use of cellulose thimbles for sample extraction in this method is prohibited.
6.3.3.4 Heating Mantle. Use a hemispherical shaped heating mantle to fit round-bottom flask.
6.3.4 Kuderna-Danish (KD) Concentrator. Use an apparatus consisting of a three-ball Snyder column, a flask with leak-free joint to accept the three-ball Snyder column at the top, a leak-free joint to receive a graduated concentration tube at the bottom and a heating mantle.
Note:
Rotary evaporation has only been demonstrated when analyzing PCDD/PCDF. The KD with Snyder column is recommended when analyzing for PAH and/or PCB to avoid evaporation loss resulting in failed performance criteria for pre-extraction spike recovery.
6.3.5 Nitrogen Evaporative Concentrator. Use a nitrogen evaporative concentrator equipped with a water bath with the temperature controlled in the range of 30 to 60 °C (86 to 140 °F) (N-Evap Organomation Associates, Inc., South Berlin, MA, or equivalent).
6.3.6 Separatory Funnels. Use glass or PTFE 2-liter separatory funnels.
6.4 Glass Liquid Chromatography Columns.
6.4.1 Pasteur Pipettes. Use disposable pipettes, or glass serological pipettes typically 150 mm long × 6 mm ID.
6.4.2 Liquid Chromatography Columns. 200 to 300 mm long × 20 mm ID with 250-mL reservoir.
6.5 Analytical Equipment.
6.5.1 Gas Chromatograph. Use a gas chromatograph consisting of the following components:
6.5.1.1 GC Oven. Use an oven capable of maintaining the separation column at the proper operating temperature ± 1.0 °C (1.8 °F) and performing programmed increases in temperature at rates of at least 40 °C/min with isothermal hold.
6.5.1.2 GC Temperature Monitor. Use a temperature monitor to measure column oven temperature to ± 1.0 °C (1.8 °F).
6.5.1.3 GC Flow System. Use an electronic pressure control or equivalent gas metering system to control carrier gas flow or pressure.
6.5.1.4 GC Injection Port. Use a split/splitless injection port in the splitless mode or on-column injection port for the capillary column.
6.5.2 Capillary GC Column. Use different columns for the analysis of the different target compound classes in this method, if needed. Perform the resolution checks in Sections 10.2.3.5 and 10.2.3.6 of this method to document the required resolution. Compound separation must meet the resolution specifications in Section 10.2.3.5 of this method and the identification specifications found in Section 11.4.3.4 of this method.
6.5.2.1 PCDD/PCDF Column. Gas chromatographic columns used to measure PCDD/PCDF should be capable of achieving separation of the 17 PCDD/PCDF target compounds from the nearest eluting target compound(s). The valley height resolution between 2,3,7,8-substituted TeCDD and TeCDF and the nearest eluting isomers must not exceed 25% of the taller of the two peaks. The valley height resolution between all other target PCDD/PCDF compounds and the nearest eluting targets (or interference) must not exceed 40% of the taller of the two peaks.
Note:
Fishman, et al. (see Section 16.3 of this method) demonstrated that all TEF isomers can be fully differentiated from closely eluting isomers using either of two sets of non-polar and polar stationary phase combinations. One set consisted of 5% phenyl methylpolysiloxane (DB-5, HP-5MS, Rtx-5MS, Equity-5) and 50% cyanopropylmethyl, 50% phenylmethylsiloxane (DB-225, SP 2331) GC columns and the other set consisted of 5% phenyl, 94% methyl, 1% vinyl silicone bonded-phase (DB-5MS, ZB-5MS, VF-5MS, CP-Sil 8 CB LowBleed/MS) with 50% cyanopropylmethyl, 50% phenylmethylsiloxane (SP-2331).
6.5.2.2 PAH Column. Use column systems for measuring PAH that can achieve separation of anthracene and phenanthrene at m/z 178 such that the valley between the peaks does not exceed 50% of the taller of the two peaks, and benzo[
b
]fluoranthene and benzo[
k
]fluoranthene such that the valley between the peaks is less than 60% of the height of the taller peak. These requirements are achievable using a 30-m narrow bore (0.25 mm ID) 5% phenyl polysilphenylene-siloxane (BPX5 or equivalent) bonded-phase, fused-silica capillary column.
6.5.2.3 PCB Column. Use column systems for measuring PCB that can achieve unique resolution and identification of the toxics for determination of a TEQ
PCB
using toxic equivalency factors (TEF). Resolution is shown by a valley between the peaks not exceeding 40% of the taller of the two peaks. Isomers may be unresolved if they have the same TEF and RRF and if these unresolved isomers are uniquely resolved from all other congeners. These requirements are achievable using several 30-meter (m) narrow bore (0.25 mm ID) columns including 8% phenyl polycarborane-siloxane (HT8), DB-XLB, and poly (50% n-octyl/50% methyl siloxane) (SPB-Octyl). Quantification of unresolved isomers should use the nearest eluting target PCB pre-extraction standard in Appendix A of this method, unless otherwise specified in applicable rule, regulation, or permit.
Note:
If all 209 PCB are analyzed the 17 toxic PCB congeners should be resolved and reported while the other PCB can be reported as totals by homolog, for example, total TrCB.
6.5.3 Mass Spectrometer. Instrument employing 28 to 70 electron volt ionization. The instrument and data system must be capable of repetitive monitoring of at least 12 exact m/z values with a mass resolution defined in Section 10.2.1 within the measurement mass range. The recommended lock-mass ions to be used for mass drift correction are presented in Tables 23-4, 23-5, and 23-6 of this method for PCDD/PCDF, PAH, and PCB, respectively, as applicable to target analytes. Mass drifts of 5 parts per million (ppm) or more can have serious effects on instrument performance.
6.5.4 Mass Spectrometer Data System. Use a data system compatible with the mass spectrometer and capable of sequencing and monitoring multiple groups of selected ions.
6.5.5 Analytical Balance. Use an analytical balance to measure within 0.1 milligram (mg).

0.05% penetration) on 0.3-micron dioctyl phthalate smoke particles.
7.1.1 Conduct a QC check on the filter lot prior to the field test to demonstrate that filters are free from contamination or interference by extracting and analyzing a minimum of three filters from each lot as follows. Spike with pre-extraction and pre-extraction filter recovery standards for target compounds to be measured and extract each filter separately with toluene as described in Section 11 of this method. After extraction, remove the filters and the solvent from the filters under clean conditions (
e.g.,
a clean nitrogen stream). Analyze the extracts according to the procedures in Section 11 of this method, including adding pre-analysis standard. This filter check analysis must meet the performance requirements in Section 13.1 of this method. Ongoing analysis of LMB can be used to fulfill this check. If criteria are not met for target compounds, repeat with additional filters from the lot or evaluate another lot.
7.2 Adsorbent Resin. Amberlite® XAD-2 resin.
All adsorbent resin must meet the cleanliness criteria described for LMB in Section 13.1 of this method following the same extraction, concentration, cleanup, and analysis steps as field samples. This method recommends using the procedures provided in Appendix B to this method to clean the resin before use, if needed. However, this method allows alternative cleanup procedures that use automated extraction equipment if the adsorbent meets the required performance criteria described for LMB in Section 13.1 of this method.
7.2.1 Conduct a QC check on the cleaned adsorbent lot or batch following the extraction and analyses procedures in Section 11 of this method, including adding applicable labeled standards. The cleaned adsorbent must meet the criteria described for LMB in Section 13.1 of this method. An LMB conducted with an adsorbent lot or batch can serve this purpose.

e.g.,
tetradecane, nonane, decane). Pesticide grade.
Note:
Lower homologous series alkanes (nonane or decane) are necessary for higher volatility targets such as MoCB and naphthalene to maintain retention during concentration procedures. However, do not take samples to dryness when using these lower alkane homologs.
7.8.9 Liquid Column Chromatography Packing Materials. Use the following column chromatography packing materials, as needed, to prepare sample extracts by fractionation and removal of interferences. Commercially prepacked cleaning columns may be available for this purpose. The liquid column chromatography packing materials must be adequate to clean the samples to be fit for purpose and meet the performance criteria of this method. All procedures for preparing column chromatography packing materials are recommendations shown to meet the performance specifications required for the recovery of labeled compounds described in Section 13 of this method.
7.8.9.1 Alumina. Use either acidic or basic alumina in the cleanup of sample extracts. Use the same type of alumina for all samples in an analytical sequence, including those used to demonstrate LMB performance.
7.8.9.1.1 Acidic Alumina (Sigma-Aldrich® 199966 or equivalent). Brockmann activity grade 1, 100-200 mesh. Prior to use, activate the alumina by heating for 12 hours at 130 °C (266 °F). Store in a desiccator. You may use pre-activated alumina purchased from a supplier as received.
7.8.9.1.2 Basic Alumina (Sigma-Aldrich® 19943 or equivalent). Brockmann activity grade 1. Activate by heating to 600 °C (1,112 °F) for a minimum of 24 hours. Do not heat to over 700 °C (1,292 °F) because this can lead to reduced capacity for retaining the target compounds. Store at 130 °C (266 °F) in a covered flask. Recommended storage time for
acidic alumina is up to five days from baking. Use prepacked alumina columns immediately after opening the vacuum-sealed pouch or container.
7.8.9.2 Florisil®. Activated, 60-100 mesh recommended. Heat previously activated Florisil® in a glass container loosely covered with aluminum foil in an oven at 130 to 150 °C (266 to 302 °F) for a minimum of 24 hours. Allow to cool and store activated Florisil® silica in a desiccator.
7.8.9.3 Silica Gel. Use either activated, acid- or base-coated silica gel in the cleanup of sample extracts. Use the same type of silica gel for all samples in an analytical sequence, including those used to demonstrate LMB performance.
7.8.9.3.1 Activated Silica Gel. Supelco® 1-3651, Bio-Sil® A, 100-200 mesh (or equivalent). Prior to use, silica gel should be activated by solvent rinsing and heat activation. It is recommended to rinse with methylene chloride and activate the silica gel by heating for at least 1 hour at 180 °C (356 °F). After allowing to cool, rinse the silica gel sequentially with methanol and toluene. Heat the rinsed silica gel at 50 °C (122 °F) for 10 minutes, then increase the temperature gradually to 180 °C (356 °F) over 25 minutes and maintain the gel at this temperature for 90 minutes. Allow to cool in a desiccator to room temperature and store in a glass container with a PTFE-lined screw cap. Alternative conditioning procedure may be used if the performance criteria in Section 13.1 are met for target compounds.
7.8.9.3.2 Acidic Silica Gel (30% weight/weight). Combine 100 g of activated silica gel with 44 g of concentrated sulfuric acid in a clean screw-capped glass container and agitate thoroughly. Disperse the solids with a stirring rod until obtaining a uniform mixture of acid-coated silica gel. Store the mixture in a glass container with a PTFE-lined screw cap.
7.8.9.3.3 Basic Silica Gel. Combine 30 g of 1 N sodium hydroxide with 100 g of activated silica gel in a clean screw-capped glass container and agitate thoroughly. Disperse solids with a stirring rod until obtaining a uniform mixture of base-coated silica gel. Store the mixture in glass container with a PTFE-lined screw cap.
7.8.9.4 Carbon/Celite® 545 (or equivalent solid support). Use of a carbon-based column cleanup material (
e.g.,
one of the many including for example Carbopack® B or C) to further remove non-planar impurities from the samples prior to analysis may be necessary. You must evaluate alternative carbon-based sorbents for this purpose prior to their use. An 18% weight/weight mixture of Carbopack® C and Celite® 545 has been used for this purpose and should be activated at 130 °C (266 °F) for a minimum of 6 hours. Allow to cool and store this mixture in a desiccator.
7.8.10 Nitrogen. 99.999% (ultra-high) purity.
7.9 Sample Analysis.
7.9.1 Helium. 99.999% (ultra-high) purity.
7.9.2 Spiking Standards. Prepare spiking standards quantitatively at a convenient concentration (
e.g.,
10 nanograms (ng)/mL) or use commercial standards if available, to enable accurate spiking of a labeled standard at various stages of the sample and extract preparation. You may adjust the sample fortification concentrations from those recommended in Tables 23-7, 23-8, and 23-9 of this method to accommodate the concentration of target compounds anticipated in samples if the performance criteria in Section 13 of this method are met.
Note:
When adjusting the fortification concentrations in the final sample extract, consider variables such as the aliquot of extract used and injection volume of samples and calibration.
7.9.3 Pre-Sampling Adsorbent Standard. Prepare stock standard solutions in nonane to enable spiking so that the isotopically labeled compounds in the final sample extract are at the concentration shown under the heading “Pre-sampling Adsorbent Standard” in Tables 23-7, 23-8, and 23-9 of this method, for applicable target compound classes.
7.9.4 Pre-extraction Filter Recovery Standard.

7.9.5 Pre-extraction Standard. Prepare stock standard solutions in nonane to enable spiking so that the isotopically labeled compounds in the final sample extract are at the concentration shown under the heading “Pre-extraction Standard” in Tables 23-7, 23-8, and 23-9 of this method, for applicable target compound classes.
7.9.6 Pre-analysis Standard. Prepare stock standard solutions in nonane to enable spiking so that the isotopically labeled compounds in the final sample extract are at the concentration shown under the heading “Pre-analysis Standard” in Tables 23-7, 23-8, and 23-9 of this method, for applicable target compound classes.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, and Storage
8.1 Sampling.
This method involves collection and recovery of trace concentrations of target semivolatile organic compounds. Therefore, field sampling and recovery staff should be trained and experienced in the best practices for handling and using organic solvents in field environments to recover and protect samples from contamination.
8.1.1 Pretest Preparation.
8.1.1.1 Cleaning Glassware. Clean glassware thoroughly before using. This section provides a recommended procedure, but any protocol that consistently results in contamination-free glassware meeting the LMB criteria in Section 13.1 of this method is acceptable.
8.1.1.1.1 Soak all glassware in hot soapy water (Alconox® or equivalent).
8.1.1.1.2 Rinse with hot tap water.
8.1.1.1.3 Rinse with deionized/distilled water.
8.1.1.1.4 Rinse with methanol.
8.1.1.1.5 Rinse with toluene.
8.1.1.1.6 Baking glassware up to 400 °C (752 °F) for a minimum of 2 hours may be necessary to remove contaminants or interferents from particularly dirty samples. Allow glassware to cool after baking.
Note:
Repeated baking of glassware may cause active sites on the glass surface that may irreversibly adsorb target compounds.
8.1.1.1.7 Cover glassware openings with clean glass fitting caps or cleaned aluminum foil (see Section 6.2.6 of this method).
8.1.1.1.8 Rinse glassware immediately before use with acetone and toluene.
Note:
To prepare heavily soiled glassware, remove surface residuals from the glassware by soaking in hot soapy water, rinsing with hot water, then soaking with a non-chromic acid oxidizing cleaning reagent in a strong acid (
e.g.,
NOCHROMIX® prepared according to manufacturer's directions). After the acid soak, rinse with hot water and repeat the cleaning procedures in Section 8.1.1.1 of this method.
8.1.1.2 Adsorbent Module. Load the modules in a clean area to avoid contamination. Fill a module with 20 to 40 g of XAD-2. Spike modules before the sampling event, but do not spike the modules in the field. Add the pre-sampling adsorbent standard to the top quarter of the adsorbent bed rather than onto the top or bottom of the adsorbent bed. Add sufficient spike (picograms (pg)/module) to result in the final sample theoretical concentrations specified in Tables 23-7, 23-8, and 23-9 of this method for PCDD/PCDF, PAH, and PCB, respectively, and to be above the lowest calibration concentration to ensure the standard recovery is quantitative. For samples with known or anticipated target compound concentration significantly higher or lower than the specified concentration in these tables, adjust the pre-sampling adsorbent standard concentration to the expected native compound concentration, but no less than 10 times the method detection limit (MDL). Follow the XAD-2 with cleaned glass wool and tightly cap both ends of the module. For analysis that includes PAH, use spiked modules within 14 days of preparation. See Table 23-10 of this method for storage conditions.
8.1.1.3 Sampling Train. Figure 23-1 of this method shows the complete sampling train. Follow the best practices by maintaining all sampling train components according to the procedure described in APTD-0576 Maintenance, Calibration, and Operation of Isokinetic Source-sampling Equipment (U.S. EPA 1972).
8.1.1.4 Silica Gel. Weigh several 200 to 300 g portions of silica gel in an air-tight container to the nearest 0.5 g. Record the total weight of the silica gel plus container, on the outside of each container. As an alternative, directly weigh the silica gel in its impinger or sampling holder just prior to sampling.
8.1.1.5 Filter. Check each filter against light for irregularities and flaws or pinhole leaks. Pack the filters flat in a clean glass container. Do not mark filters with ink or any other contaminating substance.
8.1.2 Preliminary Determinations. Use the procedures specified in Section 8.2 of Method 5 of Appendix A-3 to 40 CFR part 60.
8.1.2.1 Sample Volume. Unless otherwise specified in an applicable rule, regulation, or permit, sample for a minimum of 2 minutes at each traverse point. This method recommends sampling a minimum of 2.5 dry standard cubic meters (dscm).
8.1.2.2 For continuously operating processes, use the same sampling time at each traverse point. To avoid timekeeping errors, use an integer, or an integer plus one-half minute, for each traverse point.
8.1.2.3 For batch processes, determine the minimum operating cycle duration, dividing the sampling time evenly between the required numbers of traverse points. After sampling all traverse points once, sample each point again for the same duration of time per sampling point in reverse order until the operating cycle is completed. Sample all traverse points at least once during each test run.
8.1.3 Preparation of Sampling Train.
8.1.3.1 During field preparation and assembly of the sampling train, keep all train openings where contamination can enter sealed until just prior to assembly or until sampling is about to begin. To protect the adsorbent module from radiant heat and sunlight, you must wrap the module with aluminum foil or other suitable material capable of shielding the module from light. The XAD-2 adsorbent resin temperature must never exceed 50 °C (122 °F) because thermal decomposition will occur. Clean and prepare a complete set of sampling train components that will contact the sample for each sampling run, including one complete set to be used as a field train proof blank as a tool to evaluate equipment preparation and potential contamination during sample recovery as described in Section 9.6 of this method.
8.1.3.2 Place approximately 100 mL of water in the second and third impingers but leave the first and fourth impingers empty.
Transfer approximately 200 g or more of silica gel from its container to the fifth impinger. Weigh each impinger and the adsorbent module, including the fitting caps, to the nearest 0.5 g using the field balance and record the weight for moisture determination. Remove the aluminum foil from the adsorbent module before weighing. Keep the module out of direct sunlight and rewrap the module with foil immediately after recording the module weight.
8.1.3.3 Using tweezers or clean disposable surgical gloves, place a filter in the filter holder. Be sure that the filter is properly centered, and the gasket properly placed, to prevent the sample gas stream from circumventing the filter. Check the filter for tears after completing the assembly.
8.1.3.4 Prepare the inside of the sampling probe and nozzle by brushing each component while rinsing three times each with acetone and toluene. Install the selected nozzle, using the connecting systems described in Section 6.1.2 of this method. Mark the probe with heat resistant tape or by some other method to denote the proper distance into the stack or duct for each sampling point. Assemble the train as shown in Figure 23-1 of this method. Orient the adsorbent module vertically so condensed moisture drains into the first impinger. See APTD-0576 Maintenance, Calibration, and Operation of Isokinetic Source-sampling Equipment (U.S. EPA 1972) for details.
8.1.3.5 Turn on the recirculation pump to the adsorbent module and condenser coil and begin monitoring the temperature of the gas entering the adsorbent module. Ensure proper temperature of the gas entering the adsorbent module before proceeding.
8.1.4 Leak-Check Procedure. Same as Section 8.4 of Method 5 of Appendix A-3 to 40 CFR part 60.
8.1.5 Sampling Train Operation. Same as Sections 8.5.1 through 8.5.9 of Method 5 of Appendix A-3 to 40 CFR part 60.
8.1.5.1 Monitor the filter temperature with a sensor and record the filter temperature during sampling to ensure a sample gas temperature exiting the filter of 120 °C ± 14 °C (248 °F ± 25 °F), or such other temperature as specified by an applicable subpart of the standards or approved by the Administrator for an application of this method.
8.1.5.2 During testing, you must record the temperature of the gas entering the XAD-2 adsorbent module. The temperature of the gas must not exceed 20 °C (68 °F) for efficient capture of the target compounds.
8.2 Sample Recovery.
Begin the cleanup procedure as soon as the probe is removed from the stack at the end of the sampling period. Seal the nozzle end of the sampling probe with PTFE tape or clean (
e.g.,
toluene rinsed) aluminum foil.
8.2.1 When the probe can be safely handled, wipe off all external particulate matter near the tip of the probe. Conduct a post-test leak check. Remove the probe from the train and close off both ends with PTFE tape or clean aluminum foil. Seal off the inlet to the train with PTFE tape, a ground glass cap, or clean aluminum foil.
8.2.2 Transfer the probe and impinger assembly to the cleanup area. This method recommends cleaning and enclosing this area to minimize the chances of losing or contaminating the sample. To avoid sample contamination and unnecessary exposure to toxic chemicals, smoking or eating in the sample recovery area shall not be allowed.
8.2.3 Inspect the train prior to and during disassembly. Note and record any abnormal conditions (
e.g.,
broken filters, colored impinger liquid). Recover and prepare samples for shipping as follows in Sections 8.2.4 through 8.2.12 of this method.
8.2.4 Container No. 1. Either seal the filter holder or carefully remove the filter from the filter holder and place it in its identified container. If it is necessary to remove the filter, use a pair of cleaned tweezers to handle the filter. If necessary, fold the filter such that the particulate cake is inside the fold. Carefully transfer to the container any particulate matter and filter fibers that adhere to the filter holder gasket by using a dry inert bristle brush and a sharp-edged blade. Seal the container and store cool (≤20 °C, 68 °F) for transport to the laboratory.
8.2.5 Adsorbent Module Sample. Remove the module from the train, tightly cover both ends with fitting caps and PTFE tape, remove the foil, drain the recirculating water from the module, weigh and record the module weight, and label the adsorbent module. Moisture measurement in the field using the Method 23 train requires weighing the adsorbent module before sampling and after sampling as part of the sample recovery.
8.2.6 Container No. 2. Quantitatively recover material deposited in the nozzle, the front half of the filter holder, and the cyclone, if used, by brushing while rinsing three times with acetone followed by three rinses with toluene. Collect all the rinses in Container No. 2.
8.2.7 Rinse the back half of the filter holder three times with acetone followed by three rinses with toluene. Rinse the sample transfer line between the filter and the condenser three times with acetone followed by three rinses with toluene. If using a separate condenser and adsorbent module, rinse the condenser three times with acetone followed by three rinses with toluene. Collect all the rinses in Container No. 2 and mark the level of the liquid on the container.
8.2.8 Moisture Weight. Weigh the adsorbent module, impingers, and silica gel impinger to within ±0.5 g using the field balance and record the weights. This information is required to calculate the moisture content of the effluent gas. For PCDD/PCDF-
only measurements, discard the liquid after measuring and recording the weight.
8.2.9 Container No. 3. You must save and analyze impinger water samples if PAH and/or PCB are the target compounds. Quantitatively recover impinger water samples for analysis if PAH and/or PCB are the target compounds by rinsing three times with acetone followed by three rinses with toluene. Collect impinger water and rinses in Container No. 3 and mark the level of the liquid on the container.
8.2.10 Silica Gel. Note the color of the indicating silica gel to determine if it has been completely spent and report its condition on the field data sheet.
8.2.11 Field Sample Handling, Preservation, Storage, and Transport. Store all field samples temporarily in cool (≤20 °C, 68 °F) and dark conditions prior to transport to the laboratory. Ship samples cool (≤20 °C, 68 °F), shielded from ultraviolet light. In addition, follow the procedures in American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D6911-15 (Guide for Packaging and Shipping Environmental Samples for Laboratory Analysis) for all samples, where appropriate. To avoid contamination of the samples, pay special attention to cleanliness during transport, field handling, sampling, recovery, and laboratory analysis, as well as during preparation of the adsorbent cartridges.
8.2.12 Sample Custody. Proper procedures and documentation for sample chain of custody are critical to ensuring data integrity. Follow the chain of custody procedures in ASTM D4840-99(2018)e1 (Standard Guide for Sample Chain-of-Custody Procedures) for all samples (including field samples and blanks).
8.3 Sample Storage Conditions and Laboratory Hold Times.
8.3.1 Table 23-10 of this method summarizes the sample storage conditions and laboratory hold times.
8.3.2 Store sampling train rinses and filter samples in the dark at the storage conditions in Table 23-10 from the time the laboratory receives the samples until analysis.
8.3.3 You may store adsorbent samples for PCDD/PCDF or PCB analysis prior to extraction in the dark at 6 °C (43 °F) or less for up to one year from the time the laboratory receives the samples.
Note:
The hold times listed in this method for adsorbent samples for PCDD/PCDF and PCB are recommendations as these compounds are very stable under the conditions listed in this section.
8.3.4 Protect adsorbent samples destined for PAH analysis from ultraviolet light. You may store adsorbent samples for PAH analysis in the dark at 6 °C (43 °F) or less for up to 30 days from the time the laboratory receives the samples.
8.3.5 Analyze PAH extracts within 40 days of extraction.
8.3.6 You may store sample aliquots including archived extracts of PCDD/PCDF, PAH and/or PCB samples in the dark at −10 °C (14 °F) or less for up to one year. Sample extracts must not be stored with pierced septa.
Note:
The hold times listed in this method for sample aliquots for PCDD/PCDF and PCB are recommendations as these compounds are very stable under the conditions listed in this section.

# 9.0 Quality Control
Note:
In recognition of advances that are occurring in sampling and analytical technology, and to allow the test team to overcome analyte sensitivity and matrix interferences, this method allows certain options to increase sample collection volume and to improve separations and the quality of the analysis results for target analytes. It is the laboratory's responsibility to establish the conditions for optimum sample extraction, cleanup, and concentration to meet the performance criteria in this method. However, you may not change the fundamental sampling and analysis techniques, isokinetic sampling with an adsorbent collection media followed by sample extraction, and HRMS detection and isotopic dilution quantification procedures. Section 13 of this method specifies the performance criteria to ensure that options employed for a sample set and analytes of interest are equal to or better than the specificity of the techniques in this method. The minimum requirements of this method consist of the initial demonstration of capability (IDC) and ongoing QC requirements. The analysis team shall perform an IDC to demonstrate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method as described in Section 9.3. The ongoing QC includes performing CCVs and LMBs to evaluate an individual laboratory's performance against the criteria in this method. The method includes analysis of samples spiked with labeled compounds to evaluate and document data quality. Laboratory performance is compared to established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics and requirements of the method.
9.1 Record and report data and information
that will allow an independent reviewer to validate the determination of each target compound concentration. Record and report the data as described in Sections 9.1.1 through 9.1.7 of this method and performance criteria results required in Section 13 of this method.
9.1.1 Sample numbers and other sample identifiers. Each sample must have a unique identifier.
9.1.2 Field sample volume.
9.1.3 Field sampling date.
9.1.4 Extraction dates.
9.1.5 Analysis dates and times.
9.1.6 Analysis sequence/run chronology.
9.1.7 Quantitation Reports.
9.1.7.1 This method does not consider EMPC-flagged data to be zero concentrations. Calculate and report the EMPC concentrations.
9.1.7.2 In determining compliance with any PCDD and PCDF standard developed using zero for values that are below the EDL of the method, including federal emission standards using Method 23 promulgated under 40 CFR parts 60 and 63 prior to March 20, 2023, use zero for the determination of total and weighted concentrations when the target compound is not detected. For all other circumstances, unless otherwise specified in applicable regulations, permits, or other requirements, when a target compound is measured at or below EDL, use EDL as the concentration for calculating compliance.
9.1.7.3 For each sample you must report EDLs, MDLs, LMBs and Field Train Proof Blank results and target compound analysis results.
9.2 Isotopically Labeled Standard Recovery.
9.2.1 Pre-sampling Adsorbent Standard and Pre-extraction Filter Recovery Standard Recoveries. Pre-sampling adsorbent standard and pre-extraction filter recovery standard recoveries must demonstrate on a per sample basis that recovery of the labeled standard achieved the requirements in Section 13 of this method. Recoveries below the acceptable range for the pre-sampling adsorbent standard may be an indication of breakthrough in the sampling train.
9.2.1.1 If the pre-sampling adsorbent standard average percent recovery is below 70%, the sampling run is not valid, and the stack test must be repeated. As an alternative, you do not have to repeat the stack test for invalid analyses if the pre-sampling adsorbent standard average percent recovery is 25% or more and you divide the final results by the fraction of the pre-sampling adsorbent standard average percent recovery.
9.2.1.2 If the percent recovery of all the pre-extraction filter recovery standard compounds is below 70%, you may reanalyze the sample. If the recovery is still below the limit, the filter sampling extraction is not valid, and you must repeat the stack or vent sampling and subsequent analysis.
9.2.2 Pre-extraction Standard Recoveries. Pre-extraction standard recoveries must demonstrate on a per sample basis that recovery of the labeled standard achieved the requirements in Section 13.15 of this method. If the recovery criteria are not met, you may reanalyze the sample. If the recovery criteria are still not met, the sampling run is not valid, and the stack test must be repeated. Recoveries outside the acceptable range for pre-extraction standard are an indication that sample preparation procedures did not adequately address sample and or sample matrix processing to recover native target compounds.
9.2.3 Pre-analysis Standard Response. Pre-analysis standard recoveries must demonstrate on a per sample basis that adequate labeled standard signal meets the requirements in Section 13.16 of this method. Add pre-analysis standard to every sample (including blanks, QC samples, and calibration solutions) in a known concentration. If the prepared samples do not meet the pre-analysis standard response criteria, you may reanalyze and/or prepare and analyze archive samples to attempt meeting requirements for the compounds that do not meet the pre-analysis standard response criteria. Poor sensitivity compared to initial calibration response may indicate injection errors or instrument drift.
9.3 Initial Demonstration of Capability (IDC).
The IDC must be successfully performed prior to analyzing field samples by meeting the QC requirements in Table 23-18. The IDC must be repeated if changes are made to analytical parameters not previously validated during the IDC. This may include, for example, changing the sample volume, selecting alternate quantitation ions, extending the calibration range, adding additional pre-analysis standard, or adding additional pre-extraction standard. The same calibration range used during the IDC must be used for the analysis of field samples.
9.3.1 Perform initial calibration following the procedures in Section 10. The lowest calibration standard used to establish the initial calibration must not be less than three times the MDL. The initial calibration must meet performance criteria in Section 13.9.
9.3.2 Lowest Calibration Concentration Confirmation. Establish a target concentration for the lowest calibration standard based on the intended use of the method. The lowest calibration concentration may be established by a laboratory or programmatic lowest quantitative reporting requirement. The laboratory calibration curve must be set at or below this level. Perform seven replicate analyses of a calibration sample prepared at proposed lowest calibration concentration. The replicate analyses of the lowest calibration concentrations standards must meet the criteria in Sections 13.9 and 13.17.1.
Note:
Consider that establishing the lowest calibration concentration too low may cause repeated failure of ongoing QC requirements.
9.3.3 Calculate Lowest Calibration Statistics. Calculate the mean and standard deviation for each analyte in these replicates (those used in Section 9.3.2). Determine the Half Range for the Prediction Interval of Results (HRPIR) using Equation 23-13. Calculate the Upper and Lower Limits for the Prediction Interval of Results (PIR) with Equations 23-14 and 23-15.
9.3.4 Lowest Calibration Point Acceptance Criteria. The laboratory's ability to measure analyte concentrations down to the lowest calibration point is confirmed if the criteria presented in Section 13.17.1 are met. If these criteria are not met, the lowest calibration point as been set too low and must be confirmed at a higher concentration.
9.3.5 Demonstration of Low System Background. Analyze an LMB after the highest standard in the calibration range. If an automated extraction system is used, an LMB must be extracted on each port. Performance criteria are presented in Section 13.1. Note: When using automated systems, the same systems must be used for samples and QC samples, such as blanks and resin checks.
9.3.6 Initial Calibration Verification. A QCS must be analyzed during the IDC, and then following each initial calibration thereafter (at a minimum quarterly). A QCS is a mid-level standard prepared from a second source standard or prepared from a source of standards different from the source of calibration standards. The purpose of the QCS is to verify the integrity of the primary calibration standards. The acceptance criterion is presented in Section 13.11.
9.3.7 MDL. Perform an MDL determination using a minimum of seven spiked combined filter/sorbent media samples, spiked within 2 to 10 times of the expected MDL, and seven LMBs (combined filter/sorbent media) through all the steps of the method following the requirements in 40 CFR part 136 Appendix B. Confirm target compounds meet the qualitative identification criteria in Sections 13.12 and 13.13. The criteria for the MDL determination are presented in Section 13.6.1 of this method.
9.3.8 MDL Confirmation. Confirm newly determined MDLs by preparing a low-level spiked combined filter/sorbent media sample by spiking the sorbent with native target compounds at 1 to 5 times the MDL and pre-extraction standard at the concentration used to analyze field samples and analyze. The criterion for the MDL confirmation is presented in Section 13.6.1 of this method.
9.3.9 Demonstration of Precision. Prepare, extract, and analyze seven replicate spiked samples in a valid Extraction Batch. Fortify the spiked samples near the midpoint of the initial calibration curve. The criterion is presented in Section 13.17.2 and Table 23-18. Demonstration is repeated for failed compounds only.
9.3.10 Demonstration of Accuracy. Using the same set of replicate data generated for Section 9.3.9 of this method, calculate the average % recovery. The criterion is presented in Section 13.17.3 and Table 23-18. Demonstration is repeated for failed compounds only.
9.4 LMBs.
Evaluate background contamination from glassware, equipment, solvents, standards, and media used for sample batches using an LMB prepared and analyzed identically to the field samples, including the same labeled standards, media, sodium sulfate, glass wool, glassware, solvents, etc. An LMB must be extracted with every batch of samples. Analyze an LMB at least once during each analytical sequence or every 12 hours, whichever period is shorter. If multiple LMB are required for an analytical sequence, report the initial LMB associated with each 12 hour analysis period.
9.5 EDL.
Calculate the EDL using Equation 23-11 of this method.
Note:
If the applicable compliance limit is total dioxin or total furan, report the sum of the EDLs for all the target compounds. If the applicable rule limit is a TEQ value, report the sum of the EDLs for all target compounds multiplied by their corresponding compound specific TEF.
9.6 Field Train Proof Blank Assessment.
Conduct at least one field train proof blank for each test series at a single facility. A field train proof blank is used to evaluate equipment preparation and potential contamination during sample recovery and consists of a fully assembled train at the sampling site. Prepare and assemble the field train proof blank train in a manner identical to that described in Sections 8.1.3 and 8.1.4 of this method using glassware from the same preparation batch as the field samples. The field train proof blank train must remain assembled for the same average amount of time samples are collected. Recover the field train proof blank train as described in Section 8.2 of this method. Follow all subsequent steps for field train proof blank train sample preparation and analysis used for field samples including data reporting. Section 13.1 of this method describes the criteria for the field train proof blank.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization
10.1 Sampling System.
Same as Sections 6.1 and 10.1 through 10.7 of Method 5 of Appendix A-3 to 40 CFR part 60.
10.2 HRGC/HRMS System.
10.2.1 Mass Resolution. Tune the HRMS instrument to a resolving power of at least 10,000 at 10% percent of the peak height or 25,000 at 50% percent of the peak height. The resolving power for PAH and PCB analysis may be 8,000 at 10% of the peak height or 15,000 at 50% of the peak height. Assess the resolution at three exact m/z's representing the low-, mid-, and high-m/z range of the masses used to measure the target compound class. You may use peak matching and the chosen perfluoro-kerosene (PFK) or perfluorotributylamine (FC43) reference peak to verify that the exact mass is within 5 ppm of the required value.
10.2.2 Initial Calibration. Calibrate the HRGC/HRMS system using a minimum of five concentrations over a range that brackets expected field sample concentrations and
the concentration of isotopically labeled standards in spiked samples. Tables 23-11, 23-12, and/or 23-13 of this method show the calibration concentrations recommended by this method, as applicable to the target compound classes. Determine the initial relative response factors for the target compounds and isotopically labeled standards using the initial calibration. Criteria for the initial calibration is in Section 13.9 of this method.
10.2.2.1 Lock-Mass Ions. Tables 23-4, 23-5, and 23-6 of this method present the recommended mass spectrometer lock-mass ions for PCDD/PCDF, PAH, and PCB, respectively. The reference compounds PFK or FC43 have ions that may be selected as your lock-mass and QC check ions. Monitor the QC check ions specified in these tables to verify instrument stability during the analysis (see Section 13.8 for performance criteria). Additional cleanup of the sample extract (or archive extract) and reanalysis is necessary for failure to maintain the lock-mass during analysis.
10.2.2.2 The relative standard deviation (RSD) for the mean calibration relative response factor from each of the unlabeled analytes and isotopically labeled compounds used in an analysis must be less than or equal to the values in Table 23-14 of this method.
10.2.2.3 The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio for the GC/MS signal present in every selected ion current profile must be greater than or equal to 10 in all concentrations of calibration standards for unlabeled targets and isotopically labeled standards. The ion abundance ratios must be within the control limits in Table 23-15 of this method.
Note:
An interference with PFK m/z 223.9872 may preclude meeting 10:1 S/N for the DiCB congeners at the optional Cal 1 level (Table 23-11). If this interference occurs, 10:1 S/N must be met at the Cal 2 level.
10.2.3 Continuing Calibration Verification.
10.2.3.1 Prepare the CCV standard at the same time as the batch of field samples using the same labeled standards. Prepare CCV standards at mid-level of the calibration (C3 level from Tables 23-11, 23-12, or 23-13 of this method). Inject a CCV standard, for the target compound class, at least once every 12 hours during an analysis sequence. Calculate the RRF for each compound and compare each RRF to the corresponding mean RRF obtained during the initial calibration. The RRF for each native compound measured in a CCV must not deviate from the initial calibration RRF by more than the limits shown in Table 23-14.
10.2.3.2 The ion abundance ratios must be within the allowable control limits shown in Table 23-15 of this method.
10.2.3.3 The S/N ratio for the GC/MS signal present in every selected ion current profile must be greater than or equal to 10.
10.2.3.4 Repeat the initial calibration when there is a failure to meet the requirements for acceptable CCV standard analysis.
10.2.3.5 Column Separation Check. Use the results from a CCV to verify and document the resolution required in Section 13.2, 13.3, or 13.4 of this method for the target compound classes analyzed with this method. If target compounds are not sufficiently resolved to meet the requirement, an analysis on a confirmation column is recommended (see Section 13.5 of this method).
10.2.3.6 If you use a confirmation column, perform the resolution check in Section 10.2.3.5 of this method to document the required resolution on the confirmation column. See Section 13.5 of this method on confirmation columns, if needed.

# 11.0 Analysis Procedure
11.1 Sample Extraction and Concentration.
The sample extraction procedures in this method are the same for PCDD, PCDF, PCB and PAH targets. Figure 23-4 provides a flow chart showing sample container combination and extraction steps. Do not allow samples and extracts destined for PAH or PCB analysis to concentrate to dryness because the lower molecular weight PAH and the mono- through tri-chlorobiphenyls may be totally or partially lost. Note: Rotary evaporation is applicable when analyzing for PCDD/PCDF only. Snyder column apparatus is recommended when analyzing for PAH and PCB.
11.1.1 Optional Soxhlet Precleaning. Place an extraction thimble (see Section 6.3.3.3 of this method) and a plug of glass wool into the Soxhlet apparatus equipped with a Dean-Stark trap, charge the apparatus with toluene, and reflux for a minimum of 3 hours. Remove the toluene and discard it. Remove the extraction thimble from the extraction system and place it in a glass beaker to catch the solvent rinses from sample transfer to the extraction thimble. Retain the clean glass wool plug. Alternatively, confirm that the LMB for associated reagents, materials, and media meets the performance requirements in Section 13.1 of this method.
11.1.2 Container No. 1 (Filter) Preparation. Spike the filter with the appropriate pre-extraction filter recovery standard to result in the final sample extract concentrations shown in Tables 23-7, 23-8, and 23-9 of this method taking care that all spike liquid is distributed on the filter. Allow the filter to dry enough to prevent overspill, then transfer the filter and the contents of Container No. 1 directly to the glass extraction thimble in the glass solvent rinse catch beaker so that the filter will be completely immersed in the solvent during extraction.
11.1.3 Adsorbent Module. Spike the adsorbent with the appropriate pre-extraction standard to result in the final sample extract concentrations shown in Tables 23-7, 23-8, and 23-9 of this method, as applicable, spiked
into the adsorbent, not on top of the adsorbent. Transfer the adsorbent material to the glass extraction thimble in the glass solvent rinse catch beaker. Rinse the module into the thimble in the beaker with the contents of Container No. 1. Alternatively, suspend the adsorbent module directly over the extraction thimble in a beaker, then, using a wash bottle containing methanol, flush the XAD-2 into the thimble onto the filter. Thoroughly rinse the interior of the glass module that contained the XAD-2 with toluene.
11.1.4 Container No. 2 (Acetone and Toluene Rinses). Concentrate the sample to a volume of no less than 5 mL. Concentrate samples containing toluene using a heating mantle and three-ball Snyder column or a rotary evaporator. Rinse sample Container No. 2 three times with small portions of toluene and add these to the concentrated solution and concentrate further to no less than 5 mL. This residue contains particulate matter removed in the rinse of the train probe and nozzle. Rinse the concentrated material from Container No. 2 into the glass extraction thimble containing the filter and the XAD-2 resin.
11.1.5 Transfer the solvent contained in the glass solvent rinse catch beaker to the extraction apparatus solvent reservoir. Rinse the beaker into the Soxhlet extraction apparatus solvent reservoir three times with small portions of toluene.
11.1.6 Container No. 3 (Impinger Water and Rinses). For PAH and PCB analysis, transfer the contents of Container No. 3 to a separatory funnel. Adjust to pH 2 with 6 N sulfuric acid, if necessary. Rinse the sample container with three successive 10-mL aliquots of the toluene and add these rinses to the separatory funnel. Extract the sample by vigorously shaking the separatory funnel for 5 minutes. After complete separation of the phases, remove the solvent and filter it through a bed of precleaned, dry sodium sulfate into the Soxhlet extraction apparatus solvent reservoir. Repeat the extraction step two additional times. Adjust the pH to 11 with 6 N sodium hydroxide, re-extract the impinger water and rinses, and filter it through a bed of precleaned, dry sodium sulfate into the Soxhlet extraction apparatus solvent reservoir. Rinse the sodium sulfate into the extraction apparatus solvent reservoir with fresh solvent and discard the sodium sulfate.
11.1.7 Add the appropriate pre-extraction standard for the target compound classes (to result in the final sample extract concentrations shown in Tables 23-7, 23-8, and 23-9 of this method) to the extraction thimble containing the combined filter and adsorbent sample fractions. Cover the contents of the extraction thimble with the cleaned glass wool plug to prevent the XAD-2 resin from splashing into the solvent reservoir of the extractor. Place the extraction thimble into the Soxhlet extraction apparatus.
11.1.8 Pour additional toluene to fill the solvent reservoir to approximately two-thirds capacity. Add PTFE boiling chips and assemble the apparatus.
11.1.9 Adjust the heat source to cause the extractor to cycle approximately three times per hour. Extract the sample for sufficient time to meet the pre-extraction standard recovery performance criteria in Section 13.15 of this method. The solvent should cycle completely through the system a minimum of 48 times.
11.2 Sample Aliquots for Cleanup and Analysis.
11.2.1 After extraction, allow the Soxhlet apparatus to cool.
11.2.2 Initial Extract Concentration. You may perform an initial concentration of the sample extract using the techniques (
e.g.,
Kuderna Danish, rotary evaporation, nitrogen blowdown) found to recover the pre-extraction standard sufficient to meet the performance criteria in Section 13.15 of this method. Concentrate initial extracts in toluene using a heating mantle and three-ball Snyder column or a rotary evaporator. Concentrate the field train proof blank and LMB samples in the same manner as samples.
Note:
To meet isotopically labeled standard recoveries for low molecular weight PCB and PAH, do not evaporate samples to dryness and do not use a rotary evaporator to concentrate extracts.
11.2.3 Allow the sample extract to cool. You should use a minimum of one half of the sample extract for PCDD/PCDF analysis. You may archive the remaining sample extract or further split the sample extract for PCB and/or PAH analysis and archive.
Note:
If using amount other than half the sample extract, adjust the spiking amount of the labeled standards accordingly.
11.2.4 If necessary, further concentrate the sample extract for cleanup and analysis using concentration techniques (
e.g.,
Kuderna Danish, rotary evaporation, nitrogen blowdown) found to recover the pre-extraction standard sufficient to meet the performance criteria in Section 13 of this method.
11.3 Sample Cleanup and Fractionation.
You may process a separate aliquot/split of the sample extract for each of the compound classes analyzed by this method. Sample cleanup for each compound class may include techniques in addition to column chromatography such as acid/base back-extraction, Gel Permeation Chromatography, or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to isolate target compounds from interferences. This section includes a description of column chromatography shown to meet the performance criteria in Sections 9.2 and 13 of this method. The following sample cleanup and fractionation procedures are
recommended but not required. You may modify cleanup column dimensions to meet manual or automated cleanup procedures as technology changes and improves. You must evaluate the cleanup and fractionation procedures used to confirm acceptable recovery of isotopically labeled standards. The alternative procedures must provide sufficient cleanup to meet method identification criteria (Section 11.4.3.4 of this method) and recovery criteria (Section 9.2 of this method). Section 13 of this method summarizes the method performance requirements.
Note:
Recommendations in this section provide a cleanup approach that may allow multiple compound class measurement from a single aliquot of the original sample extract. Typically, Florisil® and alumina are used to separate PAH and PCDPE from PCDD and PCDF target compounds. Use acid, neutral, and basic silica gel and cleanup procedures to remove nonpolar and polar interferences from samples destined for PCB and PCDD/PCDF analysis. Use Carbopack®/Celite® (or other equivalent carbon-based column material) to remove other nonpolar interferences.
11.3.1 PAH and PCDPE Fractionation and Cleanup. You may use a Florisil® column to remove PAH and PCDPE from the sample extract. You may also fractionate sample extracts using Florisil® as the first cleanup step to separate PAH for analysis.
Note:
High concentrations of PAH may interfere, leading to failure of performance criteria for PCDD/PCDF or PCB analysis.
11.3.1.1 Pack a 6-mm ID chromatographic column or equivalent diameter glass pipet with a glass wool plug followed by approximately 1.5 g (approximately 2 mL) of activated Florisil®. Add approximately 1 cm (approximately 1 mL) of anhydrous sodium sulfate followed by a glass wool plug to the head of the column. Pre-elute the column with 10 mL of methylene chloride followed by 10 mL of hexane and discard the eluate.
11.3.1.2 When the solvent is within 1 mm of the packing, transfer the concentrated extract (up to 5 mL) to the top of the Florisil® column, rinse the sample container twice with 1 to 2 mL of hexane, adding each rinse to the column, and elute the column with 35 mL of 5% dichloromethane in hexane. This fraction (Fraction 1) should contain target PCB, and selected hydrocarbons and chlorinated monoaromatic compounds.
11.3.1.3 Elute the column with 35 mL of 15% of dichloromethane in hexane and collect the eluate. This fraction (Fraction 2) should contain target PCDD/PCDF compounds.
11.3.1.4 Elute the column with 50 mL of 50% dichloromethane in hexane. The fraction (Fraction 3) should contain target PAH.
11.3.1.5 If necessary to remove any remaining polar organic compounds, elute the column with 70 mL of 15% acetone in hexane.
11.3.2 PCDD/PCDF and PCB Fractionation and Cleanup. You may remove PAH from the original aliquot of sample extract used for PCDD/PCDF analysis as described in Section 11.3.1 of this method. Design the column cleanup chromatography for PCDD/PCDF and PCB such that two consecutive fractions are collected (one with PCDD/PCDF and one with PCB) without impacting the detection limits. Depending on the source and sample matrix of the original sample, one or more of the following column cleanup approaches may be necessary to further remove polyhalogenated diphenyl ethers. You may use any number of permutations found in the referenced literature for this cleanup if the pre-extraction standard recoveries from field and LMB samples meet the associated performance criteria in Section 13 of this method. Alternatively, you may use an automated cleanup approach that meets the labeled spike recovery requirements in Section 13 of this method.
11.3.2.1 Silica Gel Column Chromatography. Pack one end of a glass column, approximately 20 mm ID × 230 mm long, with glass wool. Add in sequence to the glass column, 1 g of silica gel, 2 g of sodium hydroxide impregnated silica gel, 1 g of silica gel, 4 g of acid-modified silica gel, 1 g of silica gel, and 1 cm layer of anhydrous sodium sulfate. Pre-elute the column with 30 to 50 mL of hexane leaving a small quantity of hexane above the sodium sulfate layer. Discard the pre-elution hexane. Add the sample extract, dissolved in 5 mL of hexane to the head of the column. Allow the sample to flow into the column leaving a small quantity of hexane above the sodium sulfate layer. Rinse the extract container with two additional 5-mL rinses of hexane and apply each rinse to the column separately as the previous addition elutes. Elute the column with an additional 90 mL of hexane and retain the entire eluate. Concentrate this solution to a volume of about 1 mL using the nitrogen evaporative concentrator (see Section 6.3.5 of this method).
11.3.2.2 Silver Nitrate Silica Gel Column Chromatography. Pack a column (6 mm ID, 150 mm in length) sequentially with 1 g of silica gel and 1 g of 10% silver nitrate silica gel followed by a layer of about 10 mm of sodium sulfate (anhydrous). Wash the column sufficiently with hexane, elute until the liquid level reaches to the upper end of the column, and then transfer the concentrated sample (about 5 mL). Rinse the container several times with a small amount of hexane, elute with 200 mL of hexane at a flow rate about 2.5 mL/min (approximately one drop per second) to elute PCDD/PCDF.
11.3.2.3 Multi-layer Silica Gel Column Chromatography. You may use a multi-layer silica gel column in place of separate silica columns. Pack a column of 20 mm ID and 300 mm in length sequentially by the dry pack
method with 0.9 g of silica gel, 3.0 g of 2% potassium hydroxide silica gel, 0.9 g of silica gel, 4.5 g of 44% sulfuric acid silica gel, 6.0 g of 22% sulfuric acid silica gel, 0.9 g of silica gel, 3.0 g of 10% silver nitrate silica gel, 2.0 g of silica gel and 6.0 g of sodium sulfate (anhydrous). Wash the column sufficiently with hexane, elute until the liquid level reaches to the upper end of the column, and then load the sample solution. Rinse the container several times with a small amount of hexane, elute with 150-200 mL of hexane at a flow rate about 2.5 mL/min (approximately one drop per second) to elute PCDD/PCDF.
11.3.2.4 Basic Alumina Column Chromatography. Pack a column (20 mm ID, 300 mm in length) with approximately 6 to 12 g of basic alumina. Pre-elute the column with 50 to 100 mL of hexane. Transfer the concentrated extract from the previous column cleanup to the top of the basic alumina column. Allow the sample to flow into the column leaving a small quantity of solvent above the top of the bed. Rinse the extract container with two additional 1-mL rinses of hexane and apply each rinse to the column separately as the previous addition elutes. Elute the column with 100 mL hexane to remove the interferences. Elute the PCDD/PCDF from the column with 20 to 40 mL of 50% methylene chloride in hexane. The ratio of methylene chloride to hexane may vary depending on the activity of the alumina used in the column preparation. Do not let the head of the column go without solvent. The first 100 mL hexane eluate is not used for subsequent PCDD/PCDF analysis. The eluate is concentrated to approximately 0.5 mL using the nitrogen evaporative concentrator.
11.3.2.5 Carbopack® C/Celite® 545 Column or Equivalent. Cut both ends from a 10 mL disposable Pasteur pipette (see Section 6.4.1 of this method) to produce a 10 cm column. Fire-polish both ends and flare both ends if desired. Insert a glass wool plug at one end and pack the column with 0.55 g of Carbopack®/Celite® (see Section 7.8.9.4 of this method) to form an adsorbent bed approximately 2 cm long. Insert a glass wool plug on top of the bed to hold the adsorbent in place. Pre-elute the column with 5 mL of toluene followed by 2 mL of methylene chloride:methanol:toluene (15:4:1 volume/volume (v/v)), 1 mL of methylene chloride:cyclohexane (1:1 v/v), and 5 mL of hexane. If the flow rate of eluate exceeds 0.5 mL/minute, discard the column. Do not let the head of the column go without solvent. Add the sample extract to the column. Rinse the sample container twice with 1 mL portions of hexane and apply separately to the column. Apply 2 mL of hexane to the head of the column to complete the transfer. Elute the interfering compounds with two 3 mL portions of hexane, 2 mL of methylene chloride:cyclohexane (1:1 v/v), and 2 mL of methylene chloride:methanol:toluene (15:4:1 v/v). Discard the eluate. Invert the column and elute the PCDD/PCDF with 20 mL of toluene. If carbon particles are present in the eluate, filter through glass-fiber filter paper. Concentrate the eluate to approximately 0.5 mL using the nitrogen evaporative concentrator for further cleanup or analysis by HRGC/HRMS.
11.4 PCDD, PCDF, PCB and PAH Analysis.
11.4.1 Analyze the sample extract with an HRGC/HRMS using the instrumental parameters in Sections 11.4.2 and 11.4.3 of this method.
11.4.1.1 Immediately prior to analysis, add an aliquot (typically 20 microliters (µl)) of the pre-analysis standard to result in the final sample extract concentrations in Tables 23-7, 23-8, and 23-9 of this method to each sample as appropriate for the compounds you are measuring by this method.
11.4.1.2 Inject an aliquot of the sample extract into the GC, typically 1 µl. You may perform separate analyses using different GC columns for each of the target compound classes. Perform calibration and sample analysis for each target compound class using the same instrument operating conditions including injection volume.
11.4.1.2.1 If target compounds are not resolved sufficiently from other target compounds or interferences in the sample to meet the requirements in Section 10.2.3.5 or 10.2.3.6 of this method, as applicable to the compound class being analyzed, or as otherwise specified in an applicable regulation, permit, or other requirement, analyze sample (or another aliquot of the sample) using an alternative column that provides elution order to uniquely quantify the target compounds subject to interference on the first GC column.
11.4.1.2.2 You may use column systems other than those recommended in this method provided the analyst is able to demonstrate, using calibration and CCVs, that the alternative column system is able to meet the applicable specifications of Section 10.2.3.5 or 10.2.3.6 of this method.
11.4.2 Example Gas Chromatograph Operating Conditions.
11.4.2.1 Injector. Configured for capillary column, splitless, 250 °C (482 °F).
11.4.2.2 Carrier Gas. Helium, 1 to 2 mL/min.
11.4.2.3 Oven. Optimize the GC temperature program to achieve the required separation and target compound recovery for the GC column in use. Table 23-16 of this method presents the typical conditions for a DB5-MS column.
11.4.3 High-Resolution Mass Spectrometer.
11.4.3.1 Ionization Mode. Electron ionization.
11.4.3.2 Source Temperature. Maintain the source temperature in the range of 250 to 300 °C (482 to 572 °F).
11.4.3.3 Ion Monitoring Mode. Tables 23-4, 23-5, and 23-6 of this method summarize the various ions to be monitored for PCDD/PCDF, PAH, and PCB, respectively.
11.4.3.4 Identification Criteria for Target Compounds. Use the following identification criteria for the characterization of target compounds in this method. The available native and isotopically labeled standards allow the unique identification of all PCDD/PCDF, PAH, and selected PCB congeners analyzed in this method. Also see Sections 13.12 and 13.13 of this method for identification criteria for PCDD/PCDF/PCB and PAH target compounds, respectively.
11.4.3.4.1 For PCDD/PCDF and PCB, Table 23-15 of this method provides acceptance limits for the integrated ion abundance ratio of primary and secondary target compound ions. When the ion abundance ratio for a target analyte is outside the performance criteria, you may reanalyze samples on an alternative GC column to resolve chemical interferences, tune the mass spectrometer to operate at a higher mass resolution to discriminate against the interference(s), and/or further cleanup an archived sample to remove the interference(s). Report analysis results as an EMPC when a response meets identification criteria except the ion abundance ratio criteria or when a peak representing a PCDPE has been detected at the retention time. This method does not consider EMPC-flagged data to be zero concentrations.
Note:
Some EMPCs may be caused by poor ion statistics when the concentration of the target compound is at or near the DL.
11.4.3.4.2 The retention time for the analytes must be within 3 seconds of the corresponding labeled pre-extraction standard.
11.4.3.4.3 The signals for the two exact masses in Tables 23-4 and 23-6 of this method for PCDD/PCDF and PCB, respectively, must be present and must reach their maximum response within two seconds of each other.
11.4.3.4.4 Identify and quantify specific target compounds or isomers that do not have corresponding pre-extraction standard compounds by comparing to the pre-extraction standard of the same compound class with the nearest retention time to target compound.
11.4.3.4.5 For the identification of specific PCB congeners, the retention time of the native congener must be within 0.006 relative retention time (RRT) units of the pre-extraction standard.
11.4.3.4.6 For qualitative identification, the S/N ratio for the GC signal present in every selected ion current profile for native compound response must be greater than or equal to 2.5.
11.4.3.4.7 The separation of target compounds, including 2,3,7,8-TeCDD and 2,3,7,8-TeCDF, must satisfy the separation criteria in Section 10.2.3.5 of this method and all the identification criteria specified in Sections 11.4.3.4.1 through 11.4.3.4.6 of this method. See Section 13.5 of this method on confirmation columns, if needed.
11.4.3.4.8 Chlorodiphenyl Ether Interference. If chromatographic peaks are detected at the retention time of any PCDF in any of the m/z channels used to monitor PCDPE, there is evidence of a positive interference and you may opt to flag data noting the interference and keep the value to calculate PCDF concentration as EMPC or reanalyze to remove or shift the interference. This method recommends alumina (see Section 11.3.2.4 of this method) and Florisil® (see Section 11.3.1 of this method) liquid column chromatography packing materials for removal of PCDPE during sample cleanup.
11.4.3.4.9 The recommended MS lock-mass ions are specified in Tables 23-4, 23-5, and 23-6 of this method for PCDD/PCDF, PAH, and PCB, respectively. Monitor the QC check ions to verify instrument stability during the analysis. If the QC check ion signal varies by more than 25% from the average response across the run, flag results for all isomers at corresponding retention time as the lock-mass ions or QC check ions. You have the option to reanalyze after additional cleanup on the sample (or an archived portion of the sample if the archive is available), or after dilution of the sample. Alternately, determine through additional quality review whether the target analyte and its corresponding isotopically labeled standard are equally affected by the change in lock-mass ions and/or QC check ions. When you reanalyze a sample, ensure all concentration calculations are reported from the reanalyzed sample.
11.4.3.4.10 For the identification of PAH, the RRT of each native to its labeled compound must be within 0.006 RRT units compared to the corresponding RRTs in the continuing calibration. The signals for the characteristic ion listed in Table 23-5 of this method must be present.
11.4.3.5 Quantitation. Measure the response of each native target compound and the corresponding pre-extraction standard. Using the CCV RRF, calculate the mass of each target compound, using equations in Section 12.7 of this method. Use the pre-extraction standard to correct the native target compounds result for variations in performance of the extraction, cleanup, and concentration steps of the analysis. Recovery of pre-extraction standard must meet the minimum specifications in Section 9.2. of this method to ensure that the method performance and reliability have not been compromised by unacceptable losses during sample processing. Table 23-17 of this method
shows the assignments for pre-extraction standard compounds for use in calculating the response factor and the concentrations of PCB. Recoveries of all labeled standard compounds must meet the minimum recovery specifications in Section 13 of this method. Note: Unacceptably low recoveries can be an indication of a sample processing step that caused the low recoveries, such as spiking errors.
11.4.3.5.1 Use Equation 23-7 to calculate the amount of each target compound or group in the sample.
11.4.3.5.2 Use Equation 23-8 to calculate the concentration per dscm of each target compound or group in the gas.
11.4.3.5.3 Quantify native PCDD and PCDF in its homologous series using the corresponding native and pre-extraction standard response in its homologous series. For example, use
13
C
12
-2,3,7,8-TeCDD to calculate the concentrations of all other tetra chlorinated isomers.
11.4.3.5.4 As an option or as required or specified in applicable regulations, permits, or other requirements, you may quantify any or all other PCB congeners as resolved or coeluting combinations using the RRF of the nearest eluting native target PCB in the same homolog group and the pre-extraction standard assigned in Appendix A to this method.
11.4.3.5.5 As an option or as required or specified in applicable regulations, permits, or other requirements, report the total concentration of congeners at a given level of chlorination (homolog;
i.e.,
total TrCB, total PeCB, total HxCB, etc.) by summing the concentrations of all congeners identified in the retention time window for the homologs as assigned in Appendix A to this method.
11.4.3.5.6 As an option or if required in an applicable regulation, permit or other requirement, total PCB may be reported by summing all congeners identified at all window-defining congeners (WDCs) as assigned in Appendix A to this method.

# 13.0 Method Performance
Data generated with this method must be fit for purpose. Applicable results of method performance criteria in this section must be reported. Consequences of failed quality criteria are provided with the criteria in this section.
13.1 Background Assessment—Field Train Proof Blank, LMB and Materials.
Determine the contribution to target compound concentration from reagents, media and glassware used to make target compound measurements. Conduct at least one field train proof blank for each test series at a single facility. Analyze at least one LMB sample during an analytical sequence or every 12 hours, whichever is shorter. Native target compound concentrations in the field train proof blank, LMB and materials assessment must be less than or equal to three times the EDL of the method or 10 times lower than the quantitation limit required by the end use of the data (
e.g.,
compliance limit or other limits set by consent decree or permit), whichever is higher. The field train proof blank, LMB and materials assessment must also meet the performance specifications in Tables 23-7, 23-8, and 23-9, as applicable to the compound target list.
13.2 GC column or column systems used to measure PCDD/PCDF
must meet the column separation requirements in Section 6.5.2.1 of this method and the applicable requirements in Sections 10.2.3.5 and 11.4.3.4 of this method using the continuing calibration verification. Failure to meet this chromatographic resolution criterion requires data from this analysis to be flagged explaining the potential bias of the results.
13.3 GC column or column systems used to measure PAH
must meet the column separation requirements in Section 6.5.2.2 of this method and the applicable requirements in Sections 10.2.3.5 and 11.4.3.4 of this method using the continuing calibration check. Failure to meet this chromatographic resolution criterion requires data from this analysis to be flagged explaining the potential bias of the results.
13.4 GC column or column systems used to measure PCB
must meet the column separation requirements in Section 6.5.2.3 of this method and the applicable requirements in Sections 10.2.3.5 and 11.4.3.4 of this method using the continuing calibration check and be able to achieve unique resolution and identification of the toxics for determination of a TEQ
PCB.
The rule requiring the use of this method will establish which WHO TEF to use. Failure to meet this chromatographic resolution criterion requires data from this analysis to be flagged explaining the potential bias of the results.
13.5 Confirmation Column.
If target compounds are not sufficiently resolved from other target compounds or interferences in the sample to meet the requirements for target compounds in Sections 13.2, 13.3, and/or 13.4 of this method, analyze sample (or another aliquot of the sample) using an alternative column that provides elution order to uniquely quantify the target compounds subject to interference on the first GC column. When using a confirmation column, document the required resolution.
13.6 Detection Limits.
13.6.1 MDL. The MDLs are determined following the procedures in Section 9.3.7 of this method. MDLs are confirmed by preparing and analyzing a spiked sample (spiked at 1 to 5 times the determined MDL, see Section 9.3.8), then confirm that the target compounds meet the qualitative identification criteria in Section 11.4.3.4 of this method. If the MDL confirmation criteria are not met, the MDL determination is repeated with a higher spike concentration until criteria are met.
13.6.2 EDL. If the sample specific EDLs are less than 50% of the emission standard, the EDLs are acceptable.
13.7 Tune.
The groups of monitored ions are listed in Tables 23-4, 23-5, and 23-6 of this method, as applicable for the target compound class. Tune the instrument to meet the required resolving power in Section 10.2.1 for the desired target compound class. Assess the resolution at three exact m/z's representing the low-, mid-, and high-m/z range of the masses used to measure the target compound class. You may use peak matching and the chosen PFK (or FC43) reference peak to verify that the exact mass is within 5 ppm of the required value.
13.8 Lock-Mass Ions.
The MS lock-mass and QC check ions in Tables 23-4, 23-5, and 23-6 of this method are recommended for PCDD/PCDF, PCB, or PAH, respectively. The reference compounds PFK or FC43 have ions that may be selected as your lock-mass and QC check ions. Monitor the QC check ions specified in these tables to verify instrument stability during the analysis; these must not vary
25% from the average response. Additional cleanup on sample extract (or archive extract) and reanalysis is necessary for failure to maintain lock-mass during analysis.
13.9 Initial Calibration.
13.9.1 The RSD for mean RRF from each of the target analytes and labeled standards in the calibration samples must not exceed the values in Table 23-14 of this method.
13.9.2 The S/N in every selected ion current profile must be ≥10 for all unlabeled targets and labeled standards in the calibration samples.
13.9.3 The ion abundance ratios must be within the control limits in Table 23-15 of this method.
13.10 Continuing Calibration Verification.
13.10.1 The RRF for each unlabeled and labeled compound measured in a CCV must not deviate from the initial calibration RRF by more than the limits shown in Table 23-14 of this method.
13.10.2 The ion abundance ratios must be within the control limits in Table 23-15 of this method.
13.10.3 The S/N ratio for the GC/MS signal present in every selected ion current profile must be greater than or equal to 10.
13.10.4 Repeat the initial calibration when there is a failure to meet the requirements for an acceptable CCV analysis.
13.10.5 Column Separation Check. Use the results from a CCV to verify and document the resolution required in Sections 13.2, 13.3, or 13.4 of this method for the target compound classes analyzed with this method. The separation criteria are applicable to all the compounds in a target class whether analyzed by a single or multiple GC columns. If a confirmation column is used, document required resolution (see Section 13.5).
13.11 QCS.
A QCS must be analyzed during the IDC and after initial calibrations (at a minimum quarterly). The acceptance criterion for the QCS is 70-130% of the true value. If the accuracy for any analyte fails the recovery criterion, prepare a fresh standard dilution and repeat. If the freshly prepared QCS fails, determine the cause, recalibrate the instrument if necessary and reanalyze the QCS.
13.12 Compound Identification for PCDD/PCDF and PCB.
13.12.1 Target compounds must have ion abundance ratios within the control limits in Table 23-15 of this method. PAH target compounds have single ion identifiers with no ion abundance ratio requirement. Report analysis results as an EMPC when a response meets identification criteria but fails the ion abundance ratio criteria or when a peak representing a PCDPE has been detected at the target compound retention time.
13.12.2 The retention time for the analytes must be within 3 seconds of the corresponding pre-extraction standard.
13.12.3 The monitored ions, shown in Table 23-4 of this method for a given PCDD/PCDF, must reach their maximum response within 2 seconds of each other.
13.12.4 The monitored ions, shown in Table 23-6 of this method for a given PCB, must reach their maximum response within 2 seconds of each other.
13.12.5 For the identification of specific PCB, the RRT of the native congener must be within 0.006 RRT units of the pre-extraction standard RRT.
13.12.6 The S/N ratio for the monitored ions for native compounds must be greater than or equal to 2.5.
13.12.7 Identify and quantify isomers that do not have corresponding pre-extraction standard compounds by comparing to the pre-extraction standard of the same compound class with the nearest retention time to the target compound.
13.12.8 If chromatographic peaks are detected at the retention time of any PCDD/PCDF in any of the m/z channels used to monitor PCDPE, there is evidence of interference and positive bias. Data must be flagged to indicate an interference. You may report the total with bias for the affected target. To reduce the bias, you may use a confirmatory column or perform additional clean up on an archived sample followed by reanalysis.
13.13 Compound Identification for PAH.
13.13.1 The signals for the characteristic ion listed in Table 23-5 of this method must be present.
13.13.2 The RRT between each native and labeled compound must be within 0.006 RRT units.
13.14 Pre-sampling Adsorbent Standard and Pre-extraction Filter Recovery Standard Recovery.
Recoveries of pre-sampling adsorbent standard added to the sample and pre-extraction filter recovery standard added to the filter must be between 70 and 130% (see Tables 23-7, 23-8, and 23-9 of this method).
13.14.1 If the recovery of all the pre-sampling adsorbent standard compounds is below 70%, the sampling runs are not valid, and you must repeat the stack or vent sampling. As an alternative, you do not have to repeat the test if the average pre-sampling adsorbent standard recovery is 25% or more and you divide the final results by the average fraction of pre-sampling adsorbent standard recovery.
13.14.2 If the recovery of all the pre-extraction filter recovery standard compounds is below 70%, you may reanalyze the sample. If the recovery criteria are still not met, the sampling recovery is not valid, and you must repeat the stack or vent sampling.
13.15 Pre-extraction Standard Recovery.
Recoveries of all pre-extraction standard compounds added to the sample must be between 20 to 130% for PCDD/PCDF and PAH (see Tables 23-7 and 23-8 of this method) and between 20 to 145% for PCB (see Table 23-9 of this method). If the recovery criteria are not met, you may reanalyze the sample and/or prepare and analyze the archive sample. If the recovery criteria are still not met, the sampling run is not valid, and the stack test must be repeated.
13.16 Pre-analysis Standard Response.
Response of all pre-analysis standard compounds must show a S/N for every selected ion current profile of ≥ 10. If the minimum response is not met, you must reanalyze the sample. Poor sensitivity compared to initial calibration response may indicate injection errors or instrument drift.
13.17 IDC—Lowest calibration concentration, Demonstration of precision, Demonstration of accuracy
.
13.17.1 Lowest calibration concentration. The Upper PIR Limit must be less than, or equal, to 150%; and the Lower PIR Limit must be greater than, or equal to, 50%. If these criteria are not met, the lowest calibration point has been set too low and must be confirmed at a higher concentration.
13.17.2 Demonstration of precision. The percent relative standard deviation (%RSD) of the concentrations from the replicate analyses must be less than 20% for all target analytes. Demonstration would be repeated for failed compounds only.
13.17.3 Demonstration of accuracy. The average % recovery for each target analyte must be within 70 to 130%. Demonstration would be repeated for failed compounds only.
13.18 Requirements for Equivalency.
The Administrator considers any modification of this method, beyond those expressly permitted in this method as options, to be a major modification subject to application and approval of alternative test procedures following EPA Guidance Document 22 currently found at:

Changes in the amounts of labeled standards added to the sample or its representative extract will necessitate an adjustment of the calibration solutions to prevent the introduction of inconsistencies. Spike concentration assumes 1 µL sample injection volume for analysis or the injection volume for calibration standards and samples is the same.
b
Labeled standard concentrations are recommendations (equivalent mass per sample of 25 pg pre-extraction standard, as an example, based on a 200 µL extract volume split in half before cleanup with a 20 µL aliquot of a 500 pg/µL spiking solution). Recommendations are based on assumption that half of the extract will be archived before cleanup. Spike levels may be adjusted for different split levels.
Note:
all standards used should be reported.

Changes in the amounts of labeled standards added to the sample or its representative extract will necessitate an adjustment of the calibration solutions to prevent the introduction of inconsistencies.
b
Labeled standard concentrations are recommendations (equivalent mass per sample of 25 pg pre-extraction standard, as an example, based on a 200 µL extract volume split in half before cleanup with a 20 µL aliquot of a 1000 pg/µL spiking solution). Recommendations are based on assumption that half of the extract will be archived before cleanup. Spike levels may be adjusted for different split levels.
Note:
all standards used should be reported.

# Appendix B to Method 23

# Preparation of XAD-2 Adsorbent Resin

# 1.0 Scope and Application
XAD-2® resin, as supplied by the original manufacturer, is impregnated with a bicarbonate solution to inhibit microbial growth during storage. Remove both the salt solution and any residual extractable chemicals used in the polymerization process before use. Prepare the resin by a series of water and organic extractions, followed by careful drying.

# 2.0 Extraction
2.1 You may perform the extraction using a Soxhlet extractor or other apparatus that generates resin meeting the requirements in Section 13.1 of Method 23. Use an all-glass thimble containing an extra-coarse frit for extraction of the resin. The frit is recessed 10-15 mm above a crenellated ring at the bottom of the thimble to facilitate drainage. Because the resin floats on methylene chloride, carefully retain the resin in the extractor cup with a glass wool plug and stainless-steel screen. This process involves sequential extraction with the following recommended solvents in the listed order.
•
Water initial rinse:
Place resin in a suitable container, soak for approximately 5 min with Type II water, remove fine floating resin particles and discard the water. Fill with Type II water a second time, let stand overnight, remove fine floating resin particles, and discard the water.
•
Hot water:
Extract with water for 8 hr.
•
Methyl alcohol:
Extract for 22 hr.
•
Methylene chloride:
Extract for 22 hr.
•
Toluene:
Extract for 22 hr.
•
Methylene chloride:
Extract for 22 hr.
Note:
You may store the resin in a sealed glass container filled with toluene prior to the final toluene extraction. It may be necessary to repeat the final methylene chloride extractions to meet the cleanliness requirements in Section 13.1 of Method 23.
2.2 You may use alternative extraction procedures to clean large batches of resin. Any size extractor may be constructed; the choice depends on the needs of the sampling programs. The resin is held in a glass or stainless-steel cylinder between a pair of coarse and fine screens. Spacers placed under the bottom screen allow for even distribution of clean solvent. Clean solvent is circulated through the resin for extraction. A flow rate is maintained upward through the resin to allow maximum solvent contact and prevent channeling.
2.2.1 Experience has shown that 1 mL/g of resin extracted is the minimum necessary to extract and clean the resin. The aqueous rinse is critical to the subsequent organic rinses and may be accomplished by simply flushing the canister with about 1 liter of distilled water for every 25 g of resin. A small pump may be useful for pumping the water through the canister. You should perform the water extraction at the rate of about 20 to 40 mL/min.
2.2.2 All materials of construction are glass, PTFE, or stainless steel. Pumps, if used, should not contain extractable materials.

# 3.0 Drying
3.1 Dry the adsorbent of extraction solvent before use. This section provides a recommended procedure to dry adsorbent that is wet with solvent. However, you may use other procedures if the cleanliness requirements in Section 13.1 of Method 23 are met.
3.2 Drying Column. A simple column with suitable retainers will hold all the XAD-2 from the extractor or the Soxhlet extractor, as shown in Figure B-1, with sufficient space for drying the bed while generating a minimum backpressure in the column.
3.3 Drying Procedure: Dry the adsorbent using clean inert gas. Liquid nitrogen from a standard commercial liquid nitrogen cylinder has proven to be a reliable source of large volumes of gas free from organic contaminants. You may use high-purity tank nitrogen to dry the resin. However, you should pass the high-purity nitrogen through a bed of activated charcoal approximately 150 mL in volume prior to entering the drying apparatus.
3.3.1 Connect the gas vent of a liquid nitrogen cylinder or the exit of the activated carbon scrubber to the column by a length of precleaned copper tubing (
e.g.,
0.95 cm ID) coiled to pass through a heat source. A convenient heat source is a water bath heated from a steam line. The final nitrogen temperature should only be warm to the touch and not over 40 °C.
3.3.2 Allow the methylene chloride to drain from the resin prior to placing the resin in the drying apparatus.
3.3.3 Flow nitrogen through the drying apparatus at a rate that does not fluidize or agitate the resin. Continue the nitrogen flow until the residual solvent is removed.
Note:
Experience has shown that about 500 g of resin may be dried overnight by consuming a full 160-L cylinder of liquid nitrogen.

# 4.0 Interferences
[Reserved]

# 5.0 Safety
5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this
test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and to determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.
5.2 Hazardous Components. Several of the compounds that may be contained in the coatings analyzed by this method may be irritating or corrosive to tissues (e.g., heptane) or may be toxic (e.g., benzene, methyl alcohol). Nearly all are fire hazards. Appropriate precautions can be found in reference documents, such as Reference 3 of section 16.0.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
The equipment and supplies specified in the ASTM methods listed in sections 6.1 through 6.6 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17 for acceptable versions of the methods) are required:
6.1 ASTM D 1475-60, 80, or 90, Standard Test Method for Density of Paint, Varnish, Lacquer, and Related Products.
6.2 ASTM D 2369-81, 87, 90, 92, 93, 95, or 10. Standard Test Method for Volatile Content of Coatings.
6.3 ASTM D 3792-79 or 91, Standard Test Method for Water Content of Water Reducible Paints by Direct Injection into a Gas Chromatograph.
6.4 ASTM D 4017-81, 90, or 96a, Standard Test Method for Water in Paints and Paint Materials by the Karl Fischer Titration Method.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards
7.1 The reagents and standards specified in the ASTM methods listed in sections 6.1 through 6.6 are required.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
8.1 Follow the sample collection, preservation, storage, and transport procedures described in Reference 1 of section 16.0.

# 9.0 Quality Control
9.1 Reproducibility

# Note:
Not applicable to UV radiation-cured coatings). The variety of coatings that may be subject to analysis makes it necessary to verify the ability of the analyst and the analytical procedures to obtain reproducible results for the coatings tested. Verification is accomplished by running duplicate analyses on each sample tested (Sections 11.2 through 11.4) and comparing the results with the intra-laboratory precision statements (Section 13.1) for each parameter.
9.2 Confidence Limits for Waterborne Coatings. Because of the inherent increased imprecision in the determination of the VOC content of waterborne coatings as the weight percent of water increases, measured parameters for waterborne coatings are replaced with appropriate confidence limits (Section 12.6). These confidence limits are based on measured parameters and inter-laboratory precision statements.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization
10.1 Perform the calibration and standardization procedures specified in the ASTM methods listed in sections 6.1 through 6.6.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedure
Additional guidance can be found in Reference 2 of section 16.0.
11.1 Non Thin-film Ultraviolet Radiation-cured (UV radiation-cured) Coatings.
11.1.1 Volatile Content. Use the procedure in ASTM D 5403 to determine the volatile matter content of the coating except the curing test described in NOTE 2 of ASTM D 5403 is required.
11.1.2 Water Content. To determine water content, follow section 11.3.2.
11.1.3 Coating Density. To determine coating density, follow section 11.3.3.
11.1.4 Solids Content. To determine solids content, follow section 11.3.4.
11.1.5 To determine if a coating or ink can be classified as a thin-film UV cured coating or ink, use the equation in section 12.2. If C is less than 0.2 g and A is greater than or equal to 225 cm
2
(35 in
2
) then the coating or ink is considered a thin-film UV radiation-cured coating and ASTM D 5403 is not applicable.

# Note:
As noted in section 1.4 of ASTM D 5403, this method may not be applicable to radiation curable materials wherein the volatile material is water.
11.2 Multi-component Coatings.
11.2.1 Sample Preparation.
11.2.1.1 Prepare about 100 ml of sample by mixing the components in a storage container, such as a glass jar with a screw top or a metal can with a cap. The storage container should be just large enough to hold the mixture. Combine the components (by weight or volume) in the ratio recommended by the manufacturer. Tightly close the container between additions and during mixing to prevent loss of volatile materials. However, most manufacturers mixing instructions are by volume. Because of possible error caused by expansion of the liquid when measuring the volume, it is recommended that the components be combined by weight.
When weight is used to combine the components and the manufacturer's recommended ratio is by volume, the density must be determined by section 11.3.3.
11.2.1.2 Immediately after mixing, take aliquots from this 100 ml sample for determination of the total volatile content, water content, and density.
11.2.2 Volatile Content. To determine total volatile content, use the apparatus and reagents described in ASTM D2369 (incorporated by reference; see § 60.17 for the approved versions of the standard), respectively, and use the following procedures:
11.2.2.1 Weigh and record the weight of an aluminum foil weighing dish. Add 3 ±1 ml of suitable solvent as specified in ASTM D2369 to the weighing dish. Using a syringe as specified in ASTM D2369, weigh to 1 mg, by difference, a sample of coating into the weighing dish. For coatings believed to have a volatile content less than 40 weight percent, a suitable size is 0.3 + 0.10 g, but for coatings believed to have a volatile content greater than 40 weight percent, a suitable size is 0.5 ±0.1 g.

# Note:
If the volatile content determined pursuant to section 12.4 is not in the range corresponding to the sample size chosen repeat the test with the appropriate sample size. Add the specimen dropwise, shaking (swirling) the dish to disperse the specimen completely in the solvent. If the material forms a lump that cannot be dispersed, discard the specimen and prepare a new one. Similarly, prepare a duplicate. The sample shall stand for a minimum of 1 hour, but no more than 24 hours prior to being oven cured at 110 ±5 °C (230 ±9 °F) for 1 hour.
11.2.2.2 Heat the aluminum foil dishes containing the dispersed specimens in the forced draft oven for 60 min at 110 ±5 °C (230 ±9 °F). Caution—provide adequate ventilation, consistent with accepted laboratory practice, to prevent solvent vapors from accumulating to a dangerous level.
11.2.2.3 Remove the dishes from the oven, place immediately in a desiccator, cool to ambient temperature, and weigh to within 1 mg.
11.2.2.4 Run analyses in pairs (duplicate sets) for each coating mixture until the criterion in section 11.4 is met. Calculate W
V
following Equation 24-2 and record the arithmetic average.
11.2.3 Water Content. To determine water content, follow section 11.3.2.
11.2.4 Coating Density. To determine coating density, follow section 11.3.3.
11.2.5 Solids Content. To determine solids content, follow section 11.3.4.
11.2.6 Exempt Solvent Content. To determine the exempt solvent content, follow section 11.3.5.

# Note:
For all other coatings (
i.e.,
water-or solvent-borne coatings) not covered by multicomponent or UV radiation-cured coatings, analyze as shown below:
11.3 Water-or Solvent-borne coatings.

11.3.2.2 Record the arithmetic average (w
w
).
11.3.3 Coating Density. Determine the density (Dc, kg/l) of the surface coating using the procedure in ASTM D 1475.
11.3.3.1 Run duplicate analyses until each value in a set deviates from the mean of the set by no more than the intra-laboratory precision statement in section 13.1.
11.3.3.2 Record the arithmetic average (D
c
).
11.3.4 Solids Content. Determine the volume fraction (V
s
) solids of the coating by calculation using the manufacturer's formulation.
11.3.5 Exempt Solvent Content. Determine the weight fraction of exempt solvents (W
E
) by using ASTM Method D4457. Run a duplicate set of determinations and record the arithmetic average (W
E
).
11.4 Sample Analysis Criteria. For W
v
and W
w
, run duplicate analyses until the difference between the two values in a set is less than or equal to the intra-laboratory precision statement for that parameter. For D
c
, run duplicate analyses until each value in a set deviates from the mean of the set by no more than the intra-laboratory precision statement. If, after several attempts, it is concluded that the ASTM procedures cannot be used for the specific coating with the established intra-laboratory precision (excluding UV radiation-cured coatings), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will assume responsibility for providing the necessary procedures for revising the method or precision statements upon written request to: Director, Emissions, Monitoring, and
Analysis Division, MD-14, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 Separate procedures are used to determine the VOC weight fraction and density of the ink or related coating and the density of the solvent in the ink or related coating. The VOC weight fraction is determined by measuring the weight loss of a known sample quantity which has been heated for a specified length of time at a specified temperature. The density of both the ink or related coating and solvent are measured by a standard procedure. From this information, the VOC volume fraction is calculated.

# Method 25—Determination of Total Gaseous Nonmethane Organic Emissions as Carbon

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1 Analytes.
Analyte
CAS No.
Sensitivity
Total gaseous nonmethane organic compounds (TGNMO)
N/A
Dependent upon analytical equipment.
1.2 Applicability.
1.2.1 This method is applicable for the determination of volatile organic compounds (VOC) (measured as total gaseous nonmethane organics (TGNMO) and reported as carbon) in stationary source emissions. This method is not applicable for the determination of organic particulate matter.
1.2.2 This method is not the only method that applies to the measurement of VOC. Costs, logistics, and other practicalities of source testing may make other test methods more desirable for measuring VOC contents of certain effluent streams. Proper judgment is required in determining the most applicable VOC test method. For example, depending upon the molecular composition of the organics in the effluent stream, a totally automated semicontinuous nonmethane organics (NMO) analyzer interfaced directly to the source may yield accurate results. This approach has the advantage of providing emission data semicontinuously over an extended time period.
1.2.3 Direct measurement of an effluent with a flame ionization detector (FID) analyzer may be appropriate with prior characterization of the gas stream and knowledge that the detector responds predictably to the organic compounds in the stream. If present, methane (CH
4
) will, of course, also be measured. The FID can be used under any of the following limited conditions: (1) Where only one compound is known to exist; (2) when the organic compounds consist of only hydrogen and carbon; (3) where the relative percentages of the compounds are known or can be determined, and the FID responses to
the compounds are known; (4) where a consistent mixture of the compounds exists before and after emission control and only the relative concentrations are to be assessed; or (5) where the FID can be calibrated against mass standards of the compounds emitted (solvent emissions, for example).
1.2.4 Another example of the use of a direct FID is as a screening method. If there is enough information available to provide a rough estimate of the analyzer accuracy, the FID analyzer can be used to determine the VOC content of an uncharacterized gas stream. With a sufficient buffer to account for possible inaccuracies, the direct FID can be a useful tool to obtain the desired results without costly exact determination.
1.2.5 In situations where a qualitative/quantitative analysis of an effluent stream is desired or required, a gas chromatographic FID system may apply. However, for sources emitting numerous organics, the time and expense of this approach will be formidable.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 An emission sample is withdrawn from the stack at a constant rate through a heated filter and a chilled condensate trap by means of an evacuated sample tank. After sampling is completed, the TGNMO are determined by independently analyzing the condensate trap and sample tank fractions and combining the analytical results. The organic content of the condensate trap fraction is determined by oxidizing the NMO to carbon dioxide (CO
2
) and quantitatively collecting in the effluent in an evacuated vessel; then a portion of the CO
2
is reduced to CH
4
and measured by an FID. The organic content of the sample tank fraction is measured by injecting a portion of the sample into a gas chromatographic column to separate the NMO from carbon monoxide (CO), CO
2
, and CH
4
; the NMO are oxidized to CO
2
, reduced to CH
4
, and measured by an FID. In this manner, the variable response of the FID associated with different types of organics is eliminated.

# 3.0 Definitions
[Reserved]

# 4.0 Interferences
4.1 Carbon Dioxide and Water Vapor. When carbon dioxide (CO
2
) and water vapor are present together in the stack, they can produce a positive bias in the sample. The magnitude of the bias depends on the concentrations of CO
2
and water vapor. As a guideline, multiply the CO
2
concentration, expressed as volume percent, times the water vapor concentration. If this product does not exceed 100, the bias can be considered insignificant. For example, the bias is not significant for a source having 10 percent CO
2
and 10 percent water vapor, but it might be significant for a source having 10 percent CO
2
and 20 percent water vapor.
4.2. Particulate Matter. Collection of organic particulate matter in the condensate trap would produce a positive bias. A filter is included in the sampling equipment to minimize this bias.

# 5.0 Safety
5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage
8.1 Sampling Equipment Preparation.
8.1.1 Condensate Trap Cleaning. Before its initial use and after each use, a condensate trap should be thoroughly cleaned and checked to ensure that it is not contaminated. Both cleaning and checking can be accomplished by installing the trap in the condensate recovery system and treating it as if it were a sample. The trap should be heated
as described in section 11.1.3. A trap may be considered clean when the CO
2
concentration in its effluent gas drops below 10 ppm. This check is optional for traps that most recently have been used to collect samples which were then recovered according to the procedure in section 11.1.3.
8.1.2 Sample Tank Evacuation and Leak-Check. Evacuate the sample tank to 10 mm Hg absolute pressure or less. Then close the sample tank valve, and allow the tank to sit for 60 minutes. The tank is acceptable if a change in tank vacuum of less than 1 mm Hg is noted. The evacuation and leak-check may be conducted either in the laboratory or the field.
8.1.3 Sampling Train Assembly. Just before assembly, measure the tank vacuum using a mercury manometer. Record this vacuum, the ambient temperature, and the barometric pressure at this time. Close the sample tank valve and assemble the sampling system as shown in Figure 25-1. Immerse the condensate trap body in dry ice at least 30 minutes before commencing sampling to improve collection efficiency. The point where the inlet tube joins the trap body should be 2.5 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in.) above the top of the dry ice.
8.1.4 Pretest Leak-Check. A pretest leak-check is required. Calculate or measure the approximate volume of the sampling train from the probe tip to the sample tank valve. After assembling the sampling train, plug the probe tip, and make certain that the sample tank valve is closed. Turn on the vacuum pump, and evacuate the sampling system from the probe tip to the sample tank valve to an absolute pressure of 10 mm Hg or less. Close the purge valve, turn off the pump, wait a minimum period of 10 minutes, and recheck the indicated vacuum. Calculate the maximum allowable pressure change based on a leak rate of 1 percent of the sampling rate using Equation 25-1, section 12.2. If the measured pressure change exceeds the allowable, correct the problem and repeat the leak-check before beginning sampling.
8.2 Sample Collection.
8.2.1 Unplug the probe tip, and place the probe into the stack such that the probe is perpendicular to the duct or stack axis; locate the probe tip at a single preselected point of average velocity facing away from the direction of gas flow. For stacks having a negative static pressure, seal the sample port sufficiently to prevent air in-leakage around the probe. Set the probe temperature controller to 129 °C (265 °F) and the filter temperature controller to 121 °C (250 °F). Allow the probe and filter to heat for about 30 minutes before purging the sample train.
8.2.2 Close the sample valve, open the purge valve, and start the vacuum pump. Set the flow rate between 60 and 100 cm
3
/min (0.13 and 0.21 ft
3
/hr), and purge the train with stack gas for at least 10 minutes.
8.2.3 When the temperatures at the exit ends of the probe and filter are within the corresponding specified ranges, check the dry ice level around the condensate trap, and add dry ice if necessary. Record the clock time. To begin sampling, close the purge valve and stop the pump. Open the sample valve and the sample tank valve. Using the flow control valve, set the flow through the sample train to the proper rate. Adjust the flow rate as necessary to maintain a constant rate (±10 percent) throughout the duration of the sampling period. Record the sample tank vacuum and flowmeter setting at 5-minute intervals. (See Figure 25-8.) Select a total sample time greater than or equal to the minimum sampling time specified in the applicable subpart of the regulations; end the sampling when this time period is reached or when a constant flow rate can no longer be maintained because of reduced sample tank vacuum.

# Note:
If sampling had to be stopped before obtaining the minimum sampling time (specified in the applicable subpart) because a constant flow rate could not be maintained, proceed as follows: After closing the sample tank valve, remove the used sample tank from the sampling train (without disconnecting other portions of the sampling train). Take another evacuated and leak-checked sample tank, measure and record the tank vacuum, and attach the new tank to the sampling train. After the new tank is attached to the sample train, proceed with the sampling until the required minimum sampling time has been exceeded.
8.3 Sample Recovery. After sampling is completed, close the flow control valve, and record the final tank vacuum; then record the tank temperature and barometric pressure. Close the sample tank valve, and disconnect the sample tank from the sample system. Disconnect the condensate trap at the inlet to the rate meter, and tightly seal both ends of the condensate trap. Do not include the probe from the stack to the filter as part of the condensate sample.
8.4 Sample Storage and Transport. Keep the trap packed in dry ice until the samples are returned to the laboratory for analysis. Ensure that run numbers are identified on the condensate trap and the sample tank(s).

# Note:
Maintain a record of performance of each item.
10.1 Initial Performance Checks.
10.1.1 Condensate Recovery Apparatus. Perform these tests before the system is first placed in operation, after any shutdown of 6 months or more, and after any major modification of the system, or at the frequency recommended by the manufacturer.
10.1.1.1 Carrier Gas and Auxiliary O
2
Blank Check. Analyze each new tank of carrier gas or auxiliary O
2
with the NMO analyzer to check for contamination. Treat the gas cylinders as noncondensible gas samples, and analyze according to the procedure in section 11.2.3. Add together any measured CH
4
, CO, CO
2
, or NMO. The total concentration must be less than 5 ppm.
10.1.1.2 Oxidation Catalyst Efficiency Check.
10.1.1.2.1 With a clean condensate trap installed in the recovery system or a
1/8
″ stainless steel connector tube, replace the carrier gas cylinder with the high level methane standard gas cylinder (Section 7.4.1). Set the four-port valve to the recovery position, and attach an ICV to the recovery system. With the sample recovery valve in vent position and the flow-control and ICV valves fully open, evacuate the manometer or gauge, the connecting tubing, and the ICV to 10 mm Hg absolute pressure. Close the flow-control and vacuum pump valves.
10.1.1.2.2 After the NDIR response has stabilized, switch the sample recovery valve from vent to collect. When the manometer or pressure gauge begins to register a slight positive pressure, open the flow-control valve. Keep the flow adjusted such that the pressure in the system is maintained within 10 percent of atmospheric pressure. Continue collecting the sample in a normal manner until the ICV is filled to a nominal gauge pressure of 300 mm Hg. Close the ICV valve, and remove the ICV from the system. Place the sample recovery valve in the vent position, and return the recovery system to its normal carrier gas and normal operating conditions. Analyze the ICV for CO
2
using the NMO analyzer; the catalyst efficiency is acceptable if the CO
2
concentration is within 2 percent of the methane standard concentration.
10.1.1.3 System Performance Check. Construct a liquid sample injection unit similar in design to the unit shown in Figure 25-7. Insert this unit into the condensate recovery and conditioning system in place of a condensate trap, and set the carrier gas and auxiliary O
2
flow rates to normal operating levels. Attach an evacuated ICV to the system, and switch from system vent to collect. With the carrier gas routed through the injection unit and the oxidation catalyst, inject a liquid sample (see sections 10.1.1.3.1 to 10.1.1.3.4) into the injection port. Operate the trap recovery system as described in section 11.1.3. Measure the final ICV pressure, and then analyze the vessel to determine the CO
2
concentration. For each injection, calculate the percent recovery according to section 12.7. Calculate the relative standard deviation for each set of triplicate injections according to section 12.8. The performance test is acceptable if the average percent recovery is 100 ±5 percent and the relative standard deviation is less than 2 percent for each set of triplicate injections.
10.1.1.3.1 50 µl hexane.
10.1.1.3.2 10 µl hexane.
10.1.1.3.3 50 µl decane.
10.1.1.3.4 10 µl decane.
10.1.2 NMO Analyzer. Perform these tests before the system is first placed in operation, after any shutdown longer than 6 months, and after any major modification of the system.
10.1.2.1 Oxidation Catalyst Efficiency Check. Turn off or bypass the NMO analyzer reduction catalyst. Make triplicate injections of the high level methane standard (Section 7.4.1). The oxidation catalyst operation is acceptable if the FID response is less than 1 percent of the injected methane concentration.
10.1.2.2 Reduction Catalyst Efficiency Check. With the oxidation catalyst unheated or bypassed and the heated reduction catalyst bypassed, make triplicate injections of the high level methane standard (Section 7.4.1). Repeat this procedure with both catalysts operative. The reduction catalyst operation is acceptable if the responses under both conditions agree within 5 percent of their average.
10.1.2.3 NMO Analyzer Linearity Check Calibration. While operating both the oxidation and reduction catalysts, conduct a linearity check of the analyzer using the propane standards specified in section 7.4.2. Make triplicate injections of each calibration gas. For each gas (
i.e.,
each set of triplicate injections), calculate the average response factor (area/ppm C) for each gas, as well as and the relative standard deviation (according to section 12.8). Then calculate the overall mean of the response factor values. The instrument linearity is acceptable
if the average response factor of each calibration gas is within 2.5 percent of the overall mean value and if the relative standard deviation gas is less than 2 percent of the overall mean value. Record the overall mean of the propane response factor values as the NMO calibration response factor (RF
NMO
). Repeat the linearity check using the CO
2
standards specified in section 7.4.3. Make triplicate injections of each gas, and then calculate the average response factor (area/ppm C) for each gas, as well as the overall mean of the response factor values. Record the overall mean of the response factor values as the CO
2
calibration response factor (RF
CO2
). The RF
CO2
must be within 10 percent of the RF
NMO
.
10.1.2.4 System Performance Check. Check the column separation and overall performance of the analyzer by making triplicate injections of the calibration gases listed in section 7.4.4. The analyzer performance is acceptable if the measured NMO value for each gas (average of triplicate injections) is within 5 percent of the expected value.
10.2 NMO Analyzer Daily Calibration. The following calibration procedures shall be performed before and immediately after the analysis of each set of samples, or on a daily basis, whichever is more stringent:
10.2.1 CO
2
Response Factor. Inject triplicate samples of the high level CO
2
calibration gas (Section 7.4.3), and calculate the average response factor. The system operation is adequate if the calculated response factor is within 5 percent of the RF
CO2
calculated during the initial performance test (Section 10.1.2.3). Use the daily response factor (DRF
CO2
) for analyzer calibration and the calculation of measured CO
2
concentrations in the ICV samples.
10.2.2 NMO Response Factors. Inject triplicate samples of the mixed propane calibration cylinder gas (Section 7.4.4.1), and calculate the average NMO response factor. The system operation is adequate if the calculated response factor is within 10 percent of the RF
NMO
calculated during the initial performance test (Section 10.1.2.4). Use the daily response factor (DRF
NMO
) for analyzer calibration and calculation of NMO concentrations in the sample tanks.
10.3 Sample Tank and ICV Volume. The volume of the gas sampling tanks used must be determined. Determine the tank and ICV volumes by weighing them empty and then filled with deionized distilled water; weigh to the nearest 5 g, and record the results. Alternatively, measure the volume of water used to fill them to the nearest 5 ml.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedure
11.1 Condensate Recovery. See Figure 25-9. Set the carrier gas flow rate, and heat the catalyst to its operating temperature to condition the apparatus.
11.1.1 Daily Performance Checks. Each day before analyzing any samples, perform the following tests:
11.1.1.1 Leak-Check. With the carrier gas inlets and the sample recovery valve closed, install a clean condensate trap in the system, and evacuate the system to 10 mm Hg absolute pressure or less. Monitor the system pressure for 10 minutes. The system is acceptable if the pressure change is less than 2 mm Hg.
11.1.1.2 System Background Test. Adjust the carrier gas and auxiliary oxygen flow rate to their normal values of 100 cc/min and 150 cc/min, respectively, with the sample recovery valve in vent position. Using a 10-ml syringe, withdraw a sample from the system effluent through the syringe port. Inject this sample into the NMO analyzer, and measure the CO
2
content. The system background is acceptable if the CO
2
concentration is less than 10 ppm.
11.1.1.3 Oxidation Catalyst Efficiency Check. Conduct a catalyst efficiency test as specified in section 10.1.1.2. If the criterion of this test cannot be met, make the necessary repairs to the system before proceeding.
11.1.2 Condensate Trap CO
2
Purge and Sample Tank Pressurization.
11.1.2.1 After sampling is completed, the condensate trap will contain condensed water and organics and a small volume of sampled gas. This gas from the stack may contain a significant amount of CO
2
which must be removed from the condensate trap before the sample is recovered. This is accomplished by purging the condensate trap with zero air and collecting the purged gas in the original sample tank.
11.1.2.2 Begin with the sample tank and condensate trap from the test run to be analyzed. Set the four-port valve of the condensate recovery system in the CO
2
purge position as shown in Figure 25-9. With the sample tank valve closed, attach the sample tank to the sample recovery system. With the sample recovery valve in the vent position and the flow control valve fully open, evacuate the manometer or pressure gauge to the vacuum of the sample tank. Next, close the vacuum pump valve, open the sample tank valve, and record the tank pressure.
11.1.2.3 Attach the dry ice-cooled condensate trap to the recovery system, and initiate the purge by switching the sample recovery valve from vent to collect position. Adjust the flow control valve to maintain atmospheric pressure in the recovery system. Continue the purge until the CO
2
concentration of the trap effluent is less than 5 ppm. CO
2
concentration in the trap effluent should be measured by extracting syringe samples from the recovery system and analyzing the samples with the NMO analyzer. This procedure should be used only after the NDIR response has reached a minimum level. Using a
10-ml syringe, extract a sample from the syringe port prior to the NDIR, and inject this sample into the NMO analyzer.
11.1.2.4 After the completion of the CO
2
purge, use the carrier gas bypass valve to pressurize the sample tank to approximately 1,060 mm Hg absolute pressure with zero air.
11.1.3 Recovery of the Condensate Trap Sample (See Figure 25-10).
11.1.3.1 Attach the ICV to the sample recovery system. With the sample recovery valve in a closed position, between vent and collect, and the flow control and ICV valves fully open, evacuate the manometer or gauge, the connecting tubing, and the ICV to 10 mm Hg absolute pressure. Close the flow-control and vacuum pump valves.
11.1.3.2 Begin auxiliary oxygen flow to the oxidation catalyst at a rate of 150 cc/min, then switch the four-way valve to the trap recovery position and the sample recovery valve to collect position. The system should now be set up to operate as indicated in Figure 25-10. After the manometer or pressure gauge begins to register a slight positive pressure, open the flow control valve. Adjust the flow-control valve to maintain atmospheric pressure in the system within 10 percent.
11.1.3.3 Remove the condensate trap from the dry ice, and allow it to warm to ambient temperature while monitoring the NDIR response. If, after 5 minutes, the CO
2
concentration of the catalyst effluent is below 10,000 ppm, discontinue the auxiliary oxygen flow to the oxidation catalyst. Begin heating the trap by placing it in a furnace preheated to 200 °C (390 °F). Once heating has begun, carefully monitor the NDIR response to ensure that the catalyst effluent concentration does not exceed 50,000 ppm. Whenever the CO
2
concentration exceeds 50,000 ppm, supply auxiliary oxygen to the catalyst at the rate of 150 cc/min. Begin heating the tubing that connected the heated sample box to the condensate trap only after the CO
2
concentration falls below 10,000 ppm. This tubing may be heated in the same oven as the condensate trap or with an auxiliary heat source such as a heat gun. Heating temperature must not exceed 200 °C (390 °F). If a heat gun is used, heat the tubing slowly along its entire length from the upstream end to the downstream end, and repeat the pattern for a total of three times. Continue the recovery until the CO
2
concentration drops to less than 10 ppm as determined by syringe injection as described under the condensate trap CO
2
purge procedure (Section 11.1.2).
11.1.3.4 After the sample recovery is completed, use the carrier gas bypass valve to pressurize the ICV to approximately 1060 mm Hg absolute pressure with zero air.
11.2 Analysis. Once the initial performance test of the NMO analyzer has been successfully completed (see section 10.1.2) and the daily CO
2
and NMO response factors have been determined (see section 10.2), proceed with sample analysis as follows:
11.2.1 Operating Conditions. The carrier gas flow rate is 29.5 cc/min He and 2.2 cc/min O
2
. The column oven is heated to 85 °C (185 °F). The order of elution for the sample from the column is CO, CH
4
, CO
2
, and NMO.
11.2.2 Analysis of Recovered Condensate Sample. Purge the sample loop with sample, and then inject the sample. Under the specified operating conditions, the CO
2
in the sample will elute in approximately 100 seconds. As soon as the detector response returns to baseline following the CO
2
peak, switch the carrier gas flow to backflush, and raise the column oven temperature to 195 °C (380 °F) as rapidly as possible. A rate of 30 °C/min (90 °F) has been shown to be adequate. Record the value obtained for the condensible organic material (C
cm
) measured as CO
2
and any measured NMO. Return the column oven temperature to 85 °C (185 °F) in preparation for the next analysis. Analyze each sample in triplicate, and report the average C
cm
.
11.2.3 Analysis of Sample Tank. Perform the analysis as described in section 11.2.2, but record only the value measured for NMO (C
tm
).

Sample holes shall be 4 mm (0.16-in.) in diameter or smaller and located at 16.7, 50, and 83.3 percent of the equivalent stack diameter. Alternatively, a single opening probe may be used so that a gas sample is collected from the centrally located 10 percent area of the stack cross-section.
6.1.3 Heated Sample Line. Stainless steel or Teflon” tubing to transport the sample gas
to the analyzer. The sample line should be heated (≥110 °C) to prevent any condensation.
6.1.4 Calibration Valve Assembly. A three-way valve assembly to direct the zero and calibration gases to the analyzers is recommended. Other methods, such as quick-connect lines, to route calibration gas to the analyzers are applicable.
6.1.5 Particulate Filter. An in-stack or an out-of-stack glass fiber filter is recommended if exhaust gas particulate loading is significant. An out-of-stack filter should be heated to prevent any condensation.

Alternatively, organic compounds other than propane can be used; the appropriate corrections for response factor must be made. Calibration gases shall be prepared in accordance with the procedure listed in Citation 2 of section 16. Additionally, the manufacturer of the cylinder should provide a recommended shelf life for each calibration gas cylinder over which the concentration does not change more than ±2 percent from the certified value. For calibration gas values not generally available (
i.e.,
organics between 1 and 10 percent by volume), alternative methods for preparing calibration gas mixtures, such as dilution systems (Test Method 205, 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix M), may be used with prior approval of the Administrator.
7.1.1 Fuel. A 40 percent H
2
/60 percent N

7.1.5 High-level Calibration Gas. An organic calibration gas with a concentration equivalent to 80 to 90 percent of the applicable span value.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
8.1 Selection of Sampling Site. The location of the sampling site is generally specified by the applicable regulation or purpose of the test (
i.e.,
exhaust stack, inlet line, etc.). The sample port shall be located to meet the testing requirements of Method 1.
8.2 Location of Sample Probe. Install the sample probe so that the probe is centrally located in the stack, pipe, or duct and is sealed tightly at the stack port connection.
8.3 Measurement System Preparation. Prior to the emission test, assemble the measurement system by following the manufacturer's written instructions for preparing sample interface and the organic analyzer. Make the system operable (Section 10.1).
8.4 Calibration Error Test. Immediately prior to the test series (within 2 hours of the start of the test), introduce zero gas and high-level calibration gas at the calibration valve assembly. Adjust the analyzer output to the appropriate levels, if necessary. Calculate the predicted response for the low-level and mid-level gases based on a linear response line between the zero and high-level response. Then introduce low-level and mid-level calibration gases successively to the measurement system. Record the analyzer responses for low-level and mid-level calibration gases and determine the differences between the measurement system responses and the predicted responses. These differences must be less than 5 percent of the respective calibration gas value. If not, the measurement system is not acceptable and must be replaced or repaired prior to testing. No adjustments to the measurement system shall be conducted after the calibration and before the drift check (Section 8.6.2). If adjustments are necessary before the completion of the test series, perform the drift checks prior to the required adjustments and repeat the calibration following the adjustments. If multiple electronic ranges are to be used, each additional range must be checked with a mid-level calibration gas to verify the multiplication factor.
8.5 Response Time Test. Introduce zero gas into the measurement system at the calibration valve assembly. When the system output has stabilized, switch quickly to the high-level calibration gas. Record the time from the concentration change to the measurement system response equivalent to 95 percent of the step change. Repeat the test three times and average the results.
8.6 Emission Measurement Test Procedure.
8.6.1 Organic Measurement. Begin sampling at the start of the test period, recording time and any required process information as appropriate. In particulate, note on the recording chart, periods of process interruption or cyclic operation.
8.6.2 Drift Determination. Immediately following the completion of the test period and hourly during the test period, reintroduce the zero and mid-level calibration gases, one at a time, to the measurement system at the calibration valve assembly. (Make no adjustments to the measurement system until both the zero and calibration drift checks are made.) Record the analyzer response. If the drift values exceed the specified limits, invalidate the test results preceding the check and repeat the test following corrections to the measurement system. Alternatively, recalibrate the test measurement system as in section 8.4 and report the results using both sets of calibration data (i.e., data determined prior to the test period and data determined following the test period).

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization
10.1 FIA equipment can be calibrated for almost any range of total organic concentrations. For high concentrations of organics (
1.0 percent by volume as propane), modifications to most commonly available analyzers are necessary. One accepted method of equipment modification is to decrease the size of the sample to the analyzer through the use of a smaller diameter sample capillary. Direct and continuous measurement of organic concentration is a necessary consideration when determining any modification design.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedure
The sample collection and analysis are concurrent for this method (see section 8.0).

# 12.0 Calculations and Data Analysis
12.1 Determine the average organic concentration in terms of ppmv as propane or other calibration gas. The average shall be determined by integration of the output recording over the period specified in the applicable regulation. If results are required in terms of ppmv as carbon, adjust measured concentrations using Equation 25A-1.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 A sample probe that has been perforated at one end is driven or augured to a depth of 0.9 m (3 ft) below the bottom of the landfill cover. A sample of the landfill gas is extracted with an evacuated cylinder. The NMOC content of the gas is determined by
injecting a portion of the gas into a gas chromatographic column to separate the NMOC from carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO
2
), and methane (CH
4
); the NMOC are oxidized to CO
2
, reduced to CH
4
, and measured by a flame ionization detector (FID). In this manner, the variable response of the FID associated with different types of organics is eliminated.

# 5.0 Safety
5.1 Since this method is complex, only experienced personnel should perform this test. LFG contains methane, therefore explosive mixtures may exist on or near the landfill. It is advisable to take appropriate safety precautions when testing landfills, such as refraining from smoking and installing explosion-proof equipment.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies

Non-perforated probes are allowed as long as they are withdrawn to create a gap equivalent to having the bottom third perforated. The sample probe must be capped at the bottom and must have a threaded cap with a sampling attachment at the top. The sample probe must be long enough to go through and extend no less than 0.9 m (3 ft) below the landfill cover. If the sample probe is to be driven into the landfill, the bottom cap should be designed to facilitate driving the probe into the landfill.
6.2 Sampling Train.

6.5.1 Pilot Probe. Tubing of sufficient strength to withstand being driven into the landfill by a post driver and an outside diameter of at least 6 mm (0.25 in.) smaller than the sample probe. The pilot probe shall be capped on both ends and long enough to go through the landfill cover and extend no less than 0.9 m (3 ft) into the landfill.
6.5.2 Post Driver and Compressor. Capable of driving the pilot probe and the sampling probe into the landfill. The Kitty Hawk portable post driver has been found to be acceptable.
6.6 Auger Procedure. The following are needed only if the tester chooses to use the procedure described in section 8.2.2.
6.6.1 Auger. Capable of drilling through the landfill cover and to a depth of no less than 0.9 m (3 ft) into the landfill.
6.6.2 Pea Gravel.
6.6.3 Bentonite.
6.7 NMOC Analyzer, Barometer, Thermometer, and Syringes. Same as in sections 6.3.1, 6.3.2, 6.33, and 6.2.10, respectively, of Method 25.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards
7.1 NMOC Analysis. Same as in Method 25, section 7.2.
7.2 Calibration. Same as in Method 25, section 7.4, except omit section 7.4.3.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
8.1 Sample Tank Evacuation and Leak-Check. Conduct the sample tank evacuation and leak-check either in the laboratory or the field. Connect the pressure gauge and sampling valve to the sample tank. Evacuate the sample tank to 10 mm Hg (5.4 in H
2
O) absolute pressure or less. Close the sampling valve, and allow the tank to sit for 30 minutes. The tank is acceptable if no change more than ±2 mm is noted. Include the results of the leak-check in the test report.
8.2 Sample Probe Installation. The tester may use the procedure in section 8.2.1 or 8.2.2.
8.2.1 Pilot Probe Procedure. Use the post driver to drive the pilot probe at least 0.9 m (3 ft) below the landfill cover. Alternative procedures to drive the probe into the landfill may be used subject to the approval of the Administrator's designated representative.
8.2.1.1 Remove the pilot probe and drive the sample probe into the hole left by the pilot probe. The sample probe shall extend at least 0.9 m (3 ft) below the landfill cover and shall protrude about 0.3 m (1 ft) above the landfill cover. Seal around the sampling probe with bentonite and cap the sampling probe with the sampling probe cap.
8.2.2 Auger Procedure. Use an auger to drill a hole to at least 0.9 m (3 ft) below the landfill cover. Place the sample probe in the hole and backfill with pea gravel to a level 0.6 m (2 ft) from the surface. The sample probe shall protrude at least 0.3 m (1 ft) above the landfill cover. Seal the remaining area around the probe with bentonite. Allow 24
hours for the landfill gases to equilibrate inside the augured probe before sampling.
8.2.3 Driven Probes. Closed-point probes may be driven directly into the landfill in a single step. This method may not require backfilling if the probe is adequately sealed by its insertion. Unperforated probes that are inserted in this manner and withdrawn at a distance from a detachable tip to create an open space are also acceptable.
8.3 Sample Train Assembly. Just before assembling the sample train, measure the sample tank vacuum using the pressure gauge. Record the vacuum, the ambient temperature, and the barometric pressure at this time. Assemble the sampling probe purging system as shown in Figure 25C-1.
8.4 Sampling Procedure. Open the sampling valve and use the purge pump and the flow control valve to evacuate at least two sample probe volumes from the system at a flow rate of 500 ml/min or less. Close the sampling valve and replace the purge pump with the sample tank apparatus as shown in Figure 25C-2. Open the sampling valve and the sample tank valve and, using the flow control valve, sample at a flow rate of 500 ml/min or less until either a constant flow rate can no longer be maintained because of reduced sample tank vacuum or the appropriate composite volume is attained. Disconnect the sampling tank apparatus and pressurize the sample cylinder to approximately 1,060 mm Hg (567 in. H
2
O) absolute pressure with helium, and record the final pressure. Alternatively, the sample tank may be pressurized in the lab.
8.4.1 The following restrictions apply to compositing samples from different probe sites into a single cylinder: (1) Individual composite samples per cylinder must be of equal volume; this must be verified by recording the flow rate, sampling time, vacuum readings, or other appropriate volume measuring data, (2) individual composite samples must have a minimum volume of 1 liter unless data is provided showing smaller volumes can be accurately measured, and (3) composite samples must not be collected using the final cylinder vacuum as it diminishes to ambient pressure.
8.4.2 Use Method 3C to determine the percent N
2
and O
2
in each cylinder. The presence of N
2
and O
2
indicate either infiltration of ambient air into the landfill gas sample or an inappropriate testing site has been chosen where anaerobic decomposition has not begun. The landfill gas sample is acceptable if the concentration of N
2
is less than 20 percent. Alternatively, the oxygen content of each cylinder must be less than 5 percent. Landfills with 3-year average annual rainfalls equal to or less than 20 inches annual rainfalls samples are acceptable when the N
2
to O
2
concentration ratio is greater than 3.71.

10.2 NMOC Analyzer Daily Calibration.
10.2.1 NMOC Response Factors. Same as in Method 25, section 10.2.2.
10.3 Sample Tank Volume. The volume of the gas sampling tanks must be determined. Determine the tank volumes by weighing them empty and then filled with deionized water; weigh to the nearest 5 g, and record the results. Alternatively, measure the volume of water used to fill them to the nearest 5 ml.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedures
11.1 The oxidation, reduction, and measurement of NMOC's is similar to Method 25. Before putting the NMOC analyzer into routine operation, conduct an initial performance test. Start the analyzer, and perform all the necessary functions in order to put the analyzer into proper working order. Conduct the performance test according to the procedures established in section 10.1. Once the
performance test has been successfully completed and the NMOC calibration response factor has been determined, proceed with sample analysis as follows:
11.1.1 Daily Operations and Calibration Checks. Before and immediately after the analysis of each set of samples or on a daily basis (whichever occurs first), conduct a calibration test according to the procedures established in section 10.2. If the criteria of the daily calibration test cannot be met, repeat the NMOC analyzer performance test (Section 10.1) before proceeding.
11.1.2 Operating Conditions. Same as in Method 25, section 11.2.1.
11.1.3 Analysis of Sample Tank. Purge the sample loop with sample, and then inject the sample. Under the specified operating conditions, the CO
2
in the sample will elute in approximately 100 seconds. As soon as the detector response returns to baseline following the CO
2
peak, switch the carrier gas flow to backflush, and raise the column oven temperature to 195 °C (383 °F) as rapidly as possible. A rate of 30 °C/min (54 °F/min) has been shown to be adequate. Record the value obtained for any measured NMOC. Return the column oven temperature to 85 °C (185 °F) in preparation for the next analysis. Analyze each sample in triplicate, and report the average as C
tm
.

# Method 25D—Determination of the Volatile Organic Concentration of Waste Samples

# Note:
Performance of this method should not be attempted by persons unfamiliar with the operation of a flame ionization detector (FID) or an electrolytic conductivity detector (ELCD) because knowledge beyond the scope of this presentation is required.

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1 Analyte. Volatile Organic Compounds. No CAS No. assigned.
1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for determining the volatile organic (VO) concentration of a waste sample.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 Principle. A sample of waste is obtained at a point which is most representative of the unexposed waste (where the waste has had minimum opportunity to volatilize to the atmosphere). The sample is suspended in an organic/aqueous matrix, then heated and purged with nitrogen for 30 min. in order to separate certain organic compounds. Part of the sample is analyzed for carbon concentration, as methane, with an FID, and part of the sample is analyzed for chlorine concentration, as chloride, with an ELCD. The VO concentration is the sum of the carbon and chlorine content of the sample.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
8.1 Sampling.
8.1.1 Sampling Plan Design and Development. Use the procedures in chapter nine of Reference 1 in section 16 as guidance in developing a sampling plan.
8.1.2 Single Phase or Well-mixed Waste.
8.1.2.1 Install a sampling tap to obtain the sample at a point which is most representative of the unexposed waste (where the waste has had minimum opportunity to volatilize to the atmosphere). Assemble the sampling apparatus as shown in Figure 25D-5.
8.1.2.2 Prepare the sampling containers as follows: Pour 30 mL of clean PEG into the container. PEG will reduce but not eliminate the loss of organics during sample collection. Weigh the sample container with the screw cap, the PEG, and any labels to the nearest 0.01 g and record the weight (m
st
). Store the containers in an ice bath until 1 hour before sampling (PEG will solidify at ice bath temperatures; allow the containers to reach room temperature before sampling).
8.1.2.3 Begin sampling by purging the sample lines and cooling coil with at least four volumes of waste. Collect the purged material in a separate container and dispose of it properly.
8.1.2.4 After purging, stop the sample flow and direct the sampling tube to a preweighed sample container, prepared as described in section 8.1.2.2. Keep the tip of the tube below the surface of the PEG during sampling to minimize contact with the atmosphere. Sample at a flow rate such that the temperature of the waste is less than 10 °C (50 °F). Fill the sample container and immediately cap it (within 5 seconds) so that a minimum headspace exists in the container. Store immediately in a cooler and cover with ice.
8.1.3 Multiple-phase Waste. Collect a 10 g sample of each phase of waste generated using the procedures described in section 8.1.2 or 8.1.5. Each phase of the waste shall be analyzed as a separate sample. Calculate the weighted average VO concentration of the waste using Equation 25D-13 (Section 12.14).
8.1.4 Solid waste. Add approximately 10 g of the solid waste to a container prepared in the manner described in section 8.1.2.2, minimizing headspace. Cap and chill immediately.
8.1.5 Alternative to Tap Installation. If tap installation is impractical or impossible, fill a large, clean, empty container by submerging the container into the waste below the surface of the waste. Immediately fill a container prepared in the manner described in section 8.1.2.2 with approximately 10 g of the waste collected in the large container. Minimize headspace, cap and chill immediately.
8.1.6 Alternative sampling techniques may be used upon the approval of the Administrator.
8.2 Sample Recovery.
8.2.1 Assemble the purging apparatus as shown in Figures 25D-1 and 25D-2. The oven shall be heated to 75 ±2 °C (167 ±3.6 °F). The sampling lines leading from the oven to the detectors shall be heated to 120 ±10 °C (248 ±18 °F) with no cold spots. The flame ionization detector shall be operated with a heated block. Adjust the purging lance so that it reaches the bottom of the chamber.
8.2.2 Remove the sample container from the cooler, and wipe the exterior of the container to remove any extraneous ice, water, or other debris. Reweigh the sample container to the nearest 0.01 g, and record the weight (m
sf
). Pour the contents of the sample container into the purging flask, rinse the sample container three times with a total of 20 mL of PEG (since the sample container originally held 30 mL of PEG, the total volume of PEG added to the purging flask will be 50 mL), transferring the rinsings to the purging flask after each rinse. Cap purging flask between rinses. The total volume of PEG in the purging flask shall be 50 mL. Add 50 mL of water to the purging flask.

# 9.0 Quality Control
9.1 Quality Control Samples. If audit samples are not available, prepare and analyze the two types of quality control samples (QCS) listed in Sections 9.1.1 and 9.1.2. Before placing the system in operation, after a shutdown of greater than six months, and after any major modifications, analyze each QCS in triplicate. For each detector, calculate the percent recovery by dividing measured concentration by theoretical concentration and multiplying by 100. Determine the mean percent recovery for each detector for each QCS triplicate analysis. The RSD for any triplicate analysis shall be ≤10 percent. For QCS 1 (methylene chloride), the percent recovery shall be ≥90 percent for carbon as methane, and ≥55 percent for chlorine as chloride. For QCS 2 (1,3-dichloro-2-propanol), the percent recovery shall be ≤15 percent for carbon as methane, and ≤6 percent for chlorine as chloride. If the analytical system does not meet the above-mentioned criteria for both detectors, check the system parameters (temperature, system pressure, purge rate, etc.), correct the problem, and repeat the triplicate analysis of each QCS.
9.1.1 QCS 1, Methylene Chloride. Prepare a stock solution by weighing, to the nearest 0.1 mg, 55 µL of HPLC grade methylene chloride in a tared 5 mL volumetric flask. Record the weight in milligrams, dilute to 5 mL with cleaned PEG, and inject 100 µL of the stock solution into a sample prepared as a water blank (50 mL of cleaned PEG and 60 mL of water in the purging flask). Analyze
the QCS according to the procedures described in sections 10.2 and 10.3, excluding section 10.2.2. To calculate the theoretical carbon concentration (in mg) in QCS 1, multiply mg of methylene chloride in the stock solution by 3.777 × 10
−3
. To calculate the theoretical chlorine concentration (in mg) in QCS 1, multiply mg of methylene chloride in the stock solution by 1.670 × 10
−2
.
9.1.2 QCS 2, 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol. Prepare a stock solution by weighing, to the nearest 0.1 mg, 60 µL of high purity grade 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol in a tared 5 mL volumetric flask. Record the weight in milligrams, dilute to 5 mL with cleaned PEG, and inject 100 µL of the stock solution into a sample prepared as a water blank (50 mL of cleaned PEG and 60 mL of water in the purging flask). Analyze the QCS according to the procedures described in sections 10.2 and 10.3, excluding section 10.2.2. To calculate the theoretical carbon concentration (in mg) in QCS 2, multiply mg of 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol in the stock solution by 7.461 × 10
−3
. To calculate the theoretical chlorine concentration (in mg) in QCS 2, multiply mg of 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol in the stock solution by 1.099 × 10
−2
.
9.1.3 Routine QCS Analysis. For each set of compliance samples (in this context, set is per facility, per compliance test), analyze one QCS 1 and one QCS 2 sample. The percent recovery for each sample for each detector shall be ±13 percent of the mean recovery established for the most recent set of QCS triplicate analysis (Section 9.4). If the sample does not meet this criteria, check the system components and analyze another QCS 1 and 2 until a single set of QCS meet the ±13 percent criteria.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization
10.1 Initial Performance Check of Purging System. Before placing the system in operation, after a shutdown of greater than six months, after any major modifications, and at least once per month during continuous operation, conduct the linearity checks described in sections 10.1.1 and 10.1.2. Install calibration gas at the three-way calibration gas valve. See Figure 25D-1.
10.1.1 Linearity Check Procedure. Using the calibration standard described in section 7.2.2.3 and by varying the injection time, it is possible to calibrate at multiple concentration levels. Use Equation 25D-3 to calculate three sets of calibration gas flow rates and run times needed to introduce a total mass of carbon, as methane, (m
c
) of 1, 5, and 10 mg into the system (low, medium and high FID calibration, respectively). Use Equation 25D-4 to calculate three sets of calibration gas flow rates and run times needed to introduce a total chloride mass (m
ch
) of 1, 5, and 10 mg into the system (low, medium and high ELCD calibration, respectively). With the system operating in standby mode, allow the FID and the ELCD to establish a stable baseline. Set the secondary pressure regulator of the calibration gas cylinder to the same pressure as the purge gas cylinder and set the proper flow rate with the calibration flow controller (see Figure 25D-1). The calibration gas flow rate can be measured with a flowmeter attached to the vent position of the calibration gas valve. Set the four-way bypass valve to standby position so that the calibration gas flows through the coalescing filter only. Inject the calibration gas by turning the calibration gas valve from vent position to inject position. Continue the calibration gas flow for the appropriate period of time before switching the calibration valve to vent position. Continue recording the response of the FID and the ELCD for 5 min after switching off calibration gas flow. Make triplicate injections of all six levels of calibration.
10.1.2 Linearity Criteria. Calculate the average response factor (Equations 25D-5 and 25D-6) and the relative standard deviation (RSD) (Equation 25D-10) at each level of the calibration curve for both detectors. Calculate the overall mean of the three response factor averages for each detector. The FID linearity is acceptable if each response factor is within 5 percent of the overall mean and if the RSD for each set of triplicate injections is less than 5 percent. The ELCD linearity is acceptable if each response factor is within 10 percent of the overall mean and if the RSD for each set of triplicate injections is less than 10 percent. Record the overall mean value of the response factors for the FID and the ELCD. If the calibration for either the FID or the ELCD does not meet the criteria, correct the detector/system problem and repeat sections 10.1.1 and 10.1.2.
10.2 Daily Calibrations.
10.2.1 Daily Linearity Check. Follow the procedures outlined in section 10.1.1 to analyze the medium level calibration for both the FID and the ELCD in duplicate at the start of the day. Calculate the response factors and the RSDs for each detector. For the FID, the calibration is acceptable if the average response factor is within 5 percent of the overall mean response factor (Section 10.1.2) and if the RSD for the duplicate injection is less than 5 percent. For the ELCD, the calibration is acceptable if the average response factor is within 10 percent of the overall mean response factor (Section 10.1.2) and if the RSD for the duplicate injection is less than 10 percent. If the calibration for either the FID or the ELCD does not meet the criteria, correct the detector/system problem and repeat sections 10.1.1 and 10.1.2.
10.2.2 Calibration Range Check.
10.2.2.1 If the waste concentration for either detector falls below the range of calibration for that detector, use the procedure outlined in section 10.1.1 to choose two calibration points that bracket the new target
concentration. Analyze each of these points in triplicate (as outlined in section 10.1.1) and use the criteria in section 10.1.2 to determine the linearity of the detector in this “mini-calibration” range.
10.2.2.2 After the initial linearity check of the mini-calibration curve, it is only necessary to test one of the points in duplicate for the daily calibration check (in addition to the points specified in section 10.2.1). The average daily mini-calibration point should fit the linearity criteria specified in section 10.2.1. If the calibration for either the FID or the ELCD does not meet the criteria, correct the detector/system problem and repeat the calibration procedure mentioned in the first paragraph of section 10.2.2. A mini-calibration curve for waste concentrations above the calibration curve for either detector is optional.
10.3 Analytical Balance. Calibrate against standard weights.

# 11.0 Analysis
11.1 Sample Analysis.
11.1.1 Turn on the constant temperature chamber and allow the temperature to equilibrate at 75 ±2 °C (167 ±3.6 °F). Turn the four-way valve so that the purge gas bypasses the purging flask, the purge gas flowing through the coalescing filter and to the detectors (standby mode). Turn on the purge gas. Allow both the FID and the ELCD to warm up until a stable baseline is achieved on each detector. Pack the filter flask with ice. Replace ice after each run and dispose of the waste water properly. When the temperature of the oven reaches 75 ±2 °C (167 ±3.6 °F), start both integrators and record baseline. After 1 min, turn the four-way valve so that the purge gas flows through the purging flask, to the coalescing filter and to the sample splitters (purge mode). Continue recording the response of the FID and the ELCD. Monitor the readings of the pressure gauge and the rotameter. If the readings fall below established setpoints, stop the purging, determine the source of the leak, and resolve the problem before resuming. Leaks detected during a sampling period invalidate that sample.
11.1.2 As the purging continues, monitor the output of the detectors to make certain that the analysis is proceeding correctly and that the results are being properly recorded. Every 10 minutes read and record the purge flow rate, the pressure and the chamber temperature. Continue the purging for 30 minutes.
11.1.3 For each detector output, integrate over the entire area of the peak starting at 1 minute and continuing until the end of the run. Subtract the established baseline area from the peak area. Record the corrected area of the peak. See Figure 25D-6 for an example integration.
11.2 Water Blank. A water blank shall be analyzed for each batch of cleaned PEG prepared. Transfer about 60 mL of water into the purging flask. Add 50 mL of the cleaned PEG to the purging flask. Treat the blank as described in sections 8.2 and 8.3, excluding section 8.2.2. Calculate the concentration of carbon and chlorine in the blank sample (assume 10 g of waste as the mass). A VO concentration equivalent to ≤10 percent of the applicable standard may be subtracted from the measured VO concentration of the waste samples. Include all blank results and documentation in the test report.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization

# Note:
Maintain a record of performance of each item.
10.1 Use the procedures in sections 10.2 to calibrate the headspace analyzer and FID and check for linearity before the system is first placed in operation, after any shutdown longer than 6 months, and after any modification of the system.
10.2 Calibration and Linearity. Use the procedures in section 10 of Method 18 of Part 60, Appendix A, to prepare the standards and calibrate the flowmeters, using propane as the standard gas. Fill the calibration standard vials halfway (±5 percent) with deionized water. Purge and fill the airspace with calibration standard. Prepare a minimum of three concentrations of calibration standards in triplicate at concentrations that will bracket the applicable cutoff. For a cutoff of 5.2 kPa (0.75 psi), prepare nominal concentrations of 30,000, 50,000, and 70,000 ppm as propane. For a cutoff of 27.6 kPa (4.0 psi), prepare nominal concentrations of 200,000, 300,000, and 400,000 ppm as propane.
10.2.1 Use the procedures in section 11.3 to measure the FID response of each standard. Use a linear regression analysis to calculate the values for the slope (k) and the y-intercept (b). Use the procedures in sections 12.3 and 12.2 to test the calibration and the linearity.
10.3 Daily FID Calibration Check. Check the calibration at the beginning and at the end of the daily runs by using the following procedures. Prepare 2 calibration standards at the nominal cutoff concentration using the procedures in section 10.2. Place one at the beginning and one at the end of the daily run. Measure the FID response of the daily calibration standard and use the values for k and b from the most recent calibration to calculate the concentration of the daily standard. Use an equation similar to 25E-2 to calculate the percent difference between the daily standard and C
s
. If the difference is within 5 percent, then the previous values for k and b can be used. Otherwise, use the procedures in section 10.2 to recalibrate the FID.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedures

The test methods in this appendix are referred to in § 60.8 (Performance Tests) and § 60.11 (Compliance With Standards and Maintenance Requirements) of 40 CFR part 60, subpart A (General Provisions). Specific uses of these test methods are described in the standards of performance contained in the subparts, beginning with Subpart D.
Within each standard of performance, a section title “Test Methods and Procedures” is provided to: (1) Identify the test methods to be used as reference methods to the facility subject to the respective standard and (2) identify any special instructions or conditions to be followed when applying a method to the respective facility. Such instructions (for example, establish sampling rates, volumes, or temperatures) are to be used either in addition to, or as a substitute for procedures in a test method. Similarly, for sources subject to emission monitoring requirements, specific instructions pertaining to any use of a test method as a reference method are provided in the subpart or in Appendix B.
Inclusion of methods in this appendix is not intended as an endorsement or denial of their applicability to sources that are not subject to standards of performance. The methods are potentially applicable to other sources; however, applicability should be confirmed by careful and appropriate evaluation of the conditions prevalent at such sources.
The approach followed in the formulation of the test methods involves specifications for equipment, procedures, and performance. In concept, a performance specification approach would be preferable in all methods because this allows the greatest flexibility to the user. In practice, however, this approach is impractical in most cases because performance specifications cannot be established. Most of the methods described herein, therefore, involve specific equipment specifications and procedures, and only a few methods in this appendix rely on performance criteria.
Minor changes in the test methods should not necessarily affect the validity of the results and it is recognized that alternative and equivalent methods exist. section 60.8 provides authority for the Administrator to specify or approve (1) equivalent methods, (2) alternative methods, and (3) minor changes in the methodology of the test methods. It should be clearly understood that unless otherwise identified all such methods and changes must have prior approval of the Administrator. An owner employing such methods or deviations from the test methods without obtaining prior approval does so at the risk of subsequent disapproval and retesting with approved methods.
Within the test methods, certain specific equipment or procedures are recognized as being acceptable or potentially acceptable and are specifically identified in the methods. The items identified as acceptable options may be used without approval but must be identified in the test report. The potentially approvable options are cited as “subject to the approval of the Administrator” or as “or equivalent.” Such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives may be used at the discretion of the owner without prior approval. However, detailed descriptions for applying these potentially approvable techniques or alternatives are not provided in the test methods. Also, the potentially approvable options are not necessarily acceptable in all applications. Therefore, an owner electing to use such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives is responsible for: (1) assuring that the techniques or alternatives are in fact applicable and are properly executed; (2) including a written description of the alternative method in the test report (the written method must be clear and must be capable of being performed without additional instruction, and the degree of detail should be similar to the detail contained in the test methods); and (3) providing any rationale or supporting data necessary to show the validity of the alternative in the particular application. Failure to meet these requirements can result in the Administrator's disapproval of the alternative.

1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for determining emissions of hydrogen halides (HX) (HCl, HBr, and HF) and halogens (X
2
) (Cl
2
and Br
2
) from stationary sources when specified by the applicable subpart. Sources, such as those controlled by wet scrubbers, that emit acid particulate matter must be sampled using Method 26A.
1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 An integrated sample is extracted from the source and passed through a prepurged heated probe and filter into dilute sulfuric acid and dilute sodium hydroxide solutions which collect the gaseous hydrogen halides and halogens, respectively. The filter collects particulate matter including halide salts but is not routinely recovered and analyzed. The hydrogen halides are solubilized in the acidic solution and form chloride (Cl
−
), bromide (Br
−
), and fluoride (F
−
) ions. The halogens have a very low solubility in the acidic solution and pass through to the alkaline solution where they are hydrolyzed to form a proton (H
+
), the halide ion, and the hypohalous acid (HClO or HBrO). Sodium thiosulfate is added in excess to the alkaline solution to assure reaction with the hypohalous acid to form a second halide ion such that 2 halide ions are formed for each molecule of halogen gas. The halide ions in the separate solutions are measured by ion chromatography (IC).

# 3.0 Definitions
[Reserved]

# 4.0 Interferences
4.1 Volatile materials, such as chlorine dioxide (ClO
2
) and ammonium chloride (NH
4
Cl), which produce halide ions upon dissolution during sampling are potential interferents. Interferents for the halide measurements are the halogen gases which disproportionate to a hydrogen halide and a hydrohalous acid upon dissolution in water. However, the use of acidic rather than neutral or basic solutions for collection of the hydrogen halides greatly reduces the dissolution of any halogens passing through this solution.
4.2 The simultaneous presence of HBr and CL
2
may cause a positive bias in the HCL result with a corresponding negative bias in the Cl
2
result as well as affecting the HBr/Br
2
split.
4.3 High concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NO
X
) may produce sufficient nitrate (NO
3
−
to interfere with measurements of very low Br
−
levels.
4.4 A glass wool plug should
not
be used to remove particulate matter since a negative bias in the data could result.
4.5 There is anecdotal evidence that HF may be outgassed from new teflon components. If HF is a target analyte, then preconditioning of new teflon components, by heating should be considered.

# 5.0 Safety
5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before performing this test method.
5.2 Corrosive Reagents. The following reagents are hazardous. Personal protective equipment and safe procedures are useful in preventing chemical splashes. If contact occurs, immediately flush with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. Remove clothing under shower and decontaminate. Treat residual chemical burns as thermal burns.
5.2.1 Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH). Causes severe damage to eyes and skin. Inhalation causes irritation to nose, throat, and lungs. Reacts exothermically with limited amounts of water.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards

# Note:
Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents must conform to the specifications established by the Committee on Analytical Reagents of the American Chemical Society (ACS reagent grade). When such specifications are not available, the best available grade shall be used.
7.1 Sampling.
7.1.1 Filter. A 25-mm (1 in) (or other size) Teflon glass mat, Pallflex TX40HI75 (Pallflex Inc., 125 Kennedy Drive, Putnam, CT 06260). This filter is in a mat configuration to prevent fine particulate matter from entering the sampling train. Its composition is 75% Teflon/25% borosilicate glass. Other filters may be used, but they must be in a mat (as opposed to a laminate) configuration and contain at least 75% Teflon. For practical rather than scientific reasons, when the stack gas temperature exceeds 210 °C (410 °F) and the HCl concentration is greater than 20 ppm, a quartz-fiber filter may be used since Teflon becomes unstable above this temperature.
7.1.2 Water. Deionized, distilled water that conforms to American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) Specification D 1193-77 or 91, Type 3 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17).
7.1.3 Acidic Absorbing Solution, 0.1 N Sulfuric Acid (H
2
SO
4
). To prepare 100 ml of the absorbing solution for the front impinger pair, slowly add 0.28 ml of concentrated H
2
SO
4
to about 90 ml of water while stirring, and adjust the final volume to 100 ml using additional water. Shake well to mix the solution.
7.1.4 Silica Gel. Indicating type, 6 to 16 mesh. If previously used, dry at 180 °C (350 °F) for 2 hours. New silica gel may be used as received. Alternatively, other types of desiccants may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.
7.1.5 Alkaline Adsorbing Solution, 0.1 N Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH). To prepare 100 ml of the scrubber solution for the third and fourth impinger, dissolve 0.40 g of solid NaOH in about 90 ml of water, and adjust the final
solution volume to 100 ml using additional water. Shake well to mix the solution.
7.1.6 Sodium Thiosulfate (Na
2
S

7.2 Sample Preparation and Analysis.
7.2.1 Water. Same as in section 7.1.2.
7.2.2 Absorbing Solution Blanks. A separate blank solution of each absorbing reagent should be prepared for analysis with the field samples. Dilute 30 ml of each absorbing solution to approximately the same final volume as the field samples using the blank sample of rinse water.
7.2.3 Halide Salt Stock Standard Solutions. Prepare concentrated stock solutions from reagent grade sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium bromide (NaBr), and sodium fluoride (NaF). Each must be dried at 110 °C (230 °F) for two or more hours and then cooled to room temperature in a desiccator immediately before weighing. Accurately weigh 1.6 to 1.7 g of the dried NaCl to within 0.1 mg, dissolve in water, and dilute to 1 liter. Calculate the exact Cl
−
concentration using Equation 26-1 in section 12.2. In a similar manner, accurately weigh and solubilize 1.2 to 1.3 g of dried NaBr and 2.2 to 2.3 g of NaF to make 1-liter solutions. Use Equations 26-2 and 26-3 in section 12.2, to calculate the Br
−
and F
−
concentrations. Alternately, solutions containing a nominal certified concentration of 1000 mg/l NaCl are commercially available as convenient stock solutions from which standards can be made by appropriate volumetric dilution. Refrigerate the stock standard solutions and store no longer than one month.
7.2.4 Chromatographic Eluent. Effective eluents for nonsuppressed IC using a resin-or silica-based weak ion exchange column are a 4 mM potassium hydrogen phthalate solution, adjusted to pH 4.0 using a saturated sodium borate solution, and a 4 mM 4-hydroxy benzoate solution, adjusted to pH 8.6 using 1 N NaOH. An effective eluent for suppressed ion chromatography is a solution containing 3 mM sodium bicarbonate and 2.4 mM sodium carbonate. Other dilute solutions buffered to a similar pH and containing no interfering ions may be used. When using suppressed ion chromatography, if the “water dip” resulting from sample injection interferes with the chloride peak, use a 2 mM NaOH/2.4 mM sodium bicarbonate eluent.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport

# Note:
Because of the complexity of this method, testers and analyst should be trained and experienced with the procedure to ensure reliable results.
8.1 Sampling.
8.1.1 Preparation of Collection Train. Prepare the sampling train as follows: Pour 15 ml of the acidic absorbing solution into each one of the first pair of impingers, and 15 ml of the alkaline absorbing solution into each one of the second pair of impingers. Connect the impingers in series with the knockout impinger first, if used, followed by the two impingers containing the acidic absorbing solution and the two impingers containing the alkaline absorbing solution. Place a fresh charge of silica gel, or equivalent, in the drying tube or impinger at the end of the impinger train.
8.1.2 Adjust the probe temperature and the temperature of the filter and the stopcock (
i.e.,
the heated area in Figure 26-1) to a temperature sufficient to prevent water condensation. This temperature must be maintained between 120 and 134 °C (248 and 273 °F). The temperature should be monitored throughout a sampling run to ensure that the desired temperature is maintained. It is important to maintain a temperature around the probe and filter in this range since it is extremely difficult to purge acid gases off these components. (These components are not quantitatively recovered and, hence, any collection of acid gases on these components would result in potential under reporting of these emissions. The applicable subparts may specify alternative higher temperatures.)
8.1.3 Leak-Check Procedure.
8.1.3.1 Sampling Train. A leak-check prior to the sampling run is optional; however, a leak-check after the sampling run is mandatory. The leak-check procedure is as follows: Temporarily attach a suitable [
e.g.,
0-40 cc/min (0-2.4 in
3
/min)] rotameter to the outlet of the dry gas meter and place a vacuum gauge at or near the probe inlet. Plug the probe inlet, pull a vacuum of at least 250 mm Hg (10 in. Hg), and note the flow rate as indicated by the rotameter. A leakage rate not in excess of 2 percent of the average sampling rate is acceptable.

# Note:
Carefully release the probe inlet plug before turning off the pump.
8.1.3.2 Pump. It is suggested (not mandatory) that the pump be leak-checked separately, either prior to or after the sampling run. If done prior to the sampling run, the pump leak-check shall precede the leak-check of the sampling train described immediately above; if done after the sampling run, the pump leak-check shall follow the train leak-check. To leak-check the pump, proceed as follows: Disconnect the drying tube from the probe-impinger assembly. Place a vacuum gauge at the inlet to either the drying tube or pump, pull a vacuum of 250 mm (10 in) Hg, plug or pinch off the outlet of the flow meter, and then turn off the pump. The vacuum should remain stable for at least 30 sec. Other leak-check procedures may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
8.1.4 Purge Procedure. Immediately before sampling, connect the purge line to the stopcock, and turn the stopcock to permit the purge pump to purge the probe (see Figure 1A of Figure 26-1). Turn on the purge pump, and adjust the purge rate to 2 liters/min (0.07 ft
3
/min). Purge for at least 5 minutes before sampling.
8.1.5 Sample Collection. Turn on the sampling pump, pull a slight vacuum of approximately 25 mm Hg (1 in Hg) on the impinger train, and turn the stopcock to permit stack gas to be pulled through the impinger train (see Figure 1C of Figure 26-1). Adjust the sampling rate to 2 liters/min, as indicated by the rate meter, and maintain this rate to within 10 percent during the entire sampling run. Take readings of the dry gas meter volume and temperature, rate meter, and vacuum gauge at least once every five minutes during the run. A sampling time of one hour is recommended. Shorter sampling times may introduce a significant negative bias in the HCl concentration. At the conclusion of the sampling run, remove the train from the stack, cool, and perform a leak-check as described in section 8.1.3.1.
8.2 Sample Recovery.
8.2.1 Disconnect the impingers after sampling. Quantitatively transfer the contents of the acid impingers and the knockout impinger, if used, to a leak-free storage bottle. Add the water rinses of each of these impingers and connecting glassware to the storage bottle.
8.2.2 Repeat this procedure for the alkaline impingers and connecting glassware using a separate storage bottle. Add 25 mg of sodium thiosulfate per the product of ppm of halogen anticipated to be in the stack gas times the volume (dscm) of stack gas sampled (0.7 mg per ppm-dscf).

# Note:
This amount of sodium thiosulfate includes a safety factor of approximately 5 to assure complete reaction with the hypohalous acid to form a second Cl
−
ion in the alkaline solution.
8.2.3 Save portions of the absorbing reagents (0.1 N H
2
SO
4
and 0.1 N NaOH) equivalent to the amount used in the sampling train (these are the absorbing solution blanks described in section 7.2.2); dilute to the approximate volume of the corresponding samples using rinse water directly from the wash bottle being used. Add the same amount of sodium thiosulfate solution to the 0.1 N NaOH absorbing solution blank. Also, save a portion of the rinse water used to rinse the sampling train. Place each in a separate, prelabeled storage bottle. The sample storage bottles should be sealed, shaken to mix, and labeled. Mark the fluid level.
8.3 Sample Preparation for Analysis. Note the liquid levels in the storage bottles and confirm on the analysis sheet whether or not leakage occurred during transport. If a noticeable leakage has occurred, either void the sample or use methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to correct the final results. Quantitatively transfer the sample solutions to 100-ml volumetric flasks, and dilute to 100 ml with water.

# 9.0 Quality Control [Reserved]

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization

# Note:
Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.
10.1 Volume Metering System, Temperature Sensors, Rate Meter, and Barometer. Same as in Method 6, sections 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, and 10.4.
10.2 Ion Chromatograph.
10.2.1 To prepare the calibration standards, dilute given amounts (1.0 ml or greater) of the stock standard solutions to convenient volumes, using 0.1 N H
2
SO
4
or 0.1 N NaOH, as appropriate. Prepare at least four calibration standards for each absorbing reagent containing the appropriate stock solutions such that they are within the linear range of the field samples.
10.2.2 Using one of the standards in each series, ensure adequate baseline separation for the peaks of interest.
10.2.3 Inject the appropriate series of calibration standards, starting with the lowest concentration standard first both before and after injection of the quality control check sample, reagent blanks, and field samples. This allows compensation for any instrument drift occurring during sample analysis. The values from duplicate injections of these calibration samples should agree within 5 percent of their mean for the analysis to be valid.
10.2.4 Determine the peak areas, or heights, for the standards and plot individual values versus halide ion concentrations in µg/ml.
10.2.5 Draw a smooth curve through the points. Use linear regression to calculate a formula describing the resulting linear curve.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedures
11.1 Sample Analysis.
11.1.1 The IC conditions will depend upon analytical column type and whether suppressed or non-suppressed IC is used. An example chromatogram from a non-suppressed system using a 150-mm Hamilton PRP-X100 anion column, a 2 ml/min flow rate of a 4 mM 4-hydroxy benzoate solution adjusted to a pH of 8.6 using 1 N NaOH, a 50 µl sample loop, and a conductivity detector set on 1.0 µS full scale is shown in Figure 26-2.
11.1.2 Before sample analysis, establish a stable baseline. Next, inject a sample of water, and determine if any Cl
−
, Br
−
, or F
−
appears in the chromatogram. If any of these ions are present, repeat the load/injection
procedure until they are no longer present. Analysis of the acid and alkaline absorbing solution samples requires separate standard calibration curves; prepare each according to section 10.2. Ensure adequate baseline separation of the analyses.
11.1.3 Between injections of the appropriate series of calibration standards, inject in duplicate the reagent blanks, quality control sample, and the field samples. Measure the areas or heights of the Cl
−
, Br
−
, and F
−
peaks. Use the mean response of the duplicate injections to determine the concentrations of the field samples and reagent blanks using the linear calibration curve. The values from duplicate injections should agree within 5 percent of their mean for the analysis to be valid. If the values of duplicate injections are not within 5 percent of the mean, the duplicate injections shall be repeated and all four values used to determine the average response. Dilute any sample and the blank with equal volumes of water if the concentration exceeds that of the highest standard.

# 13.0 Method Performance
13.1 Precision and Bias. The within-laboratory relative standard deviations are 6.2 and 3.2 percent at HCl concentrations of 3.9 and 15.3 ppm, respectively. The method does not exhibit a bias to Cl

when sampling at concentrations less than 50 ppm.
13.2 Sample Stability. The collected Cl

13.3 Detection Limit. A typical IC instrumental detection limit for Cl

is 0.2 µg/ml. Detection limits for the other analyses should be similar. Assuming 50 ml liquid recovered from both the acidified impingers, and the basic impingers, and 0.12 dscm (4.24 dscf) of stack gas sampled, then the analytical detection limit in the stack gas would be about 0.05 ppm for HCl and Cl

) [Cl

and Br

] from stationary sources when specified by the applicable subpart. This method collects the emission sample isokinetically and is therefore particularly suited for sampling at sources, such as those controlled by wet scrubbers, emitting acid particulate matter (
e.g.,
hydrogen halides dissolved in water droplets).
1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 Principle. Gaseous and particulate pollutants are withdrawn isokinetically from the source and collected in an optional cyclone, on a filter, and in absorbing solutions. The cyclone collects any liquid droplets and is not necessary if the source emissions do not contain them; however, it is preferable to include the cyclone in the sampling train to protect the filter from any liquid present. The filter collects particulate matter including halide salts but is not routinely recovered or analyzed. Acidic and alkaline absorbing solutions collect the gaseous hydrogen halides and halogens, respectively. Following sampling of emissions containing liquid droplets, any halides/halogens dissolved in the liquid in the cyclone and on the filter are vaporized to gas and collected in the impingers by pulling conditioned ambient air through the sampling train. The hydrogen halides are solubilized in the acidic solution and form chloride (Cl
−
), bromide (Br
−
),
and fluoride (F
−
) ions. The halogens have a very low solubility in the acidic solution and pass through to the alkaline solution where they are hydrolyzed to form a proton (H
+
), the halide ion, and the hypohalous acid (HClO or HBrO). Sodium thiosulfate is added to the alkaline solution to assure reaction with the hypohalous acid to form a second halide ion such that 2 halide ions are formed for each molecule of halogen gas. The halide ions in the separate solutions are measured by ion chromatography (IC). If desired, the particulate matter recovered from the filter and the probe is analyzed following the procedures in Method 5.

# Note:
If the tester intends to use this sampling arrangement to sample concurrently for particulate matter, the alternative Teflon probe liner, cyclone, and filter holder should not be used. The Teflon filter support must be used. The tester must also meet the probe and filter temperature requirements of both sampling trains.

# 3.0 Definitions
[Reserved]

# 4.0 Interferences
4.1 Volatile materials, such as chlorine dioxide (ClO
2
) and ammonium chloride (NH
4
Cl), which produce halide ions upon dissolution during sampling are potential interferents. Interferents for the halide measurements are the halogen gases which disproportionate to a hydrogen halide and a hypohalous acid upon dissolution in water. The use of acidic rather than neutral or basic solutions for collection of the hydrogen halides greatly reduces the dissolution of any halogens passing through this solution.
4.2 The simultaneous presence of both HBr and Cl
2
may cause a positive bias in the HCl result with a corresponding negative bias in the Cl
2
result as well as affecting the HBr/Br
2
split.
4.3 High concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NO
X
) may produce sufficient nitrate (NO
3
−
) to interfere with measurements of very low Br
−
levels. Dissociating chloride salts (
e.g.,
ammonium chloride) at elevated temperatures interfere with halogen acid measurement in this method. Maintaining particulate probe/filter temperatures between 120 °C and 134 °C (248 °F and 273 °F) minimizes this interference.
4.4 There is anecdotal evidence that HF may be outgassed from new Teflon components. If HF is a target analyte then preconditioning of new Teflon components, by heating, should be considered.

Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents must conform to the specifications established by the Committee on Analytical Reagents of the American Chemical Society (ACS reagent grade). When such specifications are not available, the best available grade shall be used.
7.1 Sampling.
7.1.1 Filter. Teflon mat (
e.g.,
Pallflex TX40HI45) filter. When the stack gas temperature exceeds 210 °C (410 °F) a quartz fiber filter may be used.
7.1.2 Water. Deionized, distilled water that conforms to American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) Specification D 1193-77 or 91, Type 3 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17).

7.2 Sample Preparation and Analysis.
7.2.1 Water. Same as in section 7.1.2.
7.2.2 Absorbing Solution Blanks. A separate blank solution of each absorbing reagent should be prepared for analysis with the
field samples. Dilute 200 ml of each absorbing solution (250 ml of the acidic absorbing solution, if a condensate impinger is used) to the same final volume as the field samples using the blank sample of rinse water. If a particulate determination is conducted, collect a blank sample of acetone.
7.2.3 Halide Salt Stock Standard Solutions. Prepare concentrated stock solutions from reagent grade sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium bromide (NaBr), and sodium fluoride (NaF). Each must be dried at 110 °C (230 °F) for two or more hours and then cooled to room temperature in a desiccator immediately before weighing. Accurately weigh 1.6 to 1.7 g of the dried NaCl to within 0.1 mg, dissolve in water, and dilute to 1 liter. Calculate the exact Cl
−
concentration using Equation 26A-1 in section 12.2. In a similar manner, accurately weigh and solubilize 1.2 to 1.3 g of dried NaBr and 2.2 to 2.3 g of NaF to make 1-liter solutions. Use Equations 26A-2 and 26A-3 in section 12.2, to calculate the Br

concentrations. Alternately, solutions containing a nominal certified concentration of 1000 mg/L NaCl are commercially available as convenient stock solutions from which standards can be made by appropriate volumetric dilution. Refrigerate the stock standard solutions and store no longer than one month.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport

# Note:
Because of the complexity of this method, testers and analysts should be trained and experienced with the procedures to ensure reliable results.
8.1 Sampling.
8.1.1 Pretest Preparation. Follow the general procedure given in Method 5, section 8.1, except the filter need only be desiccated and weighed if a particulate determination will be conducted.
8.1.2 Preliminary Determinations. Same as Method 5, section 8.2.
8.1.3 Preparation of Sampling Train. Follow the general procedure given in Method 5, section 8.1.3, except for the following variations: Add 50 ml of 0.1 N H
2
SO
4
to the condensate impinger, if used. Place 100 ml of 0.1 N H
2
SO
4
in each of the next two impingers. Place 100 ml of 0.1 N NaOH in each of the following two impingers. Finally, transfer approximately 200-300 g of preweighed silica gel from its container to the last impinger. Set up the train as in Figure 26A-1. When used, the optional cyclone is inserted between the probe liner and filter holder and located in the heated filter box.
8.1.4 Leak-Check Procedures. Follow the leak-check procedures given in Method 5, sections 8.4.2 (Pretest Leak-Check), 8.4.3 (Leak-Checks During the Sample Run), and 8.4.4 (Post-Test Leak-Check).
8.1.5 Sampling Train Operation. Follow the general procedure given in Method 5, Section 8.5. It is important to maintain a temperature around the probe, filter (and cyclone, if used) between 120 and 134 °C (248 and 273 °F) since it is extremely difficult to purge acid gases off these components. (These components are not quantitatively recovered and hence any collection of acid gases on these components would result in potential under reporting these emissions. The applicable subparts may specify alternative higher temperatures.) For each run, record the data required on a data sheet such as the one shown in Method 5, Figure 5-3. If the condensate impinger becomes too full, it may be emptied, recharged with 50 ml of 0.1 N H2SO4, and replaced during the sample run. The condensate emptied must be saved and included in the measurement of the volume of moisture collected and included in the sample for analysis. The additional 50 ml of absorbing reagent must also be considered in calculating the moisture. Before the sampling train integrity is compromised by removing the impinger, conduct a leak-check as described in Method 5, section 8.4.2.
8.1.6 Post-Test Moisture Removal (Optional). When the optional cyclone is included in the sampling train or when liquid is visible on the filter at the end of a sample run even in the absence of a cyclone, perform the following procedure. Upon completion of the test run, connect the ambient air conditioning tube at the probe inlet and operate the train with the filter heating system between 120 and 134 °C (248 and 273 °F) at a low flow rate (
e.g.,
ΔH = 1 in. H
2
O) to vaporize any liquid and hydrogen halides in the cyclone or on the filter and pull them through the train into the impingers. After 30 minutes, turn off the flow, remove the conditioning tube, and examine the cyclone and filter for any visible liquid. If liquid is visible, repeat this step for 15 minutes and observe again. Keep repeating until the cyclone is dry.

# Note:
It is critical that this procedure is repeated until the cyclone is completely dry.
8.2 Sample Recovery. Allow the probe to cool. When the probe can be handled safely, wipe off all the external surfaces of the tip of the probe nozzle and place a cap loosely over the tip to prevent gaining or losing particulate matter. Do not cap the probe tip tightly while the sampling train is cooling down because this will create a vacuum in the filter holder, drawing water from the impingers into the holder. Before moving the sampling train to the cleanup site, remove the probe from the sample train, wipe off any silicone
grease, and cap the open outlet of the impinger train, being careful not to lose any condensate that might be present. Wipe off any silicone grease and cap the filter or cyclone inlet. Remove the umbilical cord from the last impinger and cap the impinger. If a flexible line is used between the first impinger and the filter holder, disconnect it at the filter holder and let any condensed water drain into the first impinger. Wipe off any silicone grease and cap the filter holder outlet and the impinger inlet. Ground glass stoppers, plastic caps, serum caps, Teflon tape, Parafilm, or aluminum foil may be used to close these openings. Transfer the probe and filter/impinger assembly to the cleanup area. This area should be clean and protected from the weather to minimize sample contamination or loss. Inspect the train prior to and during disassembly and note any abnormal conditions. Treat samples as follows:
8.2.1 Container No. 1 (Optional; Filter Catch for Particulate Determination). Same as Method 5, section 8.7.6.1, Container No. 1.
8.2.2 Container No. 2 (Optional; Front-Half Rinse for Particulate Determination). Same as Method 5, section 8.7.6.2, Container No. 2.
8.2.3 Container No. 3 (Knockout and Acid Impinger Catch for Moisture and Hydrogen Halide Determination). Disconnect the impingers. Measure the liquid in the acid and knockout impingers to ±1 ml by using a graduated cylinder or by weighing it to ±0.5 g by using a balance. Record the volume or weight of liquid present. This information is required to calculate the moisture content of the effluent gas. Quantitatively transfer this liquid to a leak-free sample storage container. Rinse these impingers and connecting glassware including the back portion of the filter holder (and flexible tubing, if used) with water and add these rinses to the storage container. Seal the container, shake to mix, and label. The fluid level should be marked so that if any sample is lost during transport, a correction proportional to the lost volume can be applied. Retain rinse water and acidic absorbing solution blanks to be analyzed with the samples.
8.2.4 Container No. 4 (Alkaline Impinger Catch for Halogen and Moisture Determination). Measure and record the liquid in the alkaline impingers as described in section 8.2.3. Quantitatively transfer this liquid to a leak-free sample storage container. Rinse these two impingers and connecting glassware with water and add these rinses to the container. Add 25 mg of sodium thiosulfate per ppm halogen anticipated to be in the stack gas multiplied by the volume (dscm) of stack gas sampled (0.7 mg/ppm-dscf). Seal the container, shake to mix, and label; mark the fluid level. Retain alkaline absorbing solution blank to be analyzed with the samples.

# Note:
25 mg per sodium thiosulfate per ppm halogen anticipated to be in the stack includes a safety factor of approximately 5 to assure complete reaction with the hypohalous acid to form a second Cl
−
ion in the alkaline solution.
8.2.5 Container No. 5 (Silica Gel for Moisture Determination). Same as Method 5, section 8.7.6.3, Container No. 3.
8.2.6 Container Nos. 6 through 9 (Reagent Blanks). Save portions of the absorbing reagents (0.1 N H
2
SO
4
and 0.1 N NaOH) equivalent to the amount used in the sampling train; dilute to the approximate volume of the corresponding samples using rinse water directly from the wash bottle being used. Add the same ratio of sodium thiosulfate solution used in container No. 4 to the 0.1 N NaOH absorbing reagent blank. Also, save a portion of the rinse water alone and a portion of the acetone equivalent to the amount used to rinse the front half of the sampling train. Place each in a separate, prelabeled sample container.
8.2.7 Prior to shipment, recheck all sample containers to ensure that the caps are well-secured. Seal the lids of all containers around the circumference with Teflon tape. Ship all liquid samples upright and all particulate filters with the particulate catch facing upward.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization

# Note:
Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.
10.1 Probe Nozzle, Pitot Tube Assembly, Dry Gas Metering System, Probe Heater, Temperature Sensors, Leak-Check of Metering System, and Barometer. Same as Method 5, sections 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 8.4.1, and 10.6, respectively.
10.2 Ion Chromatograph.
10.2.1 To prepare the calibration standards, dilute given amounts (1.0 ml or greater) of the stock standard solutions to convenient volumes, using 0.1 N H

or 0.1 N NaOH, as appropriate. Prepare at least four calibration standards for each absorbing reagent containing the three stock solutions such that they are within the linear range of the field samples.
10.2.2 Using one of the standards in each series, ensure adequate baseline separation for the peaks of interest.
10.2.3 Inject the appropriate series of calibration standards, starting with the lowest concentration standard first both before and after injection of the quality control check sample, reagent blanks, and field samples. This allows compensation for any instrument drift occurring during sample analysis. The values from duplicate injections of these calibration samples should agree within 5 percent of their mean for the analysis to be valid.
10.2.4 Determine the peak areas, or height, of the standards and plot individual values versus halide ion concentrations in µg/ml.
10.2.5 Draw a smooth curve through the points. Use linear regression to calculate a formula describing the resulting linear curve.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedures

# Note:
The liquid levels in the sample containers and confirm on the analysis sheet whether or not leakage occurred during transport. If a noticeable leakage has occurred, either void the sample or use methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to correct the final results.
11.1 Sample Analysis.
11.1.1 The IC conditions will depend upon analytical column type and whether suppressed or non-suppressed IC is used. An example chromatogram from a non-suppressed system using a 150-mm Hamilton PRP-X100 anion column, a 2 ml/min flow rate of a 4 mM 4-hydroxy benzoate solution adjusted to a pH of 8.6 using 1 N NaOH, a 50 µl sample loop, and a conductivity detector set on 1.0 µS full scale is shown in Figure 26-2.
11.1.2 Before sample analysis, establish a stable baseline. Next, inject a sample of water, and determine if any Cl
−
, Br
−
, or F
−
appears in the chromatogram. If any of these ions are present, repeat the load/injection procedure until they are no longer present. Analysis of the acid and alkaline absorbing solution samples requires separate standard calibration curves; prepare each according to section 10.2. Ensure adequate baseline separation of the analyses.
11.1.3 Between injections of the appropriate series of calibration standards, inject in duplicate the reagent blanks, quality control sample, and the field samples. Measure the areas or heights of the Cl
−
, Br
−
, and F
−
peaks. Use the mean response of the duplicate injections to determine the concentrations of the field samples and reagent blanks using the linear calibration curve. The values from duplicate injections should agree within 5 percent of their mean for the analysis to be valid. If the values of duplicate injections are not within 5 percent of the mean, the duplicator injections shall be repeated and all four values used to determine the average response. Dilute any sample and the blank with equal volumes of water if the concentration exceeds that of the highest standard.
11.2 Container Nos. 1 and 2 and Acetone Blank (Optional; Particulate Determination). Same as Method 5, sections 11.2.1 and 11.2.2, respectively.
11.3 Container No. 5. Same as Method 5, section 11.2.3 for silica gel.

# 13.0 Method Performance
13.1 Precision and Bias. The method has a possible measurable negative bias below 20 ppm HCl perhaps due to reaction with small amounts of moisture in the probe and filter. Similar bias for the other hydrogen halides is possible.
13.2 Sample Stability. The collected Cl-samples can be stored for up to 4 weeks for analysis for HCl and Cl2.
13.3 Detection Limit. A typical analytical detection limit for HCl is 0.2 µg/ml. Detection limits for the other analyses should be similar. Assuming 300 ml of liquid recovered for the acidified impingers and a similar amounts recovered from the basic impingers, and 1 dscm of stack gas sampled, the analytical detection limits in the stack gas would be about 0.04 ppm for HCl and Cl2, respectively.

5.2 This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards
[Reserved]

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
8.1 Pretest Preparations.
8.1.1 Summary. Testing problems may occur due to the presence of volatile vapors and/or temperature fluctuations inside the delivery tank. Under these conditions, it is often difficult to obtain a stable initial pressure at the beginning of a test, and erroneous test results may occur. To help prevent this, it is recommended that prior to testing, volatile vapors be removed from the tank and the temperature inside the tank be allowed to stabilize. Because it is not always possible to completely attain these pretest conditions, a provision to ensure reproducible results is included. The difference in results for two consecutive runs must meet the criteria in sections 8.2.2.5 and 8.2.3.5.
8.1.2 Emptying of Tank. The delivery tank shall be emptied of all liquid.
8.1.3 Purging of Vapor. As much as possible the delivery tank shall be purged of all volatile vapors by any safe, acceptable method. One method is to carry a load of non-volatile liquid fuel, such as diesel or heating oil, immediately prior to the test, thus flushing out all the volatile gasoline vapors. A second method is to remove the volatile vapors by blowing ambient air into each tank compartment for at least 20 minutes. This second method is usually not as effective and often causes stabilization problems, requiring a much longer time for stabilization during the testing.
8.1.4 Temperature Stabilization. As much as possible, the test shall be conducted under isothermal conditions. The temperature of the delivery tank should be allowed to equilibrate in the test environment. During the test, the tank should be protected from extreme environmental and temperature variability, such as direct sunlight.
8.2 Test Procedure.
8.2.1 Preparations.
8.2.1.1 Open and close each dome cover.
8.2.1.2 Connect static electrical ground connections to the tank. Attach the liquid delivery and vapor return hoses, remove the liquid delivery elbows, and plug the liquid delivery fittings.

# Note:
The purpose of testing the liquid delivery hoses is to detect tears or holes that would allow liquid leakage during a delivery. Liquid delivery hoses are not considered to be possible sources of vapor leakage, and thus, do not have to be attached for a vapor leakage test. Instead, a liquid delivery hose could be either visually inspected, or filled with water to detect any liquid leakage.
8.2.1.3 Attach the test cap to the end of the vapor recovery hose.
8.2.1.4 Connect the pressure-vacuum supply hose and the pressure-vacuum relief valve to the shut-off valve. Attach a manometer to the pressure tap.
8.2.1.5 Connect compartments of the tank internally to each other if possible. If not possible, each compartment must be tested separately, as if it were an individual delivery tank.
8.2.2 Pressure Test.
8.2.2.1 Connect the pressure source to the pressure-vacuum supply hose.
8.2.2.2 Open the shut-off valve in the vapor recovery hose cap. Apply air pressure slowly, pressurize the tank to P
i
, the initial pressure specified in the regulation.
8.2.2.3 Close the shut-off and allow the pressure in the tank to stabilize, adjusting the pressure if necessary to maintain pressure of P
i
. When the pressure stabilizes, record the time and initial pressure.
8.2.2.4 At the end of the time period (t) specified in the regulation, record the time and final pressure.
8.2.2.5 Repeat steps 8.2.2.2 through 8.2.2.4 until the change in pressure for two consecutive runs agrees within 12.5 mm (0.5 in.) H
2
O. Calculate the arithmetic average of the two results.
8.2.2.6 Compare the average measured change in pressure to the allowable pressure change, Δp, specified in the regulation. If the delivery tank does not satisfy the vapor tightness criterion specified in the regulation, repair the sources of leakage, and repeat the pressure test until the criterion is met.
8.2.2.7 Disconnect the pressure source from the pressure-vacuum supply hose, and slowly open the shut-off valve to bring the tank to atmospheric pressure.
8.2.3 Vacuum Test.
8.2.3.1 Connect the vacuum source to the pressure-vacuum supply hose.
8.2.3.2 Open the shut-off valve in the vapor recovery hose cap. Slowly evacuate the tank to V
i
, the initial vacuum specified in the regulation.
8.2.3.3 Close the shut-off valve and allow the pressure in the tank to stabilize, adjusting the pressure if necessary to maintain a vacuum of V
i
. When the pressure stabilizes, record the time and initial vacuum.
8.2.3.4 At the end of the time period specified in the regulation (t), record the time and final vacuum.
8.2.3.5 Repeat steps 8.2.3.2 through 8.2.3.4 until the change in vacuum for two consecutive runs agrees within 12.5 mm (0.5 in.) H
2
O. Calculate the arithmetic average of the two results.
8.2.3.6 Compare the average measured change in vacuum to the allowable vacuum change, Δv, as specified in the regulation. If the delivery tank does not satisfy the vapor tightness criterion specified in the regulation, repair the sources of leakage, and repeat the vacuum test until the criterion is met.
8.2.3.7 Disconnect the vacuum source from the pressure-vacuum supply hose, and slowly open the shut-off valve to bring the tank to atmospheric pressure.
8.2.4 Post-Test Clean-up. Disconnect all test equipment and return the delivery tank to its pretest condition.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
8.1 Test Run Requirements.
8.1.1 Burn Rate Categories. One emission test run is required in each of the following burn rate categories:
Burn Rate Categories
[Average kg/hr (lb/hr), dry basis]
Category 1
Category 2
Category 3
Category 4
0.80
0.80 to 1.25
1.25 to 1.90
Maximum.
(
1.76)
(1.76 to 2.76)
(2.76 to 4.19)
burn rate.
8.1.1.1 Maximum Burn Rate. For Category 4, the wood heater shall be operated with the primary air supply inlet controls fully open (or, if thermostatically controlled, the thermostat shall be set at maximum heat output) during the entire test run, or the maximum burn rate setting specified by the manufacturer's written instructions.
8.1.1.2 Other Burn Rate Categories. For burn rates in Categories 1 through 3, the wood heater shall be operated with the primary air supply inlet control, or other mechanical control device, set at a predetermined position necessary to obtain the average burn rate required for the category.
8.1.1.3 Alternative Burn Rates for Burn Rate Categories 1 and 2.
8.1.1.3.1 If a wood heater cannot be operated at a burn rate below 0.80 kg/hr (1.76 lb/hr), two test runs shall be conducted with burn rates within Category 2. If a wood heater cannot be operated at a burn rate below 1.25 kg/hr (2.76 lb/hr), the flue shall be dampered or the air supply otherwise controlled in order to achieve two test runs within Category 2.
8.1.1.3.2 Evidence that a wood heater cannot be operated at a burn rate less than 0.80 kg/hr shall include documentation of two or more attempts to operate the wood heater in burn rate Category 1 and fuel combustion has stopped, or results of two or more test runs demonstrating that the burn rates were greater than 0.80 kg/hr when the air supply controls were adjusted to the lowest possible position or settings. Stopped fuel combustion is evidenced when an elapsed time of 30 minutes or more has occurred without a measurable (
0.05 kg (0.1 lb) or 1.0 percent, whichever is greater) weight change in the
test fuel charge. See also section 8.8.3. Report the evidence and the reasoning used to determine that a test in burn rate Category 1 cannot be achieved; for example, two unsuccessful attempts to operate at a burn rate of 0.4 kg/hr are not sufficient evidence that burn rate Category 1 cannot be achieved.

# Note:
After July 1, 1990, if a wood heater cannot be operated at a burn rate less than 0.80 kg/hr, at least one test run with an average burn rate of 1.00 kg/hr or less shall be conducted. Additionally, if flue dampering must be used to achieve burn rates below 1.25 kg/hr (or 1.0 kg/hr), results from a test run conducted at burn rates below 0.90 kg/hr need not be reported or included in the test run average provided that such results are replaced with results from a test run meeting the criteria above.
8.2 Catalytic Combustor and Wood Heater Aging. The catalyst-equipped wood heater or a wood heater of any type shall be aged before the certification test begins. The aging procedure shall be conducted and documented by a testing laboratory accredited according to procedures in § 60.535 of 40 CFR part 60.
8.2.1 Catalyst-equipped Wood Heater. Operate the catalyst-equipped wood heater using fuel meeting the specifications outlined in sections 7.1.1 through 7.1.3, or cordwood with a moisture content between 15 and 25 percent on a wet basis. Operate the wood heater at a medium burn rate (Category 2 or 3) with a new catalytic combustor in place and in operation for at least 50 hours. Record and report hourly catalyst exit temperature data (Section 8.6.2) and the hours of operation.
8.2.2 Non-Catalyst Wood Heater. Operate the wood heater using the fuel described in section 8.4.1 at a medium burn rate for at least 10 hours. Record and report the hours of operation.
8.3 Pretest Recordkeeping. Record the test fuel charge dimensions and weights, and wood heater and catalyst descriptions as shown in the example in Figure 28-1.
8.4 Wood Heater Installation. Assemble the wood heater appliance and parts in conformance with the manufacturer's written installation instructions. Place the wood heater centrally on the platform scale and connect the wood heater to the flue described in section 6.11. Clean the flue with an appropriately sized, wire chimney brush before each certification test.
8.5 Wood Heater Temperature Monitors.
8.5.1 For catalyst-equipped wood heaters, locate a temperature monitor (optional) about 25 mm (1 in.) upstream of the catalyst at the centroid of the catalyst face area, and locate a temperature monitor (mandatory) that will indicate the catalyst exhaust temperature. This temperature monitor is centrally located within 25 mm (1 in.) downstream at the centroid of catalyst face area. Record these locations.
8.5.2 Locate wood heater surface temperature monitors at five locations on the wood heater firebox exterior surface. Position the temperature monitors centrally on the top surface, on two sidewall surfaces, and on the bottom and back surfaces. Position the monitor sensing tip on the firebox exterior surface inside of any heat shield, air circulation walls, or other wall or shield separated from the firebox exterior surface. Surface temperature locations for unusual design shapes (
e.g.,
spherical, etc.) shall be positioned so that there are four surface temperature monitors in both the vertical and horizontal planes passing at right angles through the centroid of the firebox, not including the fuel loading door (total of five temperature monitors).
8.6 Test Facility Conditions.
8.6.1 Locate the test facility temperature monitor on the horizontal plane that includes the primary air intake opening for the wood heater. Locate the temperature monitor 1 to 2 m (3 to 6 ft) from the front of the wood heater in the 90° sector in front of the wood heater.
8.6.2 Use an anemometer to measure the air velocity. Measure and record the room air velocity before the pretest ignition period (Section 8.7) and once immediately following the test run completion.
8.6.3 Measure and record the test facility's ambient relative humidity, barometric pressure, and temperature before and after each test run.
8.6.4 Measure and record the flue draft or static pressure in the flue at a location no greater than 0.3 m (1 ft) above the flue connector at the wood heater exhaust during the test run at the recording intervals (Section 8.8.2).
8.7 Wood Heater Firebox Volume.
8.7.1 Determine the firebox volume using the definitions for height, width, and length in section 3. Volume adjustments due to presence of firebrick and other permanent fixtures may be necessary. Adjust width and length dimensions to extend to the metal wall of the wood heater above the firebrick or permanent obstruction if the firebrick or obstruction extending the length of the side(s) or back wall extends less than one-third of the usable firebox height. Use the width or length dimensions inside the firebrick if the firebrick extends more than one-third of the usable firebox height. If a log retainer or grate is a permanent fixture and the manufacturer recommends that no fuel be placed outside the retainer, the area outside of the retainer is excluded from the firebox volume calculations.
8.7.2 In general, exclude the area above the ash lip if that area is less than 10 percent of the usable firebox volume. Otherwise, take into account consumer loading practices.
For instance, if fuel is to be loaded front-to-back, an ash lip may be considered usable firebox volume.
8.7.3 Include areas adjacent to and above a baffle (up to two inches above the fuel loading opening) if four inches or more horizontal space exist between the edge of the baffle and a vertical obstruction (
e.g.,
sidewalls or air channels).
8.8 Test Fuel Charge.
8.8.1 Prepare the test fuel pieces in accordance with the specifications outlined in sections 7.1 and 7.2. Determine the test fuel moisture content with a calibrated electrical resistance meter or other equivalent performance meter. If necessary, convert fuel moisture content values from dry basis (%M
d
) to wet basis (%M
w
) in section 12.2 using Equation 28-1. Determine fuel moisture for each fuel piece (not including spacers) by averaging at least three moisture meter readings, one from each of three sides, measured parallel to the wood grain. Average all the readings for all the fuel pieces in the test fuel charge. If an electrical resistance type meter is used, penetration of insulated electrodes shall be one-fourth the thickness of the test fuel piece or 19 mm (0.75 in.), whichever is greater. Measure the moisture content within a 4-hour period prior to the test run. Determine the fuel temperature by measuring the temperature of the room where the wood has been stored for at least 24 hours prior to the moisture determination.
8.8.2 Attach the spacers to the test fuel pieces with uncoated, ungalvanized nails or staples as illustrated in Figure 28-2. Attachment of spacers to the top of the test fuel piece(s) on top of the test fuel charge is optional.
8.8.3 To avoid stacking difficulties, or when a whole number of test fuel pieces does not result, all piece lengths shall be adjusted uniformly to remain within the specified loading density. The shape of the test fuel crib shall be geometrically similar to the shape of the firebox volume without resorting to special angular or round cuts on the individual fuel pieces.
8.8.4 The test fuel loading density shall be 112 ±11.2 kg/m
3
(7 ±0.7 lb/ft
3
) of usable firebox volume on a wet basis.
8.9 Sampling Equipment. Prepare the sampling equipment as defined by the selected method (
i.e.,
either Method 5G or Method 5H). Collect one particulate emission sample for each test run.
8.10 Secondary Air Adjustment Validation.
8.10.1 If design drawings do not show the introduction of secondary air into a chamber outside the firebox (see “secondary air supply” under section 3.0, Definitions), conduct a separate test of the wood heater's secondary air supply. Operate the wood heater at a burn rate in Category 1 (Section 8.1.1) with the secondary air supply operated following the manufacturer's written instructions. Start the secondary air validation test run as described in section 8.8.1, except no emission sampling is necessary and burn rate data shall be recorded at 5-minute intervals.
8.10.2 After the start of the test run, operate the wood heater with the secondary air supply set as per the manufacturer's instructions, but with no adjustments to this setting. After 25 percent of the test fuel has been consumed, adjust the secondary air supply controls to another setting, as per the manufacturer's instructions. Record the burn rate data (5-minute intervals) for 20 minutes following the air supply adjustment.
8.10.3 Adjust the air supply control(s) to the original position(s), operate at this condition for at least 20 minutes, and repeat the air supply adjustment procedure above. Repeat the procedure three times at equal intervals over the entire burn period as defined in section 8.8. If the secondary air adjustment results in a burn rate change of more than an average of 25 percent between the 20-minute periods before and after the secondary adjustments, the secondary air supply shall be considered a primary air supply, and no adjustment to this air supply is allowed during the test run.
8.10.4 The example sequence below describes a typical secondary air adjustment validation check. The first cycle begins after at least 25 percent of the test fuel charge has been consumed.
Cycle 1
Part 1, sec air adjusted to final position—20 min
Part 2, sec air adjusted to final position—20 min
Part 3, sec air adjusted to final position—20 min
Cycle 2
Part 1, sec air adjusted to final position—20 min
Part 2, sec air adjusted to final position—20 min
Part 3, sec air adjusted to final position—20 min
Cycle 3
Part 1, sec air adjusted to final position—20 min
Part 2, sec air adjusted to final position—20 min
Part 3, sec air adjusted to final position—20 min
Note that the cycles may overlap; that is, Part 3 of Cycle 1 may coincide in part or in total with Part 1 of Cycle 2. The calculation of the secondary air percent effect for this example is as follows:
ER17oc00.425
8.11 Pretest Ignition. Build a fire in the wood heater in accordance with the manufacturer's written instructions.
8.11.1 Pretest Fuel Charge. Crumpled newspaper loaded with kindling may be used to help ignite the pretest fuel. The pretest fuel, used to sustain the fire, shall meet the same fuel requirements prescribed in section 7.1. The pretest fuel charge shall consist of whole 2 × 4's that are no less than
1/3
the length of the test fuel pieces. Pieces of 4 × 4 lumber in approximately the same weight ratio as for the test fuel charge may be added to the pretest fuel charge.
8.11.2 Wood Heater Operation and Adjustments. Set the air inlet supply controls at any position that will maintain combustion of the pretest fuel load. At least one hour before the start of the test run, set the air supply controls at the approximate positions necessary to achieve the burn rate desired for the test run. Adjustment of the air supply controls, fuel addition or subtractions, and coalbed raking shall be kept to a minimum but are allowed up to 15 minutes prior to the start of the test run. For the purposes of this method, coalbed raking is the use of a metal tool (poker) to stir coals, break burning fuel into smaller pieces, dislodge fuel pieces from positions of poor combustion, and check for the condition of uniform charcoalization. Record all adjustments made to the air supply controls, adjustments to and additions or subtractions of fuel, and any other changes to wood heater operations that occur during pretest ignition period. Record fuel weight data and wood heater temperature measurements at 10-minute intervals during the hour of the pretest ignition period preceding the start of the test run. During the 15-minute period prior to the start of the test run, the wood heater loading door shall not be open more than a total of 1 minute. Coalbed raking is the only adjustment allowed during this period.

# Note:
One purpose of the pretest ignition period is to achieve uniform charcoalization of the test fuel bed prior to loading the test fuel charge. Uniform charcoalization is a general condition of the test fuel bed evidenced by an absence of large pieces of burning wood in the coal bed and the remaining fuel pieces being brittle enough to be broken into smaller charcoal pieces with a metal poker. Manipulations to the fuel bed prior to the start of the test run should be done to achieve uniform charcoalization while maintaining the desired burn rate. In addition, some wood heaters (
e.g.,
high mass units) may require extended pretest burn time and fuel additions to reach an initial average surface temperature sufficient to meet the thermal equilibrium criteria in section 8.3.
8.11.3 The weight of pretest fuel remaining at the start of the test run is determined as the difference between the weight of the wood heater with the remaining pretest fuel and the tare weight of the cleaned, dry wood heater with or without dry ash or sand added consistent with the manufacturer's instructions and the owner's manual. The tare weight of the wood heater must be determined with the wood heater (and ash, if added) in a dry condition.
8.12 Test Run. Complete a test run in each burn rate category, as follows:
8.12.1 Test Run Start.
8.12.1.1 When the kindling and pretest fuel have been consumed to leave a fuel weight between 20 and 25 percent of the weight of the test fuel charge, record the weight of the fuel remaining and start the test run. Record and report any other criteria, in addition to those specified in this section, used to determine the moment of the test run start (
e.g.,
firebox or catalyst temperature), whether such criteria are specified by the wood heater manufacturer or the testing laboratory. Record all wood heater individual surface temperatures, catalyst temperatures, any initial sampling method measurement values, and begin the particulate emission sampling. Within 1 minute following the start of the test run, open the wood heater door, load the test fuel charge, and record the test fuel charge weight. Recording of average, rather than individual, surface temperatures is acceptable for tests conducted in accordance with § 60.533(o)(3)(i) of 40 CFR part 60.
8.12.1.2 Position the fuel charge so that the spacers are parallel to the floor of the firebox, with the spacer edges abutting each other. If loading difficulties result, some fuel pieces may be placed on edge. If the usable firebox volume is between 0.043 and 0.085 m
3
(1.5 and 3.0 ft
3
), alternate the piece sizes in vertical stacking layers to the extent possible. For example, place 2 × 4's on the bottom layer in direct contact with the coal bed and 4 × 4's on the next layer, etc. (See Figure 28-3). Position the fuel pieces parallel to each other and parallel to the longest wall of the firebox to the extent possible within the specifications in section 8.8.
8.12.1.3 Load the test fuel in appliances having unusual or unconventional firebox design maintaining air space intervals between the test fuel pieces and in conformance with
the manufacturer's written instructions. For any appliance that will not accommodate the loading arrangement specified in the paragraph above, the test facility personnel shall contact the Administrator for an alternative loading arrangement.
8.12.1.4 The wood heater door may remain open and the air supply controls adjusted up to five minutes after the start of the test run in order to make adjustments to the test fuel charge and to ensure ignition of the test fuel charge has occurred. Within the five minutes after the start of the test run, close the wood heater door and adjust the air supply controls to the position determined to produce the desired burn rate. No other adjustments to the air supply controls or the test fuel charge are allowed (except as specified in sections 8.12.3 and 8.12.4) after the first five minutes of the test run. Record the length of time the wood heater door remains open, the adjustments to the air supply controls, and any other operational adjustments.
8.12.2 Data Recording. Record on a data sheet similar to that shown in Figure 28-4, at intervals no greater than 10 minutes, fuel weight data, wood heater individual surface and catalyst temperature measurements, other wood heater operational data (
e.g.,
draft), test facility temperature and sampling method data.
8.12.3 Test Fuel Charge Adjustment. The test fuel charge may be adjusted (
i.e.,
repositioned) once during a test run if more than 60 percent of the initial test fuel charge weight has been consumed and more than 10 minutes have elapsed without a measurable (
0.05 kg (0.1 lb) or 1.0 percent, whichever is greater) weight change. The time used to make this adjustment shall be less than 15 seconds.
8.12.4 Air Supply Adjustment. Secondary air supply controls may be adjusted once during the test run following the manufacturer's written instructions (see section 8.10). No other air supply adjustments are allowed during the test run. Recording of wood heater flue draft during the test run is optional for tests conducted in accordance with § 60.533(o)(3)(i) of 40 CFR part 60.
8.12.5 Auxiliary Wood Heater Equipment Operation. Heat exchange blowers sold with the wood heater shall be operated during the test run following the manufacturer's written instructions. If no manufacturer's written instructions are available, operate the heat exchange blower in the “high” position. (Automatically operated blowers shall be operated as designed.) Shaker grates, by-pass controls, or other auxiliary equipment may be adjusted only one time during the test run following the manufacturer's written instructions.
Record all adjustments on a wood heater operational written record.

# Note:
If the wood heater is sold with a heat exchange blower as an option, test the wood heater with the heat exchange blower operating as described in sections 8.1 through 8.12 and report the results. As an alternative to repeating all test runs without the heat exchange blower operating, one additional test run may be without the blower operating as described in section 8.12.5 at a burn rate in Category 2 (Section 8.1.1). If the emission rate resulting from this test run without the blower operating is equal to or less than the emission rate plus 1.0 g/hr (0.0022 lb/hr) for the test run in burn rate Category 2 with the blower operating, the wood heater may be considered to have the same average emission rate with or without the blower operating. Additional test runs without the blower operating are unnecessary.
8.13 Test Run Completion. Continue emission sampling and wood heater operation for 2 hours. The test run is completed when the remaining weight of the test fuel charge is 0.00 kg (0.0 lb). End the test run when the scale has indicated a test fuel charge weight of 0.00 kg (0.0 lb) or less for 30 seconds. At the end of the test run, stop the particulate sampling, and record the final fuel weight, the run time, and all final measurement values.
8.14 Wood Heater Thermal Equilibrium. The average of the wood heater surface temperatures at the end of the test run shall agree with the average surface temperature at the start of the test run to within 70 °C (126 °F).
8.15 Consecutive Test Runs. Test runs on a wood heater may be conducted consecutively provided that a minimum one-hour interval occurs between test runs.
8.16 Additional Test Runs. The testing laboratory may conduct more than one test run in each of the burn rate categories specified in section 8.1.1. If more than one test run is conducted at a specified burn rate, the results from at least two-thirds of the test runs in that burn rate category shall be used in calculating the weighted average emission rate (see section 12.2). The measurement data and results of all test runs shall be reported regardless of which values are used in calculating the weighted average emission rate (see note in section 8.1).

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardizations
Same as section 10.0 of either Method 5G or Method 5H, with the addition of the following:
10.1 Platform Scale. Perform a multi-point calibration (at least five points spanning the operational range) of the platform scale before its initial use. The scale manufacturer's calibration results are sufficient for this purpose. Before each certification test, audit
the scale with the wood heater in place by weighing at least one calibration weight (Class F) that corresponds to between 20 percent and 80 percent of the expected test fuel charge weight. If the scale cannot reproduce the value of the calibration weight within 0.05 kg (0.1 lb) or 1 percent of the expected test fuel charge weight, whichever is greater, recalibrate the scale before use with at least five calibration weights spanning the operational range of the scale.
10.2 Balance (optional). Calibrate as described in section 10.1.
10.3 Temperature Monitor. Calibrate as in Method 2, section 4.3, before the first certification test and semiannually thereafter.

16.1 Pellet Burning Heaters. Certification testing requirements and procedures for pellet burning wood heaters are identical to those for other wood heaters, with the following exceptions:
16.1.1 Test Fuel Properties. The test fuel shall be all wood pellets with a moisture content no greater than 20 percent on a wet basis (25 percent on a dry basis). Determine the wood moisture content with either ASTM D 2016-74 or 83, (Method A), ASTM D 4444-92, or ASTM D 4442-84 or 92 (all noted ASTM standards are incorporated by reference—see § 60.17).
16.1.2 Test Fuel Charge Specifications. The test fuel charge size shall be as per the manufacturer's written instructions for maintaining the desired burn rate.
16.1.3 Wood Heater Firebox Volume. The firebox volume need not be measured or determined for establishing the test fuel charge size. The firebox dimensions and other heater specifications needed to identify the heater for certification purposes shall be reported.
16.1.4 Heater Installation. Arrange the heater with the fuel supply hopper on the platform scale as described in section 8.6.1.
16.1.5 Pretest Ignition. Start a fire in the heater as directed by the manufacturer's written instructions, and adjust the heater controls to achieve the desired burn rate. Operate the heater at the desired burn rate for at least 1 hour before the start of the test run.
16.1.6 Test Run. Complete a test run in each burn rate category as follows:
16.1.6.1 Test Run Start. When the wood heater has operated for at least 1 hour at the desired burn rate, add fuel to the supply hopper as necessary to complete the test run, record the weight of the fuel in the supply hopper (the wood heater weight), and start the test run. Add no additional fuel to the hopper during the test run.
Record all the wood heater surface temperatures, the initial sampling method measurement values, the time at the start of the test, and begin the emission sampling. Make no adjustments to the wood heater air supply or wood supply rate during the test run.
16.1.6.2 Data Recording. Record the fuel (wood heater) weight data, wood heater temperature and operational data, and emission sampling data as described in section 8.12.2.
16.1.6.3 Test Run Completion. Continue emission sampling and wood heater operation for 2 hours. At the end of the test run, stop the particulate sampling, and record the final fuel weight, the run time, and all final measurement values, including all wood heater individual surface temperatures.
16.1.7 Calculations. Determine the burn rate using the difference between the initial and final fuel (wood heater) weights and the procedures described in section 12.4. Complete the other calculations as described in section 12.0.

# Method 28A—Measurement of Air- to-Fuel Ratio and Minimum Achievable Burn Rates for Wood-Fired Appliances

# Note:
This method does not include all or the specifications (
e.g.,
equipment and supplies) and procedures (
e.g.,
sampling and analytical) essential to its performance. Some material is incorporated by reference from other methods in this part. Therefore, to obtain reliable results, persons using this method should also have a thorough knowledge of at least the following additional test methods: Method 3, Method 3A, Method 5H, Method 6C, and Method 28.

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1 Analyte. Particulate matter (PM). No CAS number assigned.
1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the measurement of air-to-fuel ratios and minimum achievable burn rates, for determining whether a wood-fired appliance is an affected facility, as specified in 40 CFR 60.530.
1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 A gas sample is extracted from a location in the stack of a wood-fired appliance while the appliance is operating at a prescribed set of conditions. The gas sample is analyzed for carbon dioxide (CO
2
), oxygen (O
2
), and carbon monoxide (CO). These stack gas components are measured for determining the dry molecular weight of the exhaust gas. Total moles of exhaust gas are determined stoichiometrically. Air-to-fuel ratio is determined by relating the mass of dry combustion air to the mass of dry fuel consumed.

# 3.0 Definitions
Same as Method 28, section 3.0, with the addition of the following:
3.1 Air-to-fuel ratio means the ratio of the mass of dry combustion air introduced into the firebox to the mass of dry fuel consumed (grams of dry air per gram of dry wood burned).

# 4.0 Interferences
[Reserved]

# 5.0 Safety
5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and to determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
6.1 Test Facility. Insulated Solid Pack Chimney, Platform Scale and Monitor, Test Facility Temperature Monitor, Balance, Moisture Meter, Anemometer, Barometer, Draft Gauge, Humidity Gauge, Wood Heater Flue, and Test Facility. Same as Method 28, sections 6.1, 6.2, and 6.4 to 6.12, respectively.
6.2 Sampling System. Probe, Condenser, Valve, Pump, Rate Meter, Flexible Bag, Pressure Gauge, and Vacuum Gauge. Same as Method 3, sections 6.2.1 to 6.2.8, respectively. Alternatively, the sampling system described in Method 5H, section 6.1 may be used.
6.3 Exhaust Gas Analysis. Use one or both of the following:
6.3.1 Orsat Analyzer. Same as Method 3, section 6.1.3
6.3.2 Instrumental Analyzers. Same as Method 5H, sections 6.1.3.4 and 6.1.3.5, for CO
2
and CO analyzers, except use a CO analyzer with a range of 0 to 5 percent and use a CO
2
analyzer with a range of 0 to 5 percent. Use an O
2
analyzer capable of providing a measure of O
2
in the range of 0 to 25 percent by volume at least once every 10 minutes.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards
7.1 Test Fuel and Test Fuel Spacers. Same as Method 28, sections 7.1 and 7.2, respectively.
7.2 Cylinder Gases. For each of the three analyzers, use the same concentration as specified in sections 7.2.1, 7.2.2, and 7.2.3 of Method 6C.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
8.1 Wood Heater Air Supply Adjustments.
8.1.1 This section describes how dampers are to be set or adjusted and air inlet ports closed or sealed during Method 28A tests. The specifications in this section are intended to ensure that affected facility determinations are made on the facility configurations that could reasonably be expected to be employed by the user. They are also intended to prevent circumvention of the standard through the addition of an air port that would often be blocked off in actual use. These specifications are based on the assumption that consumers will remove such items as dampers or other closure mechanism stops if this can be done readily with household tools; that consumers will block air inlet passages not visible during normal operation of the appliance using aluminum tape or parts generally available at retail stores; and that consumers will cap off any threaded or flanged air inlets. They also assume that air leakage around glass doors, sheet metal joints or through inlet grilles visible during normal operation of the appliance would not be further blocked or taped off by a consumer.
8.1.2 It is not the intention of this section to cause an appliance that is clearly designed, intended, and, in most normal installations, used as a fireplace to be converted into a wood heater for purposes of applicability testing. Such a fireplace would be identifiable by such features as large or multiple glass doors or panels that are not gasketed, relatively unrestricted air inlets intended, in large part, to limit smoking and fogging of glass surfaces, and other aesthetic features not normally included in wood heaters.
8.1.3 Adjustable Air Supply Mechanisms. Any commercially available flue damper, other adjustment mechanism or other air
inlet port that is designed, intended or otherwise reasonably expected to be adjusted or closed by consumers, installers, or dealers and which could restrict air into the firebox shall be set so as to achieve minimum air into the firebox (
i.e.,
closed off or set in the most closed position).
8.1.3.1 Flue dampers, mechanisms and air inlet ports which could reasonably be expected to be adjusted or closed would include:
8.1.3.1.1 All internal or externally adjustable mechanisms (including adjustments that affect the tightness of door fittings) that are accessible either before and/or after installation.
8.1.3.1.2 All mechanisms, other inlet ports, or inlet port stops that are identified in the owner's manual or in any dealer literature as being adjustable or alterable. For example, an inlet port that could be used to provide access to an outside air duct but which is identified as being closable through use of additional materials whether or not they are supplied with the facility.
8.1.3.1.3 Any combustion air inlet port or commercially available flue damper or mechanism stop, which would readily lend itself to closure by consumers who are handy with household tools by the removal of parts or the addition of parts generally available at retail stores (
e.g.,
addition of a pipe cap or plug, addition of a small metal plate to an inlet hole on a nondecorative sheet metal surface, or removal of riveted or screwed damper stops).
8.1.3.1.4 Any flue damper, other adjustment mechanisms or other air inlet ports that are found and documented in several (
e.g.,
a number sufficient to reasonably conclude that the practice is not unique or uncommon) actual installations as having been adjusted to a more closed position, or closed by consumers, installers, or dealers.
8.1.4 Air Supply Adjustments During Test. The test shall be performed with all air inlets identified under this section in the closed or most closed position or in the configuration which otherwise achieves the lowest air inlet (
i.e.,
greatest blockage).

# Note:
For the purposes of this section, air flow shall not be minimized beyond the point necessary to maintain combustion or beyond the point that forces smoke into the room.
8.1.5 Notwithstanding section 8.1.1, any flue damper, adjustment mechanism, or air inlet port (whether or not equipped with flue dampers or adjusting mechanisms) that is visible during normal operation of the appliance and which could not reasonably be closed further or blocked except through means that would significantly degrade the aesthetics of the facility (
e.g.,
through use of duct tape) will not be closed further or blocked.
8.2 Sampling System.
8.2.1 Sampling Location. Same as Method 5H, section 8.1.2.
8.2.2 Sampling System Set Up. Set up the sampling equipment as described in Method 3, section 8.1.
8.3 Wood Heater Installation, Test Facility Conditions, Wood Heater Firebox Volume, and Test Fuel Charge. Same as Method 28, sections 8.4 and 8.6 to 8.8, respectively.
8.4 Pretest Ignition. Same as Method 28, section 8.11. Set the wood heater air supply settings to achieve a burn rate in Category 1 or the lowest achievable burn rate (see section 8.1).
8.5 Test Run. Same as Method 28, section 8.12. Begin sample collection at the start of the test run as defined in Method 28, section 8.12.1.
8.5.1 Gas Analysis.
8.5.1.1 If Method 3 is used, collect a minimum of two bag samples simultaneously at a constant sampling rate for the duration of the test run. A minimum sample volume of 30 liters (1.1 ft
3
) per bag is recommended.
8.5.1.2 If instrumental gas concentration measurement procedures are used, conduct the gas measurement system performance tests, analyzer calibration, and analyzer calibration error check outlined in Method 6C, sections 8.2.3, 8.2.4, 8.5, and 10.0, respectively. Sample at a constant rate for the duration of the test run.
8.5.2 Data Recording. Record wood heater operational data, test facility temperature, sample train flow rate, and fuel weight data at intervals of no greater than 10 minutes.
8.5.3 Test Run Completion. Same as Method 28, section 8.13.

# 9.0 Quality Control
9.1 Data Validation. The following quality control procedure is suggested to provide a check on the quality of the data.
9.1.1 Calculate a fuel factor, F
o
, using Equation 28A-1 in section 12.2.
9.1.2 If CO is present in quantities measurable by this method, adjust the O
2
and CO
2
values before performing the calculation for F
o
as shown in section 12.3 and 12.4.
9.1.3 Compare the calculated F
o
factor with the expected F
o
range for wood (1.000-1.120). Calculated F
o
values beyond this acceptable range should be investigated before accepting the test results. For example, the strength of the solutions in the gas analyzer and the analyzing technique should be checked by sampling and analyzing a known concentration, such as air. If no detectable or correctable measurement error can be identified, the test should be repeated. Alternatively, determine a range of air-to-fuel ratio results that could include the correct value by using an F
o
value of 1.05 and calculating a potential range of CO
2
and O
2
values. Acceptance of such results will be based on whether the calculated range includes the
exemption limit and the judgment of the Administrator.
9.2 Method 3 Analyses. Compare the results of the analyses of the two bag samples. If all the gas components (O
2
, CO, and CO
2
) values for the two analyses agree within 0.5 percent (
e.g.,
6.0 percent O
2
for bag 1 and 6.5 percent O
2
for bag 2, agree within 0.5 percent), the results of the bag analyses may be averaged for the calculations in section 12. If the analysis results do not agree within 0.5 percent for each component, calculate the air-to-fuel ratio using both sets of analyses and report the results.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization
[Reserved]

# 11.0 Analytical Procedures
11.1 Method 3 Integrated Bag Samples. Within 4 hours after the sample collection, analyze each bag sample for percent CO
2
, O

, and CO using an Orsat analyzer as described in Method 3, section 11.0.
11.2 Instrumental Analyzers. Average the percent CO
2
, CO, and O
2
values for the test run.

(IBR, see § 60.17). Upon request, four-inch filters may be used. Upon request, Teflon membrane filters or Teflon-coated glass fiber filters may be used.

# 2.0 Procedures
2.1 This method incorporates the provisions of ASTM E2780-10 (IBR, see § 60.17) except as follows:
2.1.1 The burn rate categories, low burn rate requirement, and weightings in Method 28 shall be used.

# Test Method 28WHH for Measurement of Particulate Emissions and Heating Efficiency of Wood-Fired Hydronic Heating Appliances

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1 This test method applies to wood-fired hydronic heating appliances. The units typically transfer heat through circulation of a liquid heat exchange media such as water or a water-antifreeze mixture.
1.2 The test method measures particulate emissions and delivered heating efficiency at specified heat output rates based on the appliance's rated heating capacity.
1.3 Particulate emissions are measured by the dilution tunnel method as specified in ASTM E2515-11
Standard Test Method for Determination of Particulate Matter Emissions Collected in a Dilution Tunnel
(IBR, see § 60.17). Upon request, four-inch filters may be used. Upon request, Teflon membrane filters or Teflon-coated glass fiber filters may be used. Delivered efficiency is measured by determining the heat output through measurement of the flow rate and temperature change of water circulated through a heat exchanger external to the appliance and determining the input from the mass of dry wood fuel and its higher heating value. Delivered efficiency does not attempt to account for pipeline loss.
1.4 Products covered by this test method include both pressurized and non-pressurized heating appliances intended to be fired with wood. These products are wood-fired hydronic heating appliances that the manufacturer specifies for indoor or outdoor installation. They are often connected to a heat exchanger by insulated pipes and normally include a pump to circulate heated liquid. They are used to heat structures such as homes, barns and greenhouses and can heat domestic hot water, spas or swimming pools.
1.5 Distinguishing features of products covered by this standard include:
1.5.1 Manufacturer specifies for indoor or outdoor installation.
1.5.2 A firebox with an access door for hand loading of fuel.
1.5.3 Typically, an aquastat that controls combustion air supply to maintain the liquid in the appliance within a predetermined temperature range provided sufficient fuel is available in the firebox.
1.5.4 A chimney or vent that exhausts combustion products from the appliance.
1.6 The values stated are to be regarded as the standard whether in I-P or SI units. The values given in parentheses are for information only.

# 2.0 Summary of Method and References

# 4.0 Summary of Test Method
4.1 Dilution Tunnel. Emissions are determined using the “dilution tunnel” method specified in ASTM E2515-11
Standard Test Method for Determination of Particulate Matter Emissions Collected in a Dilution Tunnel
(IBR, see § 60.17). The flow rate in the dilution tunnel is maintained at a constant level throughout the test cycle and accurately measured. Samples of the dilution tunnel flow stream are extracted at a constant flow rate and drawn through high efficiency filters. The filters are dried and weighed before and after the test to determine the emissions catch and this value is multiplied by the ratio of tunnel flow to filter flow to determine the total particulate emissions produced in the test cycle.
4.2 Efficiency. The efficiency test procedure takes advantage of the fact that this type of appliance delivers heat through circulation of the heated liquid (water) from the appliance to a remote heat exchanger and back to the appliance. Measurements of the water temperature difference as it enters and exits the heat exchanger along with the measured flow rate allow for an accurate determination of the useful heat output of the appliance. The input is determined by weight of the test fuel charge, adjusted for moisture content, multiplied by the higher heating value. Additional measurements of the appliance weight and temperature at the beginning and end of a test cycle are used to correct for heat stored in the appliance. Overall efficiency (SLM) is determined using the CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17) stack loss method for data quality assurance purposes.
4.3 Operation. Appliance operation is conducted on a hot-to-hot test cycle meaning that the appliance is brought to operating
temperature and a coal bed is established prior to the addition of the test fuel charge and measurements are made for each test fuel charge cycle. The measurements are made under constant heat draw conditions within predetermined ranges. No attempt is made to modulate the heat demand to simulate an indoor thermostat cycling on and off in response to changes in the indoor environment. Four test categories are used. These are:
4.3.1 Category I: A heat output of 15 percent or less of manufacturer's rated heat output capacity.
4.3.2 Category II: A heat output of 16 percent to 24 percent of manufacturer's rated heat output capacity.
4.3.3 Category III: A heat output of 25 percent to 50 percent of manufacturer's rated heat output capacity.
4.3.4 Category IV: Manufacturer's rated heat output capacity.

# 5.0 Significance and Use
5.1 The measurement of particulate matter emission rates is an important test method widely used in the practice of air pollution control.
5.1.1 These measurements, when approved by state or federal agencies, are often required for the purpose of determining compliance with regulations and statutes.
5.1.2 The measurements made before and after design modifications are necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of design changes in reducing emissions and make this standard an important tool in manufacturers' research and development programs.
5.2 Measurement of heating efficiency provides a uniform basis for comparison of product performance that is useful to the consumer. It is also required to relate emissions produced to the useful heat production.
5.3 This is a laboratory method and is not intended to be fully representative of all actual field use. It is recognized that users of hand-fired, wood-burning equipment have a great deal of influence over the performance of any wood-burning appliance. Some compromises in realism have been made in the interest of providing a reliable and repeatable test method.

# 6.0 Test Equipment
6.1 Scale. A platform scale capable of weighing the appliance under test and associated parts and accessories when completely filled with water to an accuracy of ±1.0 pound (±0.5 kg).
6.2 Heat Exchanger. A water-to-water heat exchanger capable of dissipating the expected heat output from the system under test.
6.3 Water Temperature Difference Measurement. A Type—T 'special limits' thermopile with a minimum of 5 pairs of junctions shall be used to measure the temperature difference in water entering and leaving the heat exchanger. The temperature difference measurement uncertainty of this type of thermopile is equal to or less than ±0.50 °F (±0.25 °C).

The pump shall not be installed in such a way as to change or affect the flow rate between the appliance and the heat exchanger.
9.3.2 If the manufacturer specifies that a thermal control valve or other device be installed and set to control the return water temperature to a specific set point, the valve or other device shall be installed and set per the manufacturer's written instructions.
9.4 Prior to filling the tank, weigh and record the appliance mass.
9.5 Heat Exchanger
9.5.1 Plumb the unit to a water-to-water heat exchanger with sufficient capacity to draw off heat at the maximum rate anticipated. Route hoses, electrical cables, and instrument wires in a manner that does not influence the weighing accuracy of the scale as indicated by placing dead weights on the platform and verifying the scale's accuracy.
9.5.2 Locate thermocouples to measure the water temperature at the inlet and outlet of the load side of the heat exchanger.
9.5.3 Install a thermopile meeting the requirements of section 6.3 to measure the water temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the load side of the heat exchanger.
9.5.4 Install a calibrated water flow meter in the heat exchanger load side supply line. The water flow meter is to be installed on the cooling water inlet side of the heat exchanger so that it will operate at the temperature at which it is calibrated.
9.5.5 Place the heat exchanger in a box with 2 in. (50 mm) of expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam insulation surrounding it to minimize heat losses from the heat exchanger.
9.5.6 The reported efficiency and heat output rate shall be based on measurements made on the load side of the heat exchanger.
9.5.7 Temperature instrumentation per section 6.6 shall be installed in the appliance outlet and return lines. The average of the outlet and return water temperature on the supply side of the system shall be considered the average appliance temperature for calculation of heat storage in the appliance (TF
avg
and TI
avg
). Installation of a water flow meter in the supply side of the system is optional.
9.6 Fill the system with water. Determine the total weight of the water in the appliance when the water is circulating. Verify that the scale indicates a stable weight under operating conditions. Make sure air is purged properly.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization
10.1 Water Temperature Sensors. Temperature measuring equipment shall be calibrated before initial use and at least semi-annually thereafter. Calibrations shall be in compliance with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Monograph 175, Standard Limits of Error.
10.2 Heat Exchanger Load Side Water Flow Meter.
10.2.1 The heat exchanger load side water flow meter shall be calibrated within the flow range used for the test run using NIST traceable methods. Verify the calibration of the water flow meter before and after each test run and at least once during each test run by comparing the water flow rate indicated by the flow meter to the mass of water collected from the outlet of the heat exchanger over a timed interval. Volume of the collected water shall be determined based on the water density calculated from section 13, Eq. 8, using the water temperature measured at the flow meter. The uncertainty in the verification procedure used shall be 1 percent or less. The water flow rate determined by the collection and weighing method shall be within 1 percent of the flow rate indicated by the water flow meter.
10.3 Scales. The scales used to weigh the appliance and test fuel charge shall be calibrated using NIST traceable methods at least once every 6 months.

10.5 Flue Gas Analyzers—In accordance with CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clause 6.8.

# 11.0 Conditioning
11.1 Prior to testing, the appliance is to be operated for a minimum of 50 hours using a medium heat draw rate. The conditioning may be at the manufacturer's facility prior to the certification test. If the conditioning is at the certification test laboratory, the pre-burn for the first test can be included as
part of the conditioning requirement. If conditioning is included in pre-burn, then the appliance shall be aged with fuel meeting the specifications outlined in sections 12.2 with a moisture content between 19 and 25 percent on a dry basis. Operate the appliance at a medium burn rate (Category II or III) for at least 10 hours for noncatalytic appliances and 50 hours for catalytic appliances. Record and report hourly flue gas exit temperature data and the hours of operation. The aging procedure shall be conducted and documented by a testing laboratory.

# 12.0 Procedure
12.1 Appliance Installation. Assemble the appliance and parts in conformance with the manufacturer's written installation instructions. Clean the flue with an appropriately sized, wire chimney brush before each certification test series.
12.2 Fuel. Test fuel charge fuel shall be red (
Quercus ruba L.
) or white (
Quercus alba
) oak 19 to 25 percent moisture content on a dry basis. Piece length shall be 80 percent of the firebox depth rounded down to the nearest 1 inch (25mm) increment. For example, if the firebox depth is 46 inches (1168mm) the 4 × 4 piece length would be 36 inches (46 inches × 0.8 = 36.8 inches rounded down to 36 inches). Pieces are to be placed in the firebox parallel to the longest firebox dimension. For fireboxes with sloped surfaces that create a non-uniform firebox length, the piece length shall be adjusted for each layer based on 80 percent of the length at the level where the layer is placed. Pieces are to be spaced
3/4
inches (19 mm) apart on all faces. The first fuel layer may be assembled using fuel units consisting of multiple 4 × 4s consisting of single pieces with bottom and side spacers of 3 or more pieces if needed for a stable layer. The second layer may consist of fuel units consisting of no more than two pieces with spacers attached on the bottom and side. The top two layers of the fuel charge must consist of single pieces unless the fuel charge is only three layers. In that instance only the top layer must consist of single units. Three-quarter inch (19 mm) by 1.5 inch (38 mm) spacers shall be attached to the bottom of piece to maintain a
3/4
inch (19 mm) separation. When a layer consists of two or more units of 4 × 4s an additional
3/4
inch (19 mm) thick by 1.5 inch (38 mm) wide spacer shall be attached to the vertical face of each end of one 4 × 4, such that the
3/4
inch (19 mm) space will be maintained when two 4 × 4 units or pieces are loaded side by side. In cases where a layer contains an odd number of 4 × 4s one piece shall not be attached, but shall have spacers attached in a manner that will provide for the
3/4
inch (19 mm) space to be maintained (See Figure 1). Spacers shall be attached perpendicular to the length of the 4 × 4s such that the edge of the spacer is 1 ± 0.25 inch from the end of the 4 × 4s in the previous layers. Spacers shall be red or white oak and will be attached with either nails (non-galvanized), brads or oak dowels. The use of kiln-dried wood is not allowed.
12.2.1 Using a fuel moisture meter as specified in section 6.7 of the test method, determine the fuel moisture for each test fuel piece used for the test fuel load by averaging at least five fuel moisture meter readings measured parallel to the wood grain. Penetration of the moisture meter insulated electrodes for all readings shall be
1/4
the thickness of the fuel piece or 19 mm (
3/4
in.), whichever is lesser. One measurement from each of three sides shall be made at approximately 3 inches from each end and the center. Two additional measurements shall be made centered between the other three locations. Each individual moisture content reading shall be in the range of 18 to 28 percent on a dry basis. The average moisture content of each piece of test fuel shall be in the range of 19 to 25 percent. It is not required to measure the moisture content of the spacers. Moisture shall not be added to previously dried fuel pieces except by storage under high humidity conditions and temperature up to 100 °F. Fuel moisture shall be measured within 4 hours of using the fuel for a test.
12.2.2 Firebox Volume. Determine the firebox volume in cubic feet. Firebox volume shall include all areas accessible through the fuel loading door where firewood could reasonably be placed up to the horizontal plane defined by the top of the loading door. A drawing of the firebox showing front, side and plan views or an isometric view with interior dimensions shall be provided by the manufacturer and verified by the laboratory. Calculations for firebox volume from computer aided design (CAD) software programs are acceptable and shall be included in the test report if used. If the firebox volume is calculated by the laboratory the firebox drawings and calculations shall be included in the test report.
12.2.3 Test Fuel Charge. Test fuel charges shall be determined by multiplying the firebox volume by 10 pounds (4.54 kg) per ft
3
(28L), or a higher load density as recommended by the manufacturer's printed operating instructions, of wood (as used wet weight). Select the number of pieces of standard fuel that most nearly match this target weight. This is the standard fuel charge for all tests. For example, if the firebox loading area volume is 10 ft
3
(280L) and the firebox depth is 46 inches (1168 mm), test fuel charge target is 100 lbs (45 kg) minimum and the piece length is 36 inches (914 mm). If eight 4 × 4s, 36 inches long weigh 105 lbs (48 kg), use 8 pieces for each test fuel charge. All test fuel charges will be of the same configuration.
12.3 Sampling Equipment. Prepare the particulate emission sampling equipment as defined by ASTM E2515-11
Standard Test Method for Determination of Particulate Matter Emissions Collected in a Dilution Tunnel
(IBR, see § 60.17). Upon request, four-inch filters may be used. Upon request, Teflon membrane filters or Teflon-coated glass fiber filters may be used.
12.4 Appliance Startup. The appliance shall be fired with wood fuel of any species, size and moisture content at the laboratories' discretion to bring it up to operating temperature. Operate the appliance until the water is heated to the upper operating control limit and has cycled at least two times. Then remove all unburned fuel, zero the scale and verify the scales accuracy using dead weights.
12.4.1 Pretest Burn Cycle. Reload appliance with oak wood and allow it to burn down to the specified coal bed weight. The pretest burn cycle fuel charge weight shall be within ±10 percent of the test fuel charge weight. Piece size and length shall be selected such that charcoalization is achieved by the time the fuel charge has burned down to the required coal bed weight. Pieces with a maximum thickness of approximately 2 inches have been found to be suitable. Charcoalization is a general condition of the test fuel bed evidenced by an absence of large pieces of burning wood in the coal bed and the remaining fuel pieces being brittle enough to be broken into smaller charcoal pieces with a metal poker. Manipulations to the fuel bed prior to the start of the test run are to be done to achieve charcoalization while maintaining the desired heat output rate. During the pre-test burn cycle and at least one hour prior to starting the test run, adjust water flow to the heat exchanger to establish the target heat draw for the test. For the first test run the heat draw rate shall be equal to the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity.
12.4.1.1 Allowable Adjustments. Fuel addition or subtractions, and coal bed raking shall be kept to a minimum but are allowed up to 15 minutes prior to the start of the test run. For the purposes of this method, coal bed raking is the use of a metal tool (poker) to stir coals, break burning fuel into smaller pieces, dislodge fuel pieces from positions of poor combustion, and check for the condition of charcoalization. Record all adjustments to and additions or subtractions of fuel, and any other changes to the appliance operations that occur during pretest ignition period. During the 15-minute period prior to the start of the test run, the wood heater loading door shall not be open more than a total of 1 minute. Coal bed raking is the only adjustment allowed during this period.
12.4.2 Coal Bed Weight. The appliance is to be loaded with the test fuel charge when the coal bed weight is between 10 percent and 20 percent of the test fuel charge weight. Coals may be raked as necessary to level the coal bed but may only be raked and stirred once between 15 to 20 minutes prior to the addition of the test fuel charge.
12.5 Test Runs. For all test runs, the return water temperature to the hydronic heater must be equal to or greater than 120 °F. Aquastat or other heater output control device settings that are adjustable shall be set using manufacturer specifications, either as factory set or in accordance with the owner's manual, and shall remain the same for all burn categories.
Complete a test run in each heat output rate category, as follows:
12.5.1 Test Run Start. Once the appliance is operating normally and the pretest coal bed weight has reached the target value per section 12.4.2, tare the scale and load the full test charge into the appliance. Time for loading shall not exceed 5 minutes. The actual weight of the test fuel charge shall be measured and recorded within 30 minutes prior to loading. Start all sampling systems.
12.5.1.1 Record all water temperatures, differential water temperatures and water flow rates at time intervals of one minute or less.
12.5.1.2 Record particulate emissions data per the requirements of ASTM E2515 (IBR, see § 60.17).
12.5.1.3 Record data needed to determine overall efficiency (SLM) per the requirements of CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clauses 6.2.1, 6.2.2, 6.3, 8.5.7, 10.4.3 (a), 10.4.3(f), and 13.7.9.3
12.5.1.3.1 Measure and record the test room air temperature in accordance with the requirements of CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clauses 6.2.1, 8.5.7 and 10.4.3 (g).
12.5.1.3.2 Measure and record the flue gas temperature in accordance with the requirements of CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clauses 6.2.2, 8.5.7 and 10.4.3 (f).
12.5.1.3.3 Determine and record the carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO
2
) concentrations in the flue gas in accordance with CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clauses 6.3, 8.5.7 and 10.4.3 (i) and (j).
12.5.1.3.4 Measure and record the test fuel weight per the requirements of CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clauses 8.5.7 and 10.4.3 (h).
12.5.1.3.5 Record the test run time per the requirements of CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clauses 10.4.3 (a).
12.5.1.4 Monitor the average heat output rate on the load side of the heat exchanger. If the heat output rate gets close to the upper or lower limit of the target range (±5 percent) adjust the water flow through the heat exchanger to compensate. Make changes as infrequently as possible while maintaining the target heat output rate. The first test run shall be conducted at the Category IV heat output rate to validate that
the appliance is capable of producing the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity.
12.5.2 Test Fuel Charge Adjustment. It is acceptable to adjust the test fuel charge (
i.e.,
reposition) once during a test run if more than 60 percent of the initial test fuel charge weight has been consumed and more than 10 minutes have elapsed without a measurable (1 lb or 0. 5 kg) weight change while the operating control is in the demand mode. The time used to make this adjustment shall be less than 60 seconds.
12.5.3 Test Run Completion. The test run is completed when the remaining weight of the test fuel charge is 0.0 lb (0.0 kg). End the test run when the scale has indicated a test fuel charge weight of 0.0 lb (0.0 kg) or less for 30 seconds.
12.5.3.1 At the end of the test run, stop the particulate sampling train and overall efficiency (SLM) measurements, and record the run time, and all final measurement values.
12.5.4 Heat Output Capacity Validation. The first test run must produce a heat output rate that is within 10 percent of the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity (Category IV) throughout the test run and an average heat output rate within 5 percent of the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity. If the appliance is not capable of producing a heat output within these limits, the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity is considered not validated and testing is to be terminated. In such cases, the tests may be restarted using a lower heat output capacity if requested by the manufacturer.
12.5.5 Additional Test Runs. Using the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity as a basis, conduct a test for additional heat output categories as specified in section 4.3. It is not required to run these tests in any particular order.
12.5.6 Alternative Heat Output Rate for Category I. If an appliance cannot be operated in the Category I heat output range due to stopped combustion, two test runs shall be conducted at heat output rates within Category II, provided that the completed test run burn rate is no greater than the burn rate expected in home use. If this rate cannot be achieved, the test is not valid.
When the alternative heat output rate is used, the weightings for the weighted averages indicated in Table 2 shall be the average of the Category I and II weightings and shall be applied to both Category II results. The two completed runs in Category II will be deemed to meet the requirement for runs completed in both Category I and Category II. Appliances that are not capable of operation within Category II (
25 percent of maximum) cannot be evaluated by this test method. The test report must include full documentation and discussion of the attempted runs, completed rums and calculations.
12.5.6.1 Stopped Fuel Combustion. Evidence that an appliance cannot be operated at a Category I heat output rate due to stopped fuel combustion shall include documentation of two or more attempts to operate the appliance in burn rate Category I and fuel combustion has stopped prior to complete consumption of the test fuel charge. Stopped fuel combustion is evidenced when an elapsed time of 60 minutes or more has occurred without a measurable (1 lb or 0.5 kg) weight change in the test fuel charge while the appliance operating control is in the demand mode. Report the evidence and the reasoning used to determine that a test in burn rate Category I cannot be achieved. For example, two unsuccessful attempts to operate at an output rate of 10 percent of the rated output capacity are not sufficient evidence that burn rate Category I cannot be achieved. Note that section 12.5.6 requires that the completed test run burn rate can be no greater than the burn rate expected in home use. If this rate cannot be achieved, the test is not valid.
12.5.7 Appliance Overheating. Appliances shall be capable of operating in all heat output categories without overheating to be rated by this test method. Appliance overheating occurs when the rate of heat withdrawal from the appliance is lower than the rate of heat production when the unit control is in the idle mode. This condition results in the water in the appliance continuing to increase in temperature well above the upper limit setting of the operating control. Evidence of overheating includes: 1 hour or more of appliance water temperature increase above the upper temperature set-point of the operating control, exceeding the temperature limit of a safety control device (independent from the operating control), boiling water in a non-pressurized system or activation of a pressure or temperature relief valve in a pressurized system.
12.6 Additional Test Runs. The testing laboratory may conduct more than one test run in each of the heat output categories specified in section 4.3.1. If more than one test run is conducted at a specified heat output rate, the results from at least two-thirds of the test runs in that heat output rate category shall be used in calculating the weighted average emission rate (See section 14.1.14). The measurement data and results of all test runs shall be reported regardless of which values are used in calculating the weighted average emission rate.

# —Overall Efficiency (SLM) using Stack Loss
For determination of the average overall thermal efficiency (η
SLM
) for the test run, use the data collected over the full test run and the calculations in accordance with CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clause 13.7 except for 13.7.2 (e), (f), (g), and (h), use the following average fuel properties for oak: percent C = 50.0, percent H = 6.6, percent O = 43.2, percent ash = 0.2 percent. The averaging period for determination of efficiency by the stack loss method allows averaging over 10 minute time periods for flue gas temperature, flue gas CO
2
, and flue gas CO for the determination of the efficiency. However, under some cycling conditions the “on” period may be short relative to this 10 minute period. For this reason, during cycling operation the averaging period for these parameters may not be longer than the burner on period divided by 10. The averaging period need not be shorter than one minute. During the off period, under cycling operation, the averaging periods specified may be used. Where short averaging times are used, however, the averaging period for fuel consumption may still be at 10 minutes. This average wood consumption rate shall be applied to all of the smaller time intervals included.
13.5.5.1 Whenever the CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17) overall efficiency is found to be lower than the overall efficiency based on load side measurements, as determined by Eq. 16 of this method, section 14.1.7 of the test report must include a discussion of the reasons for this result.

# 13.6 Weighted Average Emissions and Efficiency
13.6.1 Determine the weighted average emission rate and delivered efficiency from the individual tests in the specified heat output categories. The weighting factors (Fi) are derived from an analysis of ASHRAE bin data which provides details of normal building heating requirements in terms of percent of design capacity and time in a particular capacity range—or “bin”—over the course of a heating season. The values used in this method represent an average of data from several cities located in the northern United States.

# Test Method 28WHH for Certification of Cord Wood-Fired Hydronic Heating Appliances With Partial Thermal Storage: Measurement of Particulate Matter (PM) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) Emissions and Heating Efficiency of Wood-Fired Hydronic Heating Appliances With Partial Thermal Storage

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1 This test method applies to wood-fired hydronic heating appliances with heat storage external to the appliance. The units typically transfer heat through circulation of a liquid heat exchange media such as water or a water-antifreeze mixture. Throughout this document, the term “water” will be used to denote any of the heat transfer liquids approved for use by the manufacturer.
1.2 The test method measures PM and CO emissions and delivered heating efficiency at specified heat output rates referenced against the appliance's rated heating capacity as specified by the manufacturer and verified under this test method.
1.3 PM emissions are measured by the dilution tunnel method as specified in the EPA Method 28WHH and the standards referenced therein with the exceptions noted in section 12.5.9. Delivered efficiency is measured by determining the fuel energy input and appliance output. Heat output is determined through measurement of the flow rate and temperature change of water circulated through a heat exchanger external to the appliance and the increase in energy of the external storage. Heat input is determined from the mass of dry wood fuel and its higher heating value (HHV). Delivered efficiency does not attempt to account for pipeline loss.
1.4 Products covered by this test method include both pressurized and non-pressurized hydronic heating appliances intended to be fired with wood and for which the manufacturer specifies for indoor or outdoor installation. The system, which includes the heating appliance and external storage, is commonly connected to a heat exchanger by insulated pipes and normally includes a pump to circulate heated liquid. These systems are used to heat structures such as homes, barns and greenhouses. They also provide heat for domestic hot water, spas and swimming pools.
1.5 Distinguishing features of products covered by this standard include:
1.5.1 The manufacturer specifies the application for either indoor or outdoor installation.
1.5.2 A firebox with an access door for hand loading of fuel.
1.5.3 Typically an aquastat mounted as part of the appliance that controls combustion air supply to maintain the liquid in the appliance within a predetermined temperature range provided sufficient fuel is available in the firebox. The appliance may be equipped with other devices to control combustion.
1.5.4 A chimney or vent that exhausts combustion products from the appliance.
1.5.5 A liquid storage system, typically water, which is not large enough to accept all of the heat produced when a full load of wood is burned and the storage system starts a burn cycle at 125 °F.
1.5.6 The heating appliances require external thermal storage and these units will only be installed as part of a system which includes thermal storage. The manufacturer specifies the minimum amount of thermal storage required. However, the storage system shall be large enough to ensure that the boiler (heater) does not cycle, slumber, or go into an off-mode when operated in a Category III load condition (See section 4.3).
1.6 The values stated are to be regarded as the standard whether in I-P or SI units. The values given in parentheses are for information only.

3.1.12 Test Run—An individual emission test which encompasses the time required to consume the mass of the test fuel charge. The time of the test run also considers the time for the energy to be drawn from the thermal storage.
3.1.13 Test Run Under “Cold-to-Cold” Condition—Under this test condition the test fuel is added into an empty chamber along with kindling and ignition materials (paper). The boiler/heater at the start of this test is typically 125° to 130 °F.
3.1.14 Test Run Under “Hot-to-Hot” Condition—Under this test condition the test fuel is added onto a still-burning bed of charcoals produced in a pre-burn period. The boiler/heater water is near its operating control limit at the start of the test.
3.1.15 Overall Efficiency, also known as Stack Loss Efficiency—The efficiency for each test run as determined using the CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17) stack loss method (SLM).
3.1.16 Phases of a Burn Cycle—The “startup phase” is defined as the period from the start of the test until 15 percent of the test fuel charge is consumed. The “steady-state phase” is defined as the period from the end of the startup phase to a point at which 80 percent of the test fuel charge is consumed. The “end phase” is defined as the time from the end of the steady-state period to the end of the test.

3.1.18 Slumber Mode—This is a mode in which the temperature of the water in the boiler/heater has exceeded the operating control limit and the control has changed the boiler/heater fan speed, dampers, and/or other operating parameters to minimize the heat output of the boiler/heater.

# 4.0 Summary of Test Method
4.1 Dilution Tunnel. Emissions are determined using the “dilution tunnel” method specified in EPA Method 28WHH and the standards referenced therein. The flow rate in the dilution tunnel is maintained at a constant level throughout the test cycle and accurately measured. Samples of the dilution tunnel flow stream are extracted at a constant flow rate and drawn through high efficiency filters. The filters are dried and weighed before and after the test to determine the emissions collected and this value is multiplied by the ratio of tunnel flow to filter flow to determine the total particulate emissions produced in the test cycle.
4.2 Efficiency. The efficiency test procedure takes advantage of the fact that this type of system delivers heat through circulation of the heated liquid (water) from the system to a remote heat exchanger (
e.g.
baseboard radiators in a room) and back to the system. Measurements of the cooling water temperature difference as it enters and exits the test system heat exchanger along with the measured flow rate allow for an accurate determination of the useful heat output of the appliance. Also included in the heat output is the change in the energy content in the storage system during a test run. Energy input to the appliance during the test run is determined by weight of the test fuel charge, adjusted for moisture content, multiplied by the higher heating value. Additional measurements of the appliance weight and temperature at the beginning and end of a test cycle are used to correct for heat stored in the appliance. Overall efficiency (SLM) is determined using the CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17) stack loss method for data quality assurance purposes.
4.3 Operation. Four test categories are defined for use in this method. These are:
4.3.1 Category I: A heat output of 15 percent or less of manufacturer's rated heat output capacity.
4.3.2 Category II: A heat output of 16 percent to 24 percent of manufacturer's rated heat output capacity.
4.3.3 Category III: A heat output of 25 percent to 50 percent of manufacturer's rated heat output capacity.
4.3.4 Category IV: Manufacturer's Rated Heat Output Capacity. These heat output categories refer to the output from the system by way of the load heat exchanger installed for the test. The output from just the boiler/heater part of the system may be higher for all or part of a test, as part of this boiler/heater output goes to storage.
For the Category III and IV runs, appliance operation is conducted on a hot-to-hot test
cycle meaning that the appliance is brought to operating temperature and a coal bed is established prior to the addition of the test fuel charge and measurements are made for each test fuel charge cycle. The measurements are made under constant heat draw conditions within pre-determined ranges. No attempt is made to modulate the heat demand to simulate an indoor thermostat cycling on and off in response to changes in the indoor environment.
For the Category I and II runs, the unit is tested with a “cold start.” At the manufacturer's option, the Category II and III runs may be waived and it may be assumed that the particulate emission values and efficiency values determined in the startup, steady-state, and end phases of Category I are applicable in Categories II and III for the purpose of determining the annual averages in lb/mmBtu and g/MJ (See section 13). For the annual average in g/hr, the length of time for stored heat to be drawn from thermal storage shall be determined for the test load requirements of the respective category.
All test operations and measurements shall be conducted by personnel of the laboratory responsible for the submission of the test report.

# 5.0 Significance and Use
5.1 The measurement of particulate matter emission and CO rates is an important test method widely used in the practice of air pollution control.
5.1.1 These measurements, when approved by state or federal agencies, are often required for the purpose of determining compliance with regulations and statutes.
5.1.2 The measurements made before and after design modifications are necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of design changes in reducing emissions and make this standard an important tool in manufacturers' research and development programs.
5.2 Measurement of heating efficiency provides a uniform basis for comparison of product performance that is useful to the consumer. It is also required to relate emissions produced to the useful heat production.
5.3 This is a laboratory method and is not intended to be fully representative of all actual field use. It is recognized that users of hand-fired, wood-burning equipment have a great deal of influence over the performance of any wood-burning appliance. Some compromises in realism have been made in the interest of providing a reliable and repeatable test method.

8.4 Where the manufacturer defines several alternatives for the connection and loading arrangement, one shall be defined in the appliance documentation as the default or standard installation. It is expected that this will be the configuration for use with a simple baseboard heating system. This is the configuration to be followed for these tests. The manufacturer's documentation shall define the other arrangements as optional or alternative arrangements.

The flue section from the appliance flue collar to 8 ±0.5 feet above the scale shall be single wall stove pipe and the remainder of the flue shall be double wall insulated class A chimney.
9.3 Optional Equipment Use
9.3.1 A recirculation pump may be installed between connections at the top and bottom of the appliance to minimize thermal stratification if specified by the manufacturer. The pump shall not be installed in such a way as to change or affect the flow rate between the appliance and the heat exchanger.
9.3.2 If the manufacturer specifies that a thermal control valve or other device be installed and set to control the return water temperature to a specific set point, the valve or other device shall be installed and set per the manufacturer's written instructions.
9.4 Prior to filling the boiler/heater with water, weigh and record the appliance mass.
9.5 Heat Exchanger
9.5.1 Plumb the unit to a water-to-water heat exchanger with sufficient capacity to draw off heat at the maximum rate anticipated.

9.5.2 Locate thermocouples to measure the water temperature at the inlet and outlet of the load side of the heat exchanger.
9.5.3 Install a thermopile (or equivalent instrumentation) meeting the requirements of section 6.3 to measure the water temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the load side of the heat exchanger
9.5.4 Install a calibrated water flow meter in the heat exchanger load side supply line. The water flow meter is to be installed on the cooling water inlet side of the heat exchanger so that it will operate at the temperature at which it is calibrated.
9.5.5 Place the heat exchanger in a box with 2 in. (50 mm) of expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam insulation surrounding it to minimize heat losses from the heat exchanger.
9.5.6 The reported efficiency and heat output rate shall be based on measurements made on the load side of the heat exchanger.

Temperature sensors (TS1 and TS2 in Figure 1) shall be included to measure the temperature in the recirculation loop. The valve plan in Figure 1 allows the tank recirculation loop to operate and the boiler/heater-to-heat exchanger loop to operate at the same time but in isolation. This would typically be done before the start of a test or following completion of a test to determine the end of test average tank temperature. The nominal flow rate in the storage tank recirculation loop can be estimated based on pump manufacturers' performance curves and any significant restriction in the recirculation loop.
9.7 Fill the system with water. Determine the total weight of the water in the appliance when the water is circulating. Verify that the scale indicates a stable weight under operating conditions. Make sure air is purged properly.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization

# 11.0 Conditioning
11.1 Prior to testing, an appliance is to be operated for a minimum of 50 hours using a medium heat draw rate. The conditioning may be at the manufacturer's facility prior to the certification test. If the conditioning is at the certification test laboratory, the pre-burn for the first test can be included as part of the conditioning requirement. If conditioning is included in pre-burn, then the appliance shall be aged with fuel meeting the specifications outlined in section 12.2 with a moisture content between 19 and 25 percent on a dry basis. Operate the appliance at a medium heat output rate (Category II or III) for at least 10 hours for non-catalytic appliances and 50 hours for catalytic appliances. Record and report hourly flue gas exit temperature data and the hours of operation. The aging procedure shall be conducted and documented by a testing laboratory.

# 12.0 Procedure
12.1 Appliance Installation. Assemble the appliance and parts in conformance with the manufacturer's written installation instructions. Clean the flue with an appropriately sized, wire chimney brush before each certification test series.
12.2 Fuel. Test fuel charge fuel shall be red (
Quercus ruba L.
) or white (
Quercus Alba
) oak 19 to 25 percent moisture content on a dry basis. Piece length shall be 80 percent of the firebox depth rounded down to the nearest 1 inch (25mm) increment. For example, if the firebox depth is 46 inches (1168mm) the piece length would be 36 inches (46 inches × 0.8 = 36.8 inches, rounded down to 36 inches). Pieces are to be placed in the firebox parallel to the longest firebox dimension. For fireboxes with sloped surfaces that create a non-uniform firebox length, the piece length shall be adjusted for each layer based on 80 percent of the length at the level where the layer is placed. The test fuel shall be cord wood with cross section dimensions and weight limits as defined in CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), section 8.3, Table 4. The use of dimensional lumber is not allowed.
12.2.1 Select three pieces of cord wood from the same batch of wood as the test fuel and the same weight as the average weight of the pieces in the test load ±1.0 lb. From each of these three pieces, cut three slices. Each slice shall be
1/2
inch to
3/4
inch thick. One slice shall be cut across the center of the length of the piece. The other two slices shall be cut half way between the center and the end. Immediately measure the mass of each piece in pounds. Dry each slice in an oven at 220 °F for 24 hours or until no further weight change occurs. The slices shall be arranged in the oven so as to provide separation between faces. Remove from the oven and measure the mass of each piece again as soon as practical, in pounds.
The moisture content of each slice, on a dry basis, shall be calculated as:
ER16MR15.009
Where:
W
SliceWet
= weight of the slice before drying in pounds
W
SliceDry
= weight of the slice after drying in pounds
MC
Slice
= moisture content of the slice in % dry basis
The average moisture content of the entire test load (MC) shall be determined using Eq. 6. Each individual slice shall have a moisture content in the range of 18 percent to 28 percent on a dry basis. The average moisture content for the test fuel load shall be in the range of 19 percent to 25 percent. Moisture shall not be added to previously dried fuel pieces except by storage under high humidity conditions and temperature up to 100 °F. Fuel moisture measurement shall begin within 4 hours of using the fuel batch for a test. Use of a pin-type meter to estimate the moisture content prior to a test is recommended.
12.2.2 Firebox Volume. Determine the firebox volume in cubic feet. Firebox volume shall include all areas accessible through the fuel loading door where firewood could reasonably be placed up to the horizontal plane defined by the top of the loading door. A drawing of the firebox showing front, side and plan views or an isometric view with interior dimensions shall be provided by the manufacturer and verified by the laboratory. Calculations for firebox volume from computer aided design (CAD) software programs are acceptable and shall be included in the test report if used. If the firebox volume is calculated by the laboratory the firebox drawings and calculations shall be included in the test report.
12.2.3 Test Fuel charge. Test fuel charges shall be determined by multiplying the firebox volume by 10 pounds (4.54 kg) per ft
3
(28L), or a higher load density as recommended by the manufacturer's printed operating instructions, of wood (as used wet weight). Select the number of pieces of cord wood that most nearly match this target weight. However, the test fuel charge cannot be less than the target of 10 pounds (4.54 kg) per ft
3
(28L).
12.3 Sampling Equipment. Prepare the particulate emission sampling equipment as defined by EPA Method 28WHH and the standards referenced therein.
12.4 Appliance Startup. The appliance shall be fired with wood fuel of any species, size and moisture content, at the laboratory's discretion, to bring it up to operating temperature. Operate the appliance until the water is heated to the upper operating control limit and has cycled at least two times. Then remove all unburned fuel, zero the scale and verify the scales accuracy using dead weights.
12.4.1 Startup Procedure for Category III and IV Test Runs, “Hot-to-Hot.”
12.4.1.1 Pretest t Burn Cycle. Following appliance startup (section 12.4), reload appliance with oak cord wood and allow it to burn down to the specified coal bed weight. The pre-test burn cycle fuel charge weight shall be within ±10 percent of the test fuel charge weight. Piece size and length shall be selected such that charcoalization is achieved by the time the fuel charge has burned down to the required coal bed weight. Pieces with a maximum thickness of approximately 2 inches have been found to be suitable. Charcoalization is a general condition of the test fuel bed evidenced by an absence of large pieces of burning wood in the coal bed and the remaining fuel pieces being brittle enough to be broken into smaller charcoal pieces with a metal poker. Manipulations to the fuel bed prior to the start of the test run are to be done to achieve charcoalization while maintaining the desired heat output rate. During the pre-test burn cycle and at least one hour prior to starting the test run, adjust water flow to the heat exchanger to establish the target heat draw for the test. For the first test run the heat draw rate shall be equal to the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity.
12.4.1.2 Allowable Adjustments. Fuel addition or subtractions, and coal bed raking shall be kept to a minimum but are allowed up to 15 minutes prior to the start of the test run. For the purposes of this method, coal bed raking is the use of a metal tool (poker) to stir coals, break burning fuel into smaller pieces, dislodge fuel pieces from positions of poor combustion, and check for the condition of charcoalization. Record all adjustments to and additions or subtractions of fuel, and any other changes to the appliance operations that occur during pretest ignition period. During the 15-minute period prior to the start of the test run, the wood heater loading door shall not be open more than a total of 1 minute. Coal bed raking is the only adjustment allowed during this period.
12.4.1.3 Coal Bed Weight. The appliance is to be loaded with the test fuel charge when the coal bed weight is between 10 percent and 20 percent of the test fuel charge weight. Coals may be raked as necessary to level the coal bed but may only be raked and stirred
once between 15 to 20 minutes prior to the addition of the test fuel charge.
12.4.1.4 Storage. The Category III and IV test runs may be done either with or without the thermal storage. If thermal storage is used, the initial temperature of the storage must be 125 °F or greater at the start of the test. The storage may be heated during the pre-test burn cycle or it may be heated by external means. If thermal storage is used, prior to the start of the test run, the storage tank destratification pump, shown in Figure 1, shall be operated until the total volume pumped exceeds 1.5 times the tank volume and the difference between the temperature at the top and bottom of the storage tank (TS
1
and TS
2
) is less than 1 °F. These two temperatures shall then be recorded to determine the starting average tank temperature. The total volume pumped may be based on the nominal flow rate of the destratification pump (See section 9.6). If the Category III and IV runs are done with storage, it is recognized that during the last hour of the pre-burn cycle the storage tank must be mixed to achieve a uniform starting temperature and cannot receive heat from the boiler/heater during this time. During this time period, the boiler/heater might cycle or go into a steady reduced output mode. (Note—this would happen, for example, in a Category IV run if the actual maximum output of the boiler/heater exceed the manufacturer's rated output.) A second storage tank may be used temporarily to enable the boiler/heater to operate during this last hour of the pre-burn period as it will during the test period. The temperature of this second storage tank is not used in the calculations but the return water to the boiler/heater (after mixing device if used) must be 125 °F or greater.
12.4.2 Startup Procedure for Category I and II Test Runs, “Cold-to-Cold.”
12.4.2.1 Initial Temperatures. This test shall be started with both the boiler/heater and the storage at a minimum temperature of 125 °F. The boiler/heater maximum temperature at the start of this test shall be 135 °F. The boiler/heater and storage may be heated through a pre-burn or it may be heated by external means.
12.4.2.2 Firebox Condition at Test Start. Prior to the start of this test remove all ash and charcoal from the combustion chamber(s). The loading of the test fuel and kindling should follow the manufacturer's recommendations, subject to the following constraints: Up to 10 percent kindling and paper may be used which is in addition to the fuel load. Further, up to 10 percent of the fuel load (
i.e.,
included in the 10 lb/ft
3
) may be smaller than the main fuel. This startup fuel shall still be larger than 2 inches.
12.4.2.3 Storage. The Category I and II test runs shall be done with thermal storage. The initial temperature of the storage must be 125 °F or greater at the start of the test. The storage may be heated during the pre-test burn cycle or it may be heated by external means. Prior to the start of the test run, the storage tank destratification pump, shown in Figure 1, shall be operated until the total volume pumped exceeds 1.5 times the tank volume and the difference between the temperature at the top and bottom of the storage tank (TS
1
and TS
2
) is less than 1 °F. These two temperatures shall then be recorded to determine the starting average tank temperature. The total volume pumped may be based on the nominal flow rate of the destratification pump (See section 9.6).
12.5 Test Runs. For all test runs, the return water temperature to the hydronic heater must be equal to or greater than 120 °F (this is lower than the initial tank temperature to allow for any pipeline losses). Where the storage system is used, flow of water from the boiler/heater shall be divided between the storage tank and the heat exchanger such that the temperature change of the circulating water across the heat exchanger shall be 30 ±5 °F, averaged over the entire test run. This is typically adjusted using the system valves.
Complete a test run in each heat output rate category, as follows:
12.5.1 Test Run Start. For Category III and IV runs: Once the appliance is operating normally and the pretest coal bed weight has reached the target value per section 12.4.1, tare the scale and load the full test charge into the appliance. Time for loading shall not exceed 5 minutes. The actual weight of the test fuel charge shall be measured and recorded within 30 minutes prior to loading. Start all sampling systems.
For Category I and II runs: Once the appliance has reached the starting temperature, tare the scale and load the full test charge, including kindling into the appliance. The actual weight of the test fuel charge shall be measured and recorded within 30 minutes prior to loading. Light the fire following the manufacturer's written normal startup procedure. Start all sampling systems.
12.5.1.1 Record all water temperatures, differential water temperatures and water flow rates at time intervals of one minute or less.
12.5.1.2 Record particulate emissions data per the requirements of EPA Method 28WHH and the standards referenced therein.
12.5.1.3 Record data needed to determine overall efficiency (SLM) per the requirements of CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17) clauses 6.2.1, 6.2.2, 6.3, 8.5.7, 10.4.3(a), 10.4.3(f), and 13.7.9.3
12.5.1.3.1 Measure and record the test room air temperature in accordance with the requirements of CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clauses 6.2.1, 8.5.7 and 10.4.3(g).
12.5.1.3.2 Measure and record the flue gas temperature in accordance with the requirements of CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clauses 6.2.2, 8.5.7 and 10.4.3(f).
12.5.1.3.3 Determine and record the carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO
2
) concentrations in the flue gas in accordance with CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clauses 6.3, 8.5.7 and 10.4.3(i) and (j).
12.5.1.3.4 Measure and record the test fuel weight per the requirements of CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clauses 8.5.7 and 10.4.3(h).
12.5.1.3.5 Record the test run time per the requirements of CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clause 10.4.3(a).
12.5.1.3.6 Record and document all settings and adjustments, if any, made to the boiler/heater as recommended/required by manufacturer's instruction manual for different combustion conditions or heat loads. These may include temperature setpoints, under and over-fire air adjustment, or other adjustments that could be made by an operator to optimize or alter combustion. All such settings shall be included in the report for each test run.
12.5.1.4 Monitor the average heat output rate on the load side of the heat exchanger based on water temperatures and flow. If the heat output rate over a 10 minute averaging period gets close to the upper or lower limit of the target range (±5 percent), adjust the water flow through the heat exchanger to compensate. Make changes as infrequently as possible while maintaining the target heat output rate. The first test run shall be conducted at the Category IV heat output rate to validate that the appliance is capable of producing the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity.
12.5.2 Test Fuel Charge Adjustment. It is acceptable to adjust the test fuel charge (
i.e.,
reposition) once during a test run if more than 60 percent of the initial test fuel charge weight has been consumed and more than 10 minutes have elapsed without a measurable (1 lb or 0.5 kg) weight change while the operating control is in the demand mode. The time used to make this adjustment shall be less than 60 seconds.
12.5.3 Test Run Completion. For the Category III and IV, “hot-to-hot” test runs, the test run is completed when the remaining weight of the test fuel charge is 0.0 lb (0.0 kg). (
W
FuelBurned
=
W
fuel
) End the test run when the scale has indicated a test fuel charge weight of 0.0 lb (0.0 kg) or less for 30 seconds.
For the Category I and II “cold-to-cold” test runs, the test run is completed; and the end of a test is defined at the first occurrence of any one of the following:
(a) The remaining weight of the test fuel charge is less than 1 percent of the total test fuel weight (
W
FuelBurned
0.99 ·
W
fuel
);
(b) The automatic control system on the boiler/heater switches to an off mode. In this case, the boiler/heater fan (if used) is typically stopped and all air flow dampers are closed by the control system. Note that this off mode cannot be an “overheat” or emergency shutdown which typically requires a manual reset; or
(c) If the boiler/heater does not have an automatic off mode: After 90 percent of the fuel load has been consumed and the scale has indicated a rate of change of the test fuel charge of less than 1.0 lb/hr for a period of 10 minutes or longer. Note—this is not considered “stopped fuel combustion,” See section 12.5.6.1.
12.5.3.1 At the end of the test run, stop the particulate sampling train and overall efficiency (SLM) measurements, and record the run time, and all final measurement values.
12.5.3.2 At the end of the test run, continue to operate the storage tank destratification pump until the total volume pumped exceeds 1.5 times the tank volume. The maximum average of the top and bottom temperatures measured after this time may be taken as the average tank temperature at the end of the tests (TFSavg, See section 13.1). The total volume pumped may be based on the nominal flow rate of the destratification pump (See section 9.6).
12.5.3.3 For the Category I and II test runs, there is a need to determine the energy content of the unburned fuel remaining in the chamber if the remaining mass in the chamber is greater than 1 percent of the test fuel weight. Following the completion of the test, as soon as safely practical, this remaining fuel is removed from the chamber, separated from the remaining ash and weighed. This separation could be implemented with a slotted “scoop” or similar tool. A
1/4
inch opening size in the separation tool shall be used to separate the ash and charcoal. This separated char is assigned a heating value of 12,500 Btu/lb.
12.5.4 Heat Output Capacity Validation. The first test run must produce a heat output rate that is within 10 percent of the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity (Category IV) throughout the test run and an average heat output rate within 5 percent of the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity. If the appliance is not capable of producing a heat output within these limits, the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity is considered not validated and testing is to be terminated. In such cases, the tests may be restarted using a lower heat output capacity if requested by the manufacturer. Alternatively, during the Category IV run, if the rated output cannot be maintained for a 15 minute interval, the manufacturer may elect to reduce the rated output to match the test and complete the Category IV run on this basis. The target outputs for Categories I, II, and III shall then be recalculated based on this change in rated output capacity.
12.5.5 Additional Test Runs. Using the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity
as a basis, conduct a test for additional heat output categories as specified in section 4.3. It is not required to run these tests in any particular order.
12.5.6 Alternative Heat Output Rate for Category I. If an appliance cannot be operated in the Category I heat output range due to stopped combustion, two test runs shall be conducted at heat output rates within Category II. When this is the case, the weightings for the weighted averages indicated in section 14.1.15 shall be the average of the Category I and II weighting's and shall be applied to both Category II results. Appliances that are not capable of operation within Category II (
25 percent of maximum) cannot be evaluated by this test method.
12.5.6.1 Stopped Fuel Combustion. Evidence that an appliance cannot be operated at a Category I heat output rate due to stopped fuel combustion shall include documentation of two or more attempts to operate the appliance in heat output rate Category I and fuel combustion has stopped prior to complete consumption of the test fuel charge. Stopped fuel combustion is evidenced when an elapsed time of 60 minutes or more has occurred without a measurable (1 lb or 0.5 kg) weight change in the test fuel charge while the appliance operating control is in the demand mode. Report the evidence and the reasoning used to determine that a test in heat output rate Category I cannot be achieved. For example, two unsuccessful attempts to operate at an output rate of 10 percent of the rated output capacity are not sufficient evidence that heat output rate Category I cannot be achieved.
12.5.7 Appliance Overheating. Appliances with their associated thermal storage shall be capable of operating in all heat output categories without overheating to be rated by this test method. Appliance overheating occurs when the rate of heat withdrawal from the appliance is lower than the rate of heat production when the unit control is in the idle mode. This condition results in the water in the appliance continuing to increase in temperature well above the upper limit setting of the operating control. Evidence of overheating includes: 1 hour or more of appliance water temperature increase above the upper temperature set-point of the operating control, exceeding the temperature limit of a safety control device (independent from the operating control—typically requires manual reset), boiling water in a non-pressurized system or activation of a pressure or temperature relief valve in a pressurized system.
12.5.8 Option to Eliminate Tests in Category II and III. Following successful completion of a test run in Category I, the manufacturer may eliminate the Category II and III tests. For the purpose of calculating the annual averages for particulates and efficiency, the values obtained in the Category I run shall be assumed to apply also to Category II and Category III. It is envisioned that this option would be applicable to systems which have sufficient thermal storage such that the fuel load in the Category I test can be completely consumed without the system reaching its upper operating temperature limit. In this case, the boiler/heater would likely be operating at maximum thermal output during the entire test and this output rate may be higher than the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity. The Category II and III runs would then be the same as the Category I run. It may be assumed that the particulate emission values and efficiency values determined in the startup, steady-state, and end phases of Category I are applicable in Categories II and III, for the purpose of determining the annual averages in lb/mmBtu and g/MJ (See section 13). For the annual average in g/hr, the length of time for stored heat to be drawn from thermal storage shall be determined for the test load requirements of the respective category.
12.5.9 Modification to Measurement Procedure in EPA Method 28WHH to Determine Emissions Separately During the Startup, Steady-State and End Phases. With one of the two particulate sampling trains used, filter changes shall be made at the end of the startup phase and the steady-state phase (See section 3.0). This shall be done to determine the particulate emission rate and particulate emission index for the startup, steady-state, and end phases individually. For this one train, the particulates measured during each of these three phases shall be added together to also determine the particulate emissions for the whole run.
12.5.10 Modification to Measurement Procedure in EPA Method 28WHH and the Standards Referenced therein on Averaging Period for Determination of Efficiency by the Stack Loss Method. The methods currently defined in Method 28WHH allow averaging over 10-minute time periods for flue gas temperature, flue gas CO
2
, and flue gas CO for the determination of the efficiency with the stack loss method. However, under some cycling conditions the “on” period may be short relative to this 10-minute period. For this reason, during cycling operation the averaging period for these parameters may not be longer than the burner on period divided by 10. The averaging period need not be shorter than one minute. During the off period, under cycling operation, averaging periods as specified in EPA Method 28WHH and the standards referenced therein, may be used. Where short averaging times are used, however, the averaging period for fuel consumption may still be at 10 minutes. This average wood consumption rate shall be applied to all of the smaller time intervals included.
12.6 Additional Test Runs. The testing laboratory may conduct more than one test run in each of the heat output categories specified in section 4.3. If more than one test run is conducted at a specified heat output rate, the results from at least two-thirds of the test runs in that heat output rate category shall be used in calculating the weighted average emission rate. The measurement data and results of all test runs shall be reported regardless of which values are used in calculating the weighted average emission rate.

SLM
—Overall Efficiency, also known as Stack Loss Efficiency, using stack loss method (SLM).
For determination of the average overall thermal efficiency (η
SLM
) for the test run, use the data collected over the full test run and the calculations in accordance with CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clause 13.7 except for 13.7.2(e), (f), (g), and (h), use the following average fuel properties for oak: %C = 50.0, %H = 6.6, %O = 43.2, %Ash = 0.2.
13.6.5.1 Whenever the CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17) overall efficiency is found to be lower than the overall efficiency based on load side measurements, as determined by Eq. 22 of this method, section 14.1.7 of the test report must include a discussion of the reasons for this result. For a test where the CSA B415.1-10 overall efficiency SLM is less than 2 percentage points lower than the overall efficiency based on load side measurements, the efficiency based on load side measurements shall be considered invalid. [Note on the rationale for the 2 percentage points limit. The SLM method does not include boiler/heater jacket losses and, for this reason, should provide an efficiency which is actually higher than the efficiency based on the energy input and output measurements or “delivered efficiency.” A delivered efficiency that is higher than the efficiency based on the SLM could be considered suspect. A delivered efficiency greater than 2 percentage points higher than the efficiency based on the SLM, then, clearly indicates a measurement error.]

emission for the test run, CO

.
13.7 Weighted Average Emissions and Efficiency.
13.7.1 Determine the weighted average emission rate and delivered efficiency from the individual tests in the specified heat output categories. The weighting factors (F
i
) are derived from an analysis of ASHRAE bin data which provides details of normal building heating requirements in terms of percent of design capacity and time in a particular capacity range—or “bin”—over the course of a heating season. The values used in this method represent an average of data from several cities located in the northern United States.
ER16MR15.016
If, as discussed in section 12.5.8, the option to eliminate tests in Category II and III is elected, the values of efficiency and particulate emission rate as measured in Category I, shall be assigned also to Category II and III for the purpose of determining the annual averages.

# 15.0 Precision and Bias
15.1 Precision—It is not possible to specify the precision of the procedure in this test method because the appliance operation and
fueling protocols and the appliances themselves produce variable amounts of emissions and cannot be used to determine reproducibility or repeatability of this test method.
15.2 Bias—No definitive information can be presented on the bias of the procedure in this test method for measuring solid fuel burning hydronic heater emissions because no material having an accepted reference value is available.

1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable to the determination of metals emissions from stationary sources. This method may be used to determine particulate emissions in addition to the metals emissions if the prescribed procedures and precautions are followed.
1.2.1 Hg emissions can be measured, alternatively, using EPA Method 101A of Appendix B, 40 CFR Part 61. Method 101-A measures only Hg but it can be of special interest to sources which need to measure both Hg and Mn emissions.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 Principle. A stack sample is withdrawn isokinetically from the source, particulate emissions are collected in the probe and on a heated filter, and gaseous emissions are then collected in an aqueous acidic solution of hydrogen peroxide (analyzed for all metals including Hg) and an aqueous acidic solution of potassium permanganate (analyzed only for Hg). The recovered samples are digested, and appropriate fractions are analyzed for Hg by cold vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy
(CVAAS) and for Sb, As, Ba, Be, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Pb, Mn, Ni, P, Se, Ag, Tl, and Zn by inductively coupled argon plasma emission spectroscopy (ICAP) or atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS) is used for analysis of Sb, As, Cd, Co, Pb, Se, and Tl if these elements require greater analytical sensitivity than can be obtained by ICAP. If one so chooses, AAS may be used for analysis of all listed metals if the resulting in-stack method detection limits meet the goal of the testing program. Similarly, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) may be used for analysis of Sb, As, Ba, Be, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Pb, Mn, Ni, Ag, Tl and Zn.

# 3.0 Definitions
[Reserved]

# 4.0 Interferences
4.1 Iron (Fe) can be a spectral interference during the analysis of As, Cr, and Cd by ICAP. Aluminum (Al) can be a spectral interference during the analysis of As and Pb by ICAP. Generally, these interferences can be reduced by diluting the analytical sample, but such dilution raises the in-stack detection limits. Background and overlap corrections may be used to adjust for spectral interferences. Refer to Method 6010 of Reference 2 in section 16.0 or the other analytical methods used for details on potential interferences to this method. For all GFAAS analyses, use matrix modifiers to limit interferences, and matrix match all standards.

# 5.0 Safety
5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and to determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.
5.2 Corrosive Reagents. The following reagents are hazardous. Personal protective equipment and safe procedures are useful in preventing chemical splashes. If contact occurs, immediately flush with copious amounts of water at least 15 minutes. Remove clothing under shower and decontaminate. Treat residual chemical burn as thermal burn.
5.2.1 Nitric Acid (HNO
3
). Highly corrosive to eyes, skin, nose, and lungs. Vapors cause bronchitis, pneumonia, or edema of lungs. Reaction to inhalation may be delayed as long as 30 hours and still be fatal. Provide ventilation to limit exposure. Strong oxidizer. Hazardous reaction may occur with organic materials such as solvents.
5.2.2 Sulfuric Acid (H
2
SO
4
). Rapidly destructive to body tissue. Will cause third degree burns. Eye damage may result in blindness. Inhalation may be fatal from spasm of the larynx, usually within 30 minutes. May cause lung tissue damage with edema. 1 mg/m
3
for 8 hours will cause lung damage or, in higher concentrations, death. Provide ventilation to limit inhalation. Reacts violently with metals and organics.
5.2.3 Hydrochloric Acid (HC1). Highly corrosive liquid with toxic vapors. Vapors are highly irritating to eyes, skin, nose, and lungs, causing severe damage. May cause bronchitis, pneumonia, or edema of lungs. Exposure to concentrations of 0.13 to 0.2 percent can be lethal to humans in a few minutes. Provide ventilation to limit exposure. Reacts with metals, producing hydrogen gas.
5.2.4 Hydrofluoric Acid (HF). Highly corrosive to eyes, skin, nose, throat, and lungs. Reaction to exposure may be delayed by 24 hours or more. Provide ventilation to limit exposure.
5.2.5 Hydrogen Peroxide (H
2
O
2
). Irritating to eyes, skin, nose, and lungs. 30% H
2
O
2
is a strong oxidizing agent. Avoid contact with skin, eyes, and combustible material. Wear gloves when handling.
5.2.6 Potassium Permanganate (KMnO
4
). Caustic, strong oxidizer. Avoid bodily contact with.
5.2.7 Potassium Persulfate. Strong oxidizer. Avoid bodily contact with. Keep containers well closed and in a cool place.
5.3 Reaction Pressure. Due to the potential reaction of the potassium permanganate with the acid, there could be pressure buildup in the acidic KMnO
4
absorbing solution storage bottle. Therefore these bottles shall not be fully filled and shall be vented to relieve excess pressure and prevent explosion potentials. Venting is required, but not in a manner that will allow contamination of the solution. A No. 70-72 hole drilled in the container cap and Teflon liner has been used.

Same as Method 5, sections 6.1.1.1 and 6.1.1.2, except that glass nozzles are required unless alternate tips are constructed of materials that are free from contamination and will not interfere with the sample. If a probe tip other than glass is used, no correction to the sample test results to compensate for the nozzle's effect on the sample is allowed. Probe fittings of plastic such as Teflon, polypropylene, etc. are recommended instead of metal fittings to prevent contamination. If one chooses to do so, a single glass piece consisting of a combined probe tip and probe liner may be used.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage
8.1 Sampling. The complexity of this method is such that, to obtain reliable results, both testers and analysts must be trained and experienced with the test procedures, including source sampling; reagent preparation and handling; sample handling; safety equipment and procedures; analytical calculations; reporting; and the specific procedural descriptions throughout this method.
8.1.1 Pretest Preparation. Follow the same general procedure given in Method 5, section 8.1, except that, unless particulate emissions are to be determined, the filter need not be desiccated or weighed. First, rinse all sampling train glassware with hot tap water and then wash in hot soapy water. Next, rinse glassware three times with tap water, followed by three additional rinses with water. Then soak all glassware in a 10 percent (V/V) nitric acid solution for a minimum of 4
hours, rinse three times with water, rinse a final time with acetone, and allow to air dry. Cover all glassware openings where contamination can occur until the sampling train is assembled for sampling.
8.1.2 Preliminary Determinations. Same as Method 5, section 8.1.2.
8.1.3 Preparation of Sampling Train.
8.1.3.1 Set up the sampling train as shown in Figure 29-1. Follow the same general procedures given in Method 5, section 8.3, except place 100 ml of the HNO
3
/H
2
O

solution (Section 7.3.1 of this method) in each of the second and third impingers as shown in Figure 29-1. Place 100 ml of the acidic KMnO
4
absorbing solution (Section 7.3.2 of this method) in each of the fifth and sixth impingers as shown in Figure 29-1, and transfer approximately 200 to 300 g of pre-weighed silica gel from its container to the last impinger. Alternatively, the silica gel may be weighed directly in the impinger just prior to final train assembly.
8.1.3.2 Based on the specific source sampling conditions, the use of an empty first impinger can be eliminated if the moisture to be collected in the impingers will be less than approximately 100 ml.
8.1.3.3 If Hg analysis will not be performed, the fourth, fifth, and sixth impingers as shown in Figure 29-1 are not required.
8.1.3.4 To insure leak-free sampling train connections and to prevent possible sample contamination problems, use Teflon tape or other non-contaminating material instead of silicone grease.
Precaution:
Exercise extreme care to prevent contamination within the train. Prevent the acidic KMnO
4
from contacting any glassware that contains sample material to be analyzed for Mn. Prevent acidic H
2
O
2
from mixing with the acidic KMnO
4
.
8.1.4 Leak-Check Procedures. Follow the leak-check procedures given in Method 5, section 8.4.2 (Pretest Leak-Check), section 8.4.3 (Leak-Checks During the Sample Run), and section 8.4.4 (Post-Test Leak-Checks).
8.1.5 Sampling Train Operation. Follow the procedures given in Method 5, section 8.5. When sampling for Hg, use a procedure analogous to that described in section 8.1 of Method 101A, 40 CFR Part 61, Appendix B, if necessary to maintain the desired color in the last acidified permanganate impinger. For each run, record the data required on a data sheet such as the one shown in Figure 5-3 of Method 5.
8.1.6 Calculation of Percent Isokinetic. Same as Method 5, section 12.11.
8.2 Sample Recovery.
8.2.1 Begin cleanup procedures as soon as the probe is removed from the stack at the end of a sampling period. The probe should be allowed to cool prior to sample recovery. When it can be safely handled, wipe off all external particulate matter near the tip of the probe nozzle and place a rinsed, non-contaminating cap over the probe nozzle to prevent losing or gaining particulate matter. Do not cap the probe tip tightly while the sampling train is cooling; a vacuum can form in the filter holder with the undesired result of drawing liquid from the impingers onto the filter.
8.2.2 Before moving the sampling train to the cleanup site, remove the probe from the sampling train and cap the open outlet. Be careful not to lose any condensate that might be present. Cap the filter inlet where the probe was fastened. Remove the umbilical cord from the last impinger and cap the impinger. Cap the filter holder outlet and impinger inlet. Use non-contaminating caps, whether ground-glass stoppers, plastic caps, serum caps, or Teflon ® tape to close these openings.
8.2.3 Alternatively, the following procedure may be used to disassemble the train before the probe and filter holder/oven are completely cooled: Initially disconnect the filter holder outlet/impinger inlet and loosely cap the open ends. Then disconnect the probe from the filter holder or cyclone inlet and loosely cap the open ends. Cap the probe tip and remove the umbilical cord as previously described.
8.2.4 Transfer the probe and filter-impinger assembly to a cleanup area that is clean and protected from the wind and other potential causes of contamination or loss of sample. Inspect the train before and during disassembly and note any abnormal conditions. Take special precautions to assure that all the items necessary for recovery do not contaminate the samples. The sample is recovered and treated as follows (see schematic in Figures 29-2a and 29-2b):
8.2.5 Container No. 1 (Sample Filter). Carefully remove the filter from the filter holder and place it in its labeled petri dish container. To handle the filter, use either acid-washed polypropylene or Teflon coated tweezers or clean, disposable surgical gloves rinsed with water and dried. If it is necessary to fold the filter, make certain the particulate cake is inside the fold. Carefully transfer the filter and any particulate matter or filter fibers that adhere to the filter holder gasket to the petri dish by using a dry (acid-cleaned) nylon bristle brush. Do not use any metal-containing materials when recovering this train. Seal the labeled petri dish.
8.2.6 Container No. 2 (Acetone Rinse). Perform this procedure only if a determination of particulate emissions is to be made. Quantitatively recover particulate matter and any condensate from the probe nozzle, probe fitting, probe liner, and front half of the filter holder by washing these components with a total of 100 ml of acetone, while simultaneously taking great care to see that no dust on the outside of the probe or other surfaces gets in the sample. The use of exactly 100 ml
is necessary for the subsequent blank correction procedures. Distilled water may be used instead of acetone when approved by the Administrator and shall be used when specified by the Administrator; in these cases, save a water blank and follow the Administrator's directions on analysis.
8.2.6.1 Carefully remove the probe nozzle, and clean the inside surface by rinsing with acetone from a wash bottle while brushing with a non-metallic brush. Brush until the acetone rinse shows no visible particles, then make a final rinse of the inside surface with acetone.
8.2.6.2 Brush and rinse the sample exposed inside parts of the probe fitting with acetone in a similar way until no visible particles remain. Rinse the probe liner with acetone by tilting and rotating the probe while squirting acetone into its upper end so that all inside surfaces will be wetted with acetone. Allow the acetone to drain from the lower end into the sample container. A funnel may be used to aid in transferring liquid washings to the container. Follow the acetone rinse with a non-metallic probe brush. Hold the probe in an inclined position, squirt acetone into the upper end as the probe brush is being pushed with a twisting action three times through the probe. Hold a sample container underneath the lower end of the probe, and catch any acetone and particulate matter which is brushed through the probe until no visible particulate matter is carried out with the acetone or until none remains in the probe liner on visual inspection. Rinse the brush with acetone, and quantitatively collect these washings in the sample container. After the brushing, make a final acetone rinse of the probe as described above.
8.2.6.3 It is recommended that two people clean the probe to minimize sample losses. Between sampling runs, keep brushes clean and protected from contamination. Clean the inside of the front-half of the filter holder by rubbing the surfaces with a non-metallic brush and rinsing with acetone. Rinse each surface three times or more if needed to remove visible particulate. Make a final rinse of the brush and filter holder. After all acetone washings and particulate matter have been collected in the sample container, tighten the lid so that acetone will not leak out when shipped to the laboratory. Mark the height of the fluid level to determine whether or not leakage occurred during transport. Clearly label the container to identify its contents.
8.2.7 Container No. 3 (Probe Rinse). Keep the probe assembly clean and free from contamination during the probe rinse. Rinse the probe nozzle and fitting, probe liner, and front-half of the filter holder thoroughly with a total of 100 ml of 0.1 N HNO
3
, and place the wash into a sample storage container. Perform the rinses as applicable and generally as described in Method 12, section 8.7.1. Record the volume of the rinses. Mark the height of the fluid level on the outside of the storage container and use this mark to determine if leakage occurs during transport. Seal the container, and clearly label the contents. Finally, rinse the nozzle, probe liner, and front-half of the filter holder with water followed by acetone, and discard these rinses.

# Note:
The use of a total of exactly 100 ml is necessary for the subsequent blank correction procedures.
8.2.8 Container No. 4 (Impingers 1 through 3, Moisture Knockout Impinger, when used, HNO

Impingers Contents and Rinses). Due to the potentially large quantity of liquid involved, the tester may place the impinger solutions from impingers 1 through 3 in more than one container, if necessary. Measure the liquid in the first three impingers to within 0.5 ml using a graduated cylinder. Record the volume. This information is required to calculate the moisture content of the sampled flue gas. Clean each of the first three impingers, the filter support, the back half of the filter housing, and connecting glassware by thoroughly rinsing with 100 ml of 0.1 N HNO
3
using the procedure as applicable in Method 12, section 8.7.3.

# Note:
The use of exactly 100 ml of 0.1 N HNO
3
rinse is necessary for the subsequent blank correction procedures. Combine the rinses and impinger solutions, measure and record the final total volume. Mark the height of the fluid level, seal the container, and clearly label the contents.
8.2.9 Container Nos. 5A (0.1 N HNO

absorbing solution), and 5C (8 N HCl rinse and dilution).
8.2.9.1 When sampling for Hg, pour all the liquid from the impinger (normally impinger No. 4) that immediately preceded the two permanganate impingers into a graduated cylinder and measure the volume to within 0.5 ml. This information is required to calculate the moisture content of the sampled flue gas. Place the liquid in Container No. 5A. Rinse the impinger with exactly 100 ml of 0.1 N HNO
3
and place this rinse in Container No. 5A.
8.2.9.2 Pour all the liquid from the two permanganate impingers into a graduated cylinder and measure the volume to within 0.5 ml. This information is required to calculate the moisture content of the sampled flue gas. Place this acidic KMnO
4
solution into Container No. 5B. Using a total of exactly 100 ml of fresh acidified KMnO
4
solution for all rinses (approximately 33 ml per rinse), rinse the two permanganate impingers and connecting glassware a minimum of three times. Pour the rinses into Container No. 5B, carefully assuring transfer of all loose precipitated materials from the two impingers. Similarly, using 100 ml total of water, rinse the permanganate impingers and connecting
glass a minimum of three times, and pour the rinses into Container 5B, carefully assuring transfer of any loose precipitated material. Mark the height of the fluid level, and clearly label the contents. Read the
Precaution:
in section 7.3.2.

# Note:
Due to the potential reaction of KMnO
4
with acid, pressure buildup can occur in the sample storage bottles. Do not fill these bottles completely and take precautions to relieve excess pressure. A No. 70-72 hole drilled in the container cap and Teflon liner has been used successfully.
8.2.9.3 Wash the two permanganate impingers with 25 ml of 8 N HCl, and place the wash in a separate sample container labeled No. 5C containing 200 ml of water. First, place 200 ml of water in the container. Then wash the impinger walls and stem with the 8 N HCl by turning the impinger on its side and rotating it so that the HCl contacts all inside surfaces. Use a total of only 25 ml of 8 N HCl for rinsing
both permanganate impingers combined.
Rinse the first impinger, then pour the actual rinse used for the first impinger into the second impinger for its rinse. Finally, pour the 25 ml of 8 N HCl rinse carefully into the container with the 200 ml of water. Mark the height of the fluid level on the outside of the container in order to determine if leakage occurs during transport.
8.2.10 Container No. 6 (Silica Gel). Note the color of the indicating silica gel to determine whether it has been completely spent and make a notation of its condition. Transfer the silica gel from its impinger to its original container and seal it. The tester may use a funnel to pour the silica gel and a rubber policeman to remove the silica gel from the impinger. The small amount of particles that might adhere to the impinger wall need not be removed. Do not use water or other liquids to transfer the silica gel since weight gained in the silica gel impinger is used for moisture calculations. Alternatively, if a balance is available in the field, record the weight of the spent silica gel (or silica gel plus impinger) to the nearest 0.5 g.
8.2.11 Container No. 7 (Acetone Blank). If particulate emissions are to be determined, at least once during each field test, place a 100-ml portion of the acetone used in the sample recovery process into a container labeled No. 7. Seal the container.
8.2.12 Container No. 8A (0.1 N HNO
3
Blank). At least once during each field test, place 300 ml of the 0.1 N HNO
3
solution used in the sample recovery process into a container labeled No. 8A. Seal the container.
8.2.13 Container No. 8B (Water Blank). At least once during each field test, place 100 ml of the water used in the sample recovery process into a container labeled No. 8B. Seal the container.
8.2.14 Container No. 9 (5 Percent HNO

Blank). At least once during each field test, place 100 ml of the acidified KMnO
4
solution used as the impinger solution and in the sample recovery process into a container labeled No. 10. Prepare the container as described in section 8.2.9.2. Read the
Precaution
: in section 7.3.2 and read the note in section 8.2.9.2.
8.2.16 Container No. 11 (8 N HCl Blank). At least once during each field test, place 200 ml of water into a sample container labeled No. 11. Then carefully add with stirring 25 ml of 8 N HCl. Mix well and seal the container.
8.2.17 Container No. 12 (Sample Filter Blank). Once during each field test, place into a petri dish labeled No. 12 three unused blank filters from the same lot as the sampling filters. Seal the petri dish.
8.3 Sample Preparation. Note the level of the liquid in each of the containers and determine if any sample was lost during shipment. If a noticeable amount of leakage has occurred, either void the sample or use methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to correct the final results. A diagram illustrating sample preparation and analysis procedures for each of the sample train components is shown in Figure 29-3.
8.3.1 Container No. 1 (Sample Filter).
8.3.1.1 If particulate emissions are being determined, first desiccate the filter and filter catch without added heat (do not heat the filters to speed the drying) and weigh to a constant weight as described in section 11.2.1 of Method 5.
8.3.1.2 Following this procedure, or initially, if particulate emissions are not being determined in addition to metals analysis, divide the filter with its filter catch into portions containing approximately 0.5 g each. Place the pieces in the analyst's choice of either individual microwave pressure relief vessels or Parr Bombs. Add 6 ml of concentrated HNO
3
and 4 ml of concentrated HF to each vessel. For microwave heating, microwave the samples for approximately 12 to 15 minutes total heating time as follows: heat for 2 to 3 minutes, then turn off the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes, then heat for 2 to 3 minutes, etc., continue this alternation until the 12 to 15 minutes total heating time are completed (this procedure should comprise approximately 24 to 30 minutes at 600 watts). Microwave heating times are approximate and are dependent upon the number of samples being digested simultaneously. Sufficient heating is evidenced by sorbent reflux within the vessel. For conventional heating, heat the Parr Bombs at 140 °C (285 °F) for 6 hours. Then cool the samples to
room temperature, and combine with the acid digested probe rinse as required in section 8.3.3.
8.3.1.3 If the sampling train includes an optional glass cyclone in front of the filter, prepare and digest the cyclone catch by the procedures described in section 8.3.1.2 and then combine the digestate with the digested filter sample.
8.3.2 Container No. 2 (Acetone Rinse). Note the level of liquid in the container and confirm on the analysis sheet whether or not leakage occurred during transport. If a noticeable amount of leakage has occurred, either void the sample or use methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to correct the final results. Measure the liquid in this container either volumetrically within 1 ml or gravimetrically within 0.5 g. Transfer the contents to an acid-cleaned, tared 250-ml beaker and evaporate to dryness at ambient temperature and pressure. If particulate emissions are being determined, desiccate for 24 hours without added heat, weigh to a constant weight according to the procedures described in section 11.2.1 of Method 5, and report the results to the nearest 0.1 mg. Redissolve the residue with 10 ml of concentrated HNO
3
. Quantitatively combine the resultant sample, including all liquid and any particulate matter, with Container No. 3 before beginning section 8.3.3.
8.3.3 Container No. 3 (Probe Rinse). Verify that the pH of this sample is 2 or lower. If it is not, acidify the sample by careful addition with stirring of concentrated HNO
3
to pH 2. Use water to rinse the sample into a beaker, and cover the beaker with a ribbed watch glass. Reduce the sample volume to approximately 20 ml by heating on a hot plate at a temperature just below boiling. Digest the sample in microwave vessels or Parr Bombs by quantitatively transferring the sample to the vessel or bomb, carefully adding the 6 ml of concentrated HNO
3
, 4 ml of concentrated HF, and then continuing to follow the procedures described in section 8.3.1.2. Then combine the resultant sample directly with the acid digested portions of the filter prepared previously in section 8.3.1.2. The resultant combined sample is referred to as
“Sample Fraction 1”.
Filter the combined sample using Whatman 541 filter paper. Dilute to 300 ml (or the appropriate volume for the expected metals concentration) with water. This diluted sample is
“Analytical Fraction 1”.
Measure and record the volume of Analytical Fraction 1 to within 0.1 ml. Quantitatively remove a 50-ml aliquot and label as
“Analytical Fraction 1B”.
Label the remaining 250-ml portion as
“Analytical Fraction 1A”.
Analytical Fraction 1A is used for ICAP or AAS analysis for all desired metals except Hg. Analytical Fraction 1B is used for the determination of front-half Hg.
8.3.4 Container No. 4 (Impingers 1-3). Measure and record the total volume of this sample to within 0.5 ml and label it
“Sample Fraction 2”.
Remove a 75- to 100-ml aliquot for Hg analysis and label the aliquot
“Analytical Fraction 2B”.
Label the remaining portion of Container No. 4 as
“Sample Fraction 2A”.
Sample Fraction 2A defines the volume of Analytical Fraction 2A
prior
to digestion. All of Sample Fraction 2A is digested to produce
“Analytical Fraction 2A”.
Analytical Fraction 2A defines the volume of Sample Fraction 2A
after
its digestion and the volume of Analytical Fraction 2A is normally 150 ml. Analytical Fraction 2A is analyzed for all metals except Hg. Verify that the pH of Sample Fraction 2A is 2 or lower. If necessary, use concentrated HNO
3
by careful addition and stirring to lower Sample Fraction 2A to pH 2. Use water to rinse Sample Fraction 2A into a beaker and then cover the beaker with a ribbed watchglass. Reduce Sample Fraction 2A to approximately 20 ml by heating on a hot plate at a temperature just below boiling. Then follow either of the digestion procedures described in sections 8.3.4.1 or 8.3.4.2.
8.3.4.1 Conventional Digestion Procedure. Add 30 ml of 50 percent HNO
3
, and heat for 30 minutes on a hot plate to just below boiling. Add 10 ml of 3 percent H
2
O
2
and heat for 10 more minutes. Add 50 ml of hot water, and heat the sample for an additional 20 minutes. Cool, filter the sample, and dilute to 150 ml (or the appropriate volume for the expected metals concentrations) with water. This dilution produces Analytical Fraction 2A. Measure and record the volume to within 0.1 ml.
8.3.4.2 Microwave Digestion Procedure. Add 10 ml of 50 percent HNO
3
and heat for 6 minutes total
heating
time in alternations of 1 to 2 minutes at 600 Watts followed by 1 to 2 minutes with no power, etc., similar to the procedure described in section 8.3.1. Allow the sample to cool. Add 10 ml of 3 percent H
2
O
2
and heat for 2 more minutes. Add 50 ml of hot water, and heat for an additional 5 minutes. Cool, filter the sample, and dilute to 150 ml (or the appropriate volume for the expected metals concentrations) with water. This dilution produces Analytical Fraction 2A. Measure and record the volume to within 0.1 ml.

# Note:
All microwave heating times given are approximate and are dependent upon the number of samples being digested at a time. Heating times as given above have been found acceptable for simultaneous digestion of up to 12 individual samples. Sufficient heating is evidenced by solvent reflux within the vessel.
8.3.5 Container No. 5A (Impinger 4), Container Nos. 5B and 5C (Impingers 5 and 6). Keep the samples in Containers Nos. 5A, 5B, and 5C separate from each other. Measure and record the volume of 5A to within 0.5 ml. Label the contents of Container No. 5A to be
Analytical Fraction 3A. To remove any brown MnO
2
precipitate from the contents of Container No. 5B, filter its contents through Whatman 40 filter paper into a 500 ml volumetric flask and dilute to volume with water. Save the filter for digestion of the brown MnO
2
precipitate. Label the 500 ml filtrate from Container No. 5B to be Analytical Fraction 3B. Analyze Analytical Fraction 3B for Hg within 48 hours of the filtration step. Place the saved filter, which was used to remove the brown MnO
2
precipitate, into an appropriately sized
vented
container, which will allow release of any gases including chlorine formed when the filter is digested. In a laboratory hood which will remove any gas produced by the digestion of the MnO
2
, add 25 ml of 8 N HCl to the filter and allow to digest for a minimum of 24 hours at room temperature. Filter the contents of Container No. 5C through a Whatman 40 filter into a 500-ml volumetric flask. Then filter the result of the digestion of the brown MnO
2
from Container No. 5B through a Whatman 40 filter into the same 500-ml volumetric flask, and dilute and mix well to volume with water. Discard the Whatman 40 filter. Mark this combined 500-ml dilute HCl solution as Analytical Fraction 3C.
8.3.6 Container No. 6 (Silica Gel). Weigh the spent silica gel (or silica gel plus impinger) to the nearest 0.5 g using a balance.

# 9.0 Quality Control
9.1 Field Reagent Blanks, if analyzed. Perform the digestion and analysis of the blanks in Container Nos. 7 through 12 that were produced in sections 8.2.11 through 8.2.17, respectively. For Hg field reagent blanks, use a 10 ml aliquot for digestion and analysis.
9.1.1 Digest and analyze one of the filters from Container No. 12 per section 8.3.1, 100 ml from Container No. 7 per section 8.3.2, and 100 ml from Container No. 8A per section 8.3.3. This step produces blanks for Analytical Fractions 1A and 1B.
9.1.2 Combine 100 ml of Container No. 8A with 200 ml from Container No. 9, and digest and analyze the resultant volume per section 8.3.4. This step produces blanks for Analytical Fractions 2A and 2B.
9.1.3 Digest and analyze a 100-ml portion of Container No. 8A to produce a blank for Analytical Fraction 3A.
9.1.4 Combine 100 ml from Container No. 10 with 33 ml from Container No. 8B to produce a blank for Analytical Fraction 3B. Filter the resultant 133 ml as described for Container No. 5B in section 8.3.5, except do not dilute the 133 ml. Analyze this blank for Hg within 48 hr of the filtration step, and use 400 ml as the blank volume when calculating the blank mass value. Use the actual volumes of the other analytical blanks when calculating their mass values.
9.1.5 Digest the filter that was used to remove any brown MnO
2
precipitate from the blank for Analytical Fraction 3B by the same procedure as described in section 8.3.5 for the similar sample filter. Filter the digestate and the contents of Container No. 11 through Whatman 40 paper into a 500-ml volumetric flask, and dilute to volume with water. These steps produce a blank for Analytical Fraction 3C.
9.1.6 Analyze the blanks for Analytical Fraction Blanks 1A and 2A per section 11.1.1 and/or section 11.1.2. Analyze the blanks for Analytical Fractions 1B, 2B, 3A, 3B, and 3C per section 11.1.3. Analysis of the blank for Analytical Fraction 1A produces the front-half reagent blank correction values for the desired metals except for Hg; Analysis of the blank for Analytical Fraction 1B produces the front-half reagent blank correction value for Hg. Analysis of the blank for Analytical Fraction 2A produces the back-half reagent blank correction values for all of the desired metals except for Hg, while separate analyses of the blanks for Analytical Fractions 2B, 3A, 3B, and 3C produce the back-half reagent blank correction value for Hg.
9.2 Quality Control Samples. Analyze the following quality control samples.
9.2.1 ICAP and ICP-MS Analysis. Follow the respective quality control descriptions in section 8 of Methods 6010 and 6020 in EPA Publication SW-846 Third Edition (November 1986) including updates I, II, IIA, IIB and III, as incorporated by reference in § 60.17(i). For the purposes of a source test that consists of three sample runs, modify those requirements to include the following: two instrument check standard runs, two calibration blank runs, one interference check sample at the beginning of the analysis (analyze by Method of Standard Additions unless within 25 percent), one quality control sample to check the accuracy of the calibration standards (required to be within 25 percent of calibration), and one duplicate analysis (required to be within 20 percent of average or repeat all analyses).
9.2.2 Direct Aspiration AAS and/or GFAAS Analysis for Sb, As, Ba, Be, Cd, Cu, Cr, Co, Pb, Ni, Mn, Hg, P, Se, Ag, Tl, and Zn. Analyze all samples in duplicate. Perform a matrix spike on at least one front-half sample and one back-half sample, or one combined sample. If recoveries of less than 75 percent or greater than 125 percent are obtained for the matrix spike, analyze each sample by the Method of Standard Additions. Analyze a quality control sample to check the accuracy of the calibration standards. If the results are not within 20 percent, repeat the calibration.
9.2.3 CVAAS Analysis for Hg. Analyze all samples in duplicate. Analyze a quality control sample to check the accuracy of the calibration standards (if not within 15 percent, repeat calibration). Perform a matrix spike on one sample (if not within 25 percent,
analyze all samples by the Method of Standard Additions). Additional information on quality control can be obtained from Method 7470 in EPA Publication SW-846 Third Edition (November 1986) including updates I, II, IIA, IIB and III, as incorporated by reference in § 60.17(i), or in
Standard Methods for Water and Wastewater
Method 303F.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization

# Note:
Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.
10.1 Sampling Train Calibration. Calibrate the sampling train components according to the indicated sections of Method 5: Probe Nozzle (Section 10.1); Pitot Tube (Section 10.2); Metering System (Section 10.3); Probe Heater (Section 10.4); Temperature Sensors (Section 10.5); Leak-Check of the Metering System (Section 8.4.1); and Barometer (Section 10.6).
10.2 Inductively Coupled Argon Plasma Spectrometer Calibration. Prepare standards as outlined in section 7.5. Profile and calibrate the instrument according to the manufacturer's recommended procedures using those standards. Check the calibration once per hour. If the instrument does not reproduce the standard concentrations within 10 percent, perform the complete calibration procedures. Perform ICP-MS analysis by following Method 6020 in EPA Publication SW-846 Third Edition (November 1986) including updates I, II, IIA, IIB and III, as incorporated by reference in § 60.17(i).
10.3 Atomic Absorption Spectrometer—Direct Aspiration AAS, GFAAS, and CVAAS analyses. Prepare the standards as outlined in section 7.5 and use them to calibrate the spectrometer. Calibration procedures are also outlined in the EPA methods referred to in Table 29-2 and in Method 7470 in EPA Publication SW-846 Third Edition (November 1986) including updates I, II, IIA, IIB and III, as incorporated by reference in § 60.17(i), or in
Standard Methods for Water and Wastewater
Method 303F (for Hg). Run each standard curve in duplicate and use the mean values to calculate the calibration line. Recalibrate the instrument approximately once every 10 to 12 samples.
10.4 Field Balance Calibration Check. Check the calibration of the balance used to weigh impingers with a weight that is at least 500g or within 50g of a loaded impinger. The weight must be ASTM E617-13 “Standard Specification for Laboratory Weights and Precision Mass Standards” (incorporated by reference-see 40 CFR 60.17) Class 6 (or better). Daily before use, the field balance must measure the weight within ±0.5g of the certified mass. If the daily balance calibration check fails, perform corrective measures and repeat the check before using balance.
10.5 Analytical Balance Calibration. Perform a multipoint calibration (at least five points spanning the operational range) of the analytical balance before the first use, and semiannually thereafter. The calibration of the analytical balance must be conducted using ASTM E617-13 “Standard Specification for Laboratory Weights and Precision Mass Standards” (incorporated by reference—see 40 CFR 60.17) Class 2 (or better) tolerance weights. Audit the balance each day it is used for gravimetric measurements by weighing at least one ASTM E617-13 Class 2 tolerance (or better) calibration weight that corresponds to 50 to 150 percent of the weight of one filter or between 1g and 5g. If the scale cannot reproduce the value of the calibration weight to within 0.5 mg of the certified mass, perform corrective measures, and conduct the multipoint calibration before use.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedure
11.1 Sample Analysis. For each sampling train sample run, seven individual analytical samples are generated; two for all desired metals except Hg, and five for Hg. A schematic identifying each sample container and the prescribed analytical preparation and analysis scheme is shown in Figure 29-3. The first two analytical samples, labeled Analytical Fractions 1A and 1B, consist of the digested samples from the front-half of the train. Analytical Fraction 1A is for ICAP, ICP-MS or AAS analysis as described in sections 11.1.1 and 11.1.2, respectively. Analytical Fraction 1B is for front-half Hg analysis as described in section 11.1.3. The contents of the back-half of the train are used to prepare the third through seventh analytical samples. The third and fourth analytical samples, labeled Analytical Fractions 2A and 2B, contain the samples from the moisture removal impinger No. 1, if used, and HNO

impingers Nos. 2 and 3. Analytical Fraction 2A is for ICAP, ICP-MS or AAS analysis for target metals, except Hg. Analytical Fraction 2B is for analysis for Hg. The fifth through seventh analytical samples, labeled Analytical Fractions 3A, 3B, and 3C, consist of the impinger contents and rinses from the empty impinger No. 4 and the H

Impingers Nos. 5 and 6. These analytical samples are for analysis for Hg as described in section 11.1.3. The total back-half Hg catch is determined from the sum of Analytical Fractions 2B, 3A, 3B, and 3C. Analytical Fractions 1A and 2A can be combined proportionally prior to analysis.
11.1.1 ICAP and ICP-MS Analysis. Analyze Analytical Fractions 1A and 2A by ICAP using Method 6010 or Method 200.7 (40 CFR 136, Appendix C). Calibrate the ICAP, and set up an analysis program as described in Method 6010 or Method 200.7. Follow the quality control procedures described in section 9.2.1. Recommended wavelengths for analysis are as shown in Table 29-2. These wavelengths represent the best combination of specificity
and potential detection limit. Other wavelengths may be substituted if they can provide the needed specificity and detection limit, and are treated with the same corrective techniques for spectral interference. Initially, analyze all samples for the target metals (except Hg) plus Fe and Al. If Fe and Al are present, the sample might have to be diluted so that each of these elements is at a concentration of less than 50 ppm so as to reduce their spectral interferences on As, Cd, Cr, and Pb. Perform ICP-MS analysis by following Method 6020 in EPA Publication SW-846 Third Edition (November 1986) including updates I, II, IIA, IIB and III, as incorporated by reference in § 60.17(i).

# Note:
When analyzing samples in a HF matrix, an alumina torch should be used; since all front-half samples will contain HF, use an alumina torch.
11.1.2 AAS by Direct Aspiration and/or GFAAS. If analysis of metals in Analytical Fractions 1A and 2A by using GFAAS or direct aspiration AAS is needed, use Table 29-3 to determine which techniques and procedures to apply for each target metal. Use Table 29-3, if necessary, to determine techniques for minimization of interferences. Calibrate the instrument according to section 10.3 and follow the quality control procedures specified in section 9.2.2.
11.1.3 CVAAS Hg analysis. Analyze Analytical Fractions 1B, 2B, 3A, 3B, and 3C separately for Hg using CVAAS following the method outlined in Method 7470 in EPA Publication SW-846 Third Edition (November 1986) including updates I, II, IIA, IIB and III, as incorporated by reference in § 60.17(i), or in
