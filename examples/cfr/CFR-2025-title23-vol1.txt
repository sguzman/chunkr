# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Interest to be acquired.
The State shall acquire rights-of-way of such nature and extent as are adequate for the

Use for highway purposes.
Except as provided under paragraph (c) of this section, all real property, including air space, within the right-of-way boundaries of a project shall be devoted exclusively to public highway purposes.

Maintenance.
The responsibility imposed upon the State highway department, pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 116, for the maintenance of projects shall be carried out in accordance with policies and procedures issued by the Administrator.

§ 1.28
[Reserved]
§ 1.32
Issuance of directives.
(a) The Administrator shall promulgate and require the observance of policies and procedures, and may take other action as he deems appropriate or necessary for carrying out the provisions and purposes of Federal laws, the policies of the Federal Highway Administration, and the regulations of this part.
(b) The Administrator or his delegated representative, as appropriate, is authorized to issue the following type of directives:
(1) Federal Highway Administration Regulations are issued by the Administrator or his delegate, as necessary, to implement and carry out the provisions of title 23 U.S.C., relating to the administration of Federal aid for highways, direct Federal programs and State and community safety programs; and title 49 U.S.C., relating to motor carrier safety; and other applicable laws and programs under his jurisdiction.
(2) Notices are temporary issuances transmitting one-time or short-term instructions or information which is expected to remain in effect for less than 90 days or for a predetermined period of time normally not to exceed one year.
(3) Orders are directives limited in volume and contain permanent or longlasting policy, instructions, and procedures. FHWA Orders are to be used primarily as internal FHWA directives.
(4) Joint Interagency Orders and Notices are used by FHWA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to issue joint policies, procedures, and information pertaining to the joint administration of the State and Community Highway Safety Program. Where necessary, other joint directives may be issued with other modal administrations within the Department of Transportation.
(5) Manuals are generally designed for use in issuing permanent or long-lasting detailed policy and procedure. Some of the major manuals recognized by the FHWA Directives System follow:
(i) The Federal-Aid Highway Program Manual has been established to assemble and organize program material of the type previously contained in the Policy and Procedure and Instructional Memoranda which will continue in effect until specifically revoked or published in the new manual. Regulatory material is printed in italics in the manual and also appears in this code. Nonregulatory material is printed in delegate type.
(ii) The Administrative Manual covers all internal FHWA administrative support functions.
(iii) The Highway Planning Program Manual covers the methods and procedures necessary to conduct the highway planning functions.
(iv) The Research and Development Manual series entitled, “The Federally Coordinated Program of Research and Development in Highway Transportation” describes the FHWA research and development program.
(v) The External Audit Manual provides guidance to FHWA auditors in their review of State programs and processes.
(vi) The Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity Manual provides guidance to FHWA and State Civil Rights and Equal Employment Opportunity Officers.
(vii) The BMCS Operations Manual provides program guidance for all field employees assigned to the motor carrier safety program.
(viii) The Highway Safety Program Manual, issued jointly by FHWA and NHTSA, contains volumes relating to the joint administration of the program.
(6) Handbooks are internal operating instructions published in book form where, because of the program area covered, it is desirable to provide greater detail of administrative and technical instructions.
(7) Transmittals identify and explain the original issuance or page change, provide background information, and provide filing instructions for insertion of new pages and removal of changed pages, or both.

§ 1.33
Conflicts of interest.
No official or employee of a State or any other governmental instrumentality who is authorized in his official capacity to negotiate, make, accept or approve, or to take part in negotiating, making, accepting or approving any contract or subcontract in connection with a project shall have, directly or indirectly, any financial or other personal interest in any such contract or subcontract. No engineer, attorney, appraiser, inspector or other person performing services for a State or a governmental instrumentality in connection with a project shall have, directly or indirectly, a financial or other personal interest, other than his employment or retention by a State or other governmental instrumentality, in any contract or subcontract in connection with such project. No officer or employee of such person retained by a State or other governmental instrumentality shall have, directly or indirectly, any financial or other personal interest in any real property acquired for a project unless such interest is openly disclosed upon the public records of the State highway department and of such other governmental instrumentality, and such officer, employee or person has not participated in such acquisition for and in behalf of the State. It shall be the responsibility of the State to enforce the requirements of this section.
§ 1.35
Bonus program.
(a) Any agreement entered into by a State pursuant to the provisions of section 12 of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1958, Pub. L. 85-381, 72 Stat. 95, as amended, shall provide for the control or regulation of outdoor advertising, consistent with the advertising policy and standards promulgated by the Administrator, in areas adjacent to the entire mileage of the Interstate System within that State, except such segments as may be excluded from the application of such policy and standards by section 12.
(b) Any such agreement for the control of advertising may provide for establishing publicly owned informational sites, whether publicly or privately operated, within the limits of or adjacent to the right-of-way of the
Interstate System on condition that no such site shall be established or maintained except at locations and in accordance with plans, in furtherance of the advertising policy and standards, submitted to and approved by the Administrator.
(c) No advertising right in the acquisition of which Federal funds participated shall be disposed of without the prior approval of the Administrator.
[39 FR 28628, Aug. 9, 1974]
§ 1.36
Compliance with Federal laws and regulations.
If the Administrator determines that a State has violated or failed to comply with the Federal laws or the regulations in this part with respect to a project, he may withhold payment to the State of Federal funds on account of such project, withhold approval of further projects in the State, and take such other action that he deems appropriate under the circumstances, until compliance or remedial action has been accomplished by the State to the satisfaction of the Administrator.

# Subpart F—Reimbursement for Bond Issue Projects

# Source:
48 FR 54971, Dec. 8, 1983, unless otherwise noted.
§ 140.601
Purpose.
To prescribe policies and procedures for the use of Federal funds by State highway agencies (SHAs) to aid in the retirement of the principal and interest of bonds, pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 122 and the payment of interest on bonds of eligible Interstate projects.
§ 140.602
Requirements and conditions.
(a) An SHA that uses the proceeds of bonds issued by the State, a county, city or other political subdivision of the State, for the construction of projects on the Federal-aid primary or Interstate system, or extensions of any of the Federal-aid highway systems in urban areas, or for substitute highway projects approved under 23 U.S.C. 103(e)(4), may claim payment of any portion of such sums apportioned to it for expenditures on such system to aid in the retirement of the principal of bonds at their maturities, to the extent that the proceeds of bonds have actually been expended in the construction of projects.
(b) Any interest earned and payable on bonds, the proceeds of which were expended on Interstate projects after November 6, 1978, is an eligible cost of construction. The amount of interest eligible for participation will be based on (1) the date the proceeds were expended on the project, (2) amount expended, and (3) the date of conversion to a regularly funded project. As provided for in section 115(c), Pub. L. 95-599, November 6, 1978, interest on bonds issued in any fiscal year by a State after November 6, 1978, may be paid under the authority of 23 U.S.C. 122 only if such SHA was eligible to obligate Interstate Discretionary funds under the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 118(b) during such fiscal year, and the Administrator certifies that such eligible SHA has utilized, or will utilize to the fullest extent possible during such fiscal year, its authority to obligate funds under 23 U.S.C. 118(b).
(c) The Federal share payable at the time of conversion, as provided for in § 140.610 shall be the legal pro rata in effect at the time of execution of the project agreement for the bond issue project.
(d) The authorization of a bond issue project does not constitute a commitment of Federal funds until the project is converted to a regular Federal-aid project as provided for in § 140.610.
(e) Reimbursements for the redemption of bonds may not precede, by more than 60 days, the scheduled date of the retirement of the bonds.
(f) Federal funds are not eligible for payment into sinking funds created and maintained for the subsequent retirement of bonds.
§ 140.603
Programs.
Programs covering projects to be financed from the proceeds of bonds shall be prepared and submitted to FHWA. Project designations shall be the same as for regular Federal-aid projects except that the prefix letter “B” for bond issue shall be used as the first letter of each project designation, e.g., “BI” for Bond Issue Projects—Interstate.
§ 140.604
Reimbursable schedule.
Projects to be financed from other than Interstate funds shall be subject to a 36-month reimbursable schedule upon conversion to regular Federal-aid financing (See appendix). FHWA will consider requests for waiver of this provision at the time of conversion action. Waivers are subject to the availability of liquidating cash.
§ 140.605
Approval actions.
(a) Authorization to proceed with preliminary engineering and acquisition of rights-of-way shall be issued in the same manner as for regularly financed Federal-aid projects.
(b) Authorization of physical construction shall be given in the same manner as for regularly financed Federal-aid projects. The total cost and
Federal funds required, including interest, shall be indicated in the plans, specifications, and estimates.
(c) Projects subject to the reimbursable schedule shall be identified as an “E” project when the SHA is authorized to proceed with all or any phase of the work.
(d) Concurrence in the award of contracts shall be given.

§ 140.607
Construction.
Construction shall be supervised by the SHA in the same manner as for regularly financed Federal-aid projects. The FHWA will make construction inspections and reports.
§ 140.608
Reimbursable bond interest costs of Interstate projects.
(a) Bond interest earned on bonds actually retired may be reimbursed on the Federal pro rata basis applicable to such projects in accordance with § 140.602(b) and (c).
(b) No interest will be reimbursed for bonds issued after November 6, 1978, used to retire or otherwise refinance bonds issued prior to that date.
§ 140.609
Progress and final vouchers.
(a) Progress vouchers may be submitted for the Federal share of bonds retired or about to be retired, including eligible interest on Interstate Bond Issue Projects, the proceeds of which have actually been expended for the construction of the project.
(b) Upon completion of a bond issue project, a final voucher shall be submitted by the SHA. After final review, the SHA will be advised as to the total cost and Federal fund participation for the project.
§ 140.610
Conversion from bond issue to funded project status.
(a) At such time as the SHA elects to apply available apportioned Federal-aid funds to the retirement of bonds, including eligible interest earned and payable on Interstate Bond Projects, subject to available obligational authority, its claim shall be supported by appropriate certifications as follows:
I hereby certify that the following bonds, (list), the proceeds of which have been actually expended in the construction of bond issue projects authorized by title 23 U.S.C., section 122, (1) have been retired on ______, or (2) mature and are scheduled for retirement on ______, which is ____ days in advance of the maturity date of ______.
Eligible interest claimed on Interstate Bond Projects shall be shown for each bond and the certification shall include the statement:
I also certify that interest earned and paid or payable for each bond listed has been determined from the date on and after which the respective bond proceeds were actually expended on the project.
(b) The SHA's request for full conversion of a completed projects), or partial conversion of an active or completed project(s), may be made by letter, inclusive of the appropriate certification as described in § 140.610(a) making reference to any progress payments received or the final voucher(s) previously submitted and approved in accordance with § 140.609.
(c) Approval of the conversion action shall be by the Division Administrator.
(d) The SHA's request for partial conversion of an active or completed bond issue project shall provide for: (1) Conversion to funded project status of the portion to be financed out of the balance of currently available apportioned funds, and (2) retention of the unfunded portion of the project in the bond program.
(e) Where the SHA's request involves the partial conversion of a completed bond issue project, payment of the Federal funds made available under the conversion action shall be accomplished through use of Form PR-20, Voucher for Work Performed under Provisions of the Federal-aid and Federal Highway Acts, prepared in the division office and appropriately cross-referenced to the Bond Issue Project final voucher previously submitted and approved. The final voucher will be reduced by the amount of the approved reimbursement.
§ 140.611
Determination of bond retirement.
Division Administrators shall be responsible for the prompt review of the SHA's records to determine that bonds issued to finance the projects and for which reimbursement has been made, including eligible bond interest expense, have been retired pursuant to the State's certification required by § 140.610(a), and that such action is documented in the project file.
§ 140.612
Cash management.
By July 1 of each year the SHA will provide FHWA with a schedule, including the anticipated claims for reimbursement, of bond projects to be converted during the next two fiscal years. The data will be used by FHWA in determining liquidating cash required to finance such conversions.

# Subpart H—State Highway Agency Audit Expense

# Source:
49 FR 45578, Nov. 19, 1984, unless otherwise noted.
§ 140.801
Purpose.
To establish the reimbursement criteria for Federal participation in project related audit expenses.
§ 140.803
Policy.
Project related audits performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards (as modified by the Comptroller General of the United States) and applicable Federal laws and regulations are eligible for Federal participation. The State highway agency (SHA) may use other State, local public agency, and Federal audit organizations as well as licensed or certified public accounting firms to augment its audit force.
§ 140.805
Definitions.
(a)
Project related audits.
Audits which directly benefit Federal-aid highway projects. Audits performed in accordance with the requirements of 23 CFR part 12, audits of third party contract costs, and other audits providing assurance that a recipient has complied with FHWA regulations are all considered project related audits. Audits benefiting only nonfederal projects, those performed for SHA management use only, or those serving similar nonfederal purposes are not considered project related.
(b)
Third party contract costs.
Project related costs incurred by railroads, utilities, consultants, governmental instrumentalities, universities, nonprofit organizations, construction contractors (force account work), and organizations engaged in right-of-way studies, planning, research, or related activities where the terms of a proposal
or contract (including lump sum) necessitate an audit. Construction contracts (except force account work) are not included in this group.
§ 140.807
Reimbursable costs.
(a) Federal funds may be used to reimburse an SHA for the following types of project related audit costs:
(1) Salaries, wages, and related costs paid to public employees in accordance with subpart G of this part,
(2) Payments by the SHA to any Federal, State, or local public agency audit organization, and
(3) Payments by the SHA to licensed or certified public accounting firms.
(b) Audit costs incurred by an SHA shall be equitably distributed to all benefiting parties. The portion of these costs allocated to the Federal-Aid Highway Program which are not directly related to a specific project or projects shall be equitably distributed, as a minimum, to the major FHWA funding categories in that State.

# Subpart I—Reimbursement for Railroad Work

# Source:
40 FR 16057, Apr. 9, 1975, unless otherwise noted.
§ 140.900
Purpose.
The purpose of this subpart is to prescribe policies and procedures on reimbursement to the States for railroad work done on projects undertaken pursuant to the provisions of 23 CFR part 646, subpart B.
§ 140.902
Applicability.
This subpart, and all references hereinafter made to “projects,” applies to Federal-aid projects involving railroad facilities, including projects for the elimination of hazards of railroad-highway crossings, and other projects which use railroad properties or which involve adjustments required by highway construction to either railroad facilities or facilities that are jointly owned or used by railroad and utility companies.
§ 140.904
Reimbursement basis.
(a)
General.
On projects involving the elimination of hazards of railroad-highway crossings, and on other projects where a railroad company is not obligated to move or to change its facilities at its own expense, reimbursement will be made for the costs incurred by the State in making changes to railroad facilities as required in connection with a Federal-aid highway project, in accordance with the provisions of this subpart.
(b)
Eligibility.
To be eligible, the costs must be:
(1) For work which is included in an approved statewide transportation improvement program.
(2) Incurred subsequent to the date of authorization by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA),
(3) Incurred in accordance with the provisions of 23 CFR, part 646, subpart B, and
(4) Properly attributable to the project.
[40 FR 16057, Apr. 9, 1975, as amended at 53 FR 18276, May 23, 1988; 62 FR 45328, Aug. 27, 1997]
§ 140.906
Labor costs.
(a)
General.
(1) Salaries and wages, at actual or average rates, and related expenses paid by a company to individuals, for the time they are working on the project, are reimbursable when supported by adequate records. This shall include labor costs associated with preliminary engineering, construction engineering, right-of-way, and force account construction.
(2) Salaries and expenses paid to individuals who are normally part of the overhead organization of the company may be reimbursed for the time they are working directly on the project, such as for accounting and bill preparation, when supported by adequate records and when the work performed by such individuals is essential to the project and could not have been accomplished as economically by employees outside the overhead organization.
(3) Amounts paid to engineers, architects and others for services directly related to projects may be reimbursed.
(b)
Labor surcharges.
(1) Labor surcharges include worker compensation insurance, public liability and property damage insurance, and such fringe benefits as the company has established for the benefit of its employees. The
cost of labor surcharges will be reimbursed at actual cost to the company or a company may, at its option, use an additive rate or other similar technique in lieu of actual costs provided that (i) the rate is based on historical cost data of the company, (ii) such rate is representative of actual costs incurred, (iii) the rate is adjusted at least annually taking into consideration known anticipated changes and correcting for any over or under applied costs for the preceding period, and (iv) the rate is approved by the SHA and FHWA.
(2) Where the company is a self-insurer there may be reimbursement:
(i) At experience rates properly developed from actual costs, not to exceed the rates of a regular insurance company for the class of employment covered, or
(ii) At the option of the company, a fixed rate of 8 percent of direct labor costs for worker compensation and public liability and property damage insurance together.
[40 FR 16057, Apr. 9, 1975, as amended at 47 FR 33955, Aug. 5, 1982; 56 FR 56578, Nov. 6, 1991]
§ 140.907
Overhead and indirect construction costs.
(a) A State may elect to reimburse the railroad company for its overhead and indirect construction costs.
(b) The FHWA will participate in these costs provided that:
(1) The costs are distributed to all applicable work orders and other functions on an equitable and uniform basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;
(2) The costs included in the distribution are limited to costs actually incurred by the railroad;
(3) The costs are eligible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR), part 31, Contract Cost Principles and Procedures, relating to contracts with commercial organizations;
(4) The costs are considered reasonable;
(5) Records are readily available at a single location which adequately support the costs included in the distribution, the method used for distributing the costs, and the basis for determining additive rates;
(6) The rates are adjusted at least annually taking into consideration any overrecovery or underrecovery of costs; and
(7) The railroad maintains written procedures which assure proper control and distribution of the overhead and indirect construction costs.
[53 FR 18276, May 23, 1988]
§ 140.908
Materials and supplies.
(a)
Procurement.
Materials and supplies, if available, are to be furnished from company stock, except they may be obtained from other sources near the project site when available at less cost. Where not available from company stock, they may be purchased either under competitive bids or existing continuing contracts, under which the lowest available prices are developed. Minor quantities and proprietary products are excluded from these requirements. The company shall not be required to change its existing standards for materials used in permanent changes to its facilities.
(b)
Costs.
(1) Materials and supplies furnished from company stock shall be billed at current stock price of such new or used material at time of issue.
(2) Materials and supplies not furnished from company stock shall be billed at actual costs to the company delivered to the point of entry on the railroad company's line nearest the source of procurement.
(3) A reasonable cost of plant inspection and testing may be included in the costs of materials and supplies where such expense has been incurred. The computation of actual costs of materials and supplies shall include the deduction of all offered discounts, rebates and allowances.
(c)
Materials recovered.
(1) Materials recovered from temporary use and accepted for reuse by the company shall be credited to the project at prices charged to the job, less a consideration for loss in service life at 10 percent for rails, angle bars, tie plates and metal turnout materials and 15 percent for all other materials. Materials recovered from the permanent facility of the
company that are accepted by the company for return to stock shall be credited to the project at current stock prices of such used material.
(2) Materials recovered and not accepted for reuse by the company, if determined to have a net sale value, shall be sold by the State or railroad following an opportunity for State inspection and appropriate solicitation for bids, to the highest bidder; or if the company practices a system of periodic disposal by sale, credit to the project shall be at the going prices supported by the records of the company. Where applicable, credit for materials recovered from the permanent facility in length or quantities in excess of that being placed should be reduced to reflect any increased cost of railroad operation resulting from the adjustment.
(d)
Removal costs.
Federal participation in the costs of removing, salvaging, transporting, and handling recovered materials will be limited to the value of materials recovered, except where FHWA approves additional measures for restoration of affected areas as required by the physical construction or by reason of safety or aesthetics.
(e)
Handling costs.
The actual and direct costs of handling and loading out of materials and supplies at and from company stores or material yards and of unloading and handling of recovered materials accepted by the company at its stores or material yards, are reimbursable. At the option of the company, 5 percent of the amounts billed for the materials and supplies which are issued from company stores and material yards will be reimbursable in lieu of actual costs.
(f)
Credit losses.
On projects where a company actually suffers loss by application of credits, the company shall have the opportunity of submitting a detailed statement of such loss as a basis for further adjustment.
§ 140.910
Equipment.
(a)
Company owned equipment.
Cost of company-owned equipment may be reimbursed for the average or actual cost of operation, light and running repairs, and depreciation, or at industry rates representative of actual costs as agreed to by the railroad, SHA, and FHWA. Reimbursement for company-owned vehicles may be made at average or actual costs or at rates of recorded use per mile which are representative of actual costs and agreed to by the company, SHA, and FHWA.
(b)
Other equipment.
Where company owned equipment is not available, reimbursement will be limited to the amount of rental paid (1) to the lowest qualified bidder, (2) under existing continuing contracts at reasonable cost, or (3) as an exception, by negotiation where (b) (1) and (2) are impractical due to project location or schedule.
[40 FR 16057, Apr. 9, 1975, as amended at 47 FR 33955, Aug. 5, 1982]
§ 140.912
Transportation.
(a)
Employees.
The company's cost of necessary employee transportation and subsistence directly attributable to the project, which is consistent with overall policy of the company, is reimbursable.
(b)
Materials, supplies, and equipment.
The most economical movement of materials, supplies and equipment to the project and necessary return to storage, including the associated costs of loading and unloading equipment, is reimbursable. Transportation by a railroad company over its own lines in a revenue train is reimbursable at average or actual costs, at rates which are representative of actual costs, or at rates which the company charges its customers for similar shipments provided the rate structure is documented and available to the public. These rates are to be agreed to by the company, SHA, and FHWA. No charge will be made for transportation by work train other than the operating expenses of the work train. When it is more practicable or more economical to move equipment on its own wheels, reimbursement may be made at average or actual costs or at rates which are representative of actual costs and are agreed to by the railroad, SHA, and FHWA.
[40 FR 16057, Apr. 9, 1975, as amended at 47 FR 33955, Aug. 5, 1982]
§ 140.914
Credits for improvements.
(a) Credit shall be made to the project for additions or improvements
which provide for higher quality or increased service capability of the operating facility and which are provided solely for the benefit of the company.
(b) Where buildings and other depreciable structures of a company which are integral to operation of rail traffic must be replaced, credit shall be made to the project as set forth in 23 CFR 646.216(c)(2).
(c) No credit is required for additions or improvements which are:
(1) Necessitated by the requirements of the highway project.
(2) Replacements which, although not identical, are of equivalent standard.
(3) Replacements of devices or materials no longer regularly manufactured and the next highest grade or size is used.
(4) Required by governmental and appropriate regulatory commission requirements.
§ 140.916
Protection.
The cost of essential protective services which, in the opinion of a railroad company, are required to ensure safety to railroad operations during certain periods of the construction of a project, is reimbursable provided an item for such services is incorporated in the State-railroad agreement or in a work order issued by the State and approved by FHWA.
§ 140.918
Maintenance and extended construction.
The cost of maintenance and extended construction is reimbursable to the extent provided for in 23 CFR 646.216(f)(4), and where included in the State-Railroad Agreement or otherwise approved by the State and FHWA.
§ 140.920
Lump sum payments.
Where approved by FHWA, pursuant to 23 CFR 646.216(d)(3), reimbursement may be made as a lump sum payment, in lieu of actual costs.
§ 140.922
Billings.
(a) After the executed State-Railroad Agreement has been approved by FHWA, the company may be reimbursed on progress billings of incurred costs. Costs for materials stockpiled at the project site or specifically purchased and delivered to the company for use on the project may be reimbursed on progress billings following approval of the executed State-Railroad Agreement or the written agreement under 23 CFR 646.218(c).
(b) The company shall provide one final and complete billing of all incurred costs, or of the agreed-to lump sum, within one year following completion of the reimbursable railroad work. Otherwise, previous payments to the company may be considered final, except as agreed to between the SHA and the railroad.
(c) All company cost records and accounts relating to the project are subject to audit by representatives of the State and/or the Federal Government for a period of three years from the date final payment has been received by the company.
(d) A railroad company must advise the State promptly of any outstanding obligation of the State's contractor for services furnished by the company such as protective services.

§ 172.7
Procurement methods and procedures.
(a)
Procurement methods.
The procurement of engineering and design related services funded by FAHP funds and related to a highway construction project subject to the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 112(a) shall be conducted in accordance with one of three methods: Competitive negotiation (qualifications-based selection) procurement, small purchases procurement for small dollar value contracts, and noncompetitive procurement where specific conditions exist allowing solicitation and negotiation to take place with a single consultant.
(1)
Competitive negotiation (qualifications-based selection).
Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section, contracting agencies shall use the competitive negotiation method for the procurement of engineering and design related services when FAHP funds are involved in the contract, as specified in 23 U.S.C. 112(b)(2)(A). The solicitation, evaluation, ranking, selection, and negotiation shall comply with the qualifications-based selection procurement procedures for architectural and engineering services codified under 40 U.S.C. 1101-1104, commonly referred to as the Brooks Act. In accordance with the requirements of the Brooks Act, the following procedures shall apply to the competitive negotiation procurement method:
(i)
Solicitation.
The solicitation process shall be by public announcement, public advertisement, or any other public forum or method that assures qualified in-State and out-of-State consultants are given a fair opportunity to be considered for award of the contract. Procurement procedures may involve a single step process with issuance of a request for proposal (RFP) to all interested consultants or a multiphase process with issuance of a request for statements or letters of interest or qualifications (RFQ) whereby responding consultants are ranked based on qualifications and a RFP is then provided to three or more of the
most highly qualified consultants. Minimum qualifications of consultants to perform services under general work categories or areas of expertise may also be assessed through a prequalification process whereby annual statements of qualifications and performance data are encouraged. Regardless of any process utilized for prequalification of consultants or for an initial assessment of a consultant's qualifications under a RFQ, a RFP specific to the project, task, or service is required for evaluation of a consultant's specific technical approach and qualifications.
(ii)
Request for proposal (RFP).
The RFP shall provide all information and requirements necessary for interested consultants to provide a response to the RFP and compete for the solicited services. The RFP shall:
(A) Provide a clear, accurate, and detailed description of the scope of work, technical requirements, and qualifications of consultants necessary for the services to be rendered. To the extent practicable, the scope of work should detail the purpose and description of the project, services to be performed, deliverables to be provided, estimated schedule for performance of the work, and applicable standards, specifications, and policies;
(B) Identify the requirements for any discussions that may be conducted with three or more of the most highly qualified consultants following submission and evaluation of proposals;
(C) Identify evaluation factors including their relative weight of importance in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section;
(D) Specify the contract type and method(s) of payment anticipated to contract for the solicited services in accordance with § 172.9;
(E) Identify any special provisions or contract requirements associated with the solicited services;
(F) Require that submission of any requested cost proposals or elements of cost be in a concealed format and separate from technical/qualifications proposals, since these shall not be considered in the evaluation, ranking, and selection phase; and
(G) Provide an estimated schedule for the procurement process and establish a submittal deadline for responses to the RFP that provides sufficient time for interested consultants to receive notice, prepare, and submit a proposal, which except in unusual circumstances shall be not less than 14 calendar days from the date of issuance of the RFP.
(iii)
Evaluation factors.
(A) Criteria used for evaluation, ranking, and selection of consultants to perform engineering and design related services must assess the demonstrated competence and qualifications for the type of professional services solicited. These qualifications-based factors may include, but are not limited to, technical approach (e.g., project understanding, innovative concepts or alternatives, quality control procedures), work experience, specialized expertise, professional licensure, staff capabilities, workload capacity, and past performance.
(B) Price shall not be used as a factor in the evaluation, ranking, and selection phase. All price or cost related items which include, but are not limited to, cost proposals, direct salaries/wage rates, indirect cost rates, and other direct costs are prohibited from being used as evaluation criteria.
(C) In-State or local preference shall not be used as a factor in the evaluation, ranking, and selection phase. State licensing laws are not preempted by this provision and professional licensure within a jurisdiction may be established as a requirement for the minimum qualifications and competence of a consultant to perform the solicited services.
(D) The following nonqualifications-based evaluation criteria are permitted under the specified conditions and provided the combined total of these criteria do not exceed a nominal value of 10 percent of the total evaluation criteria to maintain the integrity of a qualifications-based selection:
(
1
) A local presence may be used as a nominal evaluation factor where appropriate. This criteria shall not be based on political or jurisdictional boundaries and may be applied on a project-by-project basis for contracts where a need has been established for a consultant to provide a local presence, a local presence will add value to the quality
and efficiency of the project, and application of this criteria leaves an appropriate number of qualified consultants, given the nature and size of the project. If a consultant from outside of the locality area indicates as part of a proposal that it will satisfy the criteria in some manner, such as establishing a local project office, that commitment shall be considered to have satisfied the local presence criteria.
(
2
) The participation of qualified and certified Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) subconsultants may be used as a nominal evaluation criterion where appropriate in accordance with 49 CFR part 26 and a contracting agency's FHWA-approved DBE program.
(iv)
Evaluation, ranking, and selection.
(A) The contracting agency shall evaluate consultant proposals based on the criteria established and published within the public solicitation.
(B) Although the contract will be with the consultant, proposal evaluations shall consider the qualifications of the consultant and any subconsultants identified within the proposal with respect to the scope of work and established criteria.
(C) The contracting agency shall specify in the RFP discussion requirements that shall follow submission and evaluation of proposals and based on the size and complexity of the project or as defined in contracting agency written policies and procedures, as specified in § 172.5(c). Discussions, as required by the RFP, may be written, by telephone, video conference, or by oral presentation/interview and shall be with at least three of the most highly qualified consultants to clarify the technical approach, qualifications, and capabilities provided in response to the RFP.
(D) From the proposal evaluation and any subsequent discussions which may have been conducted, the contracting agency shall rank, in order of preference, at least three consultants determined most highly qualified to perform the solicited services based on the established and published criteria. In instances where only two qualified consultants respond to the solicitation, the contracting agency may proceed with evaluation and selection if it is determined that the solicitation did not contain conditions or requirements that arbitrarily limited competition. Alternatively, a contracting agency may pursue procurement following the noncompetitive method when competition is determined to be inadequate and it is determined to not be feasible or practical to re-compete under a new solicitation as specified in paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(C) of this section.
(E) Notification must be provided to responding consultants of the final ranking of the three most highly qualified consultants.
(F) The contracting agency shall retain supporting documentation of the solicitation, proposal, evaluation, and selection of the consultant in accordance with this section and the provisions of 2 CFR 200.333.
(v)
Negotiation.
(A) The process for negotiation of the contract shall comply with the requirements codified in 40 U.S.C. 1104(b) for the order of negotiation.
(B)
Independent estimate.
Prior to receipt or review of the most highly qualified consultant's cost proposal, the contracting agency shall prepare a detailed independent estimate with an appropriate breakdown of the work or labor hours, types or classifications of labor required, other direct costs, and consultant's fixed fee for the defined scope of work. The independent estimate shall serve as the basis for negotiation.
(C) The contracting agency shall establish elements of contract costs (e.g., indirect cost rates, direct salary or wage rates, fixed fee, and other direct costs) separately in accordance with § 172.11. The use of the independent estimate and determination of cost allowance in accordance with § 172.11 shall ensure contracts for the consultant services are obtained at a fair and reasonable cost, as specified in 40 U.S.C. 1104(a).
(D) If concealed cost proposals were submitted in conjunction with technical/qualifications proposals, the contracting agency may consider only the cost proposal of the consultant with which negotiations are initiated. Due to the confidential nature of this data, as specified in 23 U.S.C. 112(b)(2)(E), concealed cost proposals of unsuccessful consultants may be disposed of in
accordance with written policies and procedures established under § 172.5(c).
(E) The contracting agency shall retain documentation of negotiation activities and resources used in the analysis of costs to establish elements of the contract in accordance with the provisions of 2 CFR 200.333. This documentation shall include the consultant cost certification and documentation supporting the acceptance of the indirect cost rate to be applied to the contract, as specified in § 172.11(c).
(2)
Small purchases.
The contracting agency may use the State's small purchase procedures that reflect applicable State laws and regulations for the procurement of engineering and design related services provided the total contract costs do not exceed the Federal simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in 48 CFR 2.101). When a lower threshold for use of small purchase procedures is established in State law, regulation, or policy, the lower threshold shall apply to the use of FAHP funds. The following additional requirements shall apply to the small purchase procurement method:
(i) The scope of work, project phases, and contract requirements shall not be broken down into smaller components merely to permit the use of small purchase procedures.
(ii) A minimum of three consultants are required to satisfy the adequate number of qualified sources reviewed. In instances where only two qualified consultants respond to the solicitation, the contracting agency may proceed with evaluation and selection if it is determined that the solicitation did not contain conditions or requirements which arbitrarily limited competition. Alternatively, a contracting agency may pursue procurement following the noncompetitive method when competition is determined to be inadequate and it is determined to not be feasible or practical to re compete under a new solicitation as specified in § 172.7(a)(3)(iii)(C).
(iii) Contract costs may be negotiated in accordance with State small purchase procedures; however, the allowability of costs shall be determined in accordance with the Federal cost principles.
(iv) The full amount of any contract modification or amendment that would cause the total contract amount to exceed the established simplified acquisition threshold is ineligible for Federal-aid funding. The FHWA may withdraw all Federal-aid from a contract if it is modified or amended above the applicable established simplified acquisition threshold.
(3)
Noncompetitive.
The following requirements shall apply to the noncompetitive procurement method:
(i) A contracting agency may use its own noncompetitive procedures that reflect applicable State and local laws and regulations and conform to applicable Federal requirements.
(ii) A contracting agency shall establish a process to determine when noncompetitive procedures will be used and shall submit justification to, and receive approval from FHWA before using this form of contracting.
(iii) A contracting agency may award a contract by noncompetitive procedures under the following limited circumstances:
(A) The service is available only from a single source;
(B) There is an emergency which will not permit the time necessary to conduct competitive negotiations; or
(C) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined to be inadequate.
(iv) Contract costs may be negotiated in accordance with contracting agency noncompetitive procedures; however, the allowability of costs shall be determined in accordance with the Federal cost principles.
(b)
Additional procurement requirements
—(1)
Uniform administrative requirements, cost principles and audit requirements for Federal awards.
(i) STAs or other recipients and their subrecipients shall comply with procurement requirements established in State and local laws, regulations, policies, and procedures that are not addressed by or are not in conflict with applicable Federal laws and regulations, as specified in 2 CFR part 1201.
(ii) When State and local procurement laws, regulations, policies, or procedures are in conflict with applicable Federal laws and regulations, a contracting agency shall comply with
Federal requirements to be eligible for Federal-aid reimbursement of the associated costs of the services incurred following FHWA authorization, as specified in 2 CFR 200.102(c).
(2)
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program.
(i) A contracting agency shall give consideration to DBE consultants in the procurement of engineering and design related service contracts subject to 23 U.S.C. 112(b)(2) in accordance with 49 CFR part 26. When DBE program participation goals cannot be met through race-neutral measures, additional DBE participation on engineering and design related services contracts may be achieved in accordance with a contracting agency's FHWA approved DBE program through either:
(A) Use of an evaluation criterion in the qualifications-based selection of consultants, as specified in § 172.7(a)(1)(iii)(D); or
(B) Establishment of a contract participation goal.
(ii) The use of quotas or exclusive set-asides for DBE consultants is prohibited, as specified in 49 CFR 26.43.
(3)
Suspension and debarment.
A contracting agency shall verify suspension and debarment actions and eligibility status of consultants and subconsultants prior to entering into an agreement or contract in accordance with 2 CFR part 1200 and 2 CFR part 180.
(4)
Conflicts of interest.
(i) A contracting agency shall maintain a written code of standards of conduct governing the performance of their employees engaged in the award and administration of engineering and design related services contracts under this part and governing the conduct and roles of consultants in the performance of services under such contracts to prevent, identify, and mitigate conflicts of interest in accordance with 2 CFR 200.112, 23 CFR 1.33 and the provisions of this paragraph (b)(4).
(ii) No employee, officer, or agent of the contracting agency shall participate in selection, or in the award or administration of a contract supported by Federal-aid funds if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be involved. Such a conflict arises when there is a financial or other interest in the consultant selected for award by:
(A) The employee, officer, or agent;
(B) Any member of his or her immediate family;
(C) His or her partner; or
(D) An organization that employs or is about to employ any of the above.
(iii) The contracting agency's officers, employees, or agents shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from consultants, potential consultants, or parties to subagreements. A contracting agency may establish dollar thresholds where the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value.
(iv) A contracting agency may provide additional prohibitions relative to real, apparent, or potential conflicts of interest.
(v) To the extent permitted by State or local law or regulations, the standards of conduct required by this paragraph shall provide for penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of such standards by the contracting agency's officers, employees, or agents, or by consultants or their agents.
(vi) A contracting agency shall promptly disclose in writing any potential conflict of interest to FHWA.
(5)
Consultant services in management support roles.
(i) When FAHP funds participate in a consultant services contract, the contracting agency shall receive approval from FHWA, or the recipient as appropriate, before utilizing a consultant to act in a management support role for the contracting agency; unless an alternate approval procedure has been approved. Use of consultants in management support roles does not relieve the contracting agency of responsibilities associated with the use of FAHP funds, as specified in 23 U.S.C. 302(a) and 23 U.S.C. 106(g)(4) and should be limited to large projects or circumstances where unusual cost or time constraints exist, unique technical or managerial expertise is required, and/or an increase in contracting agency staff is not a viable option.
(ii) Management support roles may include, but are not limited to, providing oversight of an element of a highway program, function, or service on behalf of the contracting agency or may involve managing or providing
oversight of a project, series of projects, or the work of other consultants and contractors on behalf of the contracting agency. Contracting agency written policies and procedures as specified in § 172.5(c) may further define allowable management roles and services a consultant may provide, specific approval responsibilities, and associated controls necessary to ensure compliance with Federal requirements.
(iii) Use of consultants or subconsultants in management support roles requires appropriate conflicts of interest standards as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section and adequate contracting agency staffing to administer and monitor the management consultant contract, as specified in § 172.9(d). A consultant serving in a management support role may be precluded from providing additional services on projects, activities, or contracts under its oversight due to potential conflicts of interest.
(iv) FAHP funds shall not participate in the costs of a consultant serving in a management support role where the consultant was not procured in accordance with Federal and State requirements, as specified in 23 CFR 1.9(a).
(v) Where benefiting more than a single Federal-aid project, allocability of consultant contract costs for services related to a management support role shall be distributed consistent with the cost principles applicable to the contracting agency, as specified in 2 CFR part 200, subpart E—Cost Principles.
§ 172.9
Contracts and administration.
(a)
Contract types.
The contracting agency shall use the following types of contracts:
(1)
Project-specific.
A contract between the contracting agency and consultant for the performance of services and defined scope of work related to a specific project or projects.
(2)
Multiphase.
A project-specific contract where the solicited services are divided into phases whereby the specific scope of work and associated costs may be negotiated and authorized by phase as the project progresses.
(3)
On-call or indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ).
A contract for the performance of services for a number of projects, under task or work orders issued on an as-needed or on-call basis, for an established contract period. The procurement of services to be performed under on-call or IDIQ contracts shall follow either competitive negotiation or small purchase procurement procedures, as specified in § 172.7. The solicitation and contract provisions shall address the following requirements:
(i) Specify a reasonable maximum length of contract period, including the number and period of any allowable contract extensions, which shall not exceed 5 years;
(ii) Specify a maximum total contract dollar amount that may be awarded under a contract;
(iii) Include a statement of work, requirements, specifications, or other description to define the general scope, complexity, and professional nature of the services; and
(iv) If multiple consultants are to be selected and multiple on-call or IDIQ contracts awarded through a single solicitation for specific services:
(A) Identify the number of consultants that may be selected or contracts that may be awarded from the solicitation; and
(B) Specify the procedures the contracting agency will use in competing and awarding task or work orders among the selected, qualified consultants. Task or work orders shall not be competed and awarded among the selected, qualified consultants on the basis of costs under on-call or IDIQ contracts for services procured with competitive negotiation procedures. Under competitive negotiation procurement, each specific task or work order shall be awarded to the selected, qualified consultants:
(
1
) Through an additional qualifications-based selection procedure, which may include, but does not require, a formal RFP in accordance with § 172.5(a)(1)(ii); or
(
2
) On a regional basis whereby the State is divided into regions and consultants are selected to provide on-call or IDIQ services for an assigned region(s) identified within the solicitation.
(b)
Payment methods.
(1) The method of payment to the consultant shall be set forth in the original solicitation,
contract, and in any contract modification thereto. The methods of payment shall be: Lump sum, cost plus fixed fee, cost per unit of work, or specific rates of compensation. A single contract may contain different payment methods as appropriate for compensation of different elements of work.
(2) The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of construction cost methods of payment shall not be used.
(3) The lump sum payment method shall only be used when the contracting agency has established the extent, scope, complexity, character, and duration of the work to be required to a degree that fair and reasonable compensation, including a fixed fee, can be determined at the time of negotiation.
(4) When the method of payment is other than lump sum, the contract shall specify a maximum amount payable which shall not be exceeded unless adjusted by a contract modification.
(5) The specific rates of compensation payment method provides for reimbursement on the basis of direct labor hours at specified fixed hourly rates, including direct labor costs, indirect costs, and fee or profit, plus any other direct expenses or costs, subject to an agreement maximum amount. This payment method shall only be used when it is not possible at the time of procurement to estimate the extent or duration of the work or to estimate costs with any reasonable degree of accuracy. This specific rates of compensation payment method should be limited to contracts or components of contracts for specialized or support type services where the consultant is not in direct control of the number of hours worked, such as construction engineering and inspection. When using this payment method, the contracting agency shall manage and monitor the consultant's level of effort and classification of employees used to perform the contracted services.
(6) A contracting agency may withhold retainage from payments in accordance with prompt pay requirements, as specified in 49 CFR 26.29.

(d)
Contract administration and monitoring
—(1)
Responsible charge.
A full-time, public employee of the contracting agency qualified to ensure that the work delivered under contract is complete, accurate, and consistent with the terms, conditions, and specifications of the contract shall be in responsible charge of each contract or project. While an independent consultant may be procured to serve in a program or project management support role, as specified in § 172.7(b)(5), or to provide technical assistance in review and acceptance of engineering and design related services performed and products developed by other consultants, the contracting agency shall designate a public employee as being in responsible charge. A public employee may serve in responsible charge of multiple projects and contracting agencies may use multiple public employees to fulfill monitoring responsibilities. The term responsible charge is intended to be applied only in the context defined within this regulation. It may or may not correspond to its usage in State laws regulating the licensure and/or conduct of professional engineers. The public employee's responsibilities shall include:
(i) Administering inherently governmental activities including, but not limited to, contract negotiation, contract payment, and evaluation of compliance, performance, and quality of services provided by consultant;
(ii) Being familiar with the contract requirements, scope of services to be performed, and products to be produced by the consultant;
(iii) Being familiar with the qualifications and responsibilities of the consultant's staff and evaluating any requested changes in key personnel;
(iv) Scheduling and attending progress and project review meetings, commensurate with the magnitude, complexity, and type of work, to ensure the work is progressing in accordance with established scope of work and schedule milestones;
(v) Ensuring consultant costs billed are allowable in accordance with the Federal cost principles and consistent with the contract terms as well as the acceptability and progress of the consultant's work;
(vi) Evaluating and participating in decisions for contract modifications; and
(vii) Documenting contract monitoring activities and maintaining supporting contract records, as specified in 2 CFR 200.333.
(2)
Performance evaluation.
The contracting agency shall prepare an evaluation summarizing the consultant's performance on a contract. The performance evaluation should include, but not be limited to, an assessment of the timely completion of work, adherence to contract scope and budget, and quality of the work conducted. The contracting agency shall provide the consultant a copy of the performance evaluation and an opportunity to provide written comments to be attached to the evaluation. The contracting agency should prepare additional interim performance evaluations based on the scope, complexity, and size of the contract as a means to provide feedback, foster communication, and achieve desired changes or improvements. Completed performance evaluations should be archived for consideration as an element of past performance in the future evaluation of the consultant to provide similar services.
(e)
Contract modification.
(1) Contract modifications are required for any amendments to the terms of the existing contract that change the cost of the contract; significantly change the character, scope, complexity, or duration of the work; or significantly change the conditions under which the work is required to be performed.
(2) A contract modification shall clearly define and document the changes made to the contract, establish the method of payment for any adjustments in contract costs, and be in compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract and original procurement.
(3) A contracting agency shall negotiate contract modifications following the same procedures as the negotiation of the original contract.
(4) A contracting agency may add to a contract only the type of services and
work included within the scope of services of the original solicitation from which a qualifications-based selection was made.
(5) For any additional engineering and design related services outside of the scope of work established in the original request for proposal, a contracting agency shall:
(i) Procure the services under a new solicitation;
(ii) Perform the work itself using contracting agency staff; or
(iii) Use a different, existing contract under which the services would be within the scope of work.
(6) Overruns in the costs of the work shall not automatically warrant an increase in the fixed fee portion of a cost plus fixed fee reimbursed contract. Permitted changes to the scope of work or duration may warrant consideration for adjustment of the fixed fee portion of cost plus fixed fee or lump sum reimbursed contracts.
§ 172.11
Allowable costs and oversight.
(a)
Allowable costs.
(1) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts shall be eligible for Federal-aid reimbursement only to the extent that costs incurred or cost estimates included in negotiated prices are allowable in accordance with the Federal cost principles.
(2) Consultants shall be responsible for accounting for costs appropriately and for maintaining records, including supporting documentation, adequate to demonstrate that costs claimed have been incurred, are allocable to the contract, and comply with Federal cost principles.
(b)
Elements of contract costs.
The following requirements shall apply to the establishment of the specified elements of contract costs:
(1)
Indirect cost rates.
(i) Indirect cost rates shall be updated on an annual basis in accordance with the consultant's annual accounting period and in compliance with the Federal cost principles.
(ii) Contracting agencies shall accept a consultant's or subconsultant's indirect cost rate(s) established for a 1-year applicable accounting period by a cognizant agency that has:
(A) Performed an audit in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards to test compliance with the requirements of the Federal cost principles and issued an audit report of the consultant's indirect cost rate(s); or
(B) Conducted a review of an audit report and related workpapers prepared by a certified public accountant and issued a letter of concurrence with the related audited indirect cost rate(s).
(iii) When the indirect cost rate has not been established by a cognizant agency in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, a STA or other recipient shall perform an evaluation of a consultant's or subconsultant's indirect cost rate prior to acceptance and application of the rate to contracts administered by the recipient or its subrecipients. The evaluation performed by STAs or other recipients to establish or accept an indirect cost rate shall provide assurance of compliance with the Federal cost principles and may consist of one or more of the following:
(A) Performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards and issuing an audit report;
(B) Reviewing and accepting an audit report and related workpapers prepared by a certified public accountant or another STA;
(C) Establishing a provisional indirect cost rate for the specific contract and adjusting contract costs based upon an audited final rate at the completion of the contract; or
(D) Conducting other evaluations in accordance with a risk-based oversight process as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and within the agency's approved written policies and procedures, as specified in § 172.5(c).
(iv) A lower indirect cost rate may be accepted for use on a contract if submitted voluntarily by a consultant; however, the consultant's offer of a lower indirect cost rate shall not be a condition or qualification to be considered for the work or contract award.
(v) Once accepted in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) through (iv) of this section, contracting agencies shall apply such indirect cost rate for the
purposes of contract estimation, negotiation, administration, reporting, and contract payment and the indirect cost rate shall not be limited by administrative or de facto ceilings of any kind.
(vi) A consultant's accepted indirect cost rate for its 1-year applicable accounting period shall be applied to contracts; however, once an indirect cost rate is established for a contract, it may be extended beyond the 1-year applicable period, through the duration of the specific contract, provided all concerned parties agree. Agreement to the extension of the 1-year applicable period shall not be a condition or qualification to be considered for the work or contract award.
(vii)
Disputed rates.
If an indirect cost rate established by a cognizant agency in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section is in dispute, the contracting agency does not have to accept the rate. A contracting agency may perform its own audit or other evaluation of the consultant's indirect cost rate for application to the specific contract, until or unless the dispute is resolved. A contracting agency may alternatively negotiate a provisional indirect cost rate for the specific contract and adjust contract costs based upon an audited final rate. Only the consultant and the parties involved in performing the indirect cost audit may dispute the established indirect cost rate. If an error is discovered in the established indirect cost rate, the rate may be disputed by any prospective contracting agency.
(2)
Direct salary or wage rates.
(i) Compensation for each employee or classification of employee must be reasonable for the work performed in accordance with the Federal cost principles.
(ii) To provide for fair and reasonable compensation, considering the classification, experience, and responsibility of employees necessary to provide the desired engineering and design related services, contracting agencies may establish consultant direct salary or wage rate limitations or “benchmarks” based upon an objective assessment of the reasonableness of proposed rates performed in accordance with the reasonableness provisions of the Federal cost principles.
(iii) When an assessment of reasonableness in accordance with the Federal cost principles has not been performed, contracting agencies shall use and apply the consultant's actual direct salary or wage rates for estimation, negotiation, administration, and payment of contracts and contract modifications.
(3)
Fixed fee.
(i) The determination of the amount of fixed fee shall consider the scope, complexity, contract duration, degree of risk borne by the consultant, amount of subcontracting, and professional nature of the services as well as the size and type of contract.
(ii) The establishment of fixed fee shall be contract or task order specific.
(iii) Fixed fees in excess of 15 percent of the total direct labor and indirect costs of the contract may be justified only when exceptional circumstances exist.
(4)
Other direct costs.
A contracting agency shall use the Federal cost principles in determining the reasonableness, allowability, and allocability of other direct contract costs.
(c)
Oversight
—(1)
Agency controls.
Contracting agencies shall provide reasonable assurance that consultant costs on contracts reimbursed in whole or in part with FAHP funding are allowable in accordance with the Federal cost principles and consistent with the contract terms considering the contract type and payment method. Contracting agency written policies, procedures, contract documents, and other controls, as specified in §§ 172.5(c) and 172.9 shall address the establishment, acceptance, and administration of contract costs to assure compliance with the Federal cost principles and requirements of this section.
(2)
Risk-based analysis.
The STAs or other recipient may employ a risk-based oversight process to provide reasonable assurance of consultant compliance with Federal cost principles on FAHP funded contracts administered by the recipient or its subrecipients. If employed, this risk-based oversight process shall be incorporated into STA or other recipient written policies and procedures, as specified in § 172.5(c). In addition to ensuring allowability of direct contract costs, the risk-based oversight process shall address the evaluation and acceptance of consultant and subconsultant indirect cost
rates for application to contracts. A risk-based oversight process shall consist of the following:
(i)
Risk assessments.
Conducting and documenting an annual assessment of risks of noncompliance with the Federal cost principles per consultant doing business with the agency, considering the following factors:
(A) Consultant's contract volume within the State;
(B) Number of States in which the consultant operates;
(C) Experience of consultant with FAHP contracts;
(D) History and professional reputation of consultant;
(E) Audit history of consultant;
(F) Type and complexity of consultant accounting system;
(G) Size (number of employees or annual revenues) of consultant;
(H) Relevant experience of certified public accountant performing audit of consultant;
(I) Assessment of consultant's internal controls;
(J) Changes in consultant organizational structure; and
(K) Other factors as appropriate.
(ii)
Risk mitigation and evaluation procedures.

(A) Audits performed in accordance with generally accepted government audit standards to test compliance with the requirements of the Federal cost principles;
(B) Certified public accountant or other STA workpaper reviews;
(C) Other analytical procedures;
(D) Consultant cost certifications in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and
(E) Consultant and certified public accountant training on the Federal cost principles.
(iii)
Documentation.
Maintaining supporting documentation of the risk-based analysis procedures performed to support the allowability and acceptance of consultant costs on FAHP funded contracts.
(3)
Consultant cost certification.
(i) Indirect cost rate proposals for the consultant's 1-year applicable accounting period shall not be accepted and no agreement shall be made by a contracting agency to establish final indirect cost rates, unless the costs have been certified by an official of the consultant as being allowable in accordance with the Federal cost principles. The certification requirement shall apply to all indirect cost rate proposals submitted by consultants and subconsultants for acceptance by a STA or other recipient. Each consultant or subconsultant is responsible for certification of its own indirect cost rate and may not certify the rate of another firm.
(ii) The certifying official shall be an individual executive or financial officer of the consultant's organization at a level no lower than a Vice President or Chief Financial Officer, or equivalent, who has the authority to represent the financial information utilized to establish the indirect cost rate proposal submitted for acceptance.
(iii) The certification of final indirect costs shall read as follows:

# Certificate of Final Indirect Costs

§ 230.105
Applicability.
(a)
Federal-aid highway construction projects.
This subpart applies to all Federal-aid highway construction projects and to Appalachian highway construction projects and other State supervised cooperative highway construction projects except:
(1) Federal-aided highway construction projects being constructed pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 117; and
(2) Those projects located in areas where the Office of Federal Contract Compliance has implemented an “Imposed” or a “Hometown” Plan, except for those requirements pertaining to specific provisions involving on-the-job training and those provisions pertaining to supportive services and reporting requirements.
(b)
Direct Federal highway construction projects.
This subpart applies to all direct Federal highway construction projects except:
(1) For those provisions relating to the special requirements for the provision of supportive services; and
(2) For those provisions relating to implementation of specific equal employment opportunity requirements in areas where the Office of Federal Contract Compliance has implemented an “Imposed” or “Hometown” plan.
§ 230.107
Policy.
(a)
Direct Federal and Federal-aid highway construction projects.
It is the policy of the FHWA to require that all direct Federal and Federal-aid highway construction contracts include the same specific equal employment opportunity requirements.

I expect to employ the following firms as subcontractors on this project: (Naming subcontractors at this time does not constitute a binding commitment on the bidder to retain such subcontractors, nor will failure to enter names affect the contract award):
Name
Address
Name
Address
[40 FR 28053, July 3, 1975, as amended at 51 FR 22800, June 23, 1986]
§ 230.111
Implementation of special requirements for the provision of on-the-job training.
(a) The State highway agency shall determine which Federal-aid highway construction contracts shall include the “Training Special Provisions” (appendix B) and the minimum number of trainees to be specified therein after giving appropriate consideration to the guidelines set forth in § 230.111(c). The “Training Special Provisions” shall supersede section 7(b) of the Special Provisions (appendix A) entitled “Specific Equal Employment Opportunity Responsibilities.” Minor wording revisions will be required to the “Training Special Provisions” in areas having “Hometown” or “Imposed Plan” requirements.
(b) The Washington Headquarters shall establish and publish annually suggested minimum training goals. These goals will be based on the Federal-aid apportioned amounts and the minority population. A State will have achieved its goal if the total number of training slots on selected federally aided highway construction contracts which have been awarded during each 12-month period equals or exceeds the State's suggested minimum annual goal. In the event a State highway agency does not attain its goal during a calendar year, the State highway agency at the end of the calendar year shall inform the Administrator of the reasons for its inability to meet the suggested minimum number of training slots and the steps to be taken to achieve the goal during the next calendar year. The information is to be submitted not later than 30 days from the end of the calendar year and should be factual, and should not only indicate the situations occurring during the year but show the project conditions at least through the coming year. The final determination will be made on what training goals are considered to be realistic based on the information submitted by a State.
(c) The following guidelines shall be utilized by the State highway agency in selecting projects and determining the number of trainees to be provided training therein:
(1) Availability of minorities, women, and disadvantaged for training.
(2) The potential for effective training.
(3) Duration of the contract.
(4) Dollar value of the contract.
(5) Total normal work force that the average bidder could be expected to use.
(6) Geographic location.
(7) Type of work.
(8) The need for additional journeymen in the area.
(9) Recognition of the suggested minimum goal for the State.
(10) A satisfactory ratio of trainees to journeymen expected to be on the contractor's work force during normal operations (considered to fall between 1:10 and 1:4).
(d) Training programs which are established shall be approved only if they meet the standards set forth in appendix B with regard to:
(1) The primary objectives of training and upgrading minority group workers, women and disadvantaged persons.
(2) The development of full journeymen.
(3) The minimum length and type of training.
(4) The minimum wages of trainees.
(5) Trainees certifications.
(6) Keeping records and furnishing reports.
(e)(1) Training programs considered by a State highway agency to meet the standards under this directive shall be submitted to the FHWA division Administrator with a recommendation for approval.
(2) Employment pursuant to training programs approved by the FHWA division Administrator will be exempt from the minimum wage rate provisions of section 113 of title 23 U.S.C. Approval, however, shall not be given to training programs which provide for employment of trainees at wages less than those required by the Special Training Provisions. (Appendix B.)
(f)(1) Apprenticeship programs approved by the U.S. Department of Labor as of the date of proposed use by a Federal-aid highway contractor or subcontractor need not be formally approved by the State highway agency or the FHWA division Administrator. Such programs, including their minimum wage provisions, are acceptable for use, provided they are administered
in a manner reasonably calculated to meet the equal employment opportunity obligations of the contractor.
(2) Other training programs approved by the U.S. Department of Labor as of the date of proposed use by a Federal-aid highway contractor or subcontractor are also acceptable for use without the formal approval of the State highway agency or the division Administrator provided:
(i) The U.S. Department of Labor has clearly approved the program aspects relating to equal employment opportunity and the payment of trainee wage rates in lieu of prevailing wage rates.
(ii) They are reasonably calculated to qualify the average trainees for journeyman status in the classification concerned by the end of the training period.
(iii) They are administered in a manner calculated to meet the equal employment obligations of the contractors.
(g) The State highway agencies have the option of permitting Federal-aid highway construction contractors to bid on training to be given under this directive. The following procedures are to be utilized by those State highway agencies that elect to provide a bid item for training:
(1) The number of training positions shall continue to be specified in the Special Training Provisions. Furthermore, this number should be converted into an estimated number of hours of training which is to be used in arriving at the total bid price for the training item. Increases and decreases from the estimated amounts would be handled as overruns or underruns;
(2) A section concerning the method of payment should be included in the Special Training Provisions. Some offsite training is permissible as long as the training is an integral part of an approved training program and does not comprise a substantial part of the overall training. Furthermore, the trainee must be concurrently employed on a federally aided highway construction project subject to the Special Training Provisions attached to this directive. Reimbursement for offsite training may only be made to the contractor where he does one or more of the following: Contributes to the cost of the training, provides the instruction to the trainee, or pays the trainee's wages during the offsite training period;
(3) A State highway agency may modify the special provisions to specify the numbers to be trained in specific job classifications;
(4) A State highway agency can specify training standards provided any prospective bidder can use them, the training standards are made known in the advertised specifications, and such standards are found acceptable by FHWA.

§ 230.113
Implementation of supportive services.
(a) The State highway agency shall establish procedures, subject to the availability of funds under 23 U.S.C. 140(b), for the provision of supportive services in support of training programs approved under this directive. Funds made available to implement this paragraph shall not be used to finance the training of State highway agency employees or to provide services in support of such training. State highway agencies are not required to match funds allocated to them under this section.
(b) In determining the types of supportive services to be provided which will increase the effectiveness of approved training programs. State highway agencies shall give preference to the following types of services in the order listed:
(1) Services related to recruiting, counseling, transportation, physical examinations, remedial training, with special emphasis upon increasing training opportunities for members of minority groups and women;
(2) Services in connection with the administration of on-the-job training programs being sponsored by individual or groups of contractors and/or minority groups and women's groups;
(3) Services designed to develop the capabilities of prospective trainees for undertaking on-the-job training;
(4) Services in connection with providing a continuation of training during periods of seasonal shutdown;
(5) Followup services to ascertain outcome of training being provided.
(c) State highway agencies which desire to provide or obtain supportive services other than those listed above shall submit their proposals to the Federal Highway Administration for approval. The proposal, together with recommendations of the division and regional offices shall be submitted to the Administrator for appropriate action.
(d) When the State highway agency provides supportive services by contract, formal advertising is not required by the FHWA, however, the State highway agency shall solicit proposals from such qualified sources as will assure the competitive nature of the procurement. The evaluation of proposals by the State highway agency must include consideration of the proposer's ability to effect a productive relationship with contractors, unions (if appropriate), minority and women groups, minority and women trainees, and other persons or organizations whose cooperation and assistance will contribute to the successful performance of the contract work.
(e) In the selection of contractors to provide supportive services, State highway agencies shall make conscientious efforts to search out and utilize the services of qualified minority or women organizations, or minority or women business enterprises.
(f) As a minimum, State highway agency contracts to obtain supportive services shall include the following provisions:

(3) The nondiscrimination provisions required by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as set forth in FHWA Form PR-1273, and a statement of nondiscrimination in employment because of race, color, religion, national origin or sex;
(4) The establishment of a definite perriod of contract performance together with, if appropriate, a schedule stating when specific supportive services are to be provided;
(5) Reporting requirements pursuant to which the State highway agency will receive monthly or quarterly reports containing sufficient statistical data and narrative content to enable evaluation of both progress and problems;
(6) A requirement that the contractor keep track of trainees receiving training on Federal-aid highway construction projects for up to 6 months during periods when their training is interrupted. Such contracts shall also require the contractor to conduct a 6 month followup review of the employment status of each graduate who completes an on-the-job training program on a Federal-aid highway construction project subsequent to the effective date of the contract for supportive services.
(7) The basis of payment;
(8) An estimated schedule for expenditures;
(9) The right of access to contractor and subcontractor records and the right to audit shall be granted to authorize State highway agency and FHWA officials;
(10) Noncollusion certification;
(11) A requirement that the contractor provide all information necessary to support progress payments if such are provided for in the contract;
(12) A termination clause.
(g) The State highway agency is to furnish copies of the reports received under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, to the division office.

The contractor and all his/her subcontractors holding subcontracts not including material suppliers, of $10,000 or more, will comply with the following minimum specific requirement activities of equal employment opportunity: (The equal employment opportunity requirements of Executive Order 11246, as set forth in volume 6, chapter 4, section 1, subsection 1 of the Federal-Aid Highway Program Manual, are applicable to material suppliers as well as contractors and subcontractors.) The contractor will include these requirements in every subcontract of $10,000 or more with such modification of language as is necessary to make them binding on the subcontractor.
2.
Equal Employment Opportunity Policy.
The contractor will accept as his operating policy the following statement which is designed to further the provision of equal employment opportunity to all persons without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and to promote the full realization of equal employment opportunity through a positive continuing program:
It is the policy of this Company to assure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, religion, sex, color, or national origin. Such action shall include: employment, upgrading, demotion, or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship, preapprenticeship, and/or on-the-job training.
3.
Equal Employment Opportunity Officer.
The contractor will designate and make known to the State highway agency contracting officers and equal employment opportunity officer (hereinafter referred to as the EEO Officer) who will have the responsibility for and must be capable of effectively administering and promoting an active contractor program of equal employment opportunity and who must be assigned adequate authority and responsibility to do so.
4.
Dissemination of Policy.
a. All members of the contractor's staff who are authorized to hire, supervise, promote, and discharge employees, or who recommend such action, or who are substantially involved in such action, will be made fully cognizant of, and will implement, the contractor's equal employment opportunity policy and contractual responsibilities to provide equal employment opportunity in each grade and classification of employment. To ensure that the above agreement will be met, the following actions will be taken as a minimum:
(1) Periodic meetings of supervisory and personnel office employees will be conducted before the start of work and then not less often than once every six months, at which time the contractor's equal employment opportunity policy and its implementation will be reviewed and explained. The meetings will be conducted by the EEO Officer or other knowledgeable company official.
(2) All new supervisory or personnel office employees will be given a thorough indoctrination by the EEO Officer or other knowledgeable company official, covering all major aspects of the contractor's equal employment opportunity obligations within thirty days following their reporting for duty with the contractor.
(3) All personnel who are engaged in direct recruitment for the project will be instructed by the EEO Officer or appropriate company official in the contractor's procedures for locating and hiring minority group employees.
b. In order to make the contractor's equal employment opportunity policy known to all employees, prospective employees and potential sources of employees,
i.e.
, schools, employment agencies, labor unions (where appropriate), college placement officers, etc., the contractor will take the following actions:
(1) Notices and posters setting forth the contractor's equal employment opportunity
policy will be placed in areas readily accessible to employees, applicants for employment and potential employees.
(2) The contractor's equal employment opportunity policy and the procedures to implement such policy will be brought to the attention of employees by means of meetings, employee handbooks, or other appropriate means.
5. Recruitment. a. When advertising for employees, the contractor will include in all advertisements for employees the notation: “An Equal Opportunity Employer.” All such advertisements will be published in newspapers or other publications having a large circulation among minority groups in the area from which the project work force would normally be derived.
b. The contractor will, unless precluded by a valid bargaining agreement, conduct systematic and direct recruitment through public and private employee referral sources likely to yield qualified minority group applicants, including, but not limited to, State employment agencies, schools, colleges and minority group organizations. To meet this requirement, the contractor will, through his EEO Officer, identify sources of potential minority group employees, and establish with such identified sources procedures whereby minority group applicants may be referred to the contractor for employment consideration.
In the event the contractor has a valid bargaining agreement providing for exclusive hiring hall referrals, he is expected to observe the provisions of that agreement to the extent that the system permits the contractor's compliance with equal employment opportunity contract provisions. (The U.S. Department of Labor has held that where implementation of such agreements have the effect of discriminating against minorities or women, or obligates the contractor to do the same, such implementation violates Executive Order 11246, as amended.)
c. The contractor will encourage his present employees to refer minority group applicants for employment by posting appropriate notices or bulletins in areas accessible to all such employees. In addition, information and procedures with regard to referring minority group applicants will be discussed with employees.
6.
Personnel Actions.
Wages, working conditions, and employee benefits shall be established and administered, and personnel actions of every type, including hiring, upgrading, promotion, transfer, demotion, layoff, and termination, shall be taken without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The following procedures shall be followed:
a. The contractor will conduct periodic inspections of project sites to insure that working conditions and employee facilities do not indicate discriminatory treatment of project site personnel.
b. The contractor will periodically evaluate the spread of wages paid within each classification to determine any evidence of discriminatory wage practices.
c. The contractor will periodically review selected personnel actions in depth to determine whether there is evidence of discrimination. Where evidence is found, the contractor will promptly take corrective action. If the review indicates that the discrimination may extend beyond the actions reviewed, such corrective action shall include all affected persons.
d. The contractor will promptly investigate all complaints of alleged discrimination made to the contractor in connection with his obligations under this contract, will attempt to resolve such complaints, and will take appropriate corrective action within a reasonable time. If the investigation indicates that the discrimination may affect persons other than the complainant, such corrective action shall include such other persons. Upon completion of each investigation, the contractor will inform every complainant of all of his avenues of appeal.
7.
Training and Promotion.
a. The contractor will assist in locating, qualifying, and increasing the skills of minority group and women employees, and applicants for employment.
b. Consistent with the contractor's work force requirements and as permissible under Federal and State regulations, the contractor shall make full use of training programs,
i.e.
, apprenticeship, and on-the-job training programs for the geographical area of contract performance. Where feasible, 25 percent of apprentices or trainees in each occupation shall be in their first year of apprenticeship or training. In the event the Training Special Provision is provided under this contract, this subparagraph will be superseded as indicated in Attachment 2.
c. The contractor will advise employees and applicants for employment of available training programs and entrance requirements for each.
d. The contractor will periodically review the training and promotion potential of minority group and women employees and will encourage eligible employees to apply for such training and promotion.
8.
Unions.
If the contractor relies in whole or in part upon unions as a source of employees, the contractor will use his/her best efforts to obtain the cooperation of such unions to increase opportunities for minority groups and women within the unions, and to effect referrals by such unions of minority and female employees. Actions by the contractor either directly or through a contractor's association acting as agent will include the procedures set forth below:
a. The contractor will use best efforts to develop, in cooperation with the unions, joint training programs aimed toward qualifying more minority group members and women for membership in the unions and increasing the skills of minority group employees and women so that they may qualify for higher paying employment.
b. The contractor will use best efforts to incorporate an equal employment opportunity clause into each union agreement to the end that such union will be contractually bound to refer applicants without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.
c. The contractor is to obtain information as to the referral practices and policies of the labor union except that to the extent such information is within the exclusive possession of the labor union and such labor union refuses to furnish such information to the contractor, the contractor shall so certify to the State highway department and shall set forth what efforts have been made to obtain such information.
d. In the event the union is unable to provide the contractor with a reasonable flow of minority and women referrals within the time limit set forth in the collective bargaining agreement, the contractor will, through independent recruitment efforts, fill the employment vacancies without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; making full efforts to obtain qualified and/or qualifiable minority group persons and women. (The U.S. Department of Labor has held that it shall be no excuse that the union with which the contractor has a collective bargaining agreement providing for exclusive referral failed to refer minority employees.) In the event the union referral practice prevents the contractor from meeting the obligations pursuant to Executive Order 11246, as amended, and these special provisions, such contractor shall immediately notify the State highway agency.
9.
Subcontracting.
a. The contractor will use his best efforts to solicit bids from and to utilize minority group subcontractors or subcontractors with meaningful minority group and female representation among their employees. Contractors shall obtain lists of minority-owned construction firms from State highway agency personnel.
b. The contractor will use his best efforts to ensure subcontractor compliance with their equal employment opportunity obligations.
10.
Records and Reports.
a. The contractor will keep such records as are necessary to determine compliance with the contractor's equal employment opportunity obligations. The records kept by the contractor will be designed to indicate:
(1) The number of minority and nonminority group members and women employed in each work classification on the project.
(2) The progress and efforts being made in cooperation with unions to increase employment opportunities for minorities and women (applicable only to contractors who rely in whole or in part on unions as a source of their work force),
(3) The progress and efforts being made in locating, hiring, training, qualifying, and upgrading minority and female employees, and
(4) The progress and efforts being made in securing the services of minority group subcontractors or subcontractors with meaningful minority and female representation among their employees.
b. All such records must be retained for a period of three years following completion of the contract work and shall be available at reasonable times and places for inspection by authorized representatives of the State highway agency and the Federal Highway Administration.
c. The contractors will submit an annual report to the State highway agency each July for the duration of the project, indicating the number of minority, women, and non-minority group employees currently engaged in each work classification required by the contract work. This information is to be reported on Form PR 1391. If on-the-job training is being required by “Training Special Provision”, the contractor will be required to furnish Form FHWA 1409.

Pt. 230, Subpt. A, App. B

# Appendix B to Subpart A of Part 230—Training Special Provisions
This Training Special Provision supersedes subparagraph 7b of the Special Provision entitled “Specific Equal Employment Opportunity Responsibilities,” (Attachment 1), and is in implementation of 23 U.S.C. 140(a).
As part of the contractor's equal employment opportunity affirmative action program training shall be provided as follows:
The contractor shall provide on-the-job training aimed at developing full journeymen in the type of trade or job classification involved.
The number of trainees to be trained under the special provisions will be ________ (amount to be filled in by State highway department).
In the event that a contractor subcontracts a portion of the contract work, he shall determine how many, if any, of the trainees are to be trained by the subcontractor, provided, however, that the contractor shall retain the primary responsibility for meeting the training requirements imposed by this special provision. The contractor shall also insure that this training
special provision is made applicable to such subcontract. Where feasible, 25 percent of apprentices or trainees in each occupation shall be in their first year of apprenticeship or training.
The number of trainees shall be distributed among the work classifications on the basis of the contractor's needs and the availability of journeymen in the various classifications within a reasonable area of recruitment. Prior to commencing construction, the contractor shall submit to the State highway agency for approval the number of trainees to be trained in each selected classification and training program to be used. Furthermore, the contractor shall specify the starting time for training in each of the classifications. The contractor will be credited for each trainee employed by him on the contract work who is currently enrolled or becomes enrolled in an approved program and will be reimbursed for such trainees as provided hereinafter.
Training and upgrading of minorities and women toward journeymen status is a primary objective of this Training Special Provision. Accordingly, the contractor shall make every effort to enroll minority trainees and women (e.g., by conducting systematic and direct recruitment through public and private sources likely to yield minority and women trainees) to the extent that such persons are available within a reasonable area of recruitment. The contractor will be responsible for demonstrating the steps that he has taken in pursuance thereof, prior to a determination as to whether the contractor is in compliance with this Training Special Provision. This training commitment is not intended, and shall not be used, to discriminate against any applicant for training, whether a member of a minority group or not.
No employee shall be employed as a trainee in any classification in which he has successfully completed a training course leading to journeyman status or in which he has been employed as a journeyman. The contractor should satisfy this requirement by including appropriate questions in the employee application or by other suitable means. Regardless of the method used the contractor's records should document the findings in each case.
The minimum length and type of training for each classification will be as established in the training program selected by the contractor and approved by the State highway agency and the Federal Highway Administration. The State highway agency and the Federal Highway Administration shall approve a program if it is reasonably calculated to meet the equal employment opportunity obligations of the contractor and to qualify the average trainee for journeyman status in the classification concerned by the end of the training period. Furthermore, apprenticeship programs registered with the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, or with a State apprenticeship agency recognized by the Bureau and training programs approved but not necessarily sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor, Manpower Administration, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training shall also be considered acceptable provided it is being administered in a manner consistent with the equal employment obligations of Federal-aid highway construction contracts. Approval or acceptance of a training program shall be obtained from the State prior to commencing work on the classification covered by the program. It is the intention of these provisions that training is to be provided in the construction crafts rather than clerk-typists or secretarial-type positions. Training is permissible in lower level management positions such as office engineers, estimators, timekeepers, etc., where the training is oriented toward construction applications. Training in the laborer classification may be permitted provided that significant and meaningful training is provided and approved by the division office. Some offsite training is permissible as long as the training is an integral part of an approved training program and does not comprise a significant part of the overall training.
Except as otherwise noted below, the contractor will be reimbursed 80 cents per hour of training given an employee on this contract in accordance with an approved training program. As approved by the engineer, reimbursement will be made for training persons in excess of the number specified herein. This reimbursement will be made even though the contractor receives additional training program funds from other sources, provided such other does not specifically prohibit the contractor from receiving other reimbursement. Reimbursement for offsite training indicated above may only be made to the contractor where he does one or more of the following and the trainees are concurrently employed on a Federal-aid project; contributes to the cost of the training, provides the instruction to the trainee or pays the trainee's wages during the offsite training period.
No payment shall be made to the contractor if either the failure to provide the required training, or the failure to hire the trainee as a journeyman, is caused by the contractor and evidences a lack of good faith on the part of the contractor in meeting the requirements of this Training Special Provision. It is normally expected that a trainee will begin his training on the project as soon as feasible after start of work utilizing the skill involved and remain on the project as long as training opportunities exist in his work classification or until he has completed his training program. It is not required that all trainees be on board for the entire length
of the contract. A contractor will have fulfilled his responsibilities under this Training Special Provision if he has provided acceptable training to the number of trainees specified. The number trained shall be determined on the basis of the total number enrolled on the contract for a significant period.
Trainees will be paid at least 60 percent of the appropriate minimum journeyman's rate specified in the contract for the first half of the training period, 75 percent for the third quarter of the training period, and 90 percent for the last quarter of the training period, unless apprentices or trainees in an approved existing program are enrolled as trainees on this project. In that case, the appropriate rates approved by the Departments of Labor or Transportation in connection with the existing program shall apply to all trainees being trained for the same classification who are covered by this Training Special Provision.
The contractor shall furnish the trainee a copy of the program he will follow in providing the training. The contractor shall provide each trainee with a certification showing the type and length of training satisfactorily completed.
The contractor will provide for the maintenance of records and furnish periodic reports documenting his performance under this Training Special Provision.

# Subpart B—Supportive Services for Minority, Disadvantaged, and Women Business Enterprises

# Source:
50 FR 51243, Dec. 16, 1985, unless otherwise noted.
§ 230.201
Purpose.
To prescribe the policies, procedures, and guidance to develop, conduct, and administer supportive services assistance programs for minority, disadvantaged, and women business enterprises.
§ 230.202
Definitions.
(a)
Minority Business Enterprise,
as used in this subpart, refers to all small
businesses which participate in the Federal-aid highway program as a minority business enterprise (MBE), women business enterprise (WBE), or disadvantaged business enterprise (DBE), all defined under 49 CFR part 23. This expanded definition is used only in this subpart as a simplified way of defining the firms eligible to benefit from this supportive services program.
(b)
Supportive Services
means those services and activities provided in connection with minority business enterprise programs which are designed to increase the total number of minority businesses active in the highway program and contribute to the growth and eventual self-sufficiency of individual minority businesses so that such businesses may achieve proficiency to compete, on an equal basis, for contracts and subcontracts.
(c)
State highway agency
means that department, commission, board, or official of any State charged by its laws with the responsibility for highway construction. The term
State
is considered equivalent to
State highway agency
if the context so implies.
§ 230.203
Policy.
Based on the provisions of Pub. L. 97-424, dated January 6, 1983, it is the policy of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to promote increased participation of minority business enterprises in Federal-aid highway contracts in part through the development and implementation of cost effective supportive services programs through the State highway agencies.
§ 230.204
Implementation of supportive services.
(a) Subject to the availability of funds under 23 U.S.C. 140(c), the State highway agency shall establish procedures to develop, conduct, and administer minority business enterprise training and assistance programs specifically for the benefit of women and minority businesses. Supportive services funds allocated to the States shall not be used to finance the training of State highway agency employees or to provide services in support of such training. State highway agencies are not required to match funds allocated to them under this section. Individual States are encouraged to be actively involved in the provision of supportive services. Such involvement can take the form of staff, funding, and/or direct assistance to augment the supportive services efforts financed by Federal-aid funds.
(b) State highway agencies shall give preference to the following types of services:
(1) Services relating to identification, prequalification, and certification assistance, with emphasis on increasing the total number of legitimate minority business enterprises participating in the Federal-aid highway program;
(2) Services in connection with estimating, bidding, and technical assistance designed to develop and improve the capabilities of minority businesses and assist them in achieving proficiency in the technical skills involved in highway construction;
(3) Services designed to develop and improve the immediate and long-term business management, recordkeeping, and financial accounting capabilities;
(4) Services to assist minority business enterprises to become eligible for and to obtain bonding and financial assistance;
(5) Services relating to verification procedures to ensure that only
bona fide
minority business enterprises are certified as eligible for participation in the Federal-aid highway program;
(6) Follow-up services to ascertain the outcome of training and assistance being provided; and
(7) Other services which contribute to long-term development, increased opportunities, and eventual self-sufficiency of minority business enterprises.
(c) A detailed work statement of the supportive services which the State highway agency considers to meet the guidance under this regulation and a program plan for meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and accomplishing other objectives shall be submitted to the FHWA for approval.
(d) State highway agencies which desire to provide or obtain services other than those listed in paragraph (b) of this section shall submit their proposals to the FHWA for approval.
(e) When the State highway agency provides supportive services by contract, formal advertising is not required by FHWA; however, the State highway agency shall solicit proposals from such qualified sources as will assure the competitive nature of the procurement. The evaluation of proposals by the State highway agency must include consideration of the proposer's ability to effect a productive relationship with majority and minority contractors, contractors' associations, minority groups, and other persons or organizations whose cooperation and assistance will increase the opportunities for minority business enterprises to compete for and perform contracts and subcontracts.
(f) In the selection of contractors to perform supportive services, State highway agencies shall make conscientious efforts to search out, and utilize the services of qualified minority or women organizations, or minority or women enterprises.
(g) As a minimum, State highway agency contracts to obtain supportive services shall include the following provisions:
(1) A statement that a primary purpose of the supportive services is to increase the total number of minority firms participating in the Federal-aid highway program and to contribute to the growth and eventual self-sufficiency of minority firms;
(2) A statement that supportive services shall be provided only to those minority business enterprises determined to be eligible for participation in the Federal-aid highway program in accordance with 49 CFR part 23 and have a work specialty related to the highway construction industry;
(3) A clear and complete statement of the services to be provided under the contract, such as technical assistance, managerial assistance, counseling, certification assistance, and follow-up procedures as set forth in § 230.204(b) of this part;
(4) The nondiscrimination provisions required by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as set forth in Form FHWA-1273, Required Contract Provisions, Federal-Aid Construction Contracts,
1
and a statement of nondiscrimination in employment because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin;
1
Form FHWA-1273 is available for inspection and copying at the locations given in 49 CFR part 7, appendix D, under Document Inspection Facilities, and at all State highway agencies.
(5) The establishment of a definite period of contract performance together with, if appropriate, a schedule stating when specific supportive services are to be provided;
(6) Monthly or quarterly reports to the State highway agency containing sufficient data and narrative content to enable evaluation of both progress and problems;
(7) The basis of payment;
(8) An estimated schedule for expenditures;
(9) The right of access to records and the right to audit shall be granted to authorize State highway agency and FHWA officials;
(10) Noncollusion certification;
(11) A requirement that the contractor provide all information necessary to support progress payments if such are provided for in the contract; and
(12) A termination clause.
(h) The State highway agency is to furnish copies of the reports received under paragraph (g)(6) of this section to the FHWA division office.
[50 FR 51243, Dec. 16, 1985, as amended at 52 FR 36922, Oct. 2, 1987]
§ 230.205
Supportive services funds obligation.
Supportive services funds shall be obligated in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 230.117(b) of this part. The point of obligation is defined as that time when the FHWA has approved a detailed work statement for the supportive services.
§ 230.206
Monitoring supportive services.
Supportive services programs shall be continually monitored and evaluated by the State highway agency so that needed improvements can be identified and instituted. This requires the documentation of valid effectiveness
measures by which the results of program efforts may be accurately assessed.
§ 230.207
Sources of assistance.
It is the policy of the FHWA that all potential sources of assistance to minority business enterprises be utilized. The State highway agency shall take actions to ensure that supportive services contracts reflect the availability of all sources of assistance in order to maximize resource utilization and avoid unnecessary duplication.

# part ii—state highway agency employment
I.
General.
The State highway agency's (SHA) internal program is an integral part of the agency's total activities. It should include the involvement, commitment and support of executives, managers, supervisors and all other employees. For effective administration and implementation of the EEO Program, an affirmative action plan (AAP) is required. The scope of an EEO program and an AAP must be comprehensive, covering all elements of the agency's personnel management policies and practices. The major part of an AAP must be recognition and removal of any barriers to equal employment opportunity, identification of problem areas and of persons unfairly excluded or held back and action enabling them to compete for jobs on an equal basis. An effective AAP not only benefits those who have been denied equal employment opportunity but will also greatly benefit the organization which often has overlooked, screened out or underutilized the great reservoir of untapped human resources and skills, especially among women and minority groups.
Set forth are general guidelines designed to assist the State highway agencies in implementing internal programs, including the development and implementation of AAP's to ensure fair and equal treatment for all persons, regardless of race, color, religion, sex or national origin in all employment practices.
II.
Administration and implementation.
The head of each State highway agency is responsible for the overall administration of the internal EEO program, including the total integration of equal opportunity into all facets of personnel management. However, specific program responsibilities should be assigned for carrying out the program at all management levels.
To ensure effectiveness in the implementation of the internal EEO program, a specific and realistic AAP should be developed. It should include both short and long-range objectives, with priorities and target dates for achieving goals and measuring progress, according to the agency's individual need to overcome existing problems.
A.
State Highway Agency Affirmative Action Officer (internal).
1.
Appointment of Affirmative Action Officer.
The head of the SHA should appoint a qualified Affirmative Action (AA) Officer (Internal EEO Officer) with responsibility and authority to implement the internal EEO program. In making the selection, the following factors should be considered:
a. The person appointed should have proven ability to accomplish major program goals.
b. Managing the internal EEO program requires a major time commitment; it cannot be added on to an existing full-time job.
c. Appointing qualified minority and/or female employees to head or staff the program may offer good role models for present and potential employees and add credibility to the programs involved. However, the most essential requirements for such position(s) are sensitivity to varied ways in which discrimination limits job opportunities, commitment to program goals and sufficient status and ability to work with others in the agency to achieve them.
2.
Responsibilities of the Affirmative Action Officer.
The responsibilities of the AA Officer should include, but not necessarily be limited to:
a. Developing the written AAP.
b. Publicizing its content internally and externally.
c. Assisting managers and supervisors in collecting and analyzing employment data, identifying problem areas, setting goals and timetables and developing programs to achieve goals. Programs should include specific remedies to eliminate any discriminatory practices discovered in the employment system.
d. Handling and processing formal discrimination complaints.
e. Designing, implementing and monitoring internal audit and reporting systems to measure program effectiveness and to determine where progress has been made and where further action is needed.
f. Reporting, at least quarterly, to the head of the SHA on progress and deficiencies of each unit in relation to agency goals.
g. In addition, consider the creation of:
(1) An EEO Advisory Committee, whose membership would include top management officials,
(2) An EEO Employee Committee, whose membership would include rank and file employees, with minority and female representatives from various job levels and departments to meet regularly with the AA officer, and
(3) An EEO Counseling Program to attempt informal resolution of discrimination complaints.
B.
Contents of an affirmative action plan.
The Affirmative Action Plan (AAP) is an integral part of the SHA's EEO program. Although the style and format of AAP's may vary from one SHA to another, the basic substance will generally be the same. The essence of the AAP should include, but not necessarily be limited to:
1. Inclusion of a strong agency policy statement of commitment to EEO.
2. Assignment of responsibility and authority for program to a qualified individual.
3. A survey of the labor market area in terms of population makeup, skills, and availability for employment.
4. Analyzing the present work force to identify jobs, departments and units where minorities and females are underutilized.
5. Setting specific, measurable, attainable hiring and promotion goals, with target dates, in each area of underutilization.
6. Making every manager and supervisor responsible and accountable for meeting these goals.
7. Reevaluating job descriptions and hiring criteria to assure that they reflect actual job needs.
8. Finding minorities and females who are qualified or qualifiable to fill jobs.
9. Getting minorities and females into upward mobility and relevant training programs where they have not had previous access.
10. Developing systems to monitor and measure progress regularly. If results are not satisfactory to meet goals, determine the reasons and make necessary changes.
11. Developing a procedure whereby employees and applicants may process allegations of discrimination to an impartial body without fear of reprisal.
C.
Implementation of an affirmative action plan.
The written AAP is the framework and management tool to be used at all organizational levels to actively implement, measure and evaluate program progress on the specific action items which represent EEO program problems or deficiencies. The presence of a written plan alone does not constitute an EEO program, nor is it, in itself, evidence of an ongoing program. As a minimum, the following specific actions should be taken.
1.
Issue written equal employment opportunity policy statement and affirmative action commitment.
To be effective, EEO policy provisions must be enforced by top management, and all employees must be made aware that EEO is basic agency policy. The head of the SHA (1) should issue a firm statement of personal commitment, legal obligation and the importance of EEO as an agency goal, and (2) assign specific responsibility and accountability to each executive, manager and supervisor.
The statement should include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following elements:
a. EEO for all persons, regardless of race, color, religion, sex or national origin as a fundamental agency policy.
b. Personal commitment to and support of EEO by the head of the SHA.
c. The requirement that special affirmative action be taken throughout the agency to overcome the effects of past discrimination.
d. The requirement that the EEO program be a goal setting program with measurement
and evaluation factors similar to other major agency programs.
e. Equal opportunity in all employment practices, including (but not limited to) recruiting, hiring, transfers, promotions, training, compensation, benefits, recognition (awards), layoffs, and other terminations.
f. Responsibility for positive affirmative action in the discharge of EEO programs, including performance evaluations of managers and supervisors in such functions, will be expected of and shared by all management personnel.
g. Accountability for action or inaction in the area of EEO by management personnel.
2.
Publicize the affirmative action plan.
a.
Internally:
(1) Distribute written communications from the head of the SHA.
(2) Include the AAP and the EEO policy statement in agency operations manual.
(3) Hold individual meetings with managers and supervisors to discuss the program, their individual responsibilities and to review progress.
(4) Place Federal and State EEO posters on bulletin boards, near time clocks and in personnel offices.
(5) Publicize the AAP in the agency newsletters and other publications.
(6) Present and discuss the AAP as a part of employee orientation and all training programs.
(7) Invite employee organization representatives to cooperate and assist in developing and implementing the AAP.
b.
Externally:
Distribute the AAP to minority groups and women's organizations, community action groups, appropriate State agencies, professional organizations, etc.
3.
Develop and implement specific programs to eliminate discriminatory barriers and achieve goals.
a.
Job structuring and upward mobility:
The AAP should include specific provisions for:
(1) Periodic classification plan reviews to correct inaccurate position descriptions and to ensure that positions are allocated to the appropriate classification.
(2) Plans to ensure that all qualification requirements are closely job related.
(3) Efforts to restructure jobs and establish entry level and trainee positions to facilitate progression within occupational areas.
(4) Career counseling and guidance to employees.
(5) Creating career development plans for lower grade employees who are underutilized or who demonstrate potential for advancement.
(6) Widely publicizing upward mobility programs and opportunities within each work unit and within the total organizational structure.
b.
Recruitment and placement.
The AAP should include specific provisions for, but not necessarily limited to:
(1) Active recruitment efforts to support and supplement those of the central personnel agency or department, reaching all appropriate sources to obtain qualified employees on a nondiscriminatory basis.
(2) Maintaining contracts with organizations representing minority groups, women, professional societies, and other sources of candidates for technical, professional and management level positions.
(3) Ensuring that recruitment literature is relevant to all employees, including minority groups and women.
(4) Reviewing and monitoring recruitment and placement procedures so as to assure that no discriminatory practices exist.
(5) Cooperating with management and the central personnel agency on the review and validation of written tests and other selection devices.
(6) Analyzing the flow of applicants through the selection and appointment process, including an analytical review of reasons for rejections.
(7) Monitoring the placement of employees to ensure the assignment of work and workplace on a nondiscriminatory basis.
c.
Promotions.
The AAP should include specific provisions for, but not necessarily limited to:
1. Establishing an agency-wide merit promotion program, including a merit promotion plan, to provide equal opportunity for all persons based on merit and without regard to race, color, religion, sex or national origin.
2. Monitoring the operation of the merit promotion program, including a review of promotion actions, to assure that requirements procedures and practices support EEO program objectives and do not have a discriminatory impact in actual operation.
3. Establishing skills banks to match employee skills with available job advancement opportunities.
4. Evaluating promotion criteria (supervisory evaluations, oral interviews, written tests, qualification standards, etc.) and their use by selecting officials to identify and eliminate factors which may lead to improper “selection out” of employees or applicants, particularly minorities and women, who traditionally have not had access to better jobs. It may be appropriate to require selecting officials to submit a written justification when well qualified persons are passed over for upgrading or promotion.
5. Assuring that all job vacancies are posted conspicuously and that all employees are encouraged to bid on all jobs for which they feel they are qualified.
6. Publicizing the agency merit promotion program by highlighting breakthrough promotions,
i.e.
, advancement of minorities and women to key jobs, new career heights, etc.
d.
Training.
The AAP should include specific provisions for, but not necessarily limited to:
(1) Requiring managers and supervisors to participate in EEO seminars covering the AAP, the overall EEO program and the administration of the policies and procedures incorporated therein, and on Federal, State and local laws relating to EEO.
(2) Training in proper interviewing techniques of employees who conduct employment selection interviews.
(3) Training and education programs designed to provide opportunities for employees to advance in relation to the present and projected manpower needs of the agency and the employees' career goals.
(4) The review of profiles of training course participants to ensure that training opportunities are being offered to all eligible employees on an equal basis and to correct any inequities discovered.
e.
Layoffs, recalls, discharges, demotions, and disciplinary actions.
The standards for deciding when a person shall be terminated, demoted, disciplined, laid off or recalled should be the same for all employees, including minorities and females. Seemingly neutral practices should be reexamined to see if they have a disparate effect on such groups. For example, if more minorities and females are being laid off because they were the last hired, then, adjustments should be made to assure that the minority and female ratios do not decrease because of these actions.
(1) When employees, particularly minorities and females, are disciplined, laid off, discharged or downgraded, it is advisable that the actions be reviewed by the AA Officer before they become final.
(2) Any punitive action (
i.e.
, harassment, terminations, demotions), taken as a result of employees filing discrimination complaints, is illegal.
(3) The following records should be kept to monitor this area of the internal EEO program:
On all terminations, including layoffs and discharges: indicate total number, name, (home address and phone number), employment date, termination date, recall rights, sex, racial/ethnic identification (by job category), type of termination and reason for termination.
On all demotions: indicate total number, name, (home address and phone number), demotion date, sex, racial/ethnic identification (by job category), and reason for demotion.
On all recalls: indicate total number, name, (home address and phone number) recall date, sex, and racial/ethnic identification (by job category).
Exit interviews should be conducted with employees who leave the employment of the SHA.
f.
Other personnel actions.
The AAP should include specific provisions for, but not necessarily limited to:
(1) Assuring that information on EEO counseling and grievance procedures is easily available to all employees.
(2) A system for processing complaints alleging discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin to an impartial body.
(3) A system for processing grievances and appeals (
i.e.
, disciplinary actions, adverse actions, adverse action appeals, etc).
(4) Including in the performance appraisal system a factor to rate manager's and supervisors' performance in discharging the EEO program responsibilities assigned to them.
(5) Reviewing and monitoring the performance appraisal program periodically to determine its objectivity and effectiveness.
(6) Ensuring the equal availability of employee benefits to all employees.
4.
Program evaluation.
An internal reporting system to continually audit, monitor and evaluate programs is essential for a successful AAP. Therefore, a system providing for EEO goals, timetables, and periodic evaluations needs to be established and implemented. Consideration should be given to the following actions:
a. Defining the major objectives of EEO program evaluation.
b. The evaluation should be directed toward results accomplished, not only at efforts made.
c. The evaluation should focus attention on assessing the adequacy of problem identification in the AAP and the extent to which the specific action steps in the plan provide solutions.
d. The AAP should be reviewed and evaluated at least annually. The review and evaluation procedures should include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) Each bureau, division or other major component of the agency should make annual and such other periodic reports as are needed to provide an accurate review of the operations of the AAP in that component.
(2) The AA Officer should make an annual report to the head of the SHA, containing the overall status of the program, results achieved toward established objectives, identity of any particular problems encountered and recommendations for corrective actions needed.
e. Specific, numerical goals and objectives should be established for the ensuing year. Goals should be developed for the SHA as a whole, as well as for each unit and each job category.
III.

§ 230.409
Contract compliance review procedures.
(a)
General.
A compliance review consists of the following elements:
(1) Review Scheduling (Actions R-1 and R-2).
(2) Contractor Notification (Action R-3).
(3) Preliminary Analysis (Phase I) (Action R-4).
(4) Onsite Verification and Interviews (Phase II) (Action R-5).
(5) Exit Conference (Action R-6).
(6) Compliance Determination and Formal Notification (Actions R-8, R-9, R-10, R-11, R-12).
The compliance review procedure, as described herein and in appendix D provides for continual monitoring of the employment process. Monitoring officials at all levels shall analyze submissions from field offices to ensure proper completion of procedural requirements and to ascertain the effectiveness of program implementation.
(b)
Review scheduling.
(
Actions R-1 and R-2
). Because construction work forces are not constant, particular attention should be paid to the proper scheduling of equal opportunity compliance reviews. Priority in scheduling equal opportunity compliance reviews shall be given to reviewing those contractor's work forces:
(1) Which hold the greatest potential for employment and promotion of minorities and women (particularly in higher skilled crafts or occupations);
(2) Working in areas which have significant minority and female labor forces within a reasonable recruitment area;
(3) Working on projects that include special training provisions; and
(4) Where compliance with equal opportunity requirements is questionable. (Based on previous PR-1391's (23 CFR part 230, subpart A, appendix C) Review Reports and Hometown Plan Reports).
In addition, the following considerations shall apply:
(5) Reviews specifically requested by the Washington Headquarters shall receive priority scheduling;
(6) Compliance Reviews in geographical areas covered by areawide plans would normally be reviewed under the Consolidated Compliance Review Procedures set forth in § 230.415.
(7) Reviews shall be conducted prior to or during peak employment periods.
(8) No compliance review shall be conducted that is based on a home office work force of less than 15 employees unless requested or approved by Washington Headquarters; and
(9) For compliance reviews based on an area work force (outside of areawide plan coverage), the Compliance Specialist shall define the applicable geographical area by considering:
(i) Union geographical boundaries;
(ii) The geographical area from which the contractor recruits employees,
i.e.
, reasonable recruitment area;
(iii) Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) or census tracts; and
(iv) The county in which the Federal or Federal-aid project(s) is located and adjacent counties.
(c)
Contractor notification
(
Action R-3
). (1) The Compliance Specialist should usually provide written notification to the contractor of the pending compliance review at least 2 weeks prior to the onsite verification and interviews. This notification shall include the scheduled date(s), an outline of the mechanics and basis of the review, requisite interviews, and documents required.
(2) The contractor shall be requested to provide a meeting place on the day
of the visit either at the local office of the contractor or at the jobsite.
(3) The contractor shall be requested to supply all of the following information to the Compliance Specialist prior to the onsite verification and interviews.
(i) Current Form PR-1391 developed from the most recent payroll;
(ii) Copies of all current bargaining agreements;
(iii) Copies of purchase orders and subcontracts containing the EEO clause;
(iv) A list of recruitment sources available and utilized;
(v) A statement of the status of any action pertaining to employment practices taken by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or other Federal, State, or local agency regarding the contractor or any source of employees;
(vi) A list of promotions made during the past 6 months, to include race, national origin, and sex of employee, previous job held, job promoted into; and corresponding wage rates;
(vii) An annotated payroll to show job classification, race, national origin and sex;
(viii) A list of minority- or female-owned companies contacted as possible subcontractors, vendors, material suppliers, etc.; and
(ix) Any other necessary documents or statements requested by the Compliance Specialist for review prior to the actual onsite visit.
(4) For a project review, the prime contractor shall be held responsible for ensuring that all active subcontractors are present at the meeting and have supplied the documentation listed in § 230.409(c)(3).
(d)
Preliminary analysis
(
Phase I
) (
Action R-4
). Before the onsite verification and interviews, the Compliance Specialist shall analyze the employment patterns, policies, practices, and programs of the contractor to determine whether or not problems exist by reviewing information relative to:
(1) The contractor's current work force;
(2) The contractor's relationship with referral sources, e.g., unions, employment agencies, community action agencies, minority and female organizations, etc.;
(3) The minority and female representation of sources;
(4) The availability of minorities and females with requisite skills in a reasonable recruitment area;
(5) Any pending EEOC or Department of Justice cases or local or State Fair Employment Agency cases which are relevant to the contractor and/or the referral sources; and
(6) The related projects (and/or contractor) files of FHWA regional or division and State Coordinator's offices to obtain current information relating to the status of the contractor's project(s), value, scheduled duration, written corrective action plans, PR-1391 or Manpower Utilization Reports, training requirements, previous compliance reviews, and other pertinent correspondence and/or reports.
(e)
Onsite verification and interviews
(
Phase II
) (
Action R-5
). (1) Phase II of the review consists of the construction or home office site visit(s). During the initial meeting with the contractor, the following topics shall be discussed:
(i) Objectives of the visit;
(ii) The material submitted by the contractor, including the actual implementation of the employee referral source system and any discrepancies found in the material; and
(iii) Arrangements for the site tour(s) and employee interviews.
(2) The Compliance Specialist shall make a physical tour of the employment site(s) to determine that:
(i) EEO posters are displayed in conspicuous places in a legible fashion;
(ii) Facilities are provided on a nonsegregated basis (e.g. work areas, washroom, timeclocks, locker rooms, storage areas, parking lots, and drinking fountains);
(iii) Supervisory personnel have been oriented to the contractor's EEO commitments;
(iv) The employee referral source system is being implemented;
(v) Reported employment data is accurate;
(vi) Meetings have been held with employees to discuss EEO policy, particularly new employees; and
(vii) Employees are aware of their right to file complaints of discrimination.
(3) The Compliance Specialist should interview at least one minority, one nonminority, and one woman in each trade, classification, or occupation. The contractor's superintendent or home office manager should also be interviewed.
(4) The Compliance Specialist shall, on a sample basis, determine the union membership status of union employees on the site (e.g. whether they have permits, membership cards, or books, and in what category they are classified [e.g., A, B, or C]).
(5) The Compliance Specialist shall also determine the method utilized to place employees on the job and whether equal opportunity requirements have been followed.
(6) The Compliance Specialist shall determine, and the report shall indicate the following:
(i) Is there reasonable representation and utilization of minorities and women in each craft, classification or occupation? If not, what has the contractor done to increase recruitment, hiring, upgrading, and training of minorities and women?
(ii) What action is the contractor taking to meet the contractual requirement to provide equal employment opportunity?
(iii) Are the actions taken by the contractor acceptable? Could they reasonably be expected to result in increased utilization of minorities and women?
(iv) Is there impartiality in treatment of minorities and women?
(v) Are affirmative action measures of an isolated nature or are they continuing?
(vi) Have the contractor's efforts produced results?
(f)
Exit conference
(
Action R-6
). (1) During the exit conference with the contractor, the following topics shall be discussed:
(i) Any preliminary findings that, if not corrected immediately or not corrected by the adoption of an acceptable voluntary corrective action plan, would necessitate a determination of noncompliance;
(ii) The process and time in which the contractor shall be informed of the final determination (15 days following the onsite verification and interviews); and
(iii) Any other matters that would best be resolved before concluding the onsite portion of the review.
(2) Voluntary corrective action plans may be negotiated at the exit conference, so that within 15 days following the exit portion of the review, the Compliance Specialist shall prepare the review report and make a determination of either:
(i) Compliance, and so notify the contractor; or
(ii) Noncompliance, and issue a 30-day show cause notice.
The acceptance of a voluntary corrective action plan at the exit conference does not preclude a determination of noncompliance, particularly if deficiencies not addressed by the plan are uncovered during the final analysis and report writing. (Action R-7) A voluntary corrective action plan should be accepted with the understanding that it only address those problems uncovered prior to the exit conference.
(g)
Compliance determinations
(
Action R-8
). (1) The evidence obtained at the compliance review shall constitute a sufficient basis for an objective determination by the Compliance Specialist conducting the review of the contractor's compliance or noncompliance with contractual provisions pursuant to E.O. 11246, as amended, and FHWA EEO Special Provisions implementing the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968, where applicable.
(2) Compliance determinations on contractors working in a Hometown Plan Area shall reflect the status of those crafts covered by part II of the plan bid conditions. Findings regarding part I crafts shall be transmitted through channels to the Washington Headquarters, Office of Civil Rights.
(3) The compliance status of the contractor will usually be reflected by positive efforts in the following areas:
(i) The contractor's equal employment opportunity (EEO) policy;
(ii) Dissemination of the policy and education of supervisory employees concerning their responsibilities in implementing the EEO policy;
(iii) The authority and responsibilities of the EEO officer;

(xi) The adequacy of the contractor's records and reports.
(4) A contractor shall be considered to be in compliance (Action R-9) when the equal opportunity requirements have been effectively implemented, or there is evidence that every good faith effort has been made toward achieving this end. Efforts to acheive this goal shall be result-oriented, initiated and maintained in good faith, and emphasized as any other vital management function.
(5) A contractor shall be considered to be in noncompliance (Action R-10) when:
(i) The contractor has discriminated against applicants or employees with respect to the conditions or privileges of employment; or
(ii) The contractor fails to provide evidence of every good faith effort to provide equal opportunity.
(h)
Show cause procedures
—(1)
General.
Once the onsite verification and exit conference (Action R-5) have been completed and a compliance determination made, (Action R-8), the contractor shall be notified in writing of the compliance determination. (Action R-11 or R-12) This written notification shall be sent to the contractor within 15 days following the completion of the onsite verification and exit conference. If a contractor is found in noncompliance (Action R-10), action efforts to bring the contractor into compliance shall be initiated through the issuance of a show cause notice (Action R-12). The notice shall advise the contractor to show cause within 30 days why sanctions should not be imposed.
(2)
When a show cause notice is required.
A show cause notice shall be issued when a determination of noncompliance is made based upon:
(i) The findings of a compliance review;
(ii) The results of an investigation which verifies the existence of discrimination; or
(iii) Areawide plan reports that show an underutilization of minorities (based on criteria of U.S. Department of Labor's Optional Form 66 “Manpower Utilization Report”) throughout the contractor's work force covered by part II of the plan bid conditions.
(3)
Responsibility for issuance.
(i) Show cause notices will normally be issued by SHA's to federally assisted contractors when the State has made a determination of noncompliance, or when FHWA has made such a determination and has requested the State to issue the notice.
(ii) When circumstances warrant, the Regional Federal Highway Administrator or a designee may exercise primary compliance responsibility by issuing the notice directly to the contractor.
(iii) The Regional Federal Highway Administrators in Regions 8, 10, and the Regional Engineer in Region 15, shall issue show cause notices to direct Federal contractors found in noncompliance.
(4)
Content of show cause notice.
The show cause notice must: (See sample—appendix A of this subpart)

(vi) The 30-day show cause notice shall be issued directly to the noncompliant contractor or subcontractor with an informational copy sent to any concerned prime contractors.
(6)
Conciliation efforts during show cause period.
(i) The Compliance Specialist is required to attempt conciliation with the contractor throughout the show cause time period. Conciliation and negotiation efforts shall be directed toward correcting contractor program deficiencies and initiating corrective action which will maintain and assure equal opportunity. Records shall be maintained in the State, FHWA division, or FHWA regional office's case files, as appropriate, indicating actions and reactions of the contractor, a brief synopsis of any meetings with the contractor, notes on verbal communication and written correspondence, requests for assistance or interpretations, and other relevant matters.
(ii) In instances where a contractor is determined to be in compliance after a show cause notice has been issued, the show cause notice will be recinded and the contractor formally notified (Action R-17). The FHWA Washington Headquarters, Office of Civil Rights, shall immediately be notified of any change in status.
(7)
Corrective action plans.
(i) When a contractor is required to show cause and the deficiencies cannot be corrected within the 30-day show cause period, a written corrective action plan may be accepted. The written corrective action plan shall specify clear unequivocal action by the contractor with time limits for completion. Token actions to correct cited deficiencies will not be accepted. (See Sample Corrective Action Plan—appendix B of this subpart)
(ii) When a contractor submits an acceptable written corrective action plan, the contractor shall be considered in compliance during the plan's effective implementation and submission of required progress reports. (Action R-15 and R-17).
(iii) When an acceptable corrective action plan is not agreed upon and the contractor does not otherwise show cause as required, the formal hearing process shall be recommended through appropriate channels by the compliance specialist immediately upon expiration of the 30-day show cause period. (Action R-16, R-18, R-19)
(iv) When a contractor, after having submitted an acceptable corrective action plan and being determined in compliance is subsequently determined to be in noncompliance based upon the contractor's failure to implement the corrective action plan, the formal hearing process must be recommended immediately. There are no provisions for reinstituting a show cause notice.
(v) When, however, a contractor operating under an acceptable corrective action plan carries out the provisions of the corrective action plan but the actions do not result in the necessary
changes, the corrective action plan shall be immediately amended through negotiations. If, at this point, the contractor refuses to appropriately amend the corrective action plan, the formal hearing process shall be recommended immediately.
(vi) A contractor operating under an approved voluntary corrective action plan (
i.e.
, plan entered into prior to the issuance of a show cause) must be issued a 30-day show cause notice in the situations referred to in paragraphs (h) (7) (iv) and (v) of this section,
i.e.
, failure to implement an approved corrective action plan or failure of corrective actions to result in necessary changes.
(i)
Followup reviews.
(1) A followup review is an extension of the initial review process to verify the contractors performance of corrective action and to validate progress report information. Therefore, followup reviews shall only be conducted of those contractors where the initial review resulted in a finding of noncompliance and a show cause notice was issued.
(2) Followup reviews shall be reported as a narrative summary referencing the initial review report.
(j)
Hearing process.
(1) When such procedures as show cause issuance and conciliation conferences have been unsuccessful in bringing contractors into compliance within the prescribed 30 days, the reviewer (or other appropriate level) shall immediately recommend, through channels, that the Department of Transportation obtain approval from the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs for a formal hearing (Action R-19). The Contractor should be notified of this action.
(2) Recommendations to the Federal Highway Administrator for hearing approval shall be accompanied by full reports of findings and case files containing any related correspondence. The following items shall be included with the recommendation:
(i) Copies of all Federal and Federal-aid contracts and/or subcontracts to which the contractor is party;

(2) SHA's shall refrain from entering into any contract or contract modification subject to E.O. 11246, as amended, with a contractor who has not demonstrated eligibility for Government contracts and federally assisted construction contracts pursuant to E.O. 11246, as amended.
§ 230.411
Guidance for conducting reviews.
(a)
Extensions of time.
Reasonable extensions of time limits set forth in these instructions may be authorized by the SHA's or the FHWA regional office, as appropriate. However, all extensions are subject to Washington Headquarters approval and should only be granted with this understanding. The Federal Highway Administrator shall be notified of all time extensions granted and the justification therefor. In sensitive or special interest cases, simultaneous transmittal of reports and other pertinent documents is authorized.
(b)
Contract completion.
Completion of a contract or seasonal shutdown shall not preclude completion of the administrative procedures outlined herein or the possible imposition of sanctions or debarment.
(c)
Home office reviews outside regions.
When contractor's home offices are located outside the FHWA region in which the particular contract is being performed, and it is determined that the contractors' home offices should be reviewed, requests for such reviews with accompanying justification shall be forwarded through appropriate
channels to the Washington Headquarters, Office of Civil Rights. After approval, the Washington Headquarters, Office of Civil Rights, (OCR) shall request the appropriate region to conduct the home office review.
(d)
Employment of women.
Executive Order 11246, as amended, implementing rules and regulations regarding sex discrimination are outlined in 41 CFR part 60-20. It is the responsibility of the Compliance Specialist to ensure that contractors provide women full participation in their work forces.
(e)
Effect of exclusive referral agreements.
(1) The OFCCP has established the following criteria for determining compliance when an exclusive referral agreement is involved;
(i) It shall be no excuse that the union, with which the contractor has a collective bargaining agreement providing for exclusive referral, failed to refer minority or female employees.
(ii) Discrimination in referral for employment, even if pursuant to provisions of a collective bargaining agreement, is prohibited by the National Labor Relations Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.
(iii) Contractors and subcontractors have a responsibility to provide equal opportunity if they want to participate in federally involved contracts. To the extent they have delegated the responsibility for some of their employment practices to some other organization or agency which prevents them from meeting their obligations, these contractors must be found in noncompliance.
(2) If the contractor indicates that union action or inaction is a proximate cause of the contractor's failure to provide equal opportunity, a finding of noncompliance will be made and a show cause notice issued, and:
(i) The contractor will be formally directed to comply with the equal opportunity requirements.
(ii) Reviews of other contractors with projects within the jurisdiction of the applicable union locals shall be scheduled.
(iii) If the reviews indicate a pattern and/or practice of discrimination on the part of specific union locals, each contractor in the area shall be informed of the criteria outlined in § 230.411(e)(1) of this section. Furthermore, the FHWA Washington Headquarters, OCR, shall be provided with full documentary evidence to support the discriminatory pattern indicated.
(iv) In the event the union referral practices prevent the contractor from meeting the equal opportunity requirements pursuant to the E.O. 11246, as amended, such contractor shall immediately notify the SHA.
§ 230.413
Review reports.
(a)
General.
(1) The Compliance Specialist shall maintain detailed notes from the beginning of the review from which a comprehensive compliance review report can be developed.

§ 230.415
Consolidated compliance reviews.
(a)
General.
Consolidated compliance reviews shall be implemented to determine employment opportunities on an areawide rather than an individual project basis. The consolidated compliance review approach shall be adopted and directed by either Headquarters, region, division, or SHA, however, consolidated reviews shall at all times remain a cooperative effort.
(b) OFCCP policy requires contracting agencies to ensure compliance, in hometown an imposed plan areas, on an areawide rather than a project basis. The consolidated compliance review approach facilitates implementation of this policy.
(c)
Methodology
—(1)
Selection of a target area.
In identifying the target area of a consolidated compliance review (e.g. SMSA, hometown or imposed plan area, a multicounty area, or an entire State), consideration shall at least be given to the following facts:
(i) Minority and female work force concentrations;
(ii) Suspected or alleged discrimination in union membership or referral practices by local unions involved in highway construction;
(iii) Present or potential problem areas;
(iv) The number of highway projects in the target area; and
(v) Hometown or imposed plan reports that indicate underutilization of minorities or females.
(2)
Determine the review period.
After the target area has been selected, the dates for the actual onsite reviews shall be established.
(3)
Obtain background information.
EEO-3's Local Union Reports, should be obtained from regional offices of the EEOC. Target area civilian labor force statistics providing percent minorities and percent females in the target area shall be obtained from State employment security agencies or similar State agencies.
(4)
Identify contractors.
Every nonexempt federally assisted or direct Federal contractor and subcontractor in the target area shall be identified. In order to establish areawide employment patterns in the target area, employment data is needed for all contractors and subcontractors in the area. However, only those contractors with significant work forces (working prior to peak and not recently reviewed) may need to be actually reviwed onsite. Accordingly, once all contractors are identified, those contractors which will actually be reviewed onsite shall be determined. Compliance determinations shall only reflect the status of crafts covered by part II of plan bid conditions. Employment data of crafts covered by part I of plan bid conditions shall be gathered and identified as such in the composite report, however, OFCCP has reserved the responsibility for compliance determinations on crafts covered by part I of the plan bid conditions.
(5)
Contractor notification.
Those contractors selected for onsite review shall be sent a notification letter as outlined in § 230.409(c) along with a request for current workforce data
2
for completion
and submission at the onsite review. Those contractors in the target area not selected for onsite review shall also be requested to supply current workforce data as of the onsite review period, and shall return the data within 15 days following the onsite review period.
2
The Consolidated Workforce Questionnaire is convenient for the purpose and appears as attachment 4 to volume 2, chapter 2, section 3 of the Federal-Aid Highway Program Manual, which is available at the offices listed in 49 CFR part 7, appendix D.
(6)
Onsite reviews.
Compliance reviews shall then be conducted in accordance with the requirements set forth in § 230.409. Reviewers may use Form FHWA-86, Compliance Data Report, if appropriate. It is of particular importance during the onsite reviews that the review team provide for adequate coordination of activities at every stage of the review process.
(7)
Compliance determinations.
Upon completion of the consolidated reviews, compliance determinations shall be made on each review by the reviewer. Individual show cause notices or compliance notifications shall be sent (as appropriate) to each reviewed contractor.
The compliance determination shall be based on the contractor's target area work force (Federal, Federal-aid and non-Federal), except when the target area is coincidental with hometown plan area, compliance determinations must not be based on that part of a contractor's work force covered by part I of the plan bid conditions, as previously set forth in this regulation. For example: ABC Contracting, Inc. employs carpenters, operating engineers, and cement masons. Carpenters and operating engineers are covered by part II of the plan bid conditions, however, cement masons are covered by part I of the plan bid conditions. The compliance determination must be based only on the contractor's utilization of carpenters and operating engineers.
(d)
Reporting
—(1)
Composite report.
A final composite report shall be submitted as a complete package to the Washington Headquarters, OCR, within 45 days after the review period and shall consist of the following:
(i) Compliance review report, for each contractor and subcontractor with accompanying show cause notice or compliance notification.
(ii) Work force data to show the aggregate employment of all contractors in the target area.
(iii) A narrative summary of findings and recommendations to include the following:

Dear Contractor:
As a result of the review of your (Project Number) project located at (Project Location) conducted on (Date) by (Reviewing Agency), it is our determination that you are not in compliance with your equal opportunity requirements and that good faith efforts have not been made to meet your equal opportunity requirements in the following areas:
List of Deficiencies
1.
2.
3.
Your failure to take the contractually required affirmative action has contributed to the unacceptable level of minority and female employment in your operations, particularly in the semiskilled and skilled categories of employees.
The Department of Labor regulations (41 CFR 60) implementing Executive Order 11246, as amended, are applicable to your Federal-aid highway construction contract and are controlling in this matter (see Required Contract Provisions, Form PR-1273, Clause II). Section 60-1.20(b) of these regulations provides that when equal opportunity deficiencies exist, it is necessary that you make a commitment in writing to correct such deficiencies before you may be found in compliance. The commitment must include the specific action which you propose to take to correct each deficiency and the date of completion of such action. The time period allotted shall be no longer than the minimum period necessary to effect the necessary correction. In accordance with instructions issued by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), U.S. Department of Labor, your written commitment must also provide for the submission of monthly progress reports which shall include a head count of minority and female representation at each level of each trade and a list of minority employees.
You are specifically advised that making the commitment discussed above will not preclude a further determination of noncompliance upon a finding that the commitment is not sufficient to achieve compliance.
We will hold a compliance conference at ________________(Address) at ________________ (Time) on ________________(Date) for you to submit and discuss your written commitment. If your written commitment is acceptable and if the commitment is sufficient to achieve compliance, you will be found in compliance during the effective implementation of that commitment. You are cautioned, however, that our determination is subject to review by the Federal Highway Administration, the Department of Transportation, and OFCCP and may be disapproved if your written commitment is not considered sufficient to achieve compliance.
If you indicate either directly or by inaction that you do not wish to participate in the scheduled conference and do not otherwise show cause within 30 days from receipt of this notice why enforcement proceedings should not be instituted, this agency will commence enforcement proceedings under Executive Order 11246, as amended.
If your written commitment is accepted and it is subsequently found that you have failed to comply with its provisions, you will be advised of this determination and formal sanction proceedings will be instituted immediately.
In the event formal sanction proceedings are instituted and the final determination is that a violation of your equal opportunity contract requirements has taken place, any Federal-aid highway construction contracts or subcontracts which you hold may be canceled, terminated, or suspended, and you may be debarred from further such contracts or subcontracts. Such other sanctions as are authorized by Executive Order 11246, as amended, may also be imposed.
We encourage you to take whatever action is necessary to resolve this matter and are anxious to assist you in achieving compliance. Any questions concerning this notice should be addressed to (Name, Address, and Phone).
Sincerely yours,
[41 FR 34245, Aug. 13, 1976]

# Appendix B to Subpart D of Part 230—Sample Corrective Action Plan
Deficiency 1: Sources likely to yield minority employees have not been contacted for recruitment purposes.
Commitment: We have developed a system of written job applications at our home office which readily identifies minority applicants. In addition to this, as a minimum, we will contact the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), League of Latin American Citizens (LULAC), Urban League, and the Employment Security Office within 20 days to establish a referral system for minority group applicants and expand our recruitment base. We are in the process of identifying other community organizations and associations that may be able to provide minority applicants and will submit an updated listing of recruitment sources and evidence of contact by ________________(Date).
Deficiency 2: There have been inadequate efforts to locate, qualify, and increase skills
of minority and female employees and applicants for employment.
Commitment: We will set up an individual file for each apprentice or trainee by ____________(Date) in order to carefully screen the progress, ensure that they are receiving the necessary training, and being promoted promptly upon completion of training requirements. We have established a goal of at least 50 percent of our apprentices and trainees will be minorities and 15 percent will be female. In addition to the commitment made to deficiency number 1, we will conduct a similar identification of organizations able to supply female applicants. Based on our projected personnel needs, we expect to have reached our 50 percent goal for apprentices and trainees by ______________(Date).
Deficiency 3: Very little effort to assure subcontractors have meaningful minority group representation among their employees.
Commitment:
In cooperation with the Regional Office of Minority Business Enterprise, Department of Commerce, and the local NAACP, we have identified seven minority-owned contractors that may be able to work on future contracts we may receive. These contractors (identified in the attached list) will be contacted prior to our bidding on all future contracts. In addition, we have scheduled a meeting with all subcontractors currently working on our contracts. This meeting will be held to inform the subcontractors of our intention to monitor their reports and require meaningful minority representation. This meeting will be held on ____________________(Date) and we will summarize the discussions and current posture of each subcontractor for your review by ____________________(Date) Additionally, as requested, we will submit a PR-1391 on ____________________(Date), ________________________________________(Date), ____________________(Date). Finally, we have committed ourselves to maintaining at least 20 percent minority and female representation in each trade during the time we are carrying out the above commitments. We plan to have completely implemented all the provisions of these commitments by ____________________(Date).

§ 420.105
What is the FHWA's policy on use of FHWA planning and research funds?
(a) If the FHWA determines that planning activities of national significance, identified in paragraph (b) of this section, and the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 134, 135, 303, and 505 are being adequately addressed, the FHWA will allow State DOTs and MPOs:
(1) Maximum possible flexibility in the use of FHWA planning and research funds to meet highway and local public transportation planning and RD
T needs at the national, State, and local levels while ensuring legal use of such funds and avoiding unnecessary duplication of efforts; and
(2) To determine which eligible planning and RD
T activities they desire
to support with FHWA planning and research funds and at what funding level.
(b) The State DOTs must provide data that support the FHWA's responsibilities to the Congress and to the public. These data include, but are not limited to, information required for: preparing proposed legislation and reports to the Congress; evaluating the extent, performance, condition, and use of the Nation's transportation systems; analyzing existing and proposed Federal-aid funding methods and levels and the assignment of user cost responsibility; maintaining a critical information base on fuel availability, use, and revenues generated; and calculating apportionment factors.
(c) The policy in paragraph (a) of this section does not remove the FHWA's responsibility and authority to determine which activities are eligible for funding. Activities proposed to be funded with FHWA planning and research funds by the State DOTs and their subrecipients shall be documented and submitted for FHWA approval and authorization as prescribed in §§ 420.111 and 420.113. (The information collection requirements in paragraph (b) of § 420.105 have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under control numbers 2125-0028 and 2125-0032.)
§ 420.107

(a) A State DOT must expend no less than 25 percent of its annual SPR funds on RD
T activities relating to highway, public transportation, and intermodal transportation systems in accordance with the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 505(b), unless a State DOT certifies, and the FHWA accepts the State DOT's certification, that total expenditures by the State DOT during the fiscal year for transportation planning under 23 U.S.C. 134 and 135 will exceed 75 percent of the amount apportioned for the fiscal year.
(b) Prior to submitting a request for an exception to the 25 percent requirement, the State DOT must ensure that:
(1) The additional planning activities are essential, and there are no other reasonable options available for funding these planning activities (including the use of NHS, STP, MG, or FTA State planning and research funds (49 U.S.C. 5313(b)) or by deferment of lower priority planning activities);
(2) The planning activities have a higher priority than RD
T activities in the overall needs of the State DOT for a given fiscal year; and
(3) The total level of effort by the State DOT in RD
T (using both Federal and State funds) is adequate.
(c) If the State DOT chooses to pursue an exception, it must send the request, along with supporting justification, to the FHWA Division Administrator for action by the FHWA Associate Administrator for Research, Development, and Technology. The Associate Administrator's decision will be based upon the following considerations:
(1) Whether the State DOT has a process for identifying RD
T needs and for implementing a viable RD
T program.
(2) Whether the State DOT is contributing to cooperative RD
T programs or activities, such as the National Cooperative Highway Research Program, the Transportation Research Board, and transportation pooled fund studies.
(3) Whether the State DOT is using SPR funds for technology transfer and for transit or intermodal research and development to help meet the 25 percent minimum requirement.
(4) Whether the State DOT can demonstrate that it will meet the requirement or substantially increase its RD

(5) Whether Federal funds needed for planning exceed the 75 percent limit for the fiscal year and whether any unused planning funds are available from previous fiscal years.
(d) If the FHWA Associate Administrator for Research, Development, and Technology approves the State DOT's request for an exception, the exception is valid only for that fiscal year's funds. A new request must be submitted and approved for subsequent fiscal year funds.
§ 420.109
What are the requirements for distribution of metropolitan planning funds?
(a) The State DOTs shall make all PL funds authorized by 23 U.S.C. 104(f) available to the MPOs in accordance with a formula developed by the State DOT, in consultation with the MPOs, and approved by the FHWA Division Administrator. The formula may allow for a portion of the PL funds to be used by the State DOT, or other agency agreed to by the State DOT and the MPOs, for activities that benefit all MPOs in the State, but State DOTs shall not use any PL funds for grant or subgrant administration. The formula may also provide for a portion of the funds to be made available for discretionary grants to MPOs to supplement their annual amount received under the distribution formula.
(b) In developing the formula for distributing PL funds, the State DOT shall consider population, status of planning, attainment of air quality standards, metropolitan area transportation needs, and other factors necessary to provide for an appropriate distribution of funds to carry out the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 134 and other applicable requirements of Federal law.
(c) The State DOTs shall inform the MPOs and the FHWA Division Office of the amounts allocated to each MPO as soon as possible after PL funds have been apportioned by the FHWA to the State DOTs.
(d) If the State DOT, in a State receiving the minimum apportionment of PL funds under the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 104(f)(2), determines that the share of funds to be allocated to any MPO results in the MPO receiving more funds than necessary to carry out the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 134, the State DOT may, after considering the views of the affected MPO(s) and with the approval of the FHWA Division Administrator, use those funds for transportation planning outside of metropolitan planning areas.
(e) In accordance with the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 134(n), any PL funds not needed for carrying out the metropolitan planning provisions of 23 U.S.C. 134 in any State may be made available by the MPO(s) to the State DOT for funding statewide planning activities under 23 U.S.C. 135, subject to approval by the FHWA Division Administrator.
(f) Any State PL fund distribution formula that does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be brought into conformance with those requirements before distribution on any new apportionment of PL funds.
§ 420.111
What are the documentation requirements for use of FHWA planning and research funds?
(a) Proposed use of FHWA planning and research funds must be documented by the State DOTs and subrecipients in a work program, or other document that describes the work to be accomplished, that is acceptable to the FHWA Division Administrator. Statewide, metropolitan, other transportation planning activities, and transportation RD
T activities may be documented in separate programs, paired in various combinations, or brought together as a single work program. The expenditure of PL funds for transportation planning outside of metropolitan planning areas under § 420.109(d) may be included in the work program for statewide transportation planning activities or in a separate work program submitted by the State DOT.
(b)(1) A work program(s) for transportation planning activities must include a description of work to be accomplished and cost estimates by activity or task. In addition, each work program must include a summary that shows:
(i) Federal share by type of fund;
(ii) Matching rate by type of fund;
(iii) State and/or local matching share; and
(iv) Other State or local funds.
(2) Additional information on metropolitan planning area work programs is contained in 23 CFR part 450. Additional information on RD
T work program content and format is contained in subpart B of this part.
(c) In areas not designated as TMAs, a simplified statement of work that describes who will perform the work and the work that will be accomplished using Federal funds may be used in lieu of a work program. If a simplified statement of work is used, it may be
submitted separately or as part of the Statewide planning work program.
(d) The State DOTs that use separate Federal-aid projects in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section must submit an overall summary that identifies the amounts and sources of FHWA planning and research funds available, matching funds, and the amounts budgeted for each activity (e.g., statewide planning, RD
T, each metropolitan area, contributions to NCHRP and transportation pooled fund studies, etc.).
(e) The State DOTs and MPOs also are encouraged to include cost estimates for transportation planning, research, development, and technology transfer related activities funded with other Federal or State and/or local funds; particularly for producing the FHWA-required data specified in paragraph (b) of § 420.105, for planning for other transportation modes, and for air quality planning activities in areas designated as non-attainment for transportation-related pollutants in their work programs. The MPOs in TMAs must include such information in their work programs. (The information collection requirements in §§ 420.111 have been approved by the OMB and assigned control numbers 2125-0039 for States and 2132-0529 for MPOs.)
§ 420.113
What costs are eligible?
(a) Costs will be eligible for FHWA participation provided that the costs:
(1) Are for work performed for activities eligible under the section of title 23, U.S.C., applicable to the class of funds used for the activities;
(2) Are verifiable from the State DOT's or the subrecipient's records;
(3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project objectives and meet the other criteria for allowable costs in the applicable cost principles cited in 49 CFR 18.22;
(4) Are included in the approved budget, or amendment thereto; and
(5) Were not incurred prior to FHWA authorization.
(b) Indirect costs of State DOTs and their subrecipients are allowable if supported by a cost allocation plan and indirect cost proposal prepared, submitted (if required), and approved by the cognizant or oversight agency in accordance with the OMB requirements applicable to the State DOT or subrecipient specified in 49 CFR 18.22(b).
§ 420.115
What are the FHWA approval and authorization requirements?
(a) The State DOT and its subrecipients must obtain approval and authorization to proceed prior to beginning work on activities to be undertaken with FHWA planning and research funds. Such approvals and authorizations should be based on final work programs or other documents that describe the work to be performed. The State DOT and its subrecipients also must obtain prior approval for budget and programmatic changes as specified in 49 CFR 18.30 or 49 CFR 19.25 and for those items of allowable costs which require approval in accordance with the cost principles specified in 49 CFR 18.22(b) applicable to the entity expending the funds.
(b) Authorization to proceed with the FHWA funded work in whole or in part is a contractual obligation of the Federal government pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 106 and requires that appropriate funds be available for the full Federal share of the cost of work authorized. Those State DOTs that do not have sufficient FHWA planning and research funds or obligation authority available to obligate the full Federal share of a work program or project may utilize the advance construction provisions of 23 U.S.C. 115(a) in accordance with the requirements of 23 CFR part 630, subpart G. The State DOTs that do not meet the advance construction provisions, or do not wish to utilize them, may request authorization to proceed with that portion of the work for which FHWA planning and research funds are available. In the latter case, authorization to proceed may be given for either selected work activities or for a portion of the program period, but such authorization does not constitute a commitment by the FHWA to fund the remaining portion of the work if additional funds do become available.
(c) A project agreement must be executed by the State DOT and the FHWA Division Office for each statewide transportation planning, metropolitan
planning area, or RD
T work program, individual activity or study, or any combination administered as a single Federal-aid project. The project agreement may be executed concurrent with or after authorization has been given by the FHWA Division Administrator to proceed with the work in whole or in part. In the event that the project agreement is executed for only part of the work, the project agreement must be amended when authorization is given to proceed with additional work.
(The information collection requirements in § 420.115(c) have been approved by the OMB and assigned control numbers 2125-0529)

The FHWA may not require more frequent than quarterly reporting unless the criteria in 49 CFR 18.12 or 49 CFR 19.14 are met. Reports are due 90 days after the end of the reporting period for annual and final reports and no later than 30 days after the end of the reporting period for other reports.
(d) Events that have significant impact on the work must be reported as soon as they become known. The types of events or conditions that require reporting include: problems, delays, or adverse conditions that will materially affect the ability to attain program objectives. This disclosure must be accompanied by a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any Federal assistance needed to resolve the situation.
(e) Suitable reports that document the results of activities performed with FHWA planning and research funds must be prepared by the State DOT or subrecipient and submitted for approval by the FHWA Division Administrator prior to publication. The FHWA Division Administrator may waive this requirement for prior approval. The FHWA's approval of reports constitutes acceptance of such reports as evidence of work performed but does not imply endorsement of a report's findings or recommendations. Reports prepared for FHWA-funded work must include appropriate credit references and disclaimer statements. (The information collection requirements in § 420.117 have been approved by the OMB and assigned control numbers 2125-0039 for States and 2132-0529 for MPOs.)
§ 420.119
What are the fiscal requirements?
(a) The maximum rate of Federal participation for FHWA planning and research funds shall be as prescribed in title 23, U.S.C., for the specific class of funds used (
i.e.,
SPR, PL, NHS, STP, or MG) except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. The provisions of 49 CFR 18.24 or 49 CFR 19.23 are applicable to any necessary matching of FHWA planning and research funds.
(b) The value of third party in-kind contributions may be accepted as the match for FHWA planning and research funds, in accordance with the provisions of 49 CFR 18.24(a)(2) or 49 CFR 19.23(a) and may be on either a total planning work program basis or for specific line items or projects. The use of third party in-kind contributions must be identified in the original work program/scope of work and the grant/
subgrant agreement, or amendments thereto. The use of third-party in-kind contributions must be approved in advance by the FHWA Division Administrator and may not be made retroactive prior to approval of the work program/scope of work or an amendment thereto. The State DOT or subrecipient is responsible for ensuring that the following additional criteria are met:
(1) The third party performing the work agrees to allow the value of the work to be used as the match;
(2) The cost of the third party work is not paid for by other Federal funds or used as a match for other federally funded grants/subgrants;
(3) The work performed by the third party is an eligible transportation planning or RD
T related activity that benefits the federally funded work;
(4) The third party costs (
i.e.,
salaries, fringe benefits, etc.) are allowable under the applicable Office of Management and Budget (OMB) cost principles (
i.e.,
OMB Circular A-21, A-87, or A-122);
1
1
OMB Circulars are available on the Internet at
http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/index.html.
(5) The third party work is performed during the period to which the matching requirement applies;
(6) The third party in-kind contributions are verifiable from the records of the State DOT or subrecipient and these records show how the value placed on third party in-kind contributions was derived; and
(7) If the total amount of third party expenditures at the end of the program period is not sufficient to match the total expenditure of Federal funds by the recipient/subrecipient, the recipient/subrecipient will need to make up any shortfall with its own funds.
(c) In accordance with the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 120(j), toll revenues that are generated and used by public, quasi-public, and private agencies to build, improve, or maintain highways, bridges, or tunnels that serve the public purpose of interstate commerce may be used as a credit for the non-Federal share of an FHWA planning and research funded project.
(d) In accordance with 23 U.S.C. 505(c) or 23 U.S.C. 104(f)(3), the requirement for matching SPR or PL funds may be waived if the FHWA determines the interests of the Federal-aid highway program would be best served. Waiver of the matching requirement is intended to encourage State DOTs and/or MPOs to pool SPR and/or PL funds to address national or regional high priority planning or RD
T problems that would benefit multiple States and/or MPOs. Requests for waiver of matching requirements must be submitted to the FHWA headquarters office for approval by the Associate Administrator for Planning and Environment (for planning activities) or the Associate Administrator for Research, Development, and Technology (for RD
T activities). The matching requirement may not be waived for NHS, STP, or MG funds.
(e) NHS, STP, or MG funds used for eligible planning and RD
T purposes must be identified separately from SPR or PL funds in the work program(s) and must be administered and accounted for separately for fiscal purposes. In accordance with the statewide and metropolitan planning process requirements for fiscally constrained transportation improvement program (TIPs) planning or RD
T activities funded with NHS, STP, or MG funds must be included in the Statewide and/or metropolitan TIP(s) unless the State DOT and MPO (for a metropolitan area) agree that they may be excluded from the TIP.
(f) Payment shall be made in accordance with the provisions of 49 CFR 18.21 or 49 CFR 19.22.

# Subpart A—Transportation Planning and Programming Definitions
§ 450.100
Purpose.
The purpose of this subpart is to provide definitions for terms used in this part.
§ 450.102
Applicability.
The definitions in this subpart are applicable to this part, except as otherwise provided.
§ 450.104
Definitions.
Unless otherwise specified, the definitions in 23 U.S.C. 101(a) and 49 U.S.C. 5302 are applicable to this part.
Administrative modification
means a minor revision to a long-range statewide or metropolitan transportation plan, Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), or Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) that includes minor changes to project/project phase costs, minor changes to funding sources of previously included projects, and minor changes to project/project phase initiation dates. An administrative modification is a revision that does not require public review and comment, a redemonstration of fiscal constraint, or a conformity determination (in nonattainment and maintenance areas).
Amendment
means a revision to a long-range statewide or metropolitan transportation plan, TIP, or STIP that involves a major change to a project included in a metropolitan transportation plan, TIP, or STIP, including the addition or deletion of a project or a major change in project cost, project/project phase initiation dates, or a major change in design concept or design scope (e.g., changing project termini or the number of through traffic lanes or changing the number of stations in the case of fixed guideway transit projects). Changes to projects that are included only for illustrative purposes do not require an amendment. An amendment is a revision that requires public review and comment and a redemonstration of fiscal constraint. If an amendment involves “non-exempt” projects in nonattainment and maintenance areas, a conformity determination is required.
Asset management
means a strategic and systematic process of operating, maintaining, and improving physical assets, with a focus on both engineering and economic analysis based upon quality information, to identify a structured sequence of maintenance, preservation, repair, rehabilitation, and replacement actions that will achieve and sustain a desired state of good repair over the lifecycle of the assets at minimum practicable cost.
Attainment area
means any geographic area in which levels of a given criteria air pollutant (e.g., ozone, carbon monoxide, PM
10
, PM
2.5
, and nitrogen dioxide) meet the health-based National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for that pollutant. An area may be an attainment area for one pollutant and a nonattainment area for others. A “maintenance area” (see definition in this section) is not considered an attainment area for transportation planning purposes.
Available funds
means funds derived from an existing source dedicated to or historically used for transportation purposes. For Federal funds, authorized and/or appropriated funds and the extrapolation of formula and discretionary funds at historic rates of increase are considered “available.” A similar approach may be used for State and local funds that are dedicated to or historically used for transportation purposes.
Committed funds
means funds that have been dedicated or obligated for transportation purposes. For State funds that are not dedicated to transportation purposes, only those funds over which the Governor has control
may be considered “committed.” Approval of a TIP by the Governor is considered a commitment of those funds over which the Governor has control. For local or private sources of funds not dedicated to or historically used for transportation purposes (including donations of property), a commitment in writing (e.g., letter of intent) by the responsible official or body having control of the funds may be considered a commitment. For projects involving 49 U.S.C. 5309 funding, execution of a Full Funding Grant Agreement (or equivalent) or an Expedited Grant Agreement (or equivalent) with the DOT shall be considered a multiyear commitment of Federal funds.
Conformity
means a Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7506(c)) requirement that ensures that Federal funding and approval are given to transportation plans, programs and projects that are consistent with the air quality goals established by a State Implementation Plan (SIP). Conformity to the purpose of the SIP means that transportation activities will not cause new air quality violations, worsen existing violations, or delay timely attainment of the NAAQS or any required interim emission reductions or other milestones in any nonattainment or maintenance area. The transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A) sets forth policy, criteria, and procedures for demonstrating and assuring conformity of transportation activities.
Conformity lapse
means, pursuant to section 176(c) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7506(c)), as amended, that the conformity determination for a metropolitan transportation plan or TIP has expired and thus there is no currently conforming metropolitan transportation plan or TIP.
Congestion Management Process
means a systematic approach required in transportation management areas (TMAs) that provides for effective management and operation, based on a cooperatively developed and implemented metropolitan-wide strategy, of new and existing transportation facilities eligible for funding under title 23 U.S.C., and title 49 U.S.C., through the use of travel demand reduction and operational management strategies.
Consideration
means that one or more parties takes into account the opinions, action, and relevant information from other parties in making a decision or determining a course of action.
Consultation
means that one or more parties confer with other identified parties in accordance with an established process and, prior to taking action(s), considers the views of the other parties and periodically informs them about action(s) taken. This definition does not apply to the “consultation” performed by the States and the Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) in comparing the long-range statewide transportation plan and the metropolitan transportation plan, respectively, to State and tribal conservation plans or maps or inventories of natural or historic resources (see section 450.216(j) and sections 450.324(g)(1) and (g)(2)).

(a) In carrying out the statewide transportation planning process, including development of the long-range statewide transportation plan and the STIP, the State shall develop and use a documented public involvement process that provides opportunities for public review and comment at key decision points.
(1) The State's public involvement process at a minimum shall:
(i) Establish early and continuous public involvement opportunities that provide timely information about transportation issues and decisionmaking processes to individuals, affected public agencies, representatives of public transportation employees, public ports, freight shippers, private providers of transportation (including intercity bus operators), representatives of users of public transportation, representatives of users of pedestrian walkways and bicycle transportation facilities, representatives of the disabled, providers of freight transportation services, and other interested parties;
(ii) Provide reasonable public access to technical and policy information used in the development of the long-range statewide transportation plan and the STIP;
(iii) Provide adequate public notice of public involvement activities and time for public review and comment at key decision points, including a reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposed long-range statewide transportation plan and STIP;
(iv) To the maximum extent practicable, ensure that public meetings
are held at convenient and accessible locations and times;
(v) To the maximum extent practicable, use visualization techniques to describe the proposed long-range statewide transportation plan and supporting studies;
(vi) To the maximum extent practicable, make public information available in electronically accessible format and means, such as the World Wide Web, as appropriate to afford reasonable opportunity for consideration of public information;
(vii) Demonstrate explicit consideration and response to public input during the development of the long-range statewide transportation plan and STIP;
(viii) Include a process for seeking out and considering the needs of those traditionally underserved by existing transportation systems, such as low-income and minority households, who may face challenges accessing employment and other services; and
(ix) Provide for the periodic review of the effectiveness of the public involvement process to ensure that the process provides full and open access to all interested parties and revise the process, as appropriate.
(2) The State shall provide for public comment on existing and proposed processes for public involvement in the development of the long-range statewide transportation plan and the STIP. At a minimum, the State shall allow 45 calendar days for public review and written comment before the procedures and any major revisions to existing procedures are adopted. The State shall provide copies of the approved public involvement process document(s) to the FHWA and the FTA for informational purposes.
(3) With respect to the setting of targets, nothing in this part precludes a State from considering comments made as part of the State's public involvement process.
(b) The State shall provide for nonmetropolitan local official participation in the development of the long-range statewide transportation plan and the STIP. The State shall have a documented process(es) for cooperating with nonmetropolitan local officials representing units of general purpose local government and/or local officials with responsibility for transportation that is separate and discrete from the public involvement process and provides an opportunity for their participation in the development of the long-range statewide transportation plan and the STIP. Although the FHWA and the FTA shall not review or approve this cooperative process(es), the State shall provide copies of the process document(s) to the FHWA and the FTA for informational purposes.
(1) At least once every 5 years, the State shall review and solicit comments from nonmetropolitan local officials and other interested parties for a period of not less than 60 calendar days regarding the effectiveness of the cooperative process and any proposed changes. The State shall direct a specific request for comments to the State association of counties, State municipal league, regional planning agencies, or directly to nonmetropolitan local officials.
(2) The State, at its discretion, is responsible for determining whether to adopt any proposed changes. If a proposed change is not adopted, the State shall make publicly available its reasons for not accepting the proposed change, including notification to nonmetropolitan local officials or their associations.
(c) For each area of the State under the jurisdiction of an Indian Tribal government, the State shall develop the long-range statewide transportation plan and STIP in consultation with the Tribal government and the Secretary of the Interior. States shall, to the extent practicable, develop a documented process(es) that outlines roles, responsibilities, and key decision points for consulting with Indian Tribal governments and Department of the Interior in the development of the long-range statewide transportation plan and the STIP.
(d) To carry out the transportation planning process required by this section, a Governor may establish and designate RTPOs to enhance the planning, coordination, and implementation of the long-range statewide transportation plan and STIP, with an emphasis on addressing the needs of nonmetropolitan areas of the State. In
order to be treated as an RTPO for purposes of this Part, any existing regional planning organization must be established and designated as an RTPO under this section.
(1) Where established, an RTPO shall be a multijurisdictional organization of nonmetropolitan local officials or their designees who volunteer for such organization and representatives of local transportation systems who volunteer for such organization.
(2) An RTPO shall establish, at a minimum:
(i) A policy committee, the majority of which shall consist of nonmetropolitan local officials, or their designees, and, as appropriate, additional representatives from the State, private business, transportation service providers, economic development practitioners, and the public in the region; and
(ii) A fiscal and administrative agent, such as an existing regional planning and development organization, to provide professional planning, management, and administrative support.
(3) The duties of an RTPO shall include:
(i) Developing and maintaining, in cooperation with the State, regional long-range multimodal transportation plans;
(ii) Developing a regional TIP for consideration by the State;
(iii) Fostering the coordination of local planning, land use, and economic development plans with State, regional, and local transportation plans and programs;
(iv) Providing technical assistance to local officials;
(v) Participating in national, multistate, and State policy and planning development processes to ensure the regional and local input of nonmetropolitan areas;
(vi) Providing a forum for public participation in the statewide and regional transportation planning processes;
(vii) Considering and sharing plans and programs with neighboring RTPOs, MPOs, and, where appropriate, Indian Tribal Governments; and
(viii) Conducting other duties, as necessary, to support and enhance the statewide planning process under § 450.206.
(4) If a State chooses not to establish or designate an RTPO, the State shall consult with affected nonmetropolitan local officials to determine projects that may be of regional significance.
§ 450.212
Transportation planning studies and project development.
(a) Pursuant to section 1308 of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21 (Pub. L. 105-178), a State(s), MPO(s), or public transportation operator(s) may undertake a multimodal, systems-level corridor or subarea planning study as part of the statewide transportation planning process. To the extent practicable, development of these transportation planning studies shall involve consultation with, or joint efforts among, the State(s), MPO(s), and/or public transportation operator(s). The results or decisions of these transportation planning studies may be used as part of the overall project development process consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321
et seq.
) and associated implementing regulations (23 CFR part 771 and 40 CFR parts 1500-1508). Specifically, these corridor or subarea studies may result in producing any of the following for a proposed transportation project:
(1) Purpose and need or goals and objective statement(s);
(2) General travel corridor and/or general mode(s) definition (e.g., highway, transit, or a highway/transit combination);
(3) Preliminary screening of alternatives and elimination of unreasonable alternatives;
(4) Basic description of the environmental setting; and/or
(5) Preliminary identification of environmental impacts and environmental mitigation.
(b) Publicly available documents or other source material produced by, or in support of, the transportation planning process described in this subpart may be incorporated directly or by reference into subsequent NEPA documents, in accordance with 40 CFR 1502.21, if:
(1) The NEPA lead agencies agree that such incorporation will aid in establishing or evaluating the purpose and need for the Federal action, reasonable alternatives, cumulative or other impacts on the human and natural environment, or mitigation of these impacts; and
(2) The systems-level, corridor, or subarea planning study is conducted with:
(i) Involvement of interested State, local, Tribal, and Federal agencies;
(ii) Public review;
(iii) Reasonable opportunity to comment during the statewide transportation planning process and development of the corridor or subarea planning study;
(iv) Documentation of relevant decisions in a form that is identifiable and available for review during the NEPA scoping process and can be appended to or referenced in the NEPA document; and
(v) The review of the FHWA and the FTA, as appropriate.
(c) By agreement of the NEPA lead agencies, the above integration may be accomplished through tiering (as described in 40 CFR 1502.20), incorporating the subarea or corridor planning study into the draft Environmental Impact Statement or Environmental Assessment, or other means that the NEPA lead agencies deem appropriate. Additional information to further explain the linkages between the transportation planning and project development/NEPA processes is contained in Appendix A to this part, including an explanation that is non-binding guidance material. The guidance in Appendix A applies only to paragraphs (a)-(c) in this section.
(d) In addition to the process for incorporation directly or by reference outlined in paragraph (b) of this section, an additional authority for integrating planning products into the environmental review process exists in 23 U.S.C. 168. As provided in 23 U.S.C. 168(f):
(1) The statutory authority in 23 U.S.C. 168 shall not be construed to limit in any way the continued use of processes established under other parts of this section or under an authority established outside this part, and the use of one of the processes in this section does not preclude the subsequent use of another process in this section or an authority outside of this part.
(2) The statute does not restrict the initiation of the environmental review process during planning.
§ 450.214
Development of programmatic mitigation plans.
(a) A State may utilize the optional framework in this section to develop programmatic mitigation plans as part of the statewide transportation planning process to address the potential environmental impacts of future transportation projects. The State in consultation with FHWA and/or FTA and with the agency or agencies with jurisdiction and special expertise over the resources being addressed in the plan, will determine:
(1)
Scope.
(i) A State may develop a programmatic mitigation plan on a local, regional, ecosystem, watershed, statewide or similar scale.
(ii) The plan may encompass multiple environmental resources within a defined geographic area(s) or may focus on a specific type(s) of resource(s) such as aquatic resources, parkland, or wildlife habitat.
(iii) The plan may address or consider impacts from all projects in a defined geographic area(s) or may focus on a specific type(s) of project(s).
(2)
Contents.
The programmatic mitigation plan may include:
(i) An assessment of the existing condition of natural and human environmental resources within the area covered by the plan, including an assessment of historic and recent trends and/or any potential threats to those resources.
(ii) An identification of economic, social, and natural and human environmental resources within the geographic area that may be impacted and considered for mitigation. Examples of these resources include wetlands, streams, rivers, stormwater, parklands, cultural resources, historic resources, farmlands, archeological resources, threatened or endangered species, and critical habitat. This may include the identification of areas of high conservation concern or value, and thus worthy of avoidance.
(iii) An inventory of existing or planned environmental resource banks for the impacted resource categories such as wetland, stream, stormwater, habitat, species, and an inventory of federally, State, or locally approved in-lieu-of-fee programs.
(iv) An assessment of potential opportunities to improve the overall quality of the identified environmental resources through strategic mitigation for impacts of transportation projects, which may include the prioritization of parcels or areas for acquisition and/or potential resource banking sites.
(v) An adoption or development of standard measures or operating procedures for mitigating certain types of impacts; establishment of parameters for determining or calculating appropriate mitigation for certain types of impacts, such as mitigation ratios, or criteria for determining appropriate mitigation sites.
(vi) Adaptive management procedures, such as protocols or procedures that involve monitoring actual impacts against predicted impacts over time and adjusting mitigation measures in response to information gathered through the monitoring.
(vii) Acknowledgment of specific statutory or regulatory requirements that must be satisfied when determining appropriate mitigation for certain types of resources.
(b) A State may adopt a programmatic mitigation plan developed pursuant to paragraph (a), or developed pursuant to an alternative process as provided for in paragraph (f) of this section through the following process:
(1) Consult with each agency with jurisdiction over the environmental resources considered in the programmatic mitigation plan;
(2) Make available a draft of the programmatic mitigation plan for review and comment by appropriate environmental resource agencies and the public;
(3) Consider comments received from such agencies and the public on the draft plan; and
(4) Address such comments in the final programmatic mitigation plan.
(c) A State may integrate a programmatic mitigation plan with other plans, including, watershed plans, ecosystem plans, species recovery plans, growth management plans, State Wildlife Action Plans, and land use plans.
(d) If a programmatic mitigation plan has been adopted pursuant to paragraph (b), any Federal agency responsible for environmental reviews, permits, or approvals for a transportation project shall give substantial weight to the recommendations in the programmatic mitigation plan when carrying out its responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321
et seq.
) (NEPA) or other Federal environmental law.
(e) Nothing in this section limits the use of programmatic approaches for reviews under NEPA.
(f) Nothing in this section prohibits the development, as part of or separate from the transportation planning process, of a programmatic mitigation plan independent of the framework described in paragraph (a) of this section. Further, nothing in this section prohibits the adoption of a programmatic mitigation plan in the statewide and nonmetropolitan transportation planning process that was developed under another authority, independent of the framework described in paragraph (a).
§ 450.216
Development and content of the long-range statewide transportation plan.
(a) The State shall develop a long-range statewide transportation plan, with a minimum 20-year forecast period at the time of adoption, that provides for the development and implementation of the multimodal transportation system for the State. The long-range statewide transportation plan shall consider and include, as applicable, elements and connections between public transportation, non-motorized modes, rail, commercial motor vehicle, waterway, and aviation facilities, particularly with respect to intercity travel.
(b) The long-range statewide transportation plan should include capital, operations and management strategies, investments, procedures, and other measures to ensure the preservation and most efficient use of the existing transportation system including consideration of the role that intercity buses may play in reducing congestion,
pollution, and energy consumption in a cost-effective manner and strategies and investments that preserve and enhance intercity bus systems, including systems that are privately owned and operated. The long-range statewide transportation plan may consider projects and strategies that address areas or corridors where current or projected congestion threatens the efficient functioning of key elements of the State's transportation system.
(c) The long-range statewide transportation plan shall reference, summarize, or contain any applicable short-range planning studies; strategic planning and/or policy studies; transportation needs studies; management systems reports; emergency relief and disaster preparedness plans; and any statements of policies, goals, and objectives on issues (e.g., transportation, safety, economic development, social and environmental effects, or energy), as appropriate, that were relevant to the development of the long-range statewide transportation plan.
(d) The long-range statewide transportation plan should integrate the priorities, goals, countermeasures, strategies, or projects contained in the HSIP, including the SHSP, required under 23 U.S.C. 148, the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan required under 49 U.S.C. 5329(d), or an Interim Agency Safety Plan in accordance with 49 CFR part 659, as in effect until completion of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan.
(e) The long-range statewide transportation plan should include a security element that incorporates or summarizes the priorities, goals, or projects set forth in other transit safety and security planning and review processes, plans, and programs, as appropriate.
(f) The statewide transportation plan shall include:
(1) A description of the performance measures and performance targets used in assessing the performance of the transportation system in accordance with § 450.206(c); and
(2) A system performance report and subsequent updates evaluating the condition and performance of the transportation system with respect to the performance targets described in § 450.206(c), including progress achieved by the MPO(s) in meeting the performance targets in comparison with system performance recorded in previous reports.
(g) Within each metropolitan area of the State, the State shall develop the long-range statewide transportation plan in cooperation with the affected MPOs.
(h) For nonmetropolitan areas, the State shall develop the long-range statewide transportation plan in cooperation with affected nonmetropolitan local officials with responsibility for transportation or, if applicable, through RTPOs described in § 450.210(d) using the State's cooperative process(es) established under § 450.210(b).
(i) For each area of the State under the jurisdiction of an Indian Tribal government, the State shall develop the long-range statewide transportation plan in consultation with the Tribal government and the Secretary of the Interior consistent with § 450.210(c).
(j) The State shall develop the long-range statewide transportation plan, as appropriate, in consultation with State, Tribal, and local agencies responsible for land use management, natural resources, environmental protection, conservation, and historic preservation. This consultation shall involve comparison of transportation plans to State and Tribal conservation plans or maps, if available, and comparison of transportation plans to inventories of natural or historic resources, if available.
(k) A long-range statewide transportation plan shall include a discussion of potential environmental mitigation activities and potential areas to carry out these activities, including activities that may have the greatest potential to restore and maintain the environmental functions affected by the long-range statewide transportation plan. The discussion may focus on policies, programs, or strategies, rather than at the project level. The State shall develop the discussion in consultation with applicable Federal, State, regional, local and Tribal land management, wildlife, and regulatory
agencies. The State may establish reasonable timeframes for performing this consultation.
(l) In developing and updating the long-range statewide transportation plan, the State shall provide:
(1) To nonmetropolitan local elected officials, or, if applicable, through RTPOs described in § 450.210(d), an opportunity to participate in accordance with § 450.216(h); and
(2) To individuals, affected public agencies, representatives of public transportation employees, public ports, freight shippers, private providers of transportation (including intercity bus operators, employer-based cash-out program, shuttle program, or telework program), representatives of users of public transportation, representatives of users of pedestrian walkways and bicycle transportation facilities, representatives of the disabled, providers of freight transportation services, and other interested parties with a reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposed long-range statewide transportation plan. In carrying out these requirements, the State shall use the public involvement process described under § 450.210(a).
(m) The long-range statewide transportation plan may include a financial plan that demonstrates how the adopted long-range statewide transportation plan can be implemented, indicates resources from public and private sources that are reasonably expected to be made available to carry out the plan, and recommends any additional financing strategies for needed projects and programs. In addition, for illustrative purposes, the financial plan may include additional projects that the State would include in the adopted long-range statewide transportation plan if additional resources beyond those identified in the financial plan were to become available. The financial plan may include an assessment of the appropriateness of innovative finance techniques (for example, tolling, pricing, bonding, public-private partnerships, or other strategies) as revenue sources.
(n) The State is not required to select any project from the illustrative list of additional projects included in the financial plan described in paragraph (m) of this section.
(o) The State shall publish or otherwise make available the long-range statewide transportation plan for public review, including (to the maximum extent practicable) in electronically accessible formats and means, such as the World Wide Web, as described in § 450.210(a).
(p) The State shall continually evaluate, revise, and periodically update the long-range statewide transportation plan, as appropriate, using the procedures in this section for development and establishment of the long-range statewide transportation plan.
(q) The State shall provide copies of any new or amended long-range statewide transportation plan documents to the FHWA and the FTA for informational purposes.
§ 450.218
Development and content of the statewide transportation improvement program (STIP).
(a) The State shall develop a statewide transportation improvement program (STIP) for all areas of the State. The STIP shall cover a period of no less than 4 years and shall be updated at least every 4 years, or more frequently if the Governor of the State elects a more frequent update cycle. However, if the STIP covers more than 4 years, the FHWA and the FTA will consider the projects in the additional years as informational. In case of difficulties developing a portion of the STIP for a particular area (e.g., metropolitan planning area, nonattainment or maintenance area, or Indian Tribal lands), the State may develop a partial STIP covering the rest of the State.
(b) For each metropolitan area in the State, the State shall develop the STIP in cooperation with the MPO designated for the metropolitan area. The State shall include each metropolitan TIP without change in the STIP, directly or by reference, after approval of the TIP by the MPO and the Governor. A metropolitan TIP in a nonattainment or maintenance area is subject to a FHWA/FTA conformity finding before inclusion in the STIP. In areas outside a metropolitan planning area but within an air quality nonattainment or maintenance area containing any part
of a metropolitan area, projects must be included in the regional emissions analysis that supported the conformity determination of the associated metropolitan TIP before they are added to the STIP.
(c) For each nonmetropolitan area in the State, the State shall develop the STIP in cooperation with affected nonmetropolitan local officials with responsibility for transportation or, if applicable, through RTPOs described in § 450.210(d) using the State's consultation process(es) established under § 450.210(b).
(d) For each area of the State under the jurisdiction of an Indian Tribal government, the STIP shall be developed in consultation with the Tribal government and the Secretary of the Interior.
(e) Tribal Transportation Program, Federal Lands Transportation Program, and Federal Lands Access Program TIPs shall be included without change in the STIP, directly or by reference, once approved by the FHWA pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 201(c)(4).
(f) The Governor shall provide all interested parties with a reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposed STIP as required by § 450.210(a).
(g) The STIP shall include capital and non-capital surface transportation projects (or phases of projects) within the boundaries of the State proposed for funding under title 23 U.S.C. and title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 (including transportation alternatives and associated transit improvements; Tribal Transportation Program projects, Federal Lands Transportation Program projects, and Federal Lands Access Program projects; HSIP projects; trails projects; and accessible pedestrian walkways and bicycle facilities), except the following that may be included:
(1) Safety projects funded under 23 U.S.C. 402 and 49 U.S.C. 31102;
(2) Metropolitan planning projects funded under 23 U.S.C. 104(d) and 49 U.S.C. 5305(d);
(3) State planning and research projects funded under 23 U.S.C. 505 and 49 U.S.C. 5305(e);
(4) State planning and research projects funded with Surface Transportation Program funds;
(5) Emergency relief projects (except those involving substantial functional, locational, or capacity changes);
(6) Research, development, demonstration, and deployment projects funded under 49 U.S.C. 5312, and technical assistance and standards development projects funded under 49 U.S.C. 5314;
(7) Project management oversight projects funded under 49 U.S.C. 5327; and
(8) State safety oversight programs funded under 49 U.S.C. 5329.
(h) The STIP shall contain all regionally significant projects requiring an action by the FHWA or the FTA whether or not the projects are to be funded with 23 U.S.C. Chapters 1 and 2 or title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 funds (e.g., addition of an interchange to the Interstate System with State, local, and/or private funds, and congressionally designated projects not funded under title 23 U.S.C. or title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53). For informational and conformity purposes, the STIP shall include (if appropriate and included in any TIPs) all regionally significant projects proposed to be funded with Federal funds other than those administered by the FHWA or the FTA, as well as all regionally significant projects to be funded with non-Federal funds.
(i) The STIP shall include for each project or phase (e.g., preliminary engineering, environment/NEPA, right-of-way, design, or construction) the following:
(1) Sufficient descriptive material (
i.e.,
type of work, termini, and length) to identify the project or phase;
(2) Estimated total project cost or a project cost range, which may extend beyond the 4 years of the STIP;
(3) The amount of Federal funds proposed to be obligated during each program year. For the first year, this includes the proposed category of Federal funds and source(s) of non-Federal funds. For the second, third, and fourth years, this includes the likely category or possible categories of Federal funds and sources of non-Federal funds; and
(4) Identification of the agencies responsible for carrying out the project or phase.
(j) Projects that are not considered to be of appropriate scale for individual
identification in a given program year may be grouped by function, work type, and/or geographic area using the applicable classifications under 23 CFR 771.117(c) and (d) and/or 40 CFR part 93. In nonattainment and maintenance areas, project classifications must be consistent with the “exempt project” classifications contained in the EPA's transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A). In addition, projects proposed for funding under title 23 U.S.C. Chapter 2 that are not regionally significant may be grouped in one line item or identified individually in the STIP.
(k) Each project or project phase included in the STIP shall be consistent with the long-range statewide transportation plan developed under § 450.216 and, in metropolitan planning areas, consistent with an approved metropolitan transportation plan developed under § 450.324.
(l) The STIP may include a financial plan that demonstrates how the approved STIP can be implemented, indicates resources from public and private sources that are reasonably expected to be available to carry out the STIP, and recommends any additional financing strategies for needed projects and programs. In addition, for illustrative purposes, the financial plan may include additional projects that would be included in the adopted STIP if reasonable additional resources beyond those identified in the financial plan were to become available. The State is not required to select any project from the illustrative list for implementation, and projects on the illustrative list cannot be advanced to implementation without an action by the FHWA and the FTA on the STIP. Revenue and cost estimates for the STIP must use an inflation rate to reflect “year of expenditure dollars,” based on reasonable financial principles and information, developed cooperatively by the State, MPOs, and public transportation operators.
(m) In nonattainment and maintenance areas, projects included in the first 2 years of the STIP shall be limited to those for which funds are available or committed. Financial constraint of the STIP shall be demonstrated and maintained by year and shall include sufficient financial information to demonstrate which projects are to be implemented using current and/or reasonably available revenues, while federally supported facilities are being adequately operated and maintained. In the case of proposed funding sources, strategies for ensuring their availability shall be identified in the financial plan consistent with paragraph (l) of this section. For purposes of transportation operations and maintenance, the STIP shall include financial information containing system-level estimates of costs and revenue sources that are reasonably expected to be available to adequately operate and maintain Federal-aid highways (as defined by 23 U.S.C. 101(a)(5)) and public transportation (as defined by title 49 U.S.C. 5302).
(n) Projects in any of the first 4 years of the STIP may be advanced in place of another project in the first 4 years of the STIP, subject to the project selection requirements of § 450.222. In addition, subject to FHWA/FTA approval (see § 450.220), the State may revise the STIP at any time under procedures agreed to by the State, MPO(s), and public transportation operators consistent with the STIP development procedures established in this section, as well as the procedures for participation by interested parties (see § 450.210(a)). Changes that affect fiscal constraint must take place by amendment of the STIP.
(o) The STIP shall include a project, or an identified phase of a project, only if full funding can reasonably be anticipated to be available for the project within the time period contemplated for completion of the project.
(p) In cases where the FHWA and the FTA find a STIP to be fiscally constrained, and a revenue source is subsequently removed or substantially reduced (
i.e.,
by legislative or administrative actions), the FHWA and the FTA will not withdraw the original determination of fiscal constraint. However, in such cases, the FHWA and the FTA will not act on an updated or amended STIP that does not reflect the changed revenue situation.
(q) A STIP shall include, to the maximum extent practicable, a discussion of the anticipated effect of the STIP
toward achieving the performance targets identified by the State in the statewide transportation plan or other State performance-based plan(s), linking investment priorities to those performance targets.
[81 FR 34135, May 27, 2016, as amended at 81 FR 93470, Dec. 20, 2016; 82 FR 56543, Nov. 29, 2017]
§ 450.220
Self-certifications, Federal findings, and Federal approvals.
(a) At least every 4 years, the State shall submit an updated STIP concurrently to the FHWA and the FTA for joint approval.

(i) Approve the entire STIP;
(ii) Approve the STIP subject to certain corrective actions by the State; or
(iii) Under special circumstances, approve a partial STIP covering only a portion of the State.
(2) If the FHWA and the FTA jointly determine and document in the planning finding that a submitted STIP or amended STIP does not substantially meet the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 135, 49 U.S.C. 5304, and this part for any identified categories of projects, the FHWA and the FTA will not approve the STIP.
(c) The approval period for a new or amended STIP shall not exceed 4 years. If a State demonstrates, in writing, that extenuating circumstances will delay the submittal of a new or amended STIP past its update deadline, the FHWA and the FTA will consider and take appropriate action on a request to extend the approval beyond 4 years for all or part of the STIP for a period not to exceed 180 calendar days. In these cases, priority consideration will be given to projects and strategies involving the operation and management of the multimodal transportation system. Where the request involves projects in
a metropolitan planning area(s), the affected MPO(s) must concur in the request. If the delay was due to the development and approval of a metropolitan TIP(s), the affected MPO(s) must provide supporting information, in writing, for the request.
(d) Where necessary in order to maintain or establish highway and transit operations, the FHWA and the FTA may approve operating assistance for specific projects or programs, even though the projects or programs may not be included in an approved STIP.
§ 450.222
Project selection from the STIP.
(a) Except as provided in § 450.218(g) and § 450.220(d), only projects in a FHWA/FTA approved STIP are eligible for funds administered by the FHWA or the FTA.
(b) In metropolitan planning areas, transportation projects proposed for funds administered by the FHWA or the FTA shall be selected from the approved STIP in accordance with project selection procedures provided in § 450.332.
(c) In nonmetropolitan areas, with the exclusion of specific projects as described in this section, the State shall select projects from the approved STIP in cooperation with the affected nonmetropolitan local officials, or if applicable, through RTPOs described in § 450.210(e). The State shall select transportation projects undertaken on the NHS, under the Bridge and Interstate Maintenance programs in title 23 U.S.C. and under sections 5310 and 5311 of title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 from the approved STIP in consultation with the affected nonmetropolitan local officials with responsibility for transportation.
(d) Tribal Transportation Program, Federal Lands Transportation Program, and Federal Lands Access Program projects shall be selected from the approved STIP in accordance with the procedures developed pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 201, 202, 203, and 204.
(e) The projects in the first year of an approved STIP shall constitute an “agreed to” list of projects for subsequent scheduling and implementation. No further action under paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section is required for the implementing agency to proceed with these projects. If Federal funds available are significantly less than the authorized amounts, or where there is significant shifting of projects among years, § 450.332(a) provides for a revised list of “agreed to” projects to be developed upon the request of the State, MPO, or public transportation operator(s). If an implementing agency wishes to proceed with a project in the second, third, or fourth year of the STIP, the procedures in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section or expedited procedures that provide for the advancement of projects from the second, third, or fourth years of the STIP may be used, if agreed to by all parties involved in the selection process.
§ 450.224
Applicability of NEPA to statewide transportation plans and programs.
Any decision by the Secretary concerning a long-range statewide transportation plan or STIP developed through the processes provided for in 23 U.S.C. 135, 49 U.S.C. 5304, and this subpart shall not be considered to be a Federal action subject to review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321
et seq.
).

(b) MPO designation shall be made by agreement between the Governor and units of general purpose local government that together represent at least 75 percent of the affected population (including the largest incorporated city, based on population, as named by the Bureau of the Census) or in accordance with procedures established by applicable State or local law.
(c) The FHWA and the FTA shall identify as a TMA each urbanized area with a population of over 200,000 individuals, as defined by the Bureau of the Census. The FHWA and the FTA shall also designate any urbanized area as a TMA on the request of the Governor and the MPO designated for that area.
(d) TMA structure:
(1) Not later than October 1, 2014, each metropolitan planning organization that serves a designated TMA shall consist of:
(i) Local elected officials;
(ii) Officials of public agencies that administer or operate major modes of transportation in the metropolitan area, including representation by providers of public transportation; and
(iii) Appropriate State officials.
(2) An MPO may be restructured to meet the requirements of this paragraph (d) without undertaking a redesignation.
(3)
Representation
. (i) Designation or selection of officials or representatives under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be determined by the MPO according to the bylaws or enabling statute of the organization.
(ii) Subject to the bylaws or enabling statute of the MPO, a representative of a provider of public transportation may also serve as a representative of a local municipality.
(iii) An official described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) shall have responsibilities, actions, duties, voting rights, and any other authority commensurate with other officials described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to interfere with the authority, under any State law in effect on December 18, 1991, of a public agency with multimodal transportation responsibilities—
(i) To develop the plans and TIPs for adoption by an MPO; and
(ii) To develop long-range capital plans, coordinate transit services and
projects, and carry out other activities pursuant to State law.
(e) To the extent possible, only one MPO shall be designated for each urbanized area or group of contiguous urbanized areas. More than one MPO may be designated to serve an urbanized area only if the Governor(s) and the existing MPO, if applicable, determine that the size and complexity of the urbanized area-make designation of more than one MPO appropriate. In those cases where two or more MPOs serve the same urbanized area, the MPOs shall establish official, written agreements that clearly identify areas of coordination, and the division of transportation planning responsibilities among the MPOs.
(f) Nothing in this subpart shall be deemed to prohibit an MPO from using the staff resources of other agencies, non-profit organizations, or contractors to carry out selected elements of the metropolitan transportation planning process.
(g) An MPO designation shall remain in effect until an official redesignation has been made in accordance with this section.
(h) An existing MPO may be redesignated only by agreement between the Governor and units of general purpose local government that together represent at least 75 percent of the existing metropolitan planning area population (including the largest incorporated city, based on population, as named by the Bureau of the Census).
(i) For the purposes of redesignation, units of general purpose local government may be defined as elected officials from each unit of general purpose local government located within the metropolitan planning area served by the existing MPO.
(j) Redesignation of an MPO (in accordance with the provisions of this section) is required whenever the existing MPO proposes to make:
(1) A substantial change in the proportion of voting members on the existing MPO representing the largest incorporated city, other units of general purpose local government served by the MPO, and the State(s); or
(2) A substantial change in the decisionmaking authority or responsibility of the MPO, or in decisionmaking procedures established under MPO by-laws.
(k) Redesignation of an MPO serving a multistate metropolitan planning area requires agreement between the Governors of each State served by the existing MPO and units of general purpose local government that together represent at least 75 percent of the existing metropolitan planning area population (including the largest incorporated city, based on population, as named by the Bureau of the Census).
(l) The following changes to an MPO do not require a redesignation (as long as they do not trigger a substantial change as described in paragraph (j) of this section):
(1) The identification of a new urbanized area (as determined by the Bureau of the Census) within an existing metropolitan planning area;
(2) Adding members to the MPO that represent new units of general purpose local government resulting from expansion of the metropolitan planning area;
(3) Adding members to satisfy the specific membership requirements described in paragraph (d) of this section for an MPO that serves a TMA; or
(4) Periodic rotation of members representing units of general-purpose local government, as established under MPO by-laws.

(1) Enter into agreements or compacts, not in conflict with any law of the United States, for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in support of activities authorized under 23 U.S.C. 134 and 49 U.S.C. 5303 as the activities pertain to interstate areas and localities within the States; and
(2) Establish such agencies, joint or otherwise, as the States may determine desirable for making the agreements and compacts effective.
[81 FR 34135, May 27, 2016, as amended at 81 FR 93470, Dec. 20, 2016; 82 FR 56543, Nov. 29, 2017]
§ 450.312
Metropolitan Planning Area boundaries.
(a) The boundaries of a metropolitan planning area (MPA) shall be determined by agreement between the MPO and the Governor.
(1) At a minimum, the MPA boundaries shall encompass the entire existing urbanized area (as defined by the Bureau of the Census) plus the contiguous area expected to become urbanized within a 20-year forecast period for the metropolitan transportation plan.
(2) The MPA boundaries may be further expanded to encompass the entire metropolitan statistical area or combined statistical area, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget.
(b) An MPO that serves an urbanized area designated as a nonattainment area for ozone or carbon monoxide under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401
et seq.
) as of August 10, 2005, shall retain the MPA boundary that existed on August 10, 2005. The MPA boundaries for such MPOs may only be adjusted by agreement of the Governor and the affected MPO in accordance with the redesignation procedures described in § 450.310(h). The MPA boundary for an MPO that serves an urbanized area designated as a nonattainment area for ozone or carbon monoxide under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401
et seq.
) after August 10, 2005, may be established to coincide with the designated boundaries of the ozone and/or carbon monoxide nonattainment area, in accordance with the requirements in § 450.310(b).
(c) An MPA boundary may encompass more than one urbanized area.
(d) MPA boundaries may be established to coincide with the geography of regional economic development and growth forecasting areas.
(e) Identification of new urbanized areas within an existing metropolitan planning area by the Bureau of the Census shall not require redesignation of the existing MPO.
(f) Where the boundaries of the urbanized area or MPA extend across two or more States, the Governors with responsibility for a portion of the multistate area, the appropriate MPO(s), and the public transportation operator(s) are strongly encouraged to coordinate transportation planning for the entire multistate area.
(g) The MPA boundaries shall not overlap with each other.
(h) Where part of an urbanized area served by one MPO extends into an adjacent MPA, the MPOs shall, at a minimum, establish written agreements that clearly identify areas of coordination and the division of transportation planning responsibilities among and between the MPOs. Alternatively, the MPOs may adjust their existing boundaries so that the entire urbanized area lies within only one MPA. Boundary adjustments that change the composition of the MPO may require redesignation of one or more such MPOs.
(i) The MPO (in cooperation with the State and public transportation operator(s)) shall review the MPA boundaries after each Census to determine if existing MPA boundaries meet the minimum statutory requirements for new and updated urbanized area(s), and shall adjust them as necessary. As appropriate, additional adjustments should be made to reflect the most comprehensive boundary to foster an effective planning process that ensures connectivity between modes, improves access to modal systems, and promotes efficient overall transportation investment strategies.
(j) Following MPA boundary approval by the MPO and the Governor, the MPA boundary descriptions shall be provided for informational purposes to the FHWA and the FTA. The MPA boundary descriptions shall be submitted either as a geo-spatial database or described in sufficient detail to enable the boundaries to be accurately delineated on a map.
[82 FR 56543, Nov. 29, 2017]
§ 450.314
Metropolitan planning agreements.
(a) The MPO, the State(s), and the providers of public transportation shall cooperatively determine their mutual responsibilities in carrying out the metropolitan transportation planning process. These responsibilities shall be clearly identified in written agreements among the MPO, the State(s), and the providers of public transportation serving the MPA. To the extent possible, a single agreement between
all responsible parties should be developed. The written agreement(s) shall include specific provisions for the development of financial plans that support the metropolitan transportation plan (see § 450.324) and the metropolitan TIP (see § 450.326), and development of the annual listing of obligated projects (see § 450.334).
(b) The MPO, the State(s), and the providers of public transportation should periodically review and update the agreement, as appropriate, to reflect effective changes.
(c) If the MPA does not include the entire nonattainment or maintenance area, there shall be a written agreement among the State department of transportation, State air quality agency, affected local agencies, and the MPO describing the process for cooperative planning and analysis of all projects outside the MPA within the nonattainment or maintenance area. The agreement must also indicate how the total transportation-related emissions for the nonattainment or maintenance area, including areas outside the MPA, will be treated for the purposes of determining conformity in accordance with the EPA's transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A). The agreement shall address policy mechanisms for resolving conflicts concerning transportation-related emissions that may arise between the MPA and the portion of the nonattainment or maintenance area outside the MPA.
(d) In nonattainment or maintenance areas, if the MPO is not the designated agency for air quality planning under section 174 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7504), there shall be a written agreement between the MPO and the designated air quality planning agency describing their respective roles and responsibilities for air quality related transportation planning.
(e) If more than one MPO has been designated to serve an urbanized area there shall be a written agreement among the MPOs, the State(s), and the public transportation operator(s) describing how the metropolitan transportation planning processes will be coordinated to assure the development of consistent metropolitan transportation plans and TIPs across the MPA boundaries, particularly in cases in which a proposed transportation investment extends across the boundaries of more than one MPA. If any part of the urbanized area is a nonattainment or maintenance area, the agreement also shall include State and local air quality agencies. The metropolitan transportation planning processes for affected MPOs should, to the maximum extent possible, reflect coordinated data collection, analysis, and planning assumptions across the MPAs. Alternatively, a single metropolitan transportation plan and/or TIP for the entire urbanized area may be developed jointly by the MPOs in cooperation with their respective planning partners. Coordination efforts and outcomes shall be documented in subsequent transmittals of the UPWP and other planning products, including the metropolitan transportation plan and TIP, to the State(s), the FHWA, and the FTA.
(f) Where the boundaries of the urbanized area or MPA extend across two or more States, the Governors with responsibility for a portion of the multistate area, the appropriate MPO(s), and the public transportation operator(s) shall coordinate transportation planning for the entire multistate area. States involved in such multistate transportation planning may:
(1) Enter into agreements or compacts, not in conflict with any law of the United States, for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in support of activities authorized under this section as the activities pertain to interstate areas and localities within the States; and
(2) Establish such agencies, joint or otherwise, as the States may determine desirable for making the agreements and compacts effective.
(g) If part of an urbanized area that has been designated as a TMA overlaps into an adjacent MPA serving an urbanized area that is not designated as a TMA, the adjacent urbanized area shall not be treated as a TMA. However, a written agreement shall be established between the MPOs with MPA boundaries, including a portion of the TMA, which clearly identifies the roles and
responsibilities of each MPO in meeting specific TMA requirements (e.g., congestion management process, Surface Transportation Program funds suballocated to the urbanized area over 200,000 population, and project selection).
(h)(1) The MPO(s), State(s), and the providers of public transportation shall jointly agree upon and develop specific written provisions for cooperatively developing and sharing information related to transportation performance data, the selection of performance targets, the reporting of performance targets, the reporting of performance to be used in tracking progress toward attainment of critical outcomes for the region of the MPO (see § 450.306(d)), and the collection of data for the State asset management plan for the NHS for each of the following circumstances:
(i) When one MPO serves an urbanized area;
(ii) When more than one MPO serves an urbanized area; and

§ 450.318
Transportation planning studies and project development.
(a) Pursuant to section 1308 of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21 (Pub. L. 105-178), an MPO(s), State(s), or public transportation operator(s) may undertake a multimodal, systems-level corridor or subarea planning study as part of the metropolitan transportation planning process. To the extent practicable, development of these transportation planning studies shall involve consultation with, or joint efforts among, the MPO(s), State(s), and/or public transportation operator(s). The results or decisions of these transportation planning studies may be used as part of the overall project development process consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321
et seq.
) and associated implementing regulations (23 CFR part 771 and 40 CFR parts 1500-1508). Specifically, these corridor or subarea studies
may result in producing any of the following for a proposed transportation project:
(1) Purpose and need or goals and objective statement(s);
(2) General travel corridor and/or general mode(s) definition (e.g., highway, transit, or a highway/transit combination);
(3) Preliminary screening of alternatives and elimination of unreasonable alternatives;
(4) Basic description of the environmental setting; and/or
(5) Preliminary identification of environmental impacts and environmental mitigation.
(b) Publicly available documents or other source material produced by, or in support of, the transportation planning process described in this subpart may be incorporated directly or by reference into subsequent NEPA documents, in accordance with 40 CFR 1502.21, if:
(1) The NEPA lead agencies agree that such incorporation will aid in establishing or evaluating the purpose and need for the Federal action, reasonable alternatives, cumulative or other impacts on the human and natural environment, or mitigation of these impacts; and
(2) The systems-level, corridor, or subarea planning study is conducted with:
(i) Involvement of interested State, local, Tribal, and Federal agencies;
(ii) Public review;
(iii) Reasonable opportunity to comment during the metropolitan transportation planning process and development of the corridor or subarea planning study;
(iv) Documentation of relevant decisions in a form that is identifiable and available for review during the NEPA scoping process and can be appended to or referenced in the NEPA document; and
(v) The review of the FHWA and the FTA, as appropriate.
(c) By agreement of the NEPA lead agencies, the above integration may be accomplished through tiering (as described in 40 CFR 1502.20), incorporating the subarea or corridor planning study into the draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or Environmental Assessment, or other means that the NEPA lead agencies deem appropriate.
(d) Additional information to further explain the linkages between the transportation planning and project development/NEPA processes is contained in Appendix A to this part, including an explanation that it is non-binding guidance material. The guidance in Appendix A applies only to paragraphs (a)-(c) in this section.
(e) In addition to the process for incorporation directly or by reference outlined in paragraph (b) of this section, an additional authority for integrating planning products into the environmental review process exists in 23 U.S.C. 168. As provided in 23 U.S.C. 168(f):
(1) The statutory authority in 23 U.S.C. 168 shall not be construed to limit in any way the continued use of processes established under other parts of this section or under an authority established outside of this part, and the use of one of the processes in this section does not preclude the subsequent use of another process in this section or an authority outside of this part.
(2) The statute does not restrict the initiation of the environmental review process during planning.
§ 450.320
Development of programmatic mitigation plans.
(a) An MPO may utilize the optional framework in this section to develop programmatic mitigation plans as part of the metropolitan transportation planning process to address the potential environmental impacts of future transportation projects. The MPO, in consultation with the FHWA and/or the FTA and with the agency or agencies with jurisdiction and special expertise over the resources being addressed in the plan, will determine:
(1)
Scope.
(i) An MPO may develop a programmatic mitigation plan on a local, regional, ecosystem, watershed, statewide or similar scale.
(ii) The plan may encompass multiple environmental resources within a defined geographic area(s) or may focus on a specific type(s) of resource(s) such as aquatic resources, parkland, or wildlife habitat.
(iii) The plan may address or consider impacts from all projects in a defined geographic area(s) or may focus on a specific type(s) of project(s).
(2)
Contents.
The programmatic mitigation plan may include:
(i) An assessment of the existing condition of natural and human environmental resources within the area covered by the plan, including an assessment of historic and recent trends and/or any potential threats to those resources.
(ii) An identification of economic, social, and natural and human environmental resources within the geographic area that may be impacted and considered for mitigation. Examples of these resources include wetlands, streams, rivers, stormwater, parklands, cultural resources, historic resources, farmlands, archeological resources, threatened or endangered species, and critical habitat. This may include the identification of areas of high conservation concern or value and thus worthy of avoidance.
(iii) An inventory of existing or planned environmental resource banks for the impacted resource categories such as wetland, stream, stormwater, habitat, species, and an inventory of federally, State, or locally approved in-lieu-of-fee programs.
(iv) An assessment of potential opportunities to improve the overall quality of the identified environmental resources through strategic mitigation for impacts of transportation projects which may include the prioritization of parcels or areas for acquisition and/or potential resource banking sites.
(v) An adoption or development of standard measures or operating procedures for mitigating certain types of impacts; establishment of parameters for determining or calculating appropriate mitigation for certain types of impacts, such as mitigation ratios, or criteria for determining appropriate mitigation sites.
(vi) Adaptive management procedures, such as protocols or procedures that involve monitoring actual impacts against predicted impacts over time and adjusting mitigation measures in response to information gathered through the monitoring.
(vii) Acknowledgement of specific statutory or regulatory requirements that must be satisfied when determining appropriate mitigation for certain types of resources.
(b) A MPO may adopt a programmatic mitigation plan developed pursuant to paragraph (a), or developed pursuant to an alternative process as provided for in paragraph (f) of this section through the following process:
(1) Consult with each agency with jurisdiction over the environmental resources considered in the programmatic mitigation plan;
(2) Make available a draft of the programmatic mitigation plan for review and comment by appropriate environmental resource agencies and the public;
(3) Consider comments received from such agencies and the public on the draft plan; and
(4) Address such comments in the final programmatic mitigation plan.
(c) A programmatic mitigation plan may be integrated with other plans, including watershed plans, ecosystem plans, species recovery plans, growth management plans, State Wildlife Action Plans, and land use plans.
(d) If a programmatic mitigation plan has been adopted pursuant to paragraph (b), any Federal agency responsible for environmental reviews, permits, or approvals for a transportation project shall give substantial weight to the recommendations in the programmatic mitigation plan when carrying out its responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321
et seq.
) (NEPA) or other Federal environmental law.
(e) Nothing in this section limits the use of programmatic approaches for reviews under NEPA.
(f) Nothing in this section prohibits the development, as part of or separate from the transportation planning process, of a programmatic mitigation plan independent of the framework described in paragraph (a) of this section. Further, nothing in this section prohibits the adoption of a programmatic mitigation plan in the metropolitan planning process that was developed under another authority, independent of the framework described in paragraph (a).
§ 450.322
Congestion management process in transportation management areas.
(a) The transportation planning process in a TMA shall address congestion management through a process that provides for safe and effective integrated management and operation of the multimodal transportation system, based on a cooperatively developed and implemented metropolitan-wide strategy, of new and existing transportation facilities eligible for funding under title 23 U.S.C. and title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 through the use of travel demand reduction (including intercity bus operators, employer-based commuting programs such as a carpool program, vanpool program, transit benefit program, parking cash-out program, shuttle program, or telework program), job access projects, and operational management strategies.
(b) The development of a congestion management process should result in multimodal system performance measures and strategies that can be reflected in the metropolitan transportation plan and the TIP.
(c) The level of system performance deemed acceptable by State and local transportation officials may vary by type of transportation facility, geographic location (metropolitan area or subarea), and/or time of day. In addition, consideration should be given to strategies that manage demand, reduce single occupant vehicle (SOV) travel, improve transportation system management and operations, and improve efficient service integration within and across modes, including highway, transit, passenger and freight rail operations, and non-motorized transport. Where the addition of general purpose lanes is determined to be an appropriate congestion management strategy, explicit consideration is to be given to the incorporation of appropriate features into the SOV project to facilitate future demand management strategies and operational improvements that will maintain the functional integrity and safety of those lanes.
(d) The congestion management process shall be developed, established, and implemented as part of the metropolitan transportation planning process that includes coordination with transportation system management and operations activities. The congestion management process shall include:
(1) Methods to monitor and evaluate the performance of the multimodal transportation system, identify the underlying causes of recurring and non-recurring congestion, identify and evaluate alternative strategies, provide information supporting the implementation of actions, and evaluate the effectiveness of implemented actions;
(2) Definition of congestion management objectives and appropriate performance measures to assess the extent of congestion and support the evaluation of the effectiveness of congestion reduction and mobility enhancement strategies for the movement of people and goods. Since levels of acceptable system performance may vary among local communities, performance measures should be tailored to the specific needs of the area and established cooperatively by the State(s), affected MPO(s), and local officials in consultation with the operators of major modes of transportation in the coverage area, including providers of public transportation;
(3) Establishment of a coordinated program for data collection and system performance monitoring to define the extent and duration of congestion, to contribute in determining the causes of congestion, and evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of implemented actions. To the extent possible, this data collection program should be coordinated with existing data sources (including archived operational/ITS data) and coordinated with operations managers in the metropolitan area;
(4) Identification and evaluation of the anticipated performance and expected benefits of appropriate congestion management strategies that will contribute to the more effective use and improved safety of existing and future transportation systems based on the established performance measures. The following categories of strategies, or combinations of strategies, are some examples of what should be appropriately considered for each area:
(i) Demand management measures, including growth management, and congestion pricing;
(ii) Traffic operational improvements;
(iii) Public transportation improvements;
(iv) ITS technologies as related to the regional ITS architecture; and
(v) Where necessary, additional system capacity.
(5) Identification of an implementation schedule, implementation responsibilities, and possible funding sources for each strategy (or combination of strategies) proposed for implementation; and
(6) Implementation of a process for periodic assessment of the effectiveness of implemented strategies, in terms of the area's established performance measures. The results of this evaluation shall be provided to decision makers and the public to provide guidance on selection of effective strategies for future implementation.
(e) In a TMA designated as nonattainment area for ozone or carbon monoxide pursuant to the Clean Air Act, Federal funds may not be programmed for any project that will result in a significant increase in the carrying capacity for SOVs (
i.e.,
a new general purpose highway on a new location or adding general purpose lanes, with the exception of safety improvements or the elimination of bottlenecks), unless the project is addressed through a congestion management process meeting the requirements of this section.
(f) In TMAs designated as nonattainment for ozone or carbon monoxide, the congestion management process shall provide an appropriate analysis of reasonable (including multimodal) travel demand reduction and operational management strategies for the corridor in which a project that will result in a significant increase in capacity for SOVs (as described in paragraph (d) of this section) is proposed to be advanced with Federal funds. If the analysis demonstrates that travel demand reduction and operational management strategies cannot fully satisfy the need for additional capacity in the corridor and additional SOV capacity is warranted, then the congestion management process shall identify all reasonable strategies to manage the SOV facility safely and effectively (or to facilitate its management in the future). Other travel demand reduction and operational management strategies appropriate for the corridor, but not appropriate for incorporation into the SOV facility itself, shall also be identified through the congestion management process. All identified reasonable travel demand reduction and operational management strategies shall be incorporated into the SOV project or committed to by the State and MPO for implementation.
(g) State laws, rules, or regulations pertaining to congestion management systems or programs may constitute the congestion management process, if the FHWA and the FTA find that the State laws, rules, or regulations are consistent with, and fulfill the intent of, the purposes of 23 U.S.C. 134 and 49 U.S.C. 5303.
(h)
Congestion management plan.
A MPO serving a TMA may develop a plan that includes projects and strategies that will be considered in the TIP of such MPO.
(1) Such plan shall:
(i) Develop regional goals to reduce vehicle miles traveled during peak commuting hours and improve transportation connections between areas with high job concentration and areas with high concentrations of low-income households;
(ii) Identify existing public transportation services, employer based commuter programs, and other existing transportation services that support access to jobs in the region; and
(iii) Identify proposed projects and programs to reduce congestion and increase job access opportunities.
(2) In developing the congestion management plan, an MPO shall consult with employers, private and nonprofit providers of public transportation, transportation management organizations, and organizations that provide job access reverse commute projects or job-related services to low-income individuals.
§ 450.324
Development and content of the metropolitan transportation plan.
(a) The metropolitan transportation planning process shall include the development of a transportation plan addressing no less than a 20-year planning horizon as of the effective date. In formulating the transportation plan, the MPO shall consider factors described in § 450.306 as the factors relate to a minimum 20-year forecast period. In nonattainment and maintenance areas, the effective date of the transportation plan shall be the date of a conformity determination issued by the FHWA and the FTA. In attainment areas, the effective date of the transportation plan shall be its date of adoption by the MPO.
(b) The transportation plan shall include both long-range and short-range strategies/actions that provide for the development of an integrated multimodal transportation system (including accessible pedestrian walkways and bicycle transportation facilities) to facilitate the safe and efficient movement of people and goods in addressing current and future transportation demand.
(c) The MPO shall review and update the transportation plan at least every 4 years in air quality nonattainment and maintenance areas and at least every 5 years in attainment areas to confirm the transportation plan's validity and consistency with current and forecasted transportation and land use conditions and trends and to extend the forecast period to at least a 20-year planning horizon. In addition, the MPO may revise the transportation plan at any time using the procedures in this section without a requirement to extend the horizon year. The MPO shall approve the transportation plan (and any revisions) and submit it for information purposes to the Governor. Copies of any updated or revised transportation plans must be provided to the FHWA and the FTA.
(d) In metropolitan areas that are in nonattainment for ozone or carbon monoxide, the MPO shall coordinate the development of the metropolitan transportation plan with the process for developing transportation control measures (TCMs) in a State Implementation Plan (SIP).
(e) The MPO, the State(s), and the public transportation operator(s) shall validate data used in preparing other existing modal plans for providing input to the transportation plan. In updating the transportation plan, the MPO shall base the update on the latest available estimates and assumptions for population, land use, travel, employment, congestion, and economic activity. The MPO shall approve transportation plan contents and supporting analyses produced by a transportation plan update.
(f) The metropolitan transportation plan shall, at a minimum, include:
(1) The current and projected transportation demand of persons and goods in the metropolitan planning area over the period of the transportation plan;
(2) Existing and proposed transportation facilities (including major roadways, public transportation facilities, intercity bus facilities, multimodal and intermodal facilities, nonmotorized transportation facilities (e.g., pedestrian walkways and bicycle facilities), and intermodal connectors) that should function as an integrated metropolitan transportation system, giving emphasis to those facilities that serve important national and regional transportation functions over the period of the transportation plan.
(3) A description of the performance measures and performance targets used in assessing the performance of the transportation system in accordance with § 450.306(d).
(4) A system performance report and subsequent updates evaluating the condition and performance of the transportation system with respect to the performance targets described in § 450.306(d), including—
(i) Progress achieved by the metropolitan planning organization in meeting the performance targets in comparison with system performance recorded in previous reports, including baseline data; and
(ii) For metropolitan planning organizations that voluntarily elect to develop multiple scenarios, an analysis of how the preferred scenario has improved the conditions and performance of the transportation system and how
changes in local policies and investments have impacted the costs necessary to achieve the identified performance targets.
(5) Operational and management strategies to improve the performance of existing transportation facilities to relieve vehicular congestion and maximize the safety and mobility of people and goods;
(6) Consideration of the results of the congestion management process in TMAs that meet the requirements of this subpart, including the identification of SOV projects that result from a congestion management process in TMAs that are nonattainment for ozone or carbon monoxide.
(7) Assessment of capital investment and other strategies to preserve the existing and projected future metropolitan transportation infrastructure, provide for multimodal capacity increases based on regional priorities and needs, and reduce the vulnerability of the existing transportation infrastructure to natural disasters. The metropolitan transportation plan may consider projects and strategies that address areas or corridors where current or projected congestion threatens the efficient functioning of key elements of the metropolitan area's transportation system.
(8) Transportation and transit enhancement activities, including consideration of the role that intercity buses may play in reducing congestion, pollution, and energy consumption in a cost-effective manner and strategies and investments that preserve and enhance intercity bus systems, including systems that are privately owned and operated, and including transportation alternatives, as defined in 23 U.S.C. 101(a), and associated transit improvements, as described in 49 U.S.C. 5302(a), as appropriate;
(9) Design concept and design scope descriptions of all existing and proposed transportation facilities in sufficient detail, regardless of funding source, in nonattainment and maintenance areas for conformity determinations under the EPA's transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A). In all areas (regardless of air quality designation), all proposed improvements shall be described in sufficient detail to develop cost estimates;
(10) A discussion of types of potential environmental mitigation activities and potential areas to carry out these activities, including activities that may have the greatest potential to restore and maintain the environmental functions affected by the metropolitan transportation plan. The discussion may focus on policies, programs, or strategies, rather than at the project level. The MPO shall develop the discussion in consultation with applicable Federal, State, and Tribal land management, wildlife, and regulatory agencies. The MPO may establish reasonable timeframes for performing this consultation;
(11) A financial plan that demonstrates how the adopted transportation plan can be implemented.
(i) For purposes of transportation system operations and maintenance, the financial plan shall contain system-level estimates of costs and revenue sources that are reasonably expected to be available to adequately operate and maintain the Federal-aid highways (as defined by 23 U.S.C. 101(a)(5)) and public transportation (as defined by title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53).
(ii) For the purpose of developing the metropolitan transportation plan, the MPO(s), public transportation operator(s), and State shall cooperatively develop estimates of funds that will be available to support metropolitan transportation plan implementation, as required under § 450.314(a). All necessary financial resources from public and private sources that are reasonably expected to be made available to carry out the transportation plan shall be identified.
(iii) The financial plan shall include recommendations on any additional financing strategies to fund projects and programs included in the metropolitan transportation plan. In the case of new funding sources, strategies for ensuring their availability shall be identified. The financial plan may include an assessment of the appropriateness of innovative finance techniques (for example, tolling, pricing, bonding, public private partnerships, or other strategies) as revenue sources for projects in the plan.
(iv) In developing the financial plan, the MPO shall take into account all projects and strategies proposed for funding under title 23 U.S.C., title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 or with other Federal funds; State assistance; local sources; and private participation. Revenue and cost estimates that support the metropolitan transportation plan must use an inflation rate(s) to reflect “year of expenditure dollars,” based on reasonable financial principles and information, developed cooperatively by the MPO, State(s), and public transportation operator(s).
(v) For the outer years of the metropolitan transportation plan (
i.e.,
beyond the first 10 years), the financial plan may reflect aggregate cost ranges/cost bands, as long as the future funding source(s) is reasonably expected to be available to support the projected cost ranges/cost bands.
(vi) For nonattainment and maintenance areas, the financial plan shall address the specific financial strategies required to ensure the implementation of TCMs in the applicable SIP.
(vii) For illustrative purposes, the financial plan may include additional projects that would be included in the adopted transportation plan if additional resources beyond those identified in the financial plan were to become available.
(viii) In cases that the FHWA and the FTA find a metropolitan transportation plan to be fiscally constrained and a revenue source is subsequently removed or substantially reduced (
i.e.,
by legislative or administrative actions), the FHWA and the FTA will not withdraw the original determination of fiscal constraint; however, in such cases, the FHWA and the FTA will not act on an updated or amended metropolitan transportation plan that does not reflect the changed revenue situation.
(12) Pedestrian walkway and bicycle transportation facilities in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 217(g).
(g) The MPO shall consult, as appropriate, with State and local agencies responsible for land use management, natural resources, environmental protection, conservation, and historic preservation concerning the development of the transportation plan. The consultation shall involve, as appropriate:
(1) Comparison of transportation plans with State conservation plans or maps, if available; or
(2) Comparison of transportation plans to inventories of natural or historic resources, if available.
(h) The metropolitan transportation plan should integrate the priorities, goals, countermeasures, strategies, or projects for the metropolitan planning area contained in the HSIP, including the SHSP required under 23 U.S.C. 148, the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan required under 49 U.S.C. 5329(d), or an Interim Agency Safety Plan in accordance with 49 CFR part 659, as in effect until completion of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan, and may incorporate or reference applicable emergency relief and disaster preparedness plans and strategies and policies that support homeland security, as appropriate, to safeguard the personal security of all motorized and non-motorized users.
(i) An MPO may, while fitting the needs and complexity of its community, voluntarily elect to develop multiple scenarios for consideration as part of the development of the metropolitan transportation plan.
(1) An MPO that chooses to develop multiple scenarios under this paragraph (i) is encouraged to consider:
(i) Potential regional investment strategies for the planning horizon;
(ii) Assumed distribution of population and employment;
(iii) A scenario that, to the maximum extent practicable, maintains baseline conditions for the performance areas identified in § 450.306(d) and measures established under 23 CFR part 490;
(iv) A scenario that improves the baseline conditions for as many of the performance measures identified in § 450.306(d) as possible;
(v) Revenue constrained scenarios based on the total revenues expected to be available over the forecast period of the plan; and
(vi) Estimated costs and potential revenues available to support each scenario.
(2) In addition to the performance areas identified in 23 U.S.C. 150(c), 49 U.S.C. 5326(c), and 5329(d), and the
measures established under 23 CFR part 490, MPOs may evaluate scenarios developed under this paragraph using locally developed measures.
(j) The MPO shall provide individuals, affected public agencies, representatives of public transportation employees, public ports, freight shippers, providers of freight transportation services, private providers of transportation (including intercity bus operators, employer-based commuting programs, such as carpool program, vanpool program, transit benefit program, parking cashout program, shuttle program, or telework program), representatives of users of public transportation, representatives of users of pedestrian walkways and bicycle transportation facilities, representatives of the disabled, and other interested parties with a reasonable opportunity to comment on the transportation plan using the participation plan developed under § 450.316(a).
(k) The MPO shall publish or otherwise make readily available the metropolitan transportation plan for public review, including (to the maximum extent practicable) in electronically accessible formats and means, such as the World Wide Web.
(l) A State or MPO is not required to select any project from the illustrative list of additional projects included in the financial plan under paragraph (f)(11) of this section.
(m) In nonattainment and maintenance areas for transportation-related pollutants, the MPO, as well as the FHWA and the FTA, must make a conformity determination on any updated or amended transportation plan in accordance with the Clean Air Act and the EPA transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A). A 12-month conformity lapse grace period will be implemented when an area misses an applicable deadline, in accordance with the Clean Air Act and the transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A). At the end of this 12-month grace period, the existing conformity determination will lapse. During a conformity lapse, MPOs can prepare an interim metropolitan transportation plan as a basis for advancing projects that are eligible to proceed under a conformity lapse. An interim metropolitan transportation plan consisting of eligible projects from, or consistent with, the most recent conforming transportation plan and TIP may proceed immediately without revisiting the requirements of this section, subject to interagency consultation defined in 40 CFR part 93, subpart A. An interim metropolitan transportation plan containing eligible projects that are not from, or consistent with, the most recent conforming transportation plan and TIP must meet all the requirements of this section.
[81 FR 34135, May 27, 2016, as amended at 81 FR 93473, Dec. 20, 2016; 82 FR 56544, Nov. 29, 2017]
§ 450.326
Development and content of the transportation improvement program (TIP).
(a) The MPO, in cooperation with the State(s) and any affected public transportation operator(s), shall develop a TIP for the metropolitan planning area. The TIP shall reflect the investment priorities established in the current metropolitan transportation plan and shall cover a period of no less than 4 years, be updated at least every 4 years, and be approved by the MPO and the Governor. However, if the TIP covers more than 4 years, the FHWA and the FTA will consider the projects in the additional years as informational. The MPO may update the TIP more frequently, but the cycle for updating the TIP must be compatible with the STIP development and approval process. The TIP expires when the FHWA/FTA approval of the STIP expires. Copies of any updated or revised TIPs must be provided to the FHWA and the FTA. In nonattainment and maintenance areas subject to transportation conformity requirements, the FHWA and the FTA, as well as the MPO, must make a conformity determination on any updated or amended TIP, in accordance with the Clean Air Act requirements and the EPA's transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A).
(b) The MPO shall provide all interested parties with a reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposed TIP as required by § 450.316(a). In addition, in nonattainment area TMAs, the
MPO shall provide at least one formal public meeting during the TIP development process, which should be addressed through the participation plan described in § 450.316(a). In addition, the MPO shall publish or otherwise make readily available the TIP for public review, including (to the maximum extent practicable) in electronically accessible formats and means, such as the World Wide Web, as described in § 450.316(a).
(c) The TIP shall be designed such that once implemented, it makes progress toward achieving the performance targets established under § 450.306(d).
(d) The TIP shall include, to the maximum extent practicable, a description of the anticipated effect of the TIP toward achieving the performance targets identified in the metropolitan transportation plan, linking investment priorities to those performance targets.
(e) The TIP shall include capital and non-capital surface transportation projects (or phases of projects) within the boundaries of the metropolitan planning area proposed for funding under 23 U.S.C. and 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 (including transportation alternatives; associated transit improvements; Tribal Transportation Program, Federal Lands Transportation Program, and Federal Lands Access Program projects; HSIP projects; trails projects; accessible pedestrian walkways; and bicycle facilities), except the following that may be included:
(1) Safety projects funded under 23 U.S.C. 402 and 49 U.S.C. 31102;
(2) Metropolitan planning projects funded under 23 U.S.C. 104(d), and 49 U.S.C. 5305(d);
(3) State planning and research projects funded under 23 U.S.C. 505 and 49 U.S.C. 5305(e);
(4) At the discretion of the State and MPO, metropolitan planning projects funded with Surface Transportation Program funds;
(5) Emergency relief projects (except those involving substantial functional, locational, or capacity changes);
(6) National planning and research projects funded under 49 U.S.C. 5314; and
(7) Project management oversight projects funded under 49 U.S.C. 5327.
(f) The TIP shall contain all regionally significant projects requiring an action by the FHWA or the FTA whether or not the projects are to be funded under title 23 U.S.C. Chapters 1 and 2 or title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 (e.g., addition of an interchange to the Interstate System with State, local, and/or private funds and congressionally designated projects not funded under 23 U.S.C. or 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53). For public information and conformity purposes, the TIP shall include all regionally significant projects proposed to be funded with Federal funds other than those administered by the FHWA or the FTA, as well as all regionally significant projects to be funded with non-Federal funds.
(g) The TIP shall include, for each project or phase (e.g., preliminary engineering, environment/NEPA, right-of-way, design, or construction), the following:
(1) Sufficient descriptive material (
i.e.,
type of work, termini, and length) to identify the project or phase;
(2) Estimated total project cost, which may extend beyond the 4 years of the TIP;
(3) The amount of Federal funds proposed to be obligated during each program year for the project or phase (for the first year, this includes the proposed category of Federal funds and source(s) of non-Federal funds. For the second, third, and fourth years, this includes the likely category or possible categories of Federal funds and sources of non-Federal funds);
(4) Identification of the agencies responsible for carrying out the project or phase;
(5) In nonattainment and maintenance areas, identification of those projects that are identified as TCMs in the applicable SIP;
(6) In nonattainment and maintenance areas, included projects shall be specified in sufficient detail (design concept and scope) for air quality analysis in accordance with the EPA transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A); and
(7) In areas with Americans with Disabilities Act required paratransit and key station plans, identification of
those projects that will implement these plans.
(h) Projects that are not considered to be of appropriate scale for individual identification in a given program year may be grouped by function, work type, and/or geographic area using the applicable classifications under 23 CFR 771.117(c) and (d) and/or 40 CFR part 93. In nonattainment and maintenance areas, project classifications must be consistent with the “exempt project” classifications contained in the EPA transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A). In addition, projects proposed for funding under title 23 U.S.C. Chapter 2 that are not regionally significant may be grouped in one line item or identified individually in the TIP.
(i) Each project or project phase included in the TIP shall be consistent with the approved metropolitan transportation plan.
(j) The TIP shall include a financial plan that demonstrates how the approved TIP can be implemented, indicates resources from public and private sources that are reasonably expected to be made available to carry out the TIP, and recommends any additional financing strategies for needed projects and programs. In developing the TIP, the MPO, State(s), and public transportation operator(s) shall cooperatively develop estimates of funds that are reasonably expected to be available to support TIP implementation in accordance with § 450.314(a). Only projects for which construction or operating funds can reasonably be expected to be available may be included. In the case of new funding sources, strategies for ensuring their availability shall be identified. In developing the financial plan, the MPO shall take into account all projects and strategies funded under title 23 U.S.C., title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53, and other Federal funds; and regionally significant projects that are not federally funded. For purposes of transportation operations and maintenance, the financial plan shall contain system-level estimates of costs and revenue sources that are reasonably expected to be available to adequately operate and maintain Federal-aid highways (as defined by 23 U.S.C. 101(a)(6)) and public transportation (as defined by title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53). In addition, for illustrative purposes, the financial plan may include additional projects that would be included in the TIP if reasonable additional resources beyond those identified in the financial plan were to become available. Revenue and cost estimates for the TIP must use an inflation rate(s) to reflect “year of expenditure dollars,” based on reasonable financial principles and information, developed cooperatively by the MPO, State(s), and public transportation operator(s).
(k) The TIP shall include a project, or a phase of a project, only if full funding can reasonably be anticipated to be available for the project within the time period contemplated for completion of the project. In nonattainment and maintenance areas, projects included in the first 2 years of the TIP shall be limited to those for which funds are available or committed. For the TIP, financial constraint shall be demonstrated and maintained by year and shall include sufficient financial information to demonstrate which projects are to be implemented using current and/or reasonably available revenues, while federally supported facilities are being adequately operated and maintained. In the case of proposed funding sources, strategies for ensuring their availability shall be identified in the financial plan consistent with paragraph (h) of this section. In nonattainment and maintenance areas, the TIP shall give priority to eligible TCMs identified in the approved SIP in accordance with the EPA transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A) and shall provide for their timely implementation.
(l) In cases that the FHWA and the FTA find a TIP to be fiscally constrained and a revenue source is subsequently removed or substantially reduced (
i.e.,
by legislative or administrative actions), the FHWA and the FTA will not withdraw the original determination of fiscal constraint. However, in such cases, the FHWA and the FTA will not act on an updated or amended TIP that does not reflect the changed revenue situation.
(m) Procedures or agreements that distribute suballocated Surface Transportation Program funds to individual
jurisdictions or modes within the MPA by pre-determined percentages or formulas are inconsistent with the legislative provisions that require the MPO, in cooperation with the State and the public transportation operator, to develop a prioritized and financially constrained TIP and shall not be used unless they can be clearly shown to be based on considerations required to be addressed as part of the metropolitan transportation planning process.
(n) As a management tool for monitoring progress in implementing the transportation plan, the TIP should:
(1) Identify the criteria and process for prioritizing implementation of transportation plan elements (including multimodal trade-offs) for inclusion in the TIP and any changes in priorities from previous TIPs;
(2) List major projects from the previous TIP that were implemented and identify any significant delays in the planned implementation of major projects; and
(3) In nonattainment and maintenance areas, describe the progress in implementing any required TCMs, in accordance with 40 CFR part 93.
(o) In metropolitan nonattainment and maintenance areas, a 12-month conformity lapse grace period will be implemented when an area misses an applicable deadline, according to the Clean Air Act and the transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A). At the end of this 12-month grace period, the existing conformity determination will lapse. During a conformity lapse, MPOs may prepare an interim TIP as a basis for advancing projects that are eligible to proceed under a conformity lapse. An interim TIP consisting of eligible projects from, or consistent with, the most recent conforming metropolitan transportation plan and TIP may proceed immediately without revisiting the requirements of this section, subject to interagency consultation defined in 40 CFR part 93. An interim TIP containing eligible projects that are not from, or consistent with, the most recent conforming transportation plan and TIP must meet all the requirements of this section.
(p) Projects in any of the first 4 years of the TIP may be advanced in place of another project in the first 4 years of the TIP, subject to the project selection requirements of § 450.332. In addition, the MPO may revise the TIP at any time under procedures agreed to by the State, MPO, and public transportation operator(s) consistent with the TIP development procedures established in this section, as well as the procedures for the MPO participation plan (see § 450.316(a)) and FHWA/FTA actions on the TIP (see § 450.330).
[81 FR 34135, May 27, 2016, as amended at 81 FR 93473, Dec. 20, 2016; 82 FR 56545, Nov. 29, 2017]
§ 450.328
TIP revisions and relationship to the STIP.
(a) An MPO may revise the TIP at any time under procedures agreed to by the cooperating parties consistent with the procedures established in this part for its development and approval. In nonattainment or maintenance areas for transportation-related pollutants, if a TIP amendment involves non-exempt projects (per 40 CFR part 93), or is replaced with an updated TIP, the MPO and the FHWA and the FTA must make a new conformity determination. In all areas, changes that affect fiscal constraint must take place by amendment of the TIP. The MPO shall use public participation procedures consistent with § 450.316(a) in revising the TIP, except that these procedures are not required for administrative modifications.
(b) After approval by the MPO and the Governor, the State shall include the TIP without change, directly or by reference, in the STIP required under 23 U.S.C. 135. In nonattainment and maintenance areas, the FHWA and the FTA must make a conformity finding on the TIP before it is included in the STIP. A copy of the approved TIP shall be provided to the FHWA and the FTA.
(c) The State shall notify the MPO and Federal land management agencies when it has included a TIP including projects under the jurisdiction of these agencies in the STIP.
[81 FR 34135, May 27, 2016, as amended at 81 FR 93473, Dec. 20, 2016; 82 FR 56545, Nov. 29, 2017]
§ 450.330
TIP action by the FHWA and the FTA.
(a) The FHWA and the FTA shall jointly find that each metropolitan TIP is consistent with the metropolitan transportation plan produced by the continuing and comprehensive transportation process carried on cooperatively by the MPO, the State(s), and the public transportation operator(s) in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 134 and 49 U.S.C. 5303. This finding shall be based on the self-certification statement submitted by the State and MPO under § 450.336, a review of the metropolitan transportation plan by the FHWA and the FTA, and upon other reviews as deemed necessary by the FHWA and the FTA.
(b) In nonattainment and maintenance areas, the MPO, as well as the FHWA and the FTA, shall determine conformity of any updated or amended TIP, in accordance with 40 CFR part 93. After the FHWA and the FTA issue a conformity determination on the TIP, the TIP shall be incorporated, without change, into the STIP, directly or by reference.
(c) If an MPO has not updated the metropolitan transportation plan in accordance with the cycles defined in § 450.324(c), projects may only be advanced from a TIP that was approved and found to conform (in nonattainment and maintenance areas) prior to expiration of the metropolitan transportation plan and meets the TIP update requirements of § 450.326(a). Until the MPO approves (in attainment areas) or the FHWA and the FTA issue a conformity determination on (in nonattainment and maintenance areas) the updated metropolitan transportation plan, the MPO may not amend the TIP.
(d) In the case of extenuating circumstances, the FHWA and the FTA will consider and take appropriate action on requests to extend the STIP approval period for all or part of the TIP in accordance with § 450.220(b).
(e) If an illustrative project is included in the TIP, no Federal action may be taken on that project by the FHWA and the FTA until it is formally included in the financially constrained and conforming metropolitan transportation plan and TIP.
(f) Where necessary in order to maintain or establish operations, the FHWA and the FTA may approve highway and transit operating assistance for specific projects or programs, even though the projects or programs may not be included in an approved TIP.
[81 FR 34135, May 27, 2016, as amended at 81 FR 93473, Dec. 20, 2016; 82 FR 56545, Nov. 29, 2017]
§ 450.332
Project selection from the TIP.
(a) Once a TIP that meets the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 134(j), 49 U.S.C. 5303(j), and § 450.326 has been developed and approved, the first year of the TIP will constitute an “agreed to” list of projects for project selection purposes and no further project selection action is required for the implementing agency to proceed with projects, except where the appropriated Federal funds available to the metropolitan planning area are significantly less than the authorized amounts or where there are significant shifting of projects between years. In this case, the MPO, the State, and the public transportation operator(s) if requested by the MPO, the State, or the public transportation operator(s) shall jointly develop a revised “agreed to” list of projects. If the State or public transportation operator(s) wishes to proceed with a project in the second, third, or fourth year of the TIP, the specific project selection procedures stated in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section must be used unless the MPO, the State, and the public transportation operator(s) jointly develop expedited project selection procedures to provide for the advancement of projects from the second, third, or fourth years of the TIP.
(b) In metropolitan areas not designated as TMAs, the State and/or the public transportation operator(s), in cooperation with the MPO shall select projects to be implemented using title 23 U.S.C. funds (other than Tribal Transportation Program, Federal Lands Transportation Program, and Federal Lands Access Program projects) or funds under title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53, from the approved metropolitan TIP. Tribal Transportation
Program, Federal Lands Transportation Program, and Federal Lands Access Program projects shall be selected in accordance with procedures developed pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 201, 202, 203, and 204.
(c) In areas designated as TMAs, the MPO shall select all 23 U.S.C. and 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 funded projects (excluding projects on the NHS and Tribal Transportation Program, Federal Lands Transportation Program, and Federal Lands Access Program) in consultation with the State and public transportation operator(s) from the approved TIP and in accordance with the priorities in the approved TIP. The State shall select projects on the NHS in cooperation with the MPO, from the approved TIP. Tribal Transportation Program, Federal Lands Transportation Program, and Federal Lands Access Program projects shall be selected in accordance with procedures developed pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 201, 202, 203, and 204.
(d) Except as provided in § 450.326(e) and § 450.330(f), projects not included in the federally approved STIP are not eligible for funding with funds under title 23 U.S.C. or 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53.
(e) In nonattainment and maintenance areas, priority shall be given to the timely implementation of TCMs contained in the applicable SIP in accordance with the EPA transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93, subpart A).
[81 FR 34135, May 27, 2016, as amended at 81 FR 93473, Dec. 20, 2016; 82 FR 56545, Nov. 29, 2017]
§ 450.334
Annual listing of obligated projects.
(a) In metropolitan planning areas, on an annual basis, no later than 90 calendar days following the end of the program year, the State, public transportation operator(s), and the MPO shall cooperatively develop a listing of projects (including investments in pedestrian walkways and bicycle transportation facilities) for which funds under 23 U.S.C. or 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 were obligated in the preceding program year.
(b) The listing shall be prepared in accordance with § 450.314(a) and shall include all federally funded projects authorized or revised to increase obligations in the preceding program year, and shall at a minimum include the TIP information under § 450.326(g)(1) and (4) and identify, for each project, the amount of Federal funds requested in the TIP, the Federal funding that was obligated during the preceding year, and the Federal funding remaining and available for subsequent years.
(c) The listing shall be published or otherwise made available in accordance with the MPO's public participation criteria for the TIP.
[81 FR 34135, May 27, 2016, as amended at 81 FR 93473, Dec. 20, 2016; 82 FR 56545, Nov. 29, 2017]
§ 450.336
Self-certifications and Federal certifications.
(a) For all MPAs, concurrent with the submittal of the entire proposed TIP to the FHWA and the FTA as part of the STIP approval, the State and the MPO shall certify at least every 4 years that the metropolitan transportation planning process is being carried out in accordance with all applicable requirements including:
(1) 23 U.S.C. 134, 49 U.S.C. 5303, and this subpart;
(2) In nonattainment and maintenance areas, sections 174 and 176(c) and (d) of the Clean Air Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 7504, 7506(c) and (d)) and 40 CFR part 93;

(7) The provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101
et seq.
) and 49 CFR parts 27, 37, and 38;
(8) The Older Americans Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 6101), prohibiting
discrimination on the basis of age in programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance;
(9) Section 324 of title 23 U.S.C. regarding the prohibition of discrimination based on gender; and
(10) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and 49 CFR part 27 regarding discrimination against individuals with disabilities.
(b) In TMAs, the FHWA and the FTA jointly shall review and evaluate the transportation planning process for each TMA no less than once every 4 years to determine if the process meets the requirements of applicable provisions of Federal law and this subpart.
(1) After review and evaluation of the TMA planning process, the FHWA and FTA shall take one of the following actions:
(i) If the process meets the requirements of this part and the MPO and the Governor have approved a TIP, jointly certify the transportation planning process;
(ii) If the process substantially meets the requirements of this part and the MPO and the Governor have approved a TIP, jointly certify the transportation planning process subject to certain specified corrective actions being taken; or
(iii) If the process does not meet the requirements of this part, jointly certify the planning process as the basis for approval of only those categories of programs or projects that the FHWA and the FTA jointly determine, subject to certain specified corrective actions being taken.
(2) If, upon the review and evaluation conducted under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the FHWA and the FTA do not certify the transportation planning process in a TMA, the Secretary may withhold up to 20 percent of the funds attributable to the metropolitan planning area of the MPO for projects funded under title 23 U.S.C. and title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 in addition to corrective actions and funding restrictions. The withheld funds shall be restored to the MPA when the metropolitan transportation planning process is certified by the FHWA and FTA, unless the funds have lapsed.
(3) A certification of the TMA planning process will remain in effect for 4 years unless a new certification determination is made sooner by the FHWA and the FTA or a shorter term is specified in the certification report.
(4) In conducting a certification review, the FHWA and the FTA shall provide opportunities for public involvement within the metropolitan planning area under review. The FHWA and the FTA shall consider the public input received in arriving at a decision on a certification action.
(5) The FHWA and the FTA shall notify the MPO(s), the State(s), and public transportation operator(s) of the actions taken under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. The FHWA and the FTA will update the certification status of the TMA when evidence of satisfactory completion of a corrective action(s) is provided to the FHWA and the FTA.
[81 FR 34135, May 27, 2016, as amended at 81 FR 93473, Dec. 20, 2016; 82 FR 56545, Nov. 29, 2017]

Any decision by the Secretary concerning a metropolitan transportation plan or TIP developed through the processes provided for in 23 U.S.C. 134, 49 U.S.C. 5303, and this subpart shall not be considered to be a Federal action subject to review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321
et seq.
).
§ 450.340
Phase-in of new requirements.
(a) Prior to May 27, 2018, an MPO may adopt a metropolitan transportation plan that has been developed using the SAFETEA-LU requirements or the provisions and requirements of this part. On or after May 27, 2018, an MPO may not adopt a metropolitan transportation plan that has not been developed according to the provisions and requirements of this part.
(b) Prior to May 27, 2018 (2 years after the publication date of this rule), FHWA/FTA may determine the conformity of, or approve as part of a STIP, a TIP that has been developed using SAFETEA-LU requirements or the provisions and requirements of this part. On or after May 27, 2018 (2 years

Pt. 450, App. A

# Appendix A to Part 450—Linking the Transportation Planning and NEPA Processes

# Background and Overview
This Appendix provides additional information to explain the linkage between the transportation planning and project development/National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) processes. It is intended to be non-binding and should not be construed as a rule of general applicability.
For 40 years, the Congress has directed that federally funded highway and transit projects must flow from metropolitan and statewide transportation planning processes (pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 134-135 and 49 U.S.C. 5303-5306). Over the years, the Congress has refined and strengthened the transportation planning process as the foundation for project decisions, emphasizing public involvement, consideration of environmental and other factors, and a Federal role that oversees the transportation planning process but does not second-guess the content of transportation plans and programs.
Despite this statutory emphasis on transportation planning, the environmental analyses produced to meet the requirements of the NEPA of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4231
et seq.
) have often been conducted de novo, disconnected from the analyses used to develop long-range transportation plans, statewide and metropolitan Transportation Improvement Programs (STIPs/TIPs), or planning-level corridor/subarea/feasibility studies. When the NEPA and transportation planning processes are not well coordinated, the NEPA process may lead to the development of information that is more appropriately developed in the planning process, resulting in duplication of work and delays in transportation improvements.
The purpose of this Appendix is to change this culture, by supporting congressional intent that statewide and metropolitan transportation planning should be the foundation for highway and transit project decisions. This Appendix was crafted to recognize that transportation planning processes vary across the country. This document provides details on how information, analysis, and products from transportation planning can be incorporated into and relied upon in NEPA documents under existing laws, regardless of when the Notice of Intent has
been published. This Appendix presents environmental review as a continuum of sequential study, refinement, and expansion performed in transportation planning and during project development/NEPA, with information developed and conclusions drawn in early stages utilized in subsequent (and more detailed) review stages.
The information below is intended for use by State departments of transportation (State DOTs), metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), and public transportation operators to clarify the circumstances under which transportation planning level choices and analyses can be adopted or incorporated into the process required by NEPA. Additionally, the FHWA and the FTA will work with Federal environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies to incorporate the principles of this Appendix in their day-to-day NEPA policies and procedures related to their involvement in highway and transit projects.
This Appendix does not extend NEPA requirements to transportation plans and programs. The Transportation Efficiency Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) and the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) specifically exempted transportation plans and programs from NEPA review. Therefore, initiating the NEPA process as part of, or concurrently with, a transportation planning study does not subject transportation plans and programs to NEPA.
Implementation of this Appendix by States, MPOs, and public transportation operators is voluntary. The degree to which studies, analyses, or conclusions from the transportation planning process can be incorporated into the project development/NEPA processes will depend upon how well they meet certain standards established by NEPA regulations and guidance. While some transportation planning processes already meet these standards, others will need some modification.
The remainder of this Appendix document utilizes a “Question and Answer” format, organized into three primary categories (“Procedural Issues,” “Substantive Issues,” and “Administrative Issues”).

# I. Procedural Issues

# 1. In what format should the transportation planning information be included?
To be included in the NEPA process, work from the transportation planning process must be documented in a form that can be appended to the NEPA document or incorporated by reference. Documents may be incorporated by reference if they are readily available so as to not impede agency or public review of the action. Any document incorporated by reference must be “reasonably available for inspection by potentially interested persons within the time allowed for comment.” Incorporated materials must be cited in the NEPA document and their contents briefly described, so that the reader understands why the document is cited and knows where to look for further information. To the extent possible, the documentation should be in a form such as official actions by the MPO, State DOT, or public transportation operator and/or correspondence within and among the organizations involved in the transportation planning process.

# 2. What is a reasonable level of detail for a planning product that is intended to be used in a NEPA document? How does this level of detail compare to what is considered a full NEPA analysis?
For purposes of transportation planning alone, a planning-level analysis does not need to rise to the level of detail required in the NEPA process. Rather, it needs to be accurate and up-to-date, and should adequately support recommended improvements in the statewide or metropolitan long-range transportation plan. The SAFETEA-LU requires transportation planning processes to focus on setting a context and following acceptable procedures. For example, the SAFETEA-LU requires a “discussion of the types of potential environmental mitigation activities” and potential areas for their implementation, rather than details on specific strategies. The SAFETEA-LU also emphasizes consultation with Federal, State, and Tribal land management, wildlife, and regulatory agencies.
However, the Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) ultimately will be judged by the standards applicable under the NEPA regulations and guidance from the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). To the extent the information incorporated from the transportation planning process, standing alone, does not contain all of the information or analysis required by NEPA, then it will need to be supplemented by other information contained in the EIS or EA that would, in conjunction with the information from the plan, collectively meet the requirements of NEPA. The intent is not to require NEPA studies in the transportation planning process. As an option, the NEPA analyses prepared for project development can be integrated with transportation planning studies (see the response to Question 9 for additional information).

# 3. What type and extent of involvement from Federal, Tribal, State, and local environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies is needed in the transportation planning process in order for planning-level decisions to be more readily accepted in the NEPA process?
Sections 3005, 3006, and 6001 of the SAFETEA-LU established formal consultation requirements for MPOs and State DOTs to employ with environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies in the development of long-range transportation plans. For example, metropolitan transportation plans now “shall include a discussion of the types of potential environmental mitigation activities and potential areas to carry out these activities, including activities that may have the greatest potential to restore and maintain the environmental functions affected by the [transportation] plan,” and that these planning-level discussions “shall be developed in consultation with Federal, State, and Tribal land management, wildlife, and regulatory agencies.” In addition, MPOs “shall consult, as appropriate, with State and local agencies responsible for land use management, natural resources, environmental protection, conservation, and historic preservation concerning the development of a long-range transportation plan,” and that this consultation “shall involve, as appropriate, comparison of transportation plans with State conservation plans or maps, if available, or comparison of transportation plans to inventories of natural or historic resources, if available.” Similar SAFETEA-LU language addresses the development of the long-range statewide transportation plan, with the addition of Tribal conservation plans or maps to this planning-level “comparison.”
In addition, section 6002 of the SAFETEA-LU established several mechanisms for increased efficiency in environmental reviews for project decision-making. For example, the term “lead agency” collectively means the U.S. Department of Transportation and a State or local governmental entity serving as a joint lead agency for the NEPA process. In addition, the lead agency is responsible for inviting and designating “participating agencies” (
i.e.,
other Federal or non-Federal agencies that may have an interest in the proposed project). Any Federal agency that is invited by the lead agency to participate in the environmental review process for a project shall be designated as a participating agency by the lead agency unless the invited agency informs the lead agency, in writing, by the deadline specified in the invitation that the invited agency:
(a) Has no jurisdiction or authority with respect to the project; (b) has no expertise or information relevant to the project; and (c) does not intend to submit comments on the project.
Past successful examples of using transportation planning products in NEPA analysis are based on early and continuous involvement of environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies. Without this early coordination, environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies are more likely to expect decisions made or analyses conducted in the transportation planning process to be revisited during the NEPA process. Early participation in transportation planning provides environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies better insight into the needs and objectives of the locality. Additionally, early participation provides an important opportunity for environmental, regulatory, and resource agency concerns to be identified and addressed early in the process, such as those related to permit applications. Moreover, Federal, Tribal, State, and local environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies are able to share data on particular resources, which can play a critical role in determining the feasibility of a transportation solution with respect to environmental impacts. The use of other agency planning outputs can result in a transportation project that could support multiple goals (transportation, environmental, and community). Further, planning decisions by these other agencies may have impacts on long-range transportation plans and/or the STIP/TIP, thereby providing important input to the transportation planning process and advancing integrated decision-making.

# 4. What is the procedure for using decisions or analyses from the transportation planning process?
The lead agencies jointly decide, and must agree, on what processes and consultation techniques are used to determine the transportation planning products that will be incorporated into the NEPA process. At a minimum, a robust scoping/early coordination process (which explains to Federal and State environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies and the public the information and/or analyses utilized to develop the planning products, how the purpose and need was developed and refined, and how the design concept and scope were determined) should play a critical role in leading to informed decisions by the lead agencies on the suitability of the transportation planning information, analyses, documents, and decisions for use in the NEPA process. As part of a rigorous scoping/early coordination process, the FHWA and the FTA should ensure that the transportation planning results are appropriately documented, shared, and used.

# 5. To what extent can the FHWA/FTA provide up-front assurance that decisions and additional investments made in the transportation planning process will allow planning-level decisions and analyses to be used in the NEPA process?
There are no guarantees. However, the potential is greatly improved for transportation planning processes that address the “3-C” planning principles (comprehensive, cooperative, and continuous); incorporate the intent of NEPA through the consideration of natural, physical, and social effects; involve environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies; thoroughly document the transportation planning process information, analysis, and decision; and vet the planning results through the applicable public involvement processes.

# 6. What considerations will the FHWA/FTA take into account in their review of transportation planning products for acceptance in project development/NEPA?
The FHWA and the FTA will give deference to decisions resulting from the transportation planning process if the FHWA and FTA determine that the planning process is consistent with the “3-C” planning principles and when the planning study process, alternatives considered, and resulting decisions have a rational basis that is thoroughly documented and vetted through the applicable public involvement processes. Moreover, any applicable program-specific requirements (e.g., those of the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program or the FTA's Capital Investment Grant program) also must be met.
The NEPA requires that the FHWA and the FTA be able to stand behind the overall soundness and credibility of analyses conducted and decisions made during the transportation planning process if they are incorporated into a NEPA document. For example, if systems-level or other broad objectives or choices from the transportation plan are incorporated into the purpose and need statement for a NEPA document, the FHWA and the FTA should not revisit whether these are the best objectives or choices among other options. Rather, the FHWA and the FTA review would include making sure that objectives or choices derived from the transportation plan were: Based on transportation planning factors established by Federal law; reflect a credible and articulated planning rationale; founded on reliable data; and developed through transportation planning processes meeting FHWA and FTA statutory and regulatory requirements. In addition, the basis for the goals and choices must be documented and included in the NEPA document. The FHWA/FTA reviewers do not need to review whether assumptions or analytical methods used in the studies are the best available, but, instead, need to assure that such assumptions or analytical methods are reasonable, scientifically acceptable, and consistent with goals, objectives, and policies set forth in long-range transportation plans. This review would include determining whether: (a) Assumptions have a rational basis and are up-to-date and (b) data, analytical methods, and modeling techniques are reliable, defensible, reasonably current, and meet data quality requirements.

# II. Substantive Issues

# General Issues To Be Considered

# 7. What should be considered in order to rely upon transportation planning studies in NEPA?
The following questions should be answered prior to accepting studies conducted during the transportation planning process for use in NEPA. While not a “checklist,” these questions are intended to guide the practitioner's analysis of the planning products:
• How much time has passed since the planning studies and corresponding decisions were made?
• Were the future year policy assumptions used in the transportation planning process related to land use, economic development, transportation costs, and network expansion consistent with those to be used in the NEPA process?
• Is the information still relevant/valid?
• What changes have occurred in the area since the study was completed?
• Is the information in a format that can be appended to an environmental document or reformatted to do so?
• Are the analyses in a planning-level report or document based on data, analytical methods, and modeling techniques that are reliable, defensible, and consistent with those used in other regional transportation studies and project development activities?
• Were the FHWA and FTA, other agencies, and the public involved in the relevant planning analysis and the corresponding planning decisions?
• Were the planning products available to other agencies and the public during NEPA scoping?
• During NEPA scoping, was a clear connection between the decisions made in planning and those to be made during the project development stage explained to the public and others? What was the response?
• Are natural resource and land use plans being informed by transportation planning products, and vice versa?

# Purpose and Need

# 8. How can transportation planning be used to shape a project's purpose and need in the NEPA process?
A sound transportation planning process is the primary source of the project purpose and need. Through transportation planning, State and local governments, with involvement of stakeholders and the public, establish a vision for the region's future transportation system, define transportation goals and objectives for realizing that vision, decide which needs to address, and determine the timeframe for addressing these issues. The transportation planning process also provides a potential forum to define a project's purpose and need by framing the scope of the problem to be addressed by a proposed project. This scope may be further refined during the transportation planning process as more information about the transportation need is collected and consultation with the public and other stakeholders clarifies other issues and goals for the region.
23 U.S.C. 139(f), as amended by the SAFETEA-LU Section 6002, provides additional focus regarding the definition of the purpose and need and objectives. For example, the lead agency, as early as practicable during the environmental review process, shall provide an opportunity for involvement by participating agencies and the public in defining the purpose and need for a project. The statement of purpose and need shall include a clear statement of the objectives that the proposed action is intended to achieve, which may include: (a) Achieving a transportation objective identified in an applicable statewide or metropolitan transportation plan; (b) supporting land use, economic development, or growth objectives established in applicable Federal, State, local, or Tribal plans; and (c) serving national defense, national security, or other national objectives, as established in Federal laws, plans, or policies.
The transportation planning process can be utilized to develop the purpose and need in the following ways:
(a) Goals and objectives from the transportation planning process may be part of the project's purpose and need statement;
(b) A general travel corridor or general mode or modes (e.g., highway, transit, or a highway/transit combination) resulting from planning analyses may be part of the project's purpose and need statement;
(c) If the financial plan for a metropolitan transportation plan indicates that funding for a specific project will require special funding sources (e.g., tolls or public-private financing), such information may be included in the purpose and need statement; or
(d) The results of analyses from management systems (e.g., congestion, pavement, bridge, and/or safety) may shape the purpose and need statement.
The use of these planning-level goals and choices must be appropriately explained during NEPA scoping and in the NEPA document.
Consistent with NEPA, the purpose and need statement should be a statement of a transportation problem, not a specific solution. However, the purpose and need statement should be specific enough to generate alternatives that may potentially yield real solutions to the problem at-hand. A purpose and need statement that yields only one alternative may indicate a purpose and need that is too narrowly defined.
Short of a fully integrated transportation decision-making process, many State DOTs develop information for their purpose and need statements when implementing interagency NEPA/Section 404 process merger agreements. These agreements may need to be expanded to include commitments to share and utilize transportation planning products when developing a project's purpose and need.

# 9. Under what conditions can the NEPA process be initiated in conjunction with transportation planning studies?
The NEPA process may be initiated in conjunction with transportation planning studies in a number of ways. A common method is the “tiered EIS,” in which the first-tier EIS evaluates general travel corridors, modes, and/or packages of projects at a planning level of detail, leading to the refinement of purpose and need and, ideally, selection of the design concept and scope for a project or series of projects. Subsequently, second-tier NEPA review(s) of the resulting projects would be performed in the usual way. The first-tier EIS uses the NEPA process as a tool to involve environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies and the public in the planning decisions, as well as to ensure the appropriate consideration of environmental factors in these planning decisions.
Corridor or subarea analyses/studies are another option when the long-range transportation plan leaves open the possibility of multiple approaches to fulfill its goals and objectives. In such cases, the formal NEPA process could be initiated through publication of a NOI in conjunction with a corridor or subarea planning study.

# Alternatives

# 10. In the context of this Appendix, what is the meaning of the term “alternatives”?
This Appendix uses the term “alternatives” as specified in the NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1502.14), where it is defined in its broadest sense to include everything from
major modal alternatives and location alternatives to minor design changes that would mitigate adverse impacts. This Appendix does not use the term as it is used in many other contexts (e.g., “prudent and feasible alternatives” under Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act or the “Least Environmentally Damaging Practicable Alternative” under the Clean Water Act.

# 11. Under what circumstances can alternatives be eliminated from detailed consideration during the NEPA process based on information and analysis from the transportation planning process?
There are two ways in which the transportation planning process can begin limiting the alternative solutions to be evaluated during the NEPA process: (a) Shaping the purpose and need for the project; or (b) evaluating alternatives during planning studies and eliminating some of the alternatives from detailed study in the NEPA process prior to its start. Each approach requires careful attention, and is summarized below.
(a) Shaping the Purpose and Need for the Project: The transportation planning process should shape the purpose and need and, thereby, the range of reasonable alternatives. With proper documentation and public involvement, a purpose and need derived from the planning process can legitimately narrow the alternatives analyzed in the NEPA process. See the response to Question 8 for further discussion on how the planning process can shape the purpose and need used in the NEPA process.
For example, the purpose and need may be shaped by the transportation planning process in a manner that consequently narrows the range of alternatives that must be considered in detail in the NEPA document when:
(1) The transportation planning process has selected a general travel corridor as best addressing identified transportation problems and the rationale for the determination in the planning document is reflected in the purpose and need statement of the subsequent NEPA document;
(2) The transportation planning process has selected a general mode (e.g., highway, transit, or a highway/transit combination) that accomplishes its goals and objectives, and these documented determinations are reflected in the purpose and need statement of the subsequent NEPA document; or
(3) The transportation planning process determines that the project needs to be funded by tolls or other non-traditional funding sources in order for the long-range transportation plan to be fiscally constrained or identifies goals and objectives that can only be met by toll roads or other non-traditional funding sources, and that determination of those goals and objectives is reflected in the purpose and need statement of the subsequent NEPA document.
(b) Evaluating and Eliminating Alternatives During the Transportation Planning Process: The evaluation and elimination of alternatives during the transportation planning process can be incorporated by reference into a NEPA document under certain circumstances. In these cases, the planning study becomes part of the NEPA process and provides a basis for screening out alternatives. As with any part of the NEPA process, the analysis of alternatives to be incorporated from the process must have a rational basis that has been thoroughly documented (including documentation of the necessary and appropriate vetting through the applicable public involvement processes). This record should be made available for public review during the NEPA scoping process.
See responses to Questions 4, 5, 6, and 7 for additional elements to consider with respect to acceptance of planning products for NEPA documentation and the response to Question 12 on the information or analysis from the transportation planning process necessary for supporting the elimination of an alternative(s) from detailed consideration in the NEPA process.
Development of planning Alternatives Analysis studies, required prior to MAP-21 for projects seeking funds through FTA's Capital Investment Grant program, are now optional, but may still be used to narrow the alternatives prior to the NEPA review, just as other planning studies may be used. In fact, through planning studies, FTA may be able to narrow the alternatives considered in detail in the NEPA document to the No-Build (No Action) alternative and the Locally Preferred Alternative. If the planning process has included the analysis and stakeholder involvement that would be undertaken in a first tier NEPA process, then the alternatives screening conducted in the transportation planning process may be incorporated by reference, described, and relied upon in the project-level NEPA document. At that point, the project-level NEPA analysis can focus on the remaining alternatives.

# 12. What information or analysis from the transportation planning process is needed in an EA or EIS to support the elimination of an alternative(s) from detailed consideration?
The section of the EA or EIS that discusses alternatives considered but eliminated from detailed consideration should:
(a) Identify any alternatives eliminated during the transportation planning process (this could include broad categories of alternatives, as when a long-range transportation plan selects a general travel corridor based on a corridor study, thereby eliminating all alternatives along other alignments);
(b) Briefly summarize the reasons for eliminating the alternative; and
(c) Include a summary of the analysis process that supports the elimination of alternatives (the summary should reference the relevant sections or pages of the analysis or study) and incorporate it by reference or append it to the NEPA document.
Any analyses or studies used to eliminate alternatives from detailed consideration should be made available to the public and participating agencies during the NEPA scoping process and should be reasonably available during comment periods.
Alternatives passed over during the transportation planning process because they are infeasible or do not meet the NEPA “purpose and need” can be omitted from the detailed analysis of alternatives in the NEPA document, as long as the rationale for elimination is explained in the NEPA document. Alternatives that remain “reasonable” after the planning-level analysis must be addressed in the EIS, even when they are not the preferred alternative. When the proposed action evaluated in an EA involves unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources, NEPA requires that appropriate alternatives be studied, developed, and described.

# Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

# 13. What types of planning products provide analysis of the affected environment and environmental consequences that are useful in a project-level NEPA analysis and document?
The following planning products are valuable inputs to the discussion of the affected environment and environmental consequences (both its current state and future state in the absence of the proposed action) in the project-level NEPA analysis and document:
• Regional development and growth analyses;
• Local land use, growth management, or development plans; and
• Population and employment projections.
The following are types of information, analysis, and other products from the transportation planning process that can be used in the discussion of the affected environment and environmental consequences in an EA or EIS:
(a) Geographic information system (GIS) overlays showing the past, current, or predicted future conditions of the natural and built environments;
(b) Environmental scans that identify environmental resources and environmentally sensitive areas;
(c) Descriptions of airsheds and watersheds;
(d) Demographic trends and forecasts;
(e) Projections of future land use, natural resource conservation areas, and development; and
(f) The outputs of natural resource planning efforts, such as wildlife conservation plans, watershed plans, special area management plans, and multiple species habitat conservation plans.
However, in most cases, the assessment of the affected environment and environmental consequences conducted during the transportation planning process will not be detailed or current enough to meet NEPA standards and, thus, the inventory and evaluation of affected resources and the analysis of consequences of the alternatives will need to be supplemented with more refined analysis and possibly site-specific details during the NEPA process.

# 14. What information from the transportation planning process is useful in describing a baseline for the NEPA analysis of indirect and cumulative impacts?
Because the nature of the transportation planning process is to look broadly at future land use, development, population increases, and other growth factors, the planning analysis can provide the basis for the assessment of indirect and cumulative impacts required under NEPA. The consideration in the transportation planning process of development, growth, and consistency with local land use, growth management, or development plans, as well as population and employment projections, provides an overview of the multitude of factors in an area that are creating pressures not only on the transportation system, but on the natural ecosystem and important environmental and community resources. An analysis of all reasonably foreseeable actions in the area also should be a part of the transportation planning process. This planning-level information should be captured and utilized in the analysis of indirect and cumulative impacts during the NEPA process.
To be used in the analysis of indirect and cumulative impacts, such information should:
(a) Be sufficiently detailed that differences in consequences of alternatives can be readily identified;
(b) Be based on current data (e.g., data from the most recent Census) or be updated by additional information;
(c) Be based on reasonable assumptions that are clearly stated; and/or
(d) Rely on analytical methods and modeling techniques that are reliable, defensible, and reasonably current.

# Environmental Mitigation

# 15. How can planning-level efforts best support advance mitigation, mitigation banking, and priorities for environmental mitigation investments?
A lesson learned from efforts to establish mitigation banks and advance mitigation agreements and alternative mitigation options is the importance of beginning interagency discussions during the transportation planning process. Development pressures, habitat alteration, complicated real estate transactions, and competition for potential mitigation sites by public and private project proponents can encumber the already difficult task of mitigating for “like” value and function and reinforce the need to examine mitigation strategies as early as possible.
Robust use of remote sensing, GIS, and decision support systems for evaluating conservation strategies are all contributing to the advancement of natural resource and environmental planning. The outputs from environmental planning can now better inform transportation planning processes, including the development of mitigation strategies, so that transportation and conservation goals can be optimally met. For example, long-range transportation plans can be screened to assess the effect of general travel corridors or density, on the viability of sensitive plant and animal species or habitats. This type of screening provides a basis for early collaboration among transportation and environmental staffs, the public, and regulatory agencies to explore areas where impacts must be avoided and identify areas for mitigation investments. This can lead to mitigation strategies that are both more economical and more effective from an environmental stewardship perspective than traditional project-specific mitigation measures.

# III. Administrative Issues

# 16. Are Federal funds eligible to pay for these additional, or more in depth, environmental studies in transportation planning?
Yes. For example, the following FHWA and FTA funds may be utilized for conducting environmental studies and analyses within transportation planning:
• FHWA planning and research funds, as defined under 23 CFR part 420 (e.g., Metropolitan Planning (PL), Statewide Planning and Research (SPR), National Highway System (NHS), STP, and Equity Bonus); and
• FTA planning and research funds (49 U.S.C. 5303), urban formula funds (49 U.S.C. 5307), and (in limited circumstances) transit capital investment funds (49 U.S.C. 5309).
The eligible transportation planning-related uses of these funds may include: (a) Conducting feasibility or subarea/corridor needs studies and (b) developing system-wide environmental information/inventories (e.g., wetland banking inventories or standards to identify historically significant sites). Particularly in the case of PL and SPR funds, the proposed expenditure must be closely related to the development of transportation plans and programs under 23 U.S.C. 134-135 and 49 U.S.C. 5303-5306.
For FHWA funding programs, once a general travel corridor or specific project has progressed to a point in the preliminary engineering/NEPA phase that clearly extends beyond transportation planning, additional in-depth environmental studies must be funded through the program category for which the ultimate project qualifies (e.g., NHS, STP, Interstate Maintenance, and/or Bridge), rather than PL or SPR funds.
Another source of funding is FHWA's Transportation Enhancement program, which may be used for activities such as: conducting archeological planning and research; developing inventories such as those for historic bridges and highways, and other surface transportation-related structures; conducting studies to determine the extent of water pollution due to highway runoff; and conducting studies to reduce vehicle-caused wildlife mortality while maintaining habitat connectivity.
The FHWA and the FTA encourage State DOTs, MPOs, and public transportation operators to seek partners for some of these studies from environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies, non-government organizations, and other government and private sector entities with similar data needs, or environmental interests. In some cases, these partners may contribute data and expertise to the studies, as well as funding.

# 17. What staffing or organizational arrangements may be helpful in allowing planning products to be accepted in the NEPA process?
Certain organizational and staffing arrangements may support a more integrated approach to the planning/NEPA decision-making continuum. In many cases, planning organizations do not have environmental expertise on staff or readily accessible. Likewise, the review and regulatory responsibilities of many environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies make involvement in the transportation planning process a challenge for staff resources. These challenges may be partially met by improved use of the outputs of each agency's planning resources and by augmenting their capabilities through greater use of GIS and remote sensing technologies (see
http://www.gis.fhwa.dot.gov/
for additional information on the use of GIS). Sharing databases and the planning products of local land use decision-makers and State and Federal environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies also provide efficiencies in
acquiring and sharing the data and information needed for both transportation planning and NEPA work.
Additional opportunities such as shared staff, training across disciplines, and (in some cases) reorganizing to eliminate structural divisions between planning and NEPA practitioners may also need to be considered in order to better integrate NEPA considerations into transportation planning studies. The answers to the following two questions also contain useful information on training and staffing opportunities.

# 18. How have environmental, regulatory, and resource agency liaisons (Federally and State DOT funded positions) and partnership agreements been used to provide the expertise and interagency participation needed to enhance the consideration of environmental factors in the planning process?
For several years, States have utilized Federal and State transportation funds to support focused and accelerated project review by a variety of local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies. While Section 1309(e) of the TEA-21 and its successor in SAFETEA-LU section 6002 speak specifically to transportation project streamlining, there are other authorities that have been used to fund positions, such as the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 U.S.C. 6505). In addition, long-term, on-call consultant contracts can provide backfill support for staff that are detailed to other parts of an agency for temporary assignments. At last count (as of 2015), over 200 positions were being funded. Additional information on interagency funding agreements is available at:
http://environment.fhwa.dot.gov/strmlng/igdocs/index.htm
.
Moreover, every State has advanced a variety of stewardship and streamlining initiatives that necessitate early involvement of environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies in the project development process. Such process improvements have: addressed the exchange of data to support avoidance and impact analysis; established formal and informal consultation and review schedules; advanced mitigation strategies; and resulted in a variety of programmatic reviews. Interagency agreements and work plans have evolved to describe performance objectives, as well as specific roles and responsibilities related to new streamlining initiatives. Some States have improved collaboration and efficiency by co-locating environmental, regulatory, and resource and transportation agency staff.

# 19. What training opportunities are available to MPOs, State DOTs, public transportation operators and environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies to assist in their understanding of the transportation planning and NEPA processes?
Both the FHWA and the FTA offer a variety of transportation planning, public involvement, and NEPA courses through the National Highway Institute and/or the National Transit Institute. Of particular note is the Linking Planning and NEPA Workshop, which provides a forum and facilitated group discussion among and between State DOT; MPO; Federal, Tribal, and State environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies; and FHWA/FTA representatives (at both the executive and program manager levels) to develop a State-specific action plan that will provide for strengthened linkages between the transportation planning and NEPA processes.
Moreover, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service offers Green Infrastructure Workshops that are focused on integrating planning for natural resources (“green infrastructure”) with the development, economic, and other infrastructure needs of society (“gray infrastructure”).
Robust planning and multi-issue environmental screening requires input from a wide variety of disciplines, including information technology; transportation planning; the NEPA process; and regulatory, permitting, and environmental specialty areas (e.g., noise, air quality, and biology). Senior managers at transportation and partner agencies can arrange a variety of individual training programs to support learning curves and skill development that contribute to a strengthened link of the transportation planning and NEPA processes. Formal and informal mentoring on an intra-agency basis can be arranged. Employee exchanges within and between agencies can be periodically scheduled, and persons involved with professional leadership programs can seek temporary assignments with partner agencies.

# Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 470—Guidance Criteria for Evaluating Requests for Interstate System Designations under 23 U.S.C. 103(
c

# )(4)(A) and (B)
Section 103(c)(4)(A) and (B), of title 23, U.S.C., permits States to request the designation of National Highway System routes as parts or future parts of the Interstate System. The FHWA Administrator may approve such a request if the route is a logical addition or connection to the Interstate System and has been, or will be, constructed to meet Interstate standards. The following are the general criteria to be used to evaluate 23 U.S.C. 103(c) requests for Interstate System designations.
1. The proposed route should be of sufficient length to serve long-distance Interstate travel, such as connecting routes between principal metropolitan cities or industrial centers important to national defense and economic development.
2. The proposed route should not duplicate other Interstate routes. It should serve Interstate traffic movement not provided by another Interstate route.
3. The proposed route should directly serve major highway traffic generators. The term “major highway traffic generator” means either an urbanized area with a population over 100,000 or a similar major concentrated land use activity that produces and attracts long-distance Interstate and statewide travel of persons and goods. Typical examples of similar major concentrated land use activities would include a principal industrial complex, government center, military installation, or transportation terminal.
4. The proposed route should connect to the Interstate System at each end, with the exception of Interstate routes that connect with continental routes at an international border, or terminate in a “major highway traffic generator” that is not served by another Interstate route. In the latter case, the terminus of the Interstate route should connect to routes of the National Highway System that will adequately handle the traffic. The proposed route also must be functionally classified as a principal arterial and be a part of the National Highway System system.
5. The proposed route must meet all the current geometric and safety standards criteria as set forth in 23 CFR part 625 for highways on the Interstate System, or a formal agreement to construct the route to such standards within 25 years must be executed between the State(s) and the Federal Highway Administration. Any proposed exceptions to the standards shall be approved at the time of designation.
6. A route being proposed for designation under 23 U.S.C. 103(c)(4)(B) must have an approved final environmental document (including, if required, a 49 U.S.C. 303(c) [Section 4(f)] approval) covering the route and project action must be ready to proceed with design at the time of designation. Routes constructed to Interstate standards are not necessarily logical additions to the Interstate System unless they clearly meet all of the above criteria.

# Appendix B to Subpart A of Part 470—Designation of Segments of Section 332(
a

# )(2) Corridors as Parts of the Interstate System
The following guidance is comparable to current procedures for Interstate System designation requests under 23 U.S.C. 103(c)(4)(A). All Interstate System additions must be approved by the Federal Highway Administrator. The provisions of section 332(a)(2) of the NHS Act have also been incorporated into the ISTEA as section 1105(e)(5)(A).
1. The request must be submitted through the appropriate FHWA Division Office to the Associate Administrator for Program Development (HEP-10). Comments and recommendations by the division and regional offices are requested.
2. The State DOT secretary (or equivalent) must request that the route segment be added to the Interstate System. The exact location and termini must be specified. If the route segment involves more than one State, each affected State must submit a separate request.
3. The request must provide information to support findings that the segment (a) is built to Interstate design standards and (b) connects to the existing Interstate System. The segment should be of sufficient length to
provide substantial service to the travelling public.
4. The request must also identify and justify any design exceptions for which approval is requested.
5. Proposed Interstate route numbering for the segment must be submitted to FHWA and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Route Numbering.

# Appendix C to Subpart A of Part 470—Policy for the Signing and Numbering of Future Interstate Corridors Designated by Section 332 of the NHS Designation Act of 1995 or Designated Under 23 U.S.C. 103(c)(4)(B)

# Policy
State transportation agencies are permitted to erect informational signs along a federally designated future Interstate corridor only after the specific route location has been established for the route to be constructed to Interstate design standards.

# Conditions
1. The corridor must have been designated a future part of the Interstate System under section 332(a)(2) of the NHS Designation Act of 1995 or 23 U.S.C. 103(c)(4)(B).
2. The specific route location to appropriate termini must have received Federal Highway (FHWA) environmental clearance. Where FHWA environmental clearance is not required or Interstate standards have been met, the route location must have been publicly announced by the State.
3. Numbering of future Interstate route segments must be coordinated with affected States and be approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials and the FHWA at Headquarters. Short portions of a multistate corridor may require use of an interim 3-digit number.
4. The State shall coordinate the location and content of signing near the State line with the adjacent State.
5. Signing and other identification of a future Interstate route segment must comply with the provisions of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways.
6. The FHWA Division Office must confirm in advance that the above conditions have been met and approve the general locations of signs.

# Appendix D to Subpart A of Part 470—Guidance Criteria for Evaluating Requests for Modifications to the National Highway System
Section 103(b), of title 23, U.S.C., allows the States to propose modifications to the National Highway System (NHS) and authorizes the Secretary to approve such modifications provided that they meet the criteria established for the NHS and enhance the characteristics of the NHS. In proposing modifications under 23 U.S.C. 103(b), the States must cooperate with local and regional officials. In urbanized areas, the local officials must act through the metropolitan planning organization (MPO) designated for such areas under 23 U.S.C. 134. The following guidance criteria should be used by the States to develop proposed modifications to the NHS.
1. Proposed additions to the NHS should be included in either an adopted State or metropolitan transportation plan or program.
2. Proposed additions should connect at each end with other routes on the NHS or serve a major traffic generator.
3. Proposals should be developed in consultation with local and regional officials.
4. Proposals to add routes to the NHS should include information on the type of traffic served (
i.e.
, percent of trucks, average trip length, local, commuter, interregional, interstate) by the route, the population centers or major traffic generators served by the route, and how this service compares with existing NHS routes.
5. Proposals should include information on existing and anticipated needs and any planned improvements to the route.
6. Proposals should include information concerning the possible effects of adding or deleting a route to or from the NHS might have on other existing NHS routes that are in close proximity.
7. Proposals to add routes to the NHS should include an assessment of whether modifications (adjustments or deletions) to existing NHS routes, which provide similar service, may be appropriate.
8. Proposed modifications that might affect adjoining States should be developed in cooperation with those States.
9. Proposed modifications consisting of connections to major intermodal facilities should be developed using the criteria set forth below. These criteria were used for identifying initial NHS connections to major intermodal terminals. The primary criteria
are based on annual passenger volumes, annual freight volumes, or daily vehicular traffic on one or more principal routes that serve the intermodal facility. The secondary criteria include factors which underscore the importance of an intermodal facility within a specific State.

# Primary Criteria

# Commercial Aviation Airports
1. Passengers—scheduled commercial service with more than 250,000 annual enplanements.
2. Cargo—100 trucks per day in each direction on the principal connecting route, or 100,000 tons per year arriving or departing by highway mode.

# Ports
1. Terminals that handle more than 50,000 TEUs (a volumetric measure of containerized cargo which stands for twenty-foot equivalent units) per year, or other units measured that would convert to more than 100 trucks per day in each direction. (Trucks are defined as large single-unit trucks or combination vehicles handling freight.)
2. Bulk commodity terminals that handle more than 500,000 tons per year by highway or 100 trucks per day in each direction on the principal connecting route. (If no individual terminal handles this amount of freight, but a cluster of terminals in close proximity to each other does, then the cluster of terminals could be considered in meeting the criteria. In such cases, the connecting route might terminate at a point where the traffic to several terminals begins to separate.)
3. Passengers—terminals that handle more than 250,000 passengers per year or 1,000 passengers per day for at least 90 days during the year.

# Truck/Rail
1. 50,000 TEUs per year, or 100 trucks per day, in each direction on the principal connecting route, or other units measured that would convert to more than 100 trucks per day in each direction. (Trucks are defined as large single-unit trucks or combination vehicles carrying freight.)

# Pipelines
1. 100 trucks per day in each direction on the principal connecting route.

# Amtrak
1. 100,000 passengers per year (entrainments and detrainments). Joint Amtrak, intercity bus and public transit terminals should be considered based on the combined passenger volumes. Likewise, two or more separate facilities in close proximity should be considered based on combined passenger volumes.

# Intercity Bus
1. 100,000 passengers per year (boardings and deboardings).

# Public Transit
1. Stations with park and ride lots with more than 500 vehicle parking spaces, or 5,000 daily bus or rail passengers, with significant highway access (
i.e.
, a high percentage of the passengers arrive by cars and buses using a route that connects to another NHS route), or a major hub terminal that provides for the transfer of passengers among several bus routes. (These hubs should have a significant number of buses using a principal route connecting with the NHS.)

# Ferries
1. Interstate/international—1,000 passengers per day for at least 90 days during the year. (A ferry which connects two terminals within the same metropolitan area should be considered as local, not interstate.)
2. Local—see public transit criteria above.

# Secondary Criteria
Any of the following criteria could be used to justify an NHS connection to an intermodal terminal where there is a significant highway interface:
1. Intermodal terminals that handle more than 20 percent of passenger or freight volumes by mode within a State;
2. Intermodal terminals identified either in the Intermodal Management System or the State and metropolitan transportation plans as a major facility;
3. Significant investment in, or expansion of, an intermodal terminal; or
4. Connecting routes targeted by the State, MPO, or others for investment to address an existing, or anticipated, deficiency as a result of increased traffic.

# Proximate Connections
Intermodal terminals, identified under the secondary criteria noted above, may not have sufficient highway traffic volumes to justify an NHS connection to the terminal. States and MPOs should fully consider whether a direct connection should be identified for such terminals, or whether being in the proximity (2 to 3 miles) of an NHS route is sufficient.

The data set includes records that contain average travel times for every 15 minutes of every day (24 hours) of the year recorded and calculated for every travel time segment where probe data are available. The NPMRDS does not include any imputed travel time data.
Nonattainment area
as used in this part is defined in § 450.104 of this chapter, Transportation Planning and Programming Definitions.
Non-SOV travel
is defined as any travel mode other than driving alone in a motorized vehicle (
i.e.,
single occupancy vehicle or SOV travel), including travel avoided by telecommuting.
Non-urbanized area
means a single geographic area that comprises all of the areas in the State that are not “urbanized areas” under 23 U.S.C. 101(a)(34).
Performance period
means a determined time period during which condition/performance is measured and evaluated to: Assess condition/performance with respect to baseline condition/performance; and track progress toward the achievement of the targets that represent the intended condition/performance level at the midpoint and at the end of that time period. The term “performance period” applies to all measures in this part, except the measures for the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) in subpart B of this part. Each performance period covers a 4-year duration beginning on a specified date (provided in § 490.105).
Reporting segment
means the length of roadway that the State Department of Transportation (DOT) and MPOs define for metric calculation and reporting and is comprised of one or more travel time segments.
Target
means a quantifiable level of performance or condition, expressed as a value for the measure, to be achieved within a time period required by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).
Transportation Management Area (TMA)
as used in this part is defined in § 450.104 of this chapter, Transportation Planning and Programming Definitions.
Travel time data set
means either the NPMRDS or an equivalent data set that is used by State DOTs and MPOs as approved by FHWA, to carry out the requirements in subparts E, F, and G of this part.
Travel time reliability
means the consistency or dependability of travel times from day to day or across different times of the day.
Travel time segment
means a contiguous stretch of the NHS for which average travel time data are summarized in the travel time data set.
Truck freight bottleneck,
as used in this part, is defined as a segment of roadway identified by the State DOT as having constraints that cause a significant impact on freight mobility and reliability. Bottlenecks may include highway sections that do not meet thresholds for freight reliability identified in § 490.613 or other locations identified by the State DOT. Causes may include recurring congestion, causing delays in freight movement, or roadway features that impact truck movements, such as steep grades, substandard vertical or horizontal clearances, weight restrictions, delays at border crossings or terminals, or truck operating restrictions.

§ 490.109
Assessing significant progress toward achieving the performance targets for the National Highway Performance Program and the National Highway Freight Program.
(a)
In general.
The FHWA will assess each of the State DOT targets separately for the NHPP measures specified in § 490.105(c)(1) through (5) and the Freight Reliability measure specified in § 490.105(c)(6) to determine the significant progress made toward the achievement of those targets.
(b)
Frequency.
The FHWA will determine whether a State DOT has or has not made significant progress toward the achievement of applicable targets as described in paragraph (e) of this section at the midpoint and the end of each performance period.
(c)
Schedule.
The FHWA will determine significant progress toward the achievement of a State DOT's NHPP and NHFP targets after the State DOT submits the Mid Performance Period Progress Report for progress toward the achievement of 2-year targets, and again after the State DOT submits the Full Performance Period Progress Report for progress toward the achievement of 4-year targets. The FHWA will
notify State DOTs of the outcome of the determination of the State DOT's ability to make significant progress toward the achievement of its NHPP and NHFP targets.
(d)
Source of data/information.
(1) The FHWA will use the following sources of information to assess NHPP target achievement and condition/performance progress:
(i) Data contained within the HPMS on June 15th of the year in which the significant progress determination is made that represents conditions from the prior year for targets established for Interstate System pavement condition measures, as specified in § 490.105(c)(1);
(ii) Data contained within the HPMS on August 15th of the year in which the significant progress determination is made that represents conditions from the prior year for targets established for non-Interstate NHS pavement condition measures, as specified in § 490.105(c)(2);
(iii) The most recently available data contained within the NBI as of June 15th of the year in which the significant progress determination is made for targets established for NHS bridge condition measures, as specified in § 490.105(c)(3);
(iv) Data contained within the HPMS on August 15th of the year in which the significant progress determination is made that represents performance from the prior year for targets established for the Travel Time Reliability measures, as specified in § 490.105(c)(4);

FASH on August 15th of the year in which the significant progress determination is made that represents performance from the prior year for targets established for the GHG measure in § 490.105(c)(5), and data from Fuels
FASH that represents performance for the reference year.
(vi) Baseline condition/performance data contained in Fuels
FASH, HPMS, and NBI of the year in which the Baseline Period Performance Report is due to FHWA that represents baseline conditions/performances for the performance period for the measures in §§ 490.105(c)(1) through (5). For the GHG measure, specified in § 490.105(c)(5), the baseline performance data from HPMS shall be the data contained within HPMS on November 30th of the year the Baseline Period Performance Report is due to FHWA.
(vii) Data contained within the HPMS on November 30th of the year in which the significant progress determination is made that represents performance from the prior year for targets established for the GHG measure specified in § 490.105(c)(5), and HPMS data as of November 30, 2023 that represents performance for the reference year.
(viii) The CO
2
factor specified in § 490.509(f) for the baseline performance, prior year, and reference year for targets established for the GHG measure specified in § 490.105(c)(5).
(2) The FHWA will use the following sources of information to assess NHFP target achievement and condition/performance progress:
(i) Data contained within the HPMS on August 15th of the year in which the significant progress determination is made that represents performance from the prior year for targets established for the Freight Reliability measure, as specified in § 490.105(c)(6); and

(e)
Significant progress determination for individual NHPP and NHFP targets
—(1)
In general.
The FHWA will biennially assess whether the State DOT has achieved or made significant progress toward each target established by the State DOT for the NHPP measures described in § 490.105(c)(1) through (5) and the Freight Reliability measure described in § 490.105(c)(6). The FHWA will assess the significant progress of each statewide target separately using the condition/performance data/information sources described in paragraph (d) of this section. The FHWA will not assess the progress achieved for any additional targets a State DOT may establish under § 490.105(e)(3).
(2)
Significant progress toward individual NHPP and NHFP targets.
The FHWA will determine that a State
DOT has made significant progress toward the achievement of each 2-year or 4-year applicable target if either:
(i) The actual condition/performance level is better than the baseline condition/performance; or
(ii) The actual condition/performance level is equal to or better than the established target.
(3)
Phase-in of new requirements.
The following requirements shall only apply to the first performance period and only to the Interstate System pavement condition targets and non-Interstate NHS Travel Time Reliability targets, described in § 490.105(e)(7):
(i) At the midpoint of the first performance period, FHWA will not make a determination of significant progress toward the achievement of 2-year targets for Interstate System pavement condition measures:
(ii) The FHWA will classify the assessment of progress toward the achievement of targets in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section as “progress not determined” so that they will be excluded from the requirement under paragraph (e)(2) of this section; and
(iii) The FHWA will not make a determination of significant progress toward the achievement of 2-year targets for the Non-Interstate NHS Travel Time Reliability measure.
(4)
Insufficient data and/or information.
The FHWA will determine that a State DOT has not made significant progress toward the achievement of an individual NHPP or NHFP target if:
(i) A State DOT does not submit a required report, individual target, or other information as specified in § 490.107 for the each of the measures in § 490.105(c)(1) through (6);
(ii) The data contained in HPMS do not meet the requirements under § 490.313(b)(4)(i) by the data extraction date specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section for the each of the Interstate System pavement condition measures in § 490.105(c)(1);
(iii) The data contained in HPMS do not meet the requirements under § 490.313(b)(4)(i) by the data extraction date specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section for the each of the non-Interstate NHS pavement condition measures in § 490.105(c)(2);
(iv) A State DOT reported data are not cleared in the NBI by the data extraction date specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section for the each of the NHS bridge condition measures in § 490.105(c)(3); or
(v) The data were determined insufficient, as described in paragraphs (e)(4)(ii) through (iv) of this section, in the year in which the Baseline Period Performance Report is due to FHWA for the measures in § 490.105(c)(1) through (3).
(vi) A State DOT's reported data are not accepted in the Fuels
FASH, by the data extraction date specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section for the GHG measure in § 490.105(c)(5).
(vii) A State DOT's reported data are not accepted in the HPMS by the data extraction date specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section for the GHG measure in § 490.105(c)(5).
(5)
Extenuating circumstances.
The FHWA will consider extenuating circumstances documented by the State DOT in the assessment of progress toward the achievement of NHPP and NHFP targets in the relevant State Biennial Performance Report, provided in § 490.107.
(i) The FHWA will classify the assessment of progress toward the achievement of an individual 2-year or 4-year target as “progress not determined” if the State DOT has provided an explanation of the extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the State DOT that prevented it from making significant progress toward the achievement of a 2-year or 4-year target and the State DOT has quantified the impacts on the condition/performance that resulted from the circumstances, which are:
(A) Natural or man-made disasters that caused delay in NHPP or NHFP project delivery, extenuating delay in data collection, and/or damage/loss of data system;
(B) Sudden discontinuation of Federal government furnished data due to natural and man-made disasters or sudden discontinuation of Federal government furnished data due to lack of funding; and/or
(C) New law and/or regulation directing State DOTs to change metric and/or measure calculation.
(ii) If the State DOT's explanation, described in paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section, is accepted by FHWA, FHWA will classify the progress toward achieving the relevant target(s) as “progress not determined,” and those targets will be excluded from the requirement in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(6)
Phase-in of new requirements for the GHG Measure.
The following requirements shall only apply to the GHG targets, described in § 490.513(d), and the significant progress determination conducted immediately after the submittal of the 2024 Mid Performance Period Progress Report, described in § 490.107(b)(2):
(i) Consistent with § 490.105(e)(10)(i), State DOTs are not required to establish a 2-year target, and, consistent with 490.107(b)(2), State DOTs will not submit information related to the GHG measure in the 2024 Mid Performance Period Progress Report.
(ii) At the midpoint of the performance period, FHWA shall not make a determination of significant progress toward the achievement of 2-year targets for the GHG measure; and
(iii) The FHWA will classify the assessment of progress toward the achievement of targets in paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section as “progress not determined” and they will be excluded from the requirement under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(f)

# Subpart B—National Performance Management Measures for the Highway Safety Improvement Program
§ 490.201
Purpose.
The purpose of this subpart is to implement the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 150(c)(4), which requires the Secretary of Transportation to establish performance measures for the purpose of carrying out the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) and for State departments of transportation (State DOTs) to use in assessing:
(a) Serious injuries and fatalities per vehicle miles traveled (VMT); and
(b) Number of serious injuries and fatalities.
§ 490.203
Applicability.
The performance measures are applicable to all public roads covered by the HSIP carried out under 23 U.S.C. 130 and 148.
§ 490.205
Definitions.
Unless otherwise specified, the following definitions apply in this subpart:
5-year rolling average
means the average of 5 individual, consecutive annual points of data (e.g., the 5-year rolling average of the annual fatality rate).
Annual Report File
(ARF) means FARS data that are published annually, but prior to Final FARS data.
Fatality Analysis Reporting System
(FARS) means a nationwide census providing public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes.
Final FARS
means the FARS data that replace the ARF file and contain additional cases or updates to cases that became available after the ARF was released, and which are no longer subject to future changes.
KABCO
means the coding convention system for injury classification established by the National Safety Council.
Number of fatalities
means the total number of persons suffering fatal injuries in a motor vehicle traffic crash during a calendar year, based on the data reported by the FARS database.
Number of non-motorized fatalities
means the total number of fatalities (as defined in this section) with the FARS person attribute codes: (5) Pedestrian, (6) Bicyclist, (7) Other Cyclist, and (8) Person on Personal Conveyance.
Number of non-motorized serious injuries
means the total number of serious injuries (as defined in this section) where the injured person is, or is equivalent to, a pedestrian (2.2.36) or a pedalcylcist (2.2.39) as defined in the ANSI D16.1-2007 (incorporated by reference, see § 490.111).
Number of serious injuries
means the total number of persons suffering at least one serious injury for each separate motor vehicle traffic crash during a calendar year, as reported by the State, where the crash involves a motor vehicle traveling on a public road, and the injury status is “suspected serious injury (A)” as described in MMUCC, (incorporated by reference, see § 490.111). For serious injury classifications that are not MMUCC compliant, the number of serious injuries means serious injuries that are converted to KABCO by use of conversion tables developed by the NHTSA.
Public road
is as defined in 23 CFR 924.3.
Rate of fatalities
means the ratio of the total number of fatalities (as defined in this section) to the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) (expressed in 100 million VMT) in a calendar year.
Rate of serious injuries
means the ratio of the total number of serious injuries (as defined in this section) to the number of VMT (expressed in 100 million vehicle miles of travel) in a calendar year.
Serious injuries
means:
(1) From April 14, 2016 to April 15, 2019, injuries classified as “A” on the KABCO scale through use of the conversion tables developed by NHTSA; and
(2) After April 15, 2019, “suspected serious injury (A)” as defined in the MMUCC.
§ 490.207
National performance management measures for the Highway Safety Improvement Program.
(a) There are five performance measures for the purpose of carrying out the HSIP. They are:
(1) Number of fatalities;
(2) Rate of fatalities;
(3) Number of serious injuries;
(4) Rate of serious injuries; and,
(5) Number of non-motorized fatalities and non-motorized serious injuries.
(b) Each performance measure is based on a 5-year rolling average. The performance measures are calculated as follows:
(1) The performance measure for the number of fatalities is the 5-year rolling average of the total number of fatalities for each State and shall be calculated by adding the number of fatalities for each of the most recent 5 consecutive years ending in the year for which the targets are established, dividing by 5, and rounding to the tenth decimal place. FARS ARF may be used if Final FARS is not available.
(2) The performance measure for the rate of fatalities is the 5-year rolling average of the State's fatality rate per VMT and shall be calculated by first calculating the number of fatalities per 100 million VMT for each of the most recent 5 consecutive years ending in the year for which the targets are established, adding the results, dividing by 5, and rounding to the thousandth decimal place. The FARS ARF may be used if Final FARS is not available. State VMT data are derived from the HPMS. The Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) VMT is estimated by the MPO. The sum of the fatality rates is divided by five and then rounded to the thousandth decimal place.
(3) The performance measure for the number of serious injuries is the 5-year rolling average of the total number of serious injuries for each State and shall be calculated by adding the number of serious injuries for each of the most recent 5 consecutive years ending in the year for which the targets are established, dividing by five, and rounding to the tenth decimal place.
(4) The performance measure for the rate of serious injuries is the 5-year rolling average of the State's serious injuries rate per VMT and shall be calculated by first calculating the number of serious injuries per 100 million VMT for each of the most recent 5 consecutive years ending in the year for which the targets are established, adding the results, dividing by five, and rounding to the thousandth decimal place. State VMT data are derived from the HPMS. The MPO VMT is estimated by the MPO.
(5) The performance measure for the number of Non-motorized Fatalities and Non-motorized Serious Injuries is the 5-year rolling average of the total number of non-motorized fatalities and non-motorized serious injuries for each State and shall be calculated by adding the number of non-motorized fatalities to the number non-motorized serious injuries for each of the most recent 5 consecutive years ending in the year for which the targets are established, dividing by five, and rounding to the tenth decimal place. FARS ARF may be used if Final FARS is not available.
(c) For purposes of calculating serious injuries in paragraphs (b)(3), (4), and (5) of this section:
(1) Before April 15, 2019, serious injuries may be determined by either of the following:
(i) Serious injuries coded (A) in the KABCO injury classification scale through use of the NHTSA serious injuries conversion tables; or
(ii) Using MMUCC (incorporated by reference, see § 490.111).
(2) By April 15, 2019, serious injuries shall be determined using MMUCC.
§ 490.209
Establishment of performance targets.
(a) State DOTs shall establish targets annually for each performance measure identified in § 490.207(a) in a manner that is consistent with the following:
(1) State DOT targets shall be identical to the targets established by the State Highway Safety Office for common performance measures reported in the State's Highway Safety Plan, subject to the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 402(k)(4), and as coordinated through the State Strategic Highway Safety Plan. For Fiscal Year 2025 only, the performance targets submitted under this paragraph are not required to be identical to the targets established by the State Highway Safety Office for the common performance measures.
(2) State DOT targets shall represent performance outcomes anticipated for the calendar year following the HSIP annual report date, as provided in 23 CFR 924.15.
(3) State DOT performance targets shall represent the anticipated performance outcome for all public roadways within the State regardless of ownership or functional class.
(4) State DOT targets shall be reported in the HSIP annual report that is due after April 14, 2017, and in each subsequent HSIP annual report thereafter.
(5) The State DOT shall include, in the HSIP Report (see 23 CFR part 924), at a minimum, the most recent 5 years of serious injury data and non-motorized serious injury data. The serious injury data shall be either MMUCC compliant or converted to the KABCO system (A) for injury classification through use of the NHTSA conversion tables as required by § 490.207(c).
(6) Unless approved by FHWA and subject to § 490.209(a)(1), a State DOT shall not change one or more of its targets for a given year once it is submitted in the HSIP annual report.
(b) In addition to targets described in paragraph (a) of this section, State DOTs may, as appropriate, for each target in paragraph (a) establish additional targets for portions of the State.
(1) A State DOT shall declare and describe in the State HSIP annual report required by § 490.213 the boundaries used to establish each additional target.
(2) State DOTs may select any number and combination of urbanized area boundaries and may also select a single non-urbanized area boundary for the establishment of additional targets.
(3) The boundaries used by the State DOT for additional targets shall be contained within the geographic boundary of the State.
(4) State DOTs shall evaluate separately the progress of each additional target and report that progress in the State HSIP annual report (see 23 CFR part 924).
(c) The Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) shall establish performance targets for each of the measures identified in § 490.207(a), where applicable, in a manner that is consistent with the following:
(1) The MPOs shall establish targets not later than 180 days after the respective State DOT establishes and reports targets in the State HSIP annual report.
(2) The MPO target shall represent performance outcomes anticipated for the same calendar year as the State target.
(3) After the MPOs within each State establish the targets, the State DOT must be able to provide those targets to FHWA, upon request.
(4) For each performance measure, the MPOs shall establish a target by either:
(i) Agreeing to plan and program projects so that they contribute toward the accomplishment of the State DOT safety target for that performance measure; or
(ii) Committing to a quantifiable target for that performance measure for their metropolitan planning area.
(5) The MPOs that establish quantifiable fatality rate or serious injury rate targets shall report the VMT estimate used for such targets and the methodology used to develop the estimate. The methodology should be consistent with other Federal reporting requirements, if applicable.
(6) The MPO targets established under paragraph (c)(4) of this section specific to the metropolitan planning area shall represent the anticipated performance outcome for all public roadways within the metropolitan planning boundary regardless of ownership or functional class.
(d)(1) The State DOT and relevant MPOs shall coordinate on the establishment of targets in accordance with 23 CFR part 450 to ensure consistency, to the maximum extent practicable.
(2) The MPOs with multi-State boundaries that agree to plan and program projects to contribute toward State targets in accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section shall plan and program safety projects in support of the State DOT targets for each area within each State (e.g., MPOs that extend into two States shall agree to plan and program projects to contribute toward two separate sets of targets (one set for each State)).
[81 FR 13913, Mar. 15, 2016, as amended at 88 FR 36474, June 5, 2023; 89 FR 37115, May 6, 2024]
§ 490.211
Determining whether a State department of transportation has met or made significant progress toward meeting performance targets.
(a) The determination for having met or made significant progress toward meeting the performance targets under 23 U.S.C. 148(i) will be determined based on:
(1) The most recent available Final FARS data for the fatality number. The FARS ARF may be used if Final FARS is not available;
(2) The most recent available Final FARS and HPMS data for the fatality rate. The FARS ARF may be used if Final FARS is not available;
(3) The most recent available Final FARS data for the non-motorized fatality number. The FARS ARF may be used if Final FARS is not available;
(4) State reported data for the serious injuries number;
(5) State reported data and HPMS data for the serious injuries rate; and
(6) State reported data for the non-motorized serious injuries number.
(b) The State-reported serious injury data and non-motorized serious injury data will be taken from the HSIP report in accordance with 23 CFR part 924.
(c) The FHWA will evaluate whether a State DOT has met or made significant progress toward meeting performance targets.
(1) The FHWA will not evaluate any additional targets a State DOT may establish under § 490.209(b).
(2) A State DOT is determined to have met or made significant progress toward meeting its targets when at least four of the performance targets established under § 490.207(a) are:
(i) Met; or
(ii) The outcome for a performance measure is less than the 5-year rolling average data for the performance measure for the year prior to the establishment of the State's target. For example, of the State DOT's five performance targets, the State DOT is determined to have met or made significant progress toward meeting its targets if it met two targets and the outcome is less than the measure for the year prior to the establishment of the target for two other targets.
(d) If a State DOT has not met or made significant progress toward meeting performance targets in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, the State DOT must comply with 23 U.S.C. 148(i) for the subsequent fiscal year.
(e) The FHWA will first evaluate whether a State DOT has met or made significant progress toward meeting performance targets after the calendar year following the year for which the first targets are established, and then annually thereafter.
§ 490.213
Reporting of targets for the Highway Safety Improvement Program.
(a) The targets established by the State DOT shall be reported to FHWA in the State's HSIP annual report in accordance with 23 CFR part 924.
(b) The MPOs shall annually report their established safety targets to their respective State DOT, in a manner that is documented and mutually agreed upon by both parties.
(c) The MPOs shall report baseline safety performance, VMT estimate and methodology if a quantifiable rate target was established, and progress toward the achievement of their targets in the system performance report in the metropolitan transportation plan in accordance with 23 CFR part 450.

(A) If the Cracking__Percent value of a section is less than 5 percent, the cracking rating for the pavement section is Good;
(B) If the Cracking__Percent value of a section is equal to or greater than 5 percent and less than or equal to 20 percent the cracking rating for the pavement section is Fair; and
(C) If the Cracking__Percent value of a section is greater than 20 percent the cracking rating for the pavement section is Poor.
(ii) For jointed concrete pavement sections—
(A) If the Cracking__Percent value of a section is less than 5 percent, the cracking rating for the pavement section is Good;
(B) If the Cracking__Percent value of a section is equal to or greater than 5 percent and less than or equal to 15 percent the cracking rating for the pavement section is Fair; and
(C) If the Cracking__Percent value of a section is greater than 15 percent the cracking rating for the pavement section is Poor.

(4) For sections on roadways where the posted speed limit is less than 40 MPH and where the State DOT has reported PSR in lieu of the IRI, Cracking__Percent, rutting, and faulting metrics the PSR condition level shall be determined using the following criteria:
(i) If the PSR of a section is equal to or greater than 4.0 the PSR rating for the pavement section is Good;
(ii) If the PSR of a section is less than 4.0 and greater than 2.0 the PSR rating for the pavement section is Fair; and

(d) The Overall condition for CRCP sections shall be determined based on two ratings of IRI and Cracking__Percent, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section or based on PSR where appropriate as
described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, respectively, for each section as follows:
(1) A pavement section shall be rated an overall condition of Good only if the section is exhibiting Good ratings for both conditions (IRI and Cracking__Percent);
(2) A pavement section shall be rated an overall condition of Poor if it exhibits Poor ratings for both conditions (IRI and Cracking__Percent);
(3) A pavement section shall be rated an overall condition of Fair if it does not meet the criteria in paragraphs (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section.

§ 490.505
Definitions.
All definitions in § 490.101 apply to this subpart. Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, the following definitions apply to this subpart:
Greenhouse gas (GHG)
is any gas that absorbs infrared radiation (traps heat) in the atmosphere. Approximately 97 percent of on-road GHG emissions are carbon dioxide (CO
2
) from burning fossil fuel. Other transportation GHGs are methane (CH
4
), nitrous oxide (N
2
O), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).
Greenhouse gas (GHG)
is any gas that absorbs infrared radiation (traps heat) in the atmosphere. Approximately 97 percent of on-road GHG emissions are carbon dioxide (CO
2
) from burning fossil fuel. Other transportation GHGs are methane (CH
4
), nitrous oxide (N
2
O), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).
Level of Travel Time Reliability
is a comparison, expressed as a ratio, of the 80th percentile travel time of a reporting segment to the “normal” (50th percentile) travel time of a reporting segment occurring throughout a full calendar year.
Normal Travel Time (or 50th percentile travel time)
is the time of travel to traverse the full extent of a reporting segment which is greater than the time for 50 percent of the travel in a calendar year to traverse the same reporting segment.
Reference year
is calendar year 2022 for the purpose of the GHG measure.
Travel time cumulative probability distribution
means a representation of all the travel times for a road segment during a defined reporting period (such as annually) presented in a percentile ranked order as provided in the travel time data set. The normal (50th percentile) and 80th percentile travel
times used to compute the Travel Time Reliability measures may be identified by the travel time cumulative probability distribution.

§ 490.507
National performance management measures for system performance.
There are three performance measures to assess the performance of the Interstate System and the performance of the non-Interstate NHS for the purpose of carrying out the National Highway Performance Program (referred to collectively as the NHS Performance measures).
(a) Two measures are used to assess reliability (referred to collectively as the Travel Time Reliability measures). They are:
(1) Percent of the person-miles traveled on the Interstate that are reliable (referred to as the Interstate Travel Time Reliability measure); and
(2) Percent of person-miles traveled on the non-Interstate NHS that are reliable (referred to as the Non-Interstate Travel Time Reliability measure).
(b) One measure is used to assess GHG emissions, which is the percent change in tailpipe CO
2
emissions on the NHS compared to the reference year (referred to as the GHG measure).

[82 FR 6031, Jan. 18, 2017, as amended at 83 FR 24936, May 31, 2018; 88 FR 85392, Dec. 7, 2023]
§ 490.511
Calculation of National Highway System performance metrics.
(a) Two performance metrics are required for the NHS Performance measures specified in § 490.507. These are:
(1) Level of Travel Time Reliability (LOTTR) for the Travel Time Reliability measures in § 490.507(a) (referred to as the LOTTR metric).
(2) Annual Total Tailpipe CO
2
Emissions on the NHS for the GHG measure in § 490.507(b) (referred to as the GHG metric).
(b) The State DOT shall calculate the LOTTR metrics for each NHS reporting segment in accordance with the following:
(1) Data sets shall be created from the travel time data set to be used to calculate the LOTTR metrics. This data set shall include, for each reporting segment, a ranked list of average travel times for all traffic (“all vehicles” in NPMRDS nomenclature), to the nearest second, for 15 minute periods of a population that:
(i) Includes travel times occurring between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. for every weekday (Monday-Friday) from January 1st through December 31st of the same year;
(ii) Includes travel times occurring between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. for every weekday (Monday-Friday) from January 1st through December 31st of the same year;
(iii) Includes travel times occurring between the hours of 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. for every weekday (Monday-Friday) from January 1st through December 31st of the same year; and
(iv) Includes travel times occurring between the hours of 6: a.m. and 8: p.m. for every weekend day (Saturday-Sunday) from January 1st through December 31st of the same year.
(2) The Normal Travel Time (50th percentile) shall be determined from each data set defined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section as the time in which 50 percent of the times in the data set are shorter in duration and 50 percent are longer in duration. The 80th percentile travel time shall be determined for each data set defined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section as the time in which 80 percent of the times in the data set are shorter in duration and 20 percent are longer in duration. Both the Normal and 80th percentile travel times can be determined by plotting the data on a travel time cumulative probability distribution graph or using the percentile functions available in spreadsheet and other analytical tools.
(3) Four LOTTR metrics shall be calculated for each reporting segment; one for each data set defined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section as the 80th percentile travel time divided by the 50th percentile travel time and rounded to the nearest hundredth.
(c) Tailpipe CO
2
emissions on the NHS for a given year shall be computed in million metric tons (mmt) and rounded to the nearest hundredth as follows:
ER07DE23.000
Where:
(Tailpipe CO
2
Emissions on NHS)
CY
= Total tailpipe CO
2
emissions on the NHS in a calendar year (expressed in mmt, and rounded to the nearest hundredth);
T = the total number of on-road fuel types;
t
= an on-road fuel type;

released per unit of fuel consumed for on-road fuel type “
t”;
NHS VMT = annual total vehicle-miles traveled on NHS (to the nearest one million vehicle-miles); and
Total VMT = annual total vehicle-miles traveled on all public roads (to the nearest one million vehicle-miles).
(d) For the GHG measure specified in § 490.507(b), MPOs are granted additional flexibility in how they calculate the GHG metric, described in § 490.511(a)(2). MPOs may use the MPO share of the State's VMT as a proxy for the MPO share of CO
2
emissions in the State, VMT estimates along with MOVES
1
emissions factors, FHWA's Energy and Emissions Reduction Policy Analysis Tool (EERPAT) model, or other method the MPO can demonstrate has valid and useful results for CO
2
measurement.
(e) Starting in 2018 and annually thereafter, State DOTs shall report the LOTTR metrics, defined in paragraph (b) of this section, in accordance with HPMS Field Manual by June 15th of each year for the previous year's measures.
(1) Metrics are reported to HPMS by reporting segment. All reporting segments where the NPMRDS is used shall be referenced by NPMRDS TMC(s) or HPMS section(s). If a State DOT elects to use, in part or in whole, the equivalent data set, all reporting segment shall be referenced by HPMS section(s); and

If a State DOT does not elect to use FHWA supplied occupancy factor, as provided in § 490.507(d), that State DOT shall report vehicle occupancy factor (to the nearest tenth) to HPMS.
(f) Tailpipe CO
2
emissions generated by on-road sources travelling on the NHS (the GHG metric), and generated by on-road sources travelling on all roadways (the step in the calculation prior to computing the GHG metric) shall be calculated as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. The calculations shall be reported in the State Biennial Performance Reports, as required in § 490.107, and shall address the following time periods.
(1) The reference year, as required in § 490.107(b)(1)(ii)(H); and
(2) The calendar year preceding the reporting year, as required in § 490.107(b)(1)(ii)(H), (b)(2)(ii)(J) and (b)(3)(ii)(I).

§ 490.601
Purpose.
The purpose of this subpart is to implement the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 150(c)(6) to establish performance measures for State Departments of Transportation (State DOTs) and the Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) to use to assess the national freight movement on the Interstate System.
§ 490.603
Applicability.
The performance measures to assess the national freight movement are applicable to the Interstate System.
§ 490.605
Definitions.
The definitions in § 490.101 apply to this subpart.
§ 490.607
National performance management measures to assess freight movement on the Interstate System.
The performance measure to assess freight movement on the Interstate System is the: Truck Travel Time Reliability (TTTR) Index (referred to as the Freight Reliability measure).
§ 490.609
Data requirements.
(a) Travel time data needed to calculate the Freight Reliability measure in § 490.607 shall come from the travel time data set, as specified in § 490.103(e).
(b) State DOTs, in coordination with MPOs, shall define reporting segments in accordance with § 490.103(f). Reporting segments must be contiguous so that they cover the full extent of the directional mainline highways of the Interstate in the State.
(c) When truck travel times are not available in the travel time data set (data not reported, or reported as “0” or null) as specified in § 490.611(a)(1)(ii) for a given 15 minute interval, State DOTs shall replace the missing travel time with an observed travel time that represents all traffic on the roadway during the same 15 minute interval (“all vehicles” in NPMRDS nomenclature).
(d) If an NHS roadway is closed, the State DOT is not required to include those time periods for those segments of road in the calculations required for the Freight Reliability metric/measure.
§ 490.611
Calculation of Truck Travel Time Reliability metrics.
(a) The State DOT shall calculate the TTTR Index metric (referred to as the TTTR metric) for each Interstate System reporting segment in accordance with the following:
(1) A truck travel time data set shall be created from the travel time data set to be used to calculate the TTTR metric. This data set shall include, for each reporting segment, a ranked list of average truck travel times, to the nearest second, for 15 minute periods of a 24-hour period for an entire calendar year that:
(i) Includes “AM Peak” travel times occurring between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. for every weekday (Monday -Friday) from January 1st through December 31st of the same year;
(ii) Includes “Mid Day” travel times occurring between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. for every weekday (Monday-Friday) from January 1st through December 31st of the same year;
(iii) Includes “PM Peak” travel times occurring between the hours of 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. for every weekday (Monday-Friday) from January 1st through December 31st of the same year;

(v) Includes “Weekend” travel times occurring between the hours of 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. for every weekend day (Saturday-Sunday) from January 1st through December 31st of the same year.
(2) The Normal Truck Travel Time (50th percentile) shall be determined from each of the truck travel time data sets defined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section as the time in which 50 percent of the times in the data set are shorter in duration and 50 percent are longer in duration. The 95th percentile truck travel time shall be determined from each of the truck travel time data sets defined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section as the time in which 95 percent of the times in the data set are shorter in duration. Both the Normal and 95th percentile truck travel times can be determined by plotting the data on a travel time cumulative probability distribution graph or using the percentile functions available in spreadsheet and other analytical tools.
(3) Five TTTR metrics shall be calculated for each reporting segment; one for each data set defined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section as the 95th percentile travel time divided by the Normal Truck Travel Time and rounded to the nearest hundredth.
(b) Starting in 2018 and annually thereafter, State DOTs shall report the TTTR metrics, as defined in this section, in accordance with the HPMS Field Manual by June 15th of each year for the previous year's Freight Reliability measures.
(1) All metrics shall be reported to HPMS by reporting segments. When the NPMRDS is used metrics shall be referenced by NPMRDS TMC(s) or HPMS section(s). If a State DOT elects to use, in part or in whole, the equivalent data set, all reporting segment shall be referenced by HPMS section(s).
(2) The TTTR metric shall be reported to HPMS for each reporting segment (to the nearest hundredths) for each of the five time periods identified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (v) of this section; the corresponding 95th percentile travel times (to the nearest second) and the corresponding normal (50th percentile) travel times (to the nearest second).
§ 490.613
Calculation of Freight Reliability measure.
(a) The performance for freight movement on the Interstate in § 490.607 (the Freight Reliability measure) shall be calculated in accordance with this section by State DOTs and MPOs to carry out the freight movement on the Interstate System related requirements of this part, and by FHWA to make the significant progress determinations specified in § 490.109 and to report on freight performance of the Interstate System.
(b) The Freight Reliability measure shall be computed to the nearest hundredth as follows:
ER18JA17.030
Where:
i
= An Interstate System reporting segment;
maxTTTR
i
= The maximum TTTR of the five time periods in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (v) of § 490.611, to the nearest hundredth, of Interstate System reporting segment “i”;

82 FR 6045, Jan. 18, 2017, unless otherwise noted.
§ 490.701
Purpose.
The purpose of this subpart is to implement the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 150(c)(5)(A) to establish performance measures for State DOTs and the MPOs to use in assessing CMAQ Traffic Congestion for the purpose of carrying out the CMAQ program.
§ 490.703
Applicability.
The CMAQ Traffic Congestion performance measures are applicable to all urbanized areas that include NHS mileage and with a population over 1 million for the first performance period and in urbanized areas with a population over 200,000 for the second and all other performance periods, that are, in all or part, designated as nonattainment or maintenance areas for ozone (O

10
and PM
2.5
) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
§ 490.705
Definitions.
All definitions in § 490.101 apply to this subpart. Unless otherwise specified, the following definitions apply in this subpart:
Excessive delay
means the extra amount of time spent in congested conditions defined by speed thresholds that are lower than a normal delay threshold. For the purposes of this rule, the speed threshold is 20 miles per hour (mph) or 60 percent of the posted speed limit, whichever is greater.
Peak Period
is defined as weekdays from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and either 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. or 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. State DOTs and MPOs may choose whether to use 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. or 4 p.m. to 8 p.m.
§ 490.707
National performance management measures for traffic congestion.
There are two performance measures to assess traffic congestion for the purpose of carrying out the CMAQ program (referred to collectively as the CMAQ Traffic Congestion measures. They are:
(a) Annual Hours of Peak Hour Excessive Delay (PHED) Per Capita (referred to as the PHED measure); and
(b) Percent of Non-SOV Travel.
§ 490.709
Data requirements.
(a) Travel time data needed to calculate the PHED measure in § 490.707(a) shall come from the travel time data set, as specified in § 490.103(e).

(1) State DOTs shall measure or estimate hourly traffic volumes for Peak Periods on each weekday of the reporting year by using either paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
(i) State DOTs may use hourly traffic volume counts collected by continuous count stations and apply them to multiple reporting segments; or
(ii) State DOTs may use Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) reported to the HPMS to estimate hourly traffic volumes when no hourly volume counts exist. In these cases the AADT data used should be the most recently available, but not more than 2 years older than the reporting period (e.g., if reporting for calendar year 2018, AADT should be from 2016 or 2017) and should be split to represent the appropriate direction of travel of the reporting segment.
(2) State DOTs shall assign hourly traffic volumes to each reporting segment by hour (e.g., between 8 a.m. and 8:59 a.m.).
(3) State DOTs shall report the methodology they use to develop hourly traffic volume estimates to FHWA no later than 60 days before the submittal of the first Baseline Performance Period Report.
(4) If a State DOT elects to change the methodology it reported under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, then the State DOT shall submit the changed methodology no later than 60 days before the submittal of next State Biennial Performance Report required in § 490.107(b).
(5) If an NHS roadway is closed, the State DOT is not required to include those time periods for the segment of road in the calculation required for this metric and measure.
(d) State DOTs shall develop annual vehicle classification data for each reporting segment using data as follows:
(1) State DOTs shall measure or estimate the percentage of cars, buses, and trucks, relative to total AADT for each segment using either paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
(i) State DOTs may use annual traffic volume counts collected by continuous count stations to estimate the annual percent share of traffic volumes for cars, buses, and trucks for each segment; or
(ii) State DOTs may use AADT reported to the HPMS to estimate the annual percent share of traffic volumes for cars, buses, and trucks, where:
(A) Buses = value in HPMS Data Item “AADT__Single__Unit”;
(B) Trucks = value in HPMS Data Item “AADT__Combination”; and
(C) Cars = subtract values for Buses and Trucks from the value in HPMS Data Item “AADT”.
(iii) If a State DOT uses the data reported to the HPMS in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, then the data values should be split to represent the appropriate direction of travel of the reporting segment.
(2) State DOTs shall report the methodology they use to develop annual percent share of traffic volume by vehicle class to FHWA no later than 60 days before the submittal of the first Baseline Performance Period Report.
(3) If a State DOT elects to change the methodology it reported under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, then the State DOT shall submit the changed methodology no later than 60 days before the submittal of next State
Biennial Performance Report required in § 490.107(b).
(e) State DOTs shall develop annual average vehicle occupancy (AVO) factors for cars, buses, and trucks in applicable urbanized areas using either method under paragraph (e)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
(1) State DOTs shall measure or estimate annual vehicle occupancy factors for cars, buses, and trucks in applicable urbanized areas.
(i) State DOTs shall use estimated annual vehicle occupancy factors for cars, buses, and trucks in urbanized areas provided by FHWA; and/or
(ii) State DOTs may use an alternative estimate of annual vehicle occupancy factors for a specific reporting segment(s) for cars, buses, and trucks in urbanized areas, provided that it is more specific than the data provided by FHWA.
(f) All State DOTs and MPOs contributing to the unified target for the applicable area as specified in § 490.105(d)(2) shall agree to using one of the methods specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section to identify the data that will be used to determine the Percent of Non-SOV Travel for the applicable urbanized area.
(1) The data to determine the Percent of Non-SOV Travel measure shall be developed using any one of the following methods.
(i)
Method A—American Community Survey.
Populations by predominant travel to commute to work may be identified from Table DP03 of the American Community Survey using the totals by transportation mode listed within the “Commuting to Work” subject heading under the “Estimate” column of the table. The “5 Year Estimate” DP03 table using a geographic filter that represents the applicable “Urban Area” shall be used to identify these populations. The Percent of Non-SOV Travel measure shall be developed from the most recent data as of August 15th of the year in which the State Biennial Performance Report is due to FHWA.
(ii)
Method B—local survey.
The Percent of Non-SOV Travel may be estimated from a local survey focused on either work travel or household travel for the area and conducted as recently as 2 years before the beginning of the performance period. The survey method shall estimate travel mode choice for the full urbanized area using industry accepted methodologies and approaches resulting in a margin of error that is acceptable to industry standards, allow for updates on at least a biennial frequency, and distinguish non-SOV travel occurring in the area as a percent of all work or household travel.
(iii)
Method C—system use measurement.
The volume of travel using surface modes of transportation may be estimated from measurements of actual use of each transportation mode. Sample or continuous measurements may be used to count the number of travelers using different surface modes of transportation. The method used to count travelers shall estimate the total volume of annual travel for the full urbanized area within a margin of error that is acceptable to industry standards and allows for updates on at least a biennial frequency. The method shall include sufficient information to calculate the amount of non-SOV travel occurring in the area as a percentage of all surface transportation travel. State DOTs are encouraged to report use counts to FHWA that are not included in currently available national data sources.
(2) State DOTs shall report the data collection method that is used to determine the Percent of Non-SOV Travel measure for each applicable urbanized area in the State to FHWA in their first Baseline Performance Period Report required in § 490.107(b)(1). The State DOT shall include sufficient detail to understand how the data are collected if either Method B or Method C are used for the urbanized area. This method shall be used for the full performance period for each applicable urbanized area.
(3) If State DOTs and MPOs that contribute to an applicable urbanized area elect to change the data collection method reported under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, then each respective State DOT shall report this change in their next Baseline Performance Report required in § 490.107(b)(1). The new method reported as a requirement of this paragraph shall not be used until
the beginning of the next performance period for the Baseline Performance Report in which the method was reported to be changed.
(g) Populations of urbanized areas shall be as identified based on the most recent annual estimates published by the U.S. Census available 1 year before the State DOT Baseline Performance Period Report is due to FHWA to identify applicability of the CMAQ Traffic Congestion measures in § 490.707(a) and (b) for each performance period, as described in § 490.105(e)(8)(iii)(D) and (f)(5)(iii)(D). For computing the PHED measure in § 490.713(b), the most recent annual population estimate published by the U.S. Census, at the time when the State DOT Biennial Performance Period Report is due to FHWA shall be used.
(h) Nonattainment and maintenance area determinations for the CMAQ Traffic Congestion measures:
(1) The CMAQ Traffic Congestion measures apply to nonattainment and maintenance areas. Such areas shall be identified based on the effective date of U.S. EPA's designations under the NAAQS in 40 CFR part 81, as of the date 1 year before the State DOT Baseline Performance Period Report is due to FHWA.
(2) The nonattainment and maintenance areas to which the CMAQ Traffic Congestion measures applies shall be revised if, on the date 1 year before the State DOT Mid Performance Period Progress Report is due to FHWA, the area is no longer in nonattainment or maintenance for a criteria pollutant included in § 490.703.
§ 490.711
Calculation of Peak Hour Excessive Delay metric.
(a) The performance metric required to calculate the measure specified in § 490.707(a) is Total Peak Hour Excessive Delay (person-hours)(referred to as the PHED metric). The following paragraphs explain how to calculate this PHED metric.
(b) State DOTs shall use the following data to calculate the PHED metric:
(1) Travel times of all traffic (“all vehicles” in NPMRDS nomenclature) during each 15 minute interval for all applicable reporting segments in the travel time data set occurring for peak periods from January 1st through December 31st of the same year;
(2) The length of each applicable reporting segment, reported as required under § 490.709(b);
(3) Hourly volume estimation for all days and for all reporting segments where excessive delay is measured, as specified in § 490.709(c);
(4) Annual vehicle classification data for all days and for all reporting segments where excessive delay is measured, as specified in § 490.709(d); and
(5) Annual vehicle occupancy factors for cars, buses, and trucks for all days and for all reporting segments where excessive delay is measured, as specified in § 490.709(e).
(c) The State DOT shall calculate the “excessive delay threshold travel time” for all applicable travel time segments as follows:
ER18JA17.031
Where:
Excessive Delay Threshold Travel Time
s
= the time of travel, to the nearest whole second, to traverse the Travel Time Segment at which any longer measured travel times would result in excessive delay for the travel time segment “”;
Travel Time Segment Length
s
= total length of travel time segment to the nearest thousandth of a mile for travel time reporting segment “”; and
Threshold Speed
s
= the speed of travel at which any slower measured speeds would result in excessive delay for travel time
reporting segment “.” As defined in § 490.705, the speed threshold is 20 miles per hour (mph) or 60 percent of the posted speed limit travel time reporting segment “s,” whichever is greater.
(d) State DOTs shall determine the “excessive delay” for each 15 minute bin of each reporting segment for every hour and every day in a calendar year as follows:
(1) The travel time segment delay (RSD) shall be calculated to the nearest whole second as follow:
RSD
s,b
−
Excessive Delay Threshold Travel Time
s
and
RSD
s,b
≤ 900
seconds
Where:
RSD
s,b
= travel time segment delay, calculated to the nearest whole second, for a 15-minute bin “b” of travel time reporting segment “s” for in a day in a calendar year.

b = a 15-minute bin of a travel time reporting segment “s”; and
s = a travel time reporting segment.
(2) Excessive delay, the additional amount of time to traverse a travel time segment in a 15-minute bin as compared to the time needed to traverse the travel time segment when traveling at the excessive delay travel speed threshold, shall be calculated to the nearest thousandths of an hour as follows:

RSD
s,b
= the calculated travel time reporting segment delay for fifteen minute bin “b” of a travel time reporting segment “s,” as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section;
b = a fifteen minute bin of a travel time reporting segment “s”; and
s = a travel time reporting segment.
(e) State DOTs shall use the hourly traffic volumes as described in § 490.709(c) to calculate the PHED metric for each reporting segment as follows:
ER18JA17.033
Where:
Total Excessive Delay
s
(in person-hours) = the sum of the excessive delay, to the nearest thousandths, for all traffic traveling through single travel time reporting segment “s” on NHS within an urbanized area, specified in § 490.703, accumulated over the full reporting year;
AVO = Average Vehicle Occupancy;
s = a travel time reporting segment;
d = a day of the reporting year;
TD = total number of days in the reporting year;

ER18JA17.034
Where the equation equals hourly traffic volume, to the nearest tenth, for hour interval “h” and day “d” that corresponds to 15-minute bin “b” and travel time reporting segment “s” divided by 4. For example, the 9 a.m. to 9:15 a.m. minute bin would be assigned one fourth of the hourly traffic volume for the 9 a.m. to 9:59 a.m. hour on the roadway in which travel time segment is included;
AVO = (P

(f) Starting in 2018 and annually thereafter, State DOTs shall report the PHED metric (to the nearest one hundredth hour) in accordance with HPMS Field Manual by June 15th of each year for the previous year's PHED measures. The PHED metric shall be reported for each reporting segment. All reporting segments of the NPMRDS shall be referenced by NPMRDS TMC or HPMS section(s). If a State DOT elects to use, in part or in whole, the equivalent data set, all reporting segments shall be referenced by HPMS sections.
§ 490.713
Calculation of Traffic Congestion measures.
(a) The performance measures in § 490.707 shall be computed in accordance with this section by State DOTs and MPOs to carry out CMAQ traffic congestion performance-related requirements of this part and by FHWA to report on traffic congestion performance.
(b) The performance measure for CMAQ traffic congestion specified in § 490.707, Annual Hours of Peak Hour Excessive Delay Per Capita (the PHED measure), shall be computed to the nearest tenth, and by summing the PHED metrics of all reporting segments in each of the urbanized area, specified in § 490.703, and dividing it by the population of the urbanized area to produce the PHED measure. The equation for calculating the PHED measure is as follows:
ER18JA17.035

§ 500.101
Purpose.
The purpose of this part is to implement the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 303(a) which directs the Secretary of Transportation (the Secretary) to issue regulations for State development, establishment, and implementation of systems for managing highway pavement of Federal-aid highways (PMS), bridges on and off Federal-aid highways (BMS), highway safety (SMS), traffic congestion (CMS), public transportation facilities and equipment (PTMS), and intermodal transportation facilities and systems (IMS). This regulation also implements 23 U.S.C. 303(b) which directs the Secretary to issue guidelines and requirements for State development, establishment, and implementation of a traffic monitoring system for highways and public transportation facilities and equipment (TMS).
§ 500.102
Policy.
(a) Federal, State, and local governments are under increasing pressure to balance their budgets and, at the same time, respond to public demands for quality services. Along with the need to invest in America's future, this leaves transportation agencies with the task of trying to manage current transportation systems as cost-effectively as possible to meet evolving, as well as backlog needs. The use of existing or new transportation management systems provides a framework for cost-effective decision making that emphasizes enhanced service at reduced public and private life-cycle cost. The primary outcome of transportation management systems is improved system performance and safety. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) strongly encourage implementation of transportation management systems consistent with State, metropolitan planning organization, transit operator, or local government needs.
(b) Whether the systems are developed under the provisions of this part or under a State's own procedures, the following categories of FHWA administered funds may be used for development, establishment, and implementation of any of the management systems and the traffic monitoring system: National highway system; surface transportation program; State planning and research and metropolitan planning funds (including the optional use of minimum allocation funds authorized under 23 U.S.C. 157(c) and restoration funds authorized under § 202(f) of the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 (Pub.L. 104-59) for carrying out the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 307(c)(1) and 23 U.S.C. 134(a)); congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program funds for those management systems that can be shown to contribute to the attainment of a national ambient air quality standard; and apportioned bridge funds for development
and establishment of the bridge management system. The following categories of FTA administered funds may be used for development, establishment, and implementation of the CMS, PTMS, IMS, and TMS: Metropolitan planning; State planning and research, and formula transit funds.
§ 500.103
Definitions.
Unless otherwise specified in this part, the definitions in 23 U.S.C. 101(a) are applicable to this part. As used in this part:
Federal-aid highways
means those highways eligible for assistance under title 23, U.S.C., except those functionally classified as local or rural minor collectors.
Metropolitan planning organization (MPO)
means the forum for cooperative transportation decision making for a metropolitan planning area.
National Highway System (NHS)
means the system of highways designated and approved in accordance with the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 103(b).
State
means any one of the fifty States, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico.
Transportation management area (TMA)
means an urbanized area with a population over 200,000 (as determined by the latest decennial census) or other area when TMA designation is requested by the Governor and the MPO (or affected local officials), and officially designated by the Administrators of the FHWA and the FTA. The TMA designation applies to the entire metropolitan planning area(s).
§ 500.104
State option.
Except as specified in § 500.105 (a) and (b), a State may elect at any time not to implement any one or more of the management systems required under 23 U.S.C. 303, in whole or in part.
§ 500.105
Requirements.
(a) The metropolitan transportation planning process (23 U.S.C. 134 and 49 U.S.C. 5303-5005) in TMAs shall include a CMS that meets the requirements of § 500.109 of this regulation.
(b) States shall develop, establish, and implement a TMS that meets the requirements of subpart B of this regulation.
(c) Any of the management systems that the State chooses to implement under 23 U.S.C. 303 and this regulation shall be developed in cooperation with MPOs in metropolitan areas, affected agencies receiving assistance under the Federal Transit Act (49 U.S.C., Chapter 53), and other agencies (including private owners and operators) that have responsibility for operation of the affected transportation systems or facilities.
(d) The results (e.g., policies, programs, projects, etc.) of any of the management systems that a State chooses to develop under 23 U.S.C. 303 and this regulation shall be considered in the development of metropolitan and statewide transportation plans and improvement programs and in making project selection decisions under title 23, U.S.C., and under the Federal Transit Act. Plans and programs adopted after September 30, 1997, shall demonstrate compliance with this requirement.
§ 500.106
PMS.
An effective PMS for Federal-aid highways is a systematic process that provides information for use in implementing cost-effective pavement reconstruction, rehabilitation, and preventative maintenance programs and that results in pavements designed to accommodate current and forecasted traffic in a safe, durable, and cost-effective manner. The PMS should be based on the “AASHTO Guidelines for Pavement Management Systems.”

(g) Identification of skills, resources, and training needs to implement highway safety programs.
§ 500.109
CMS.
(a) For purposes of this part, congestion means the level at which transportation system performance is unacceptable due to excessive travel times and delays. Congestion management means the application of strategies to improve system performance and reliability by reducing the adverse impacts of congestion on the movement of people and goods in a region. A congestion management system or process is a systematic and regionally accepted approach for managing congestion that provides accurate, up-to-date information on transportation system operations and performance and assesses alternative strategies for congestion management that meet State and local needs.
(b) The development of a congestion management system or process should result in performance measures and strategies that can be integrated into transportation plans and programs. The level of system performance deemed acceptable by State and local officials may vary by type of transportation facility, geographic location (metropolitan area or subarea and/or non-metropolitan area), and/or time of day. In both metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas, consideration needs to be given to strategies that manage demand, reduce single occupant vehicle (SOV) travel, and improve transportation system management and operations. Where the addition of general purpose lanes is determined to be an appropriate congestion management strategy, explicit consideration is to be given to the incorporation of appropriate features into the SOV project to facilitate future demand management strategies and operational improvements that will maintain the functional integrity of those lanes.

§ 500.110
PTMS.
An effective PTMS for public transportation facilities (e.g., maintenance facilities, stations, terminals, transit related structures), equipment, and rolling stock is a systematic process that collects and analyzes information on the condition and cost of transit assets on a continual basis, identifies needs, and enables decision makers to select cost-effective strategies for providing and maintaining transit assets in serviceable condition. The PTMS should cover public transportation systems operated by the State, local jurisdictions, public transportation agencies and authorities, and private (for profit and non-profit) transit operators receiving funds under the Federal Transit Act and include, at a minimum:
(a) Development of transit asset condition measures and standards;
(b) An inventory of the transit assets including age, condition, remaining useful life, and replacement cost; and
(c) Identification, evaluation, and implementation of appropriate strategies and projects.
§ 500.111
IMS.
An effective IMS for intermodal facilities and systems provides efficient, safe, and convenient movement of people and goods through integration of transportation facilities and systems and improvement in the coordination in planning, and implementation of air, water, and the various land-based transportation facilities and systems. An IMS should include, at a minimum:
(a) Establishment of performance measures;
(b) Identification of key linkages between one or more modes of transportation, where the performance or use of one mode will affect another;
(c) Definition of strategies for improving the effectiveness of these modal interactions; and
(d) Evaluation and implementation of these strategies to enhance the overall performance of the transportation system.

# Subpart B—Traffic Monitoring System

(b)
Precision of reported data.
Traffic data supplied for the purposes identified in § 500.203(a) of this subpart shall be to the statistical precision applicable at the time of the data's collection as specified by the data users at various levels of government. A State's TMS shall meet the statistical precisions established by FHWA for the HPMS.
(c)
Continuous counter operations.
Within each State, there shall be sufficient continuous counters of traffic volumes, vehicle classification, and vehicle weight to provide estimates of changes in highway travel patterns and to provide for the development of day-of-week, seasonal, axle correction, growth factors, or other comparable factors approved by the FHWA that support the development of traffic estimates to meet the statistical precision requirements of the data uses identified in § 500.203(a) of this subpart. As appropriate, sufficient continuous
counts of vehicle classification and vehicle weight should be available to address traffic data program needs.
(d)
Short term traffic monitoring.
(1) Count data for traffic volumes collected in the field shall be adjusted to reflect annual average conditions. The estimation of annual average daily traffic will be through the appropriate application of only the following: Seasonal factors, day-of-week factors, and, when necessary, axle correction and growth factors or other comparable factors approved by the FHWA. Count data that have not been adjusted to represent annual average conditions will be noted as being unadjusted when they are reported. The duration and frequency of such monitoring shall comply to the data needs identified in § 500.203(a) of this subpart.
(2) Vehicle classification activities on the National Highway System (NHS), shall be sufficient to assure that, on a cycle of no greater than three years, every major system segment (
i.e.
, segments between interchanges or intersections of principal arterials of the NHS with other principal arterials of the NHS) will be monitored to provide information on the numbers of single-trailer combination trucks, multiple-trailer combination trucks, two-axle four-tire vehicles, buses and the total number of vehicles operating on an average day. If it is determined that two or more continuous major system segments have both similar traffic volumes and distributions of the vehicle types identified above, a single monitoring session will be sufficient to monitor these segments.
(e)
Vehicle occupancy monitoring.
As deemed appropriate to support the data uses identified in § 500.203(a) of this subpart, data will be collected on the average number of persons per automobile, light two-axle truck, and bus. The duration, geographic extent, and level of detail shall be consistent with the intended use of the data, as cooperatively agreed to by the organizations that will use the data and the organizations that will collect the data. Such vehicle occupancy data shall be reviewed at least every three years and updated as necessary. Acceptable data collection methods include roadside monitoring, traveler surveys, the use of administrative records (e.g., accident reports or reports developed in support of public transportation programs), or any other method mutually acceptable to the responsible organizations and the FHWA.
(f)
Field operations.
(1) Each State's TMS for highway traffic data shall include the testing of equipment used in the collection of the data. This testing shall be based on documented procedures developed by the State. This documentation will describe the test procedure as well as the frequency of testing. Standards of the American Society for Testing and Materials or guidance from the AASHTO may be used. Only equipment passing the test procedures will be used for the collection of data for the purposes identified in § 500.203(a) of this subpart.
(2) Documentation of field operations shall include the number of counts, the period of monitoring, the cycle of monitoring, and the spatial and temporal distribution of count sites. Copies of the State's documentation shall be provided to the FHWA Division Administrator when it is initially developed and after each revision.
(g)
Source data retention.
For estimates of traffic or travel, the value or values collected during a monitoring session, as well as information on the date(s) and hour(s) of monitoring, will remain available until the traffic or travel estimates based on the count session are updated. Data shall be available in formats that conform to those in the version of the TMG current at the time of data collection or as then amended by the FHWA.
(h)
Office factoring procedures.
(1) Factors to adjust data from short term monitoring sessions to estimates of average daily conditions shall be used to adjust for month, day of week, axle correction, and growth or other comparable factors approved by the FHWA. These factors will be reviewed annually and updated at least every three years.
(2) The procedures used by a State to edit and adjust highway traffic data collected from short term counts at field locations to estimates of average traffic volume shall be documented. The documentation shall include the factors discussed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The documentation shall remain available as long as the traffic
or travel estimates discussed in paragraph (g) of this section remain current. Copies of the State's documentation shall be provided to the FHWA Division Administrator when it is initially developed and after each revision.

As used in this part:
Asset
means all physical highway infrastructure located within the right-of-way corridor of a highway. The term
asset
includes all components necessary for the operation of a highway including pavements, highway bridges, tunnels, signs, ancillary structures, and other physical components of a highway.
Asset class
means assets with the same characteristics and function (e.g., bridges, culverts, tunnels, pavements, or guardrail) that are a subset of a group or collection of
assets that serve a common function (e.g., roadway system, safety, Intelligent Transportation (IT), signs, or lighting).
Asset condition
means the actual physical condition of an asset.
Asset management
means a strategic and systematic process of operating, maintaining, and improving physical assets, with a focus on both engineering and economic analysis based upon quality information, to identify a structured sequence of maintenance, preservation, repair, rehabilitation, and replacement actions that will achieve and sustain a desired state of good repair over the life cycle of the assets at minimum practicable cost.
Asset management plan
means a document that describes how a State DOT will carry out asset management as defined in this section. This includes how the State DOT will make risk-based decisions from a long-term assessment of the National Highway System (NHS), and other public roads included in the plan at the option of the State DOT, as it relates to managing its physical assets and laying out a set of investment strategies to address the condition and system performance gaps. This document describes how the highway network system will be managed to achieve State DOT targets for asset condition and system performance effectiveness while managing the risks, in a financially responsible manner, at a minimum practicable cost over the life cycle of its assets. The term
asset management plan
under this part is the risk-based asset management plan that is required under 23 U.S.C. 119(e) and is intended to carry out asset management as defined in 23 U.S.C. 101(a)(2).
Asset sub-group
means a specialized group of assets within an asset class with the same characteristics and function (e.g., concrete pavements or asphalt pavements.)
Bridge
as used in this part, is defined in 23 CFR 650.305, the National Bridge Inspection Standards.
Critical infrastructure
means those facilities the incapacity or failure of which would have a debilitating impact on national or regional economic security, national or regional energy security, national or regional public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.
Financial plan
means a long-term plan spanning 10 years or longer, presenting a State DOT's estimates of projected available financial resources and predicted expenditures in major asset categories that can be used to achieve State DOT targets for asset condition during the plan period, and highlighting how resources are expected to be allocated based on asset strategies, needs, shortfalls, and agency policies.
Investment strategy
means a set of strategies that result from evaluating various levels of funding to achieve State DOT targets for asset condition and system performance effectiveness at a minimum practicable cost while managing risks.
Life-cycle cost
means the cost of managing an asset class or asset sub-group for its whole life, from initial construction to its replacement.
Life-cycle planning
means a process to estimate the cost of managing an asset class, or asset sub-group over its whole life with consideration for minimizing cost while preserving or improving the condition.
Minimum practicable cost
means lowest feasible cost to achieve the objective.
NHS pavements and bridges and NHS pavement and bridge assets
mean Interstate System pavements (inclusion of ramps that are not part of the roadway normally traveled by through traffic is optional); NHS pavements (excluding the Interstate System) (inclusion of ramps that are not part of the roadway normally traveled by through traffic is optional); and NHS bridges carrying the NHS (including bridges that are part of the ramps connecting to the NHS).
Performance of the NHS
refers to the effectiveness of the NHS in providing for the safe and efficient movement of people and goods where that performance can be affected by physical assets. This term does not include the performance measures established for performance of the Interstate System and performance of the NHS (excluding the Interstate System) under 23 U.S.C. 150(c)(3)(ii)(A)(IV)-(V).
Performance gap
means the gaps between the current asset condition and State DOT targets for asset condition, and the gaps in system performance effectiveness that are best addressed by improving the physical assets.

§ 515.7
Process for establishing the asset management plan.
A State shall develop a risk-based asset management plan that describes how the NHS will be managed to achieve system performance effectiveness and State DOT targets for asset condition, while managing the risks, in a financially responsible manner, at a minimum practicable cost over the life
cycle of its assets. The State DOT shall develop and use, at a minimum the following processes to prepare its asset management plan:
(a) A State DOT shall establish a process for conducting performance gap analysis to identify deficiencies hindering progress toward improving or preserving the NHS and achieving and sustaining the desired state of good repair. At a minimum, the State DOT's process shall address the following in the gap analysis:
(1) The State DOT targets for asset condition of NHS pavements and bridges as established by the State DOT under 23 U.S.C. 150(d) once promulgated.
(2) The gaps, if any, in the performance-of the NHS that affect NHS pavements and bridges regardless of their physical condition; and
(3) Alternative strategies to close or address the identified gaps.
(b) A State DOT shall establish a process for conducting life-cycle planning for an asset class or asset sub-group at the network level (network to be defined by the State DOT). As a State DOT develops its life-cycle planning process, the State DOT should include future changes in demand; information on current and future environmental conditions including extreme weather events, climate change, and seismic activity; and other factors that could impact whole of life costs of assets. The State DOT may propose excluding one or more asset sub-groups from its life-cycle planning if the State DOT can demonstrate to FHWA the exclusion of the asset sub-group would have no material adverse effect on the development of sound investment strategies due to the limited number of assets in the asset sub-group, the low level of cost associated with managing the assets in that asset sub-group, or other justifiable reasons. A life-cycle planning process shall, at a minimum, include the following:
(1) The State DOT targets for asset condition for each asset class or asset sub-group;
(2) Identification of deterioration models for each asset class or asset sub-group, provided that identification of deterioration models for assets other than NHS pavements and bridges is optional;
(3) Potential work types across the whole life of each asset class or asset sub-group with their relative unit cost; and
(4) A strategy for managing each asset class or asset sub-group by minimizing its life-cycle costs, while achieving the State DOT targets for asset condition for NHS pavements and bridges under 23 U.S.C. 150(d).
(c) A State DOT shall establish a process for developing a risk management plan. This process shall, at a minimum, produce the following information:
(1) Identification of risks that can affect condition of NHS pavements and bridges and the performance of the NHS, including risks associated with current and future environmental conditions, such as extreme weather events, climate change, seismic activity, and risks related to recurring damage and costs as identified through the evaluation of facilities repeated damaged by emergency events carried out under part 667 of this title. Examples of other risk categories include financial risks such as budget uncertainty; operational risks such as asset failure; and strategic risks such as environmental compliance.
(2) An assessment of the identified risks in terms of the likelihood of their occurrence and their impact and consequence if they do occur;
(3) An evaluation and prioritization of the identified risks;
(4) A mitigation plan for addressing the top priority risks;
(5) An approach for monitoring the top priority risks; and
(6) A summary of the evaluations of facilities repeatedly damaged by emergency events carried out under part 667 of this title that discusses, at a minimum, the results relating to the State's NHS pavements and bridges.
(d) A State DOT shall establish a process for the development of a financial plan that identifies annual costs over a minimum period of 10 years. The financial plan process shall, at a minimum, produce:
(1) The estimated cost of expected future work to implement investment
strategies contained in the asset management plan, by State fiscal year and work type;
(2) The estimated funding levels that are expected to be reasonably available, by fiscal year, to address the costs of future work types. State DOTs may estimate the amount of available future funding using historical values where the future funding amount is uncertain;
(3) Identification of anticipated funding sources; and
(4) An estimate of the value of the agency's NHS pavement and bridge assets and the needed investment on an annual basis to maintain the value of these assets.

(1) Performance gap analysis required under paragraph (a) of this section;
(2) Life-cycle planning for asset classes or asset sub-groups resulting from the process required under paragraph (b) of this section;
(3) Risk management analysis resulting from the process required under paragraph (c) of this section; and
(4) Anticipated available funding and estimated cost of expected future work types associated with various candidate strategies based on the financial plan required by paragraph (d) of this section.
(f) The processes established by State DOTs shall include a provision for the State DOT to obtain necessary data from other NHS owners in a collaborative and coordinated effort.
(g) States DOTs shall use the best available data to develop their asset management plans. Pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 150(c)(3)(A)(i), each State DOT shall use bridge and pavement management systems meeting the requirements of § 515.17 to analyze the condition of NHS pavements and bridges for the purpose of developing and implementing the asset management plan required under this part. The use of these or other management systems for other assets that the State DOT elects to include in the asset management plan is optional (e.g., Sign Management Systems, etc.).
§ 515.9
Asset management plan requirements.
(a) A State DOT shall develop and implement an asset management plan to improve or preserve the condition of the assets and improve the performance of the NHS in accordance with the requirements of this part. Asset management plans must describe how the State DOT will carry out asset management as defined in § 515.5.
(b) An asset management plan shall include, at a minimum, a summary listing of NHS pavement and bridge assets, regardless of ownership.
(c) In addition to the assets specified in paragraph (b) of this section, State DOTs are encouraged, but not required, to include all other NHS infrastructure assets within the right-of-way corridor and assets on other public roads. Examples of other NHS infrastructure assets include tunnels, ancillary structures, and signs. Examples of other public roads include non-NHS Federal-aid highways. If a State DOT decides to include other NHS assets in its asset management plan, or to include assets on other public roads, the State DOT, at a minimum, shall evaluate and manage those assets consistent with paragraph (l) of this section.
(d) The minimum content for an asset management plan under this part includes a discussion of each element in this paragraph (d).
(1) Asset management objectives. The objectives should align with the State DOT's mission. The objectives must be consistent with the purpose of asset management, which is to achieve and sustain the desired state of good repair over the life cycle of the assets at a minimum practicable cost.
(2) Asset management measures and State DOT targets for asset condition, including those established pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 150, for NHS pavements and bridges. The plan must include measures and associated targets the State DOT can use in assessing the condition of the assets and performance of the highway system as it relates to those assets. The measures and targets must be consistent with the State DOT's asset management objectives. The
State DOT must include the measures established under 23 U.S.C. 150(c)(3)(A)(ii)(I)-(III), once promulgated in 23 CFR part 490, for the condition of NHS pavements and bridges. The State DOT also must include the targets the State DOT has established for the measures required by 23 U.S.C. 150(c)(3)(A)(ii)(I)-(III), once promulgated, and report on such targets in accordance with 23 CFR part 490. The State DOT may include measures and targets for NHS pavements and bridges that the State DOT established through pre-existing management efforts or develops through new efforts if the State DOT wishes to use such additional measures and targets to supplement information derived from the pavement and bridge measures and targets required under 23 U.S.C. 150.
(3) A summary description of the condition of NHS pavements and bridges, regardless of ownership. The summary must include a description of the condition of those assets based on the performance measures established under 23 U.S.C. 150(c)(3)(A)(ii) for condition, once promulgated. The description of condition should be informed by evaluations required under part 667 of this title of facilities repeated damaged by emergency events.
(4) Performance gap identification.
(5) Life-cycle planning.
(6) Risk management analysis, including the results for NHS pavements and bridges, of the periodic evaluations under part 667 of this title of facilities repeated damaged by emergency event.
(7) Financial plan.
(8) Investment strategies.
(e) An asset management plan shall cover, at a minimum, a 10-year period.
(f) An asset management plan shall discuss how the plan's investment strategies collectively would make or support progress toward:
(1) Achieving and sustaining a desired state of good repair over the life cycle of the assets,
(2) Improving or preserving the condition of the assets and the performance of the NHS relating to physical assets,
(3) Achieving the State DOT targets for asset condition and performance of the NHS in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 150(d), and
(4) Achieving the national goals identified in 23 U.S.C. 150(b).
(g) A State DOT must include in its plan a description of how the analyses required by State processes developed in accordance with § 515.7 (such as analyses pertaining to life cycle planning, risk management, and performance gaps) support the State DOT's asset management plan investment strategies.
(h) A State DOT shall integrate its asset management plan into its transportation planning processes that lead to the STIP, to support its efforts to achieve the goals in paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section.
(i) A State DOT is required to make its asset management plan available to the public, and is encouraged to do so in a format that is easily accessible.
(j) Inclusion of performance measures and State DOT targets for NHS pavements and bridges established pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 150 in the asset management plan does not relieve the State DOT of any performance management requirements, including 23 U.S.C. 150(e) reporting, established in other parts of this title.
(k) The head of the State DOT shall approve the asset management plan.
(l) If the State DOT elects to include other NHS infrastructure assets or other public roads assets in its asset management plan, the State at a minimum shall address the following, using a level of effort consistent with the State DOT's needs and resources:
(1) Summary listing of assets, including a description of asset condition;
(2) Asset management measures and State DOT targets for asset condition;
(3) Performance gap analysis;
(4) Life-cycle planning;
(5) Risk analysis, including summaries of evaluations carried out under part 667 of this title for the assets, if available, and consideration of those evaluations;
(6) Financial plan; and
(7) Investment strategies.
(m) The asset management plan of a State may include consideration of critical infrastructure from among those facilities in the State that are eligible under 23 U.S.C. 119(c).
§ 515.11
Deadlines and phase-in of asset management plan development.
(a)
Deadlines.
(1) Not later than April 30, 2018, the State DOT shall submit to FHWA a State-approved initial asset management plan meeting the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section. The FHWA will review the processes described in the initial plan and make a process certification decision as provided in § 515.13(a).
(2) Not later than June 30, 2019, the State DOT shall submit a State-approved asset management plan meeting all the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 119 and this part, including paragraph (c) of this section, together with documentation demonstrating implementation of the asset management plan. The FWHA will determine whether the State DOT's plan and implementation meet the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 119 and this part as provided in § 515.13(b).
(b) The initial plan shall describe the State DOT's processes for developing its risk-based asset management plan, including the policies, procedures, documentation, and implementation approach that satisfy the requirements of this part. The plan also must contain measures and targets for assets covered by the plan. The investment strategies required by § 515.7(e) and 515.9((d)(8) must support progress toward the achievement of the national goals identified in 23 U.S.C. 150(b). The initial plan must include and address the State DOT's 23 U.S.C. 150(d) targets for NHS pavements and bridges only if the first target-setting deadline established in 23 CFR part 490 for NHS pavements and bridges is a date more than 6 months before the initial plan submission deadline in paragraph (a)(1). The initial asset management plan may exclude one or more of the necessary analyses with respect to the following required asset management processes:
(1) Life-cycle planning required under § 515.7(a)(2);
(2) The risk management analysis required under § 515.7(a)(3); and
(3) Financial plan under § 515.7(a)(4).
(c) The State-approved asset management plan submitted not later than June 30, 2019, shall include all required analyses, performed using FHWA-certified processes, and the section 150 measures and State DOT targets for the NHS pavements and bridges. The plan must meet all requirements in §§ 515.7 and 515.9. This includes investment strategies that are developed based on the analyses from all processes required under § 515.7, and meet the requirements in 23 U.S.C. 119(e)(2).
§ 515.13
Process certification and recertification, and annual plan consistency review.
(a)
Process certification and recertification under 23 U.S.C. 119(e)(6).
Not later than 90 days after the date on which the FHWA receives a State DOT's processes and request for certification or recertification, the FHWA shall decide whether the State DOT's processes for developing its asset management plan meet the requirements of this part. The FHWA will treat the State DOT's submission of an initial State-approved asset management plan under § 515.11(b) as the State DOT's request for the first certification of the State's DOT's plan development processes under 23 U.S.C. 119(e)(6). As provided in paragraph (c) of this section, State DOT shall update and resubmit its asset management plan development processes to the FHWA for a new process certification at least every 4 years.
(1) If FHWA determines that the processes used by a State DOT to develop and maintain the asset management plan do not meet the requirements established under this part, FHWA will send the State DOT a written notice of the denial of certification or recertification, including a listing of the specific requirement deficiencies.
(2) Upon receiving a notice of denial of certification or recertification, the State DOT shall have 90 days from receipt of the notice to address the deficiencies identified in the notice and resubmit the State DOT's processes to FHWA for review and certification. The FHWA may extend the State DOT's 90-day period to cure deficiencies upon request. During the cure period established, all penalties and other legal impacts of a denial of certification shall be stayed as provided in 23 U.S.C. 119(e)(6)(C)(i).
(3) If FHWA finds that a State DOT's asset management processes substantially meet the requirements of this part except for minor deficiencies, FHWA may certify or recertify the State DOT's processes as being in compliance, but the State DOT must take actions to correct the minor deficiencies within 90 days of receipt of the notification of certification. The State shall notify FHWA, in writing, when corrective actions are completed.
(b)
Annual determination of consistency under 23 U.S.C. 119(e)(5).
Not later than August 31, 2019, and not later than July 31 in each year thereafter, FHWA will notify the State DOT whether the State DOT has developed and implemented an asset management plan consistent with 23 U.S.C. 119. The notice will be in writing and, in the case of a negative determination, will specify the deficiencies the State DOT needs to address. In making the annual consistency determination, the FHWA will consider the most recent asset management plan submitted by the State DOT, as well as any documentation submitted by the State DOT to demonstrate implementation of the plan. The FHWA determination is only as to the consistency of the State DOT asset management plan and State DOT implementation of that plan with applicable requirements, and is not an approval or disapproval of strategies or other decisions contained in the plan. With respect to any assets the State DOT may elect to include in its plan in addition to NHS pavement and bridge assets, the FHWA consistency determination will consider only whether the State DOT has complied with § 515.9(l) with respect to such discretionary assets.
(1)
Plan development.
The FHWA will review the State DOT's asset management plan to ensure that it was developed with certified processes, includes the required content, and is consistent with other applicable requirements in this part.
(2)
Plan implementation.
The State DOT must demonstrate implementation of an asset management plan that meets the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 119 and this part. Each State DOT may determine the most suitable approach for demonstrating implementation of its asset management plan, so long as the information is current, documented, and verifiable. The submission must show the State DOT is using the investment strategies in its plan to make progress toward achievement of its targets for asset condition and performance of the NHS and to support progress toward the national goals identified in 23 U.S.C. 150(b). The State DOT must submit its implementation documentation not less than 30 days prior to the deadline for the FHWA consistency determination.
(i) FHWA considers the best evidence of plan implementation to be that, for the 12 months preceding the consistency determination, the State DOT funding allocations are reasonably consistent with the investment strategies in the State DOT's asset management plan. This demonstration takes into account the alignment between the actual and planned levels of investment for various work types (
i.e.,
initial construction, maintenance, preservation, rehabilitation and reconstruction).
(ii) FHWA may find a State DOT has implemented its asset management plan even if the State has deviated from the investment strategies included in the asset management plan, if the State DOT shows the deviation was necessary due to extenuating circumstances beyond the State DOT's reasonable control.
(3)
Opportunity to cure deficiencies.
In the event FHWA notifies a State DOT of a negative consistency determination, the State DOT has 30 days to address the deficiencies. The State DOT may submit additional information showing the FHWA negative determination was in error, or to demonstrate the State DOT has taken corrective action that resolves the deficiencies specified in FHWA's negative determination.
(c)
Updates and other amendments to plans and development processes.
A State DOT must update its asset management plan and asset management plan development processes at least every 4 years, beginning on the date of the initial FHWA certification of the State DOT's processes under paragraph (a) of this section. Whenever the State DOT updates or otherwise amends its asset
management plan or its asset management plan development processes, the State DOT must submit the amended plan or processes to the FHWA for a new process certification and consistency determination at least 30 days prior to the deadline for the next FHWA consistency determination under paragraph (b) of this section. Minor technical corrections and revisions with no foreseeable material impact on the accuracy and validity of the processes, analyses, or investment strategies in the plan do not constitute amendments and do not require submission to FHWA.
§ 515.15
Penalties
(a) Beginning on October 1, 2019, and in each fiscal year thereafter, if a State DOT has not developed and implemented an asset management plan consistent with the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 119 and this part, the maximum Federal share for National Highway Performance Program projects and activities carried out by the State in that fiscal year shall be reduced to 65 percent for that fiscal year.
(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if the State DOT has not developed and implemented an asset management plan that is consistent with the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 119 and this part and established the performance targets for NHS pavements and bridges required under 23 U.S.C. 150(d) by the date that is 18 months after the effective date of the 23 U.S.C. 150(c) final rule for NHS pavements and bridges, the FHWA will not approve any further projects using National Highway Performance Program funds. Such suspension of funding approvals will terminate once the State DOT has developed and implemented an asset management plan that is consistent with the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 119 and this part and established its performance targets for NHS pavements and bridges required under 23 U.S.C. 150(d).
(2) The FHWA may extend this deadline if FHWA determines that the State DOT has made a good faith effort to develop and implement an asset management plan and establish the performance targets for NHS pavements and bridges required under 23 U.S.C. 150(d).
§ 515.17
Minimum standards for developing and operating bridge and pavement management systems
Pursuant to 23 U.S.C.150(c)(3)(A)(i), this section establishes the minimum standards States must use for developing and operating bridge and pavement management systems. State DOT bridge and pavement management systems are not subject to FHWA certification under § 515.13. Bridge and pavement management systems shall include, at a minimum, documented procedures for:
(a) Collecting, processing, storing, and updating inventory and condition data for all NHS pavement and bridge assets.
(b) Forecasting deterioration for all NHS pavement and bridge assets;
(c) Determining the benefit-cost over the life cycle of assets to evaluate alternative actions (including no action decisions), for managing the condition of NHS pavement and bridge assets;
(d) Identifying short- and long-term budget needs for managing the condition of all NHS pavement and bridge assets;
(e) Determining the strategies for identifying potential NHS pavement and bridge projects that maximize overall program benefits within the financial constraints.; and
(f) Recommending programs and implementation schedules to manage the condition of NHS pavement and bridge assets within policy and budget constraints.
§ 515.19
Organizational integration of asset management.
(a) The purpose of this section is to describe how a State DOT may integrate asset management into its organizational mission, culture and capabilities at all levels. The activities described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section are not requirements.
(b) A State DOT should establish organizational strategic goals and include the goals in its organizational strategic implementation plans with an explanation as to how asset management will help it to achieve those goals.
(c) A State DOT should conduct a periodic self-assessment of the agency's capabilities to conduct asset management, as well as its current efforts in implementing an asset management plan. The self-assessment should consider, at a minimum, the adequacy of the State DOT's strategic goals and policies with respect to asset management, whether asset management is considered in the agency's planning and programming of resources, including development of the STIP; whether the agency is implementing appropriate program delivery processes, such as consideration of alternative project delivery mechanisms, effective program management, and cost tracking and estimating; and whether the agency is implementing adequate data collection and analysis policies to support an effective asset management program.
(d) Based on the results of the self-assessment, the State DOT should conduct a gap analysis to determine which areas of its asset management process require improvement. In conducting a gap analysis, the State DOT should:
(1) Determine the level of organizational performance effort needed to achieve the objectives of asset management;
(2) Determine the performance gaps between the existing level of performance effort and the needed level of performance effort; and
(3) Develop strategies to close the identified organizational performance gaps and define the period of time over which the gap is to be closed.

§ 620.101
Purpose.
The purpose of this section is to implement title 23 U.S.C., section 318 which requires coordination of airport and highway developments to insure (a) that airway-highway clearances are adequate for the safe movement of air and highway traffic, and (b) that the expenditure of public funds for airport and highway improvements is in the public interest.
§ 620.102
Applicability.
The requirements of this section apply to all projects on which Federal-aid highway funds are to be expended and to both civil and military airports.
§ 620.103
Policy.
(a) Federal-aid highway funds shall not participate in the costs of reconstruction or relocation of any highway to which this section applies unless the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and State officials, in cooperation with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or appropriate military authority, or in the case of privately owned airports, the owner of that airport, determine that the location or extension of the airport in question and the consequent relocation or reconstruction of the highway is in the public interest.
(b) In addition to complying with 23 U.S.C. 318 and insuring the prudent use of public funds, it is the policy of FHWA to provide a high degree of safety in the location, design, construction and operation of highways and airports.
(c) Federal-aid funds shall not participate in projects where substandard clearances are created or will continue to exist.
§ 620.104
Standards.
A finding of public interest by FHWA will be based on compliance with airway-highway clearances which conform to FAA standards for aeronautical safety.

# Subpart B—Relinquishment of Highway Facilities

# Source:
39 FR 33311, Sept. 17, 1974, unless otherwise noted.
§ 620.201
Purpose.
To prescribe Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) procedures relating to relinquishment of highway facilities.
§ 620.202
Applicability.
The provisions of this subpart apply to highway facilities where Federal-aid funds have participated in either right-of-way or physical construction costs of a project. The provisions of this subpart apply only to relinquishment of facilities for continued highway purposes. Other real property disposals and modifications or disposal of access rights are governed by the requirements of 23 CFR part 710.
[64 FR 71289, Dec. 21, 1999]
§ 620.203
Procedures.
(a) After final acceptance of a project on the Federal-aid primary, urban, or
secondary system or after the date that the plans, specifications and estimates (PS
E) for the physical construction on the right-of-way for a Federal-aid Interstate project have been approved by the FHWA, relinquishment of the right-of-way or any change made in control of access shall be in accordance with the provisions of this section. For the purposes of this section, final acceptance for a project involving physical construction is the date of the acceptance of the physical construction by the FHWA and for right-of-way projects, the date the division engineer determines to be the date of the completion of the acquisition of the right-of-way shown on the final plans.
(b) Other than a conveyance made as part of a concession agreement as defined in section 710.703, for purposes of this section,
relinquishment
is defined as the conveyance of a portion of a highway right-of-way or facility by a State highway agency (SHA) to another Government agency for highway use.
(c) The following facilities may be relinquished in accordance with paragraph 203(f):
(1) Sections of a State highway which have been superseded by construction on new location and removed from the Federal-aid system and the replaced section thereof is approved by the FHWA as the new location of the Federal-aid route. Federal-aid funds may not participate in rehabilitation work performed for the purpose of placing the superseded section of the highway in a condition acceptable to the local authority. The relinquishment of any Interstate mileage shall be submitted to the Federal Highway Administrator as a special case for prior approval.
(2) Sections of reconstructed local facilities that are located outside the control of access lines, such as turn-arounds of severed local roads or streets adjacent to the Federal-aid project's right-of-way, and local roads and streets crossing over or under said project that have been adjusted in grade and/or alignment, including new right-of-way required for adjustments. Eligibility for Federal-aid participation in the costs of the foregoing adjustments is as determined at the time of PS
E approval under policies of the FHWA.
(3) Frontage roads or portions thereof that are constructed generally parallel to and outside the control of access lines of a Federal-aid project for the purpose of permitting access to private properties rather than to serve as extensions of ramps to connect said Federal-aid project with the nearest crossroad or street.
(d) The following facilities may be relinquished only with the approval of the Federal Highway Administrator in accordance with paragraph 203(g).
(1) Frontage roads or portions thereof located outside the access control lines of a Federal-aid project that are constructed to service (in lieu of or in addition to the purposes outlined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section) as connections between ramps to or from the Federal-aid project and existing public roads or streets.
(2) Ramps constructed to serve as connections for interchange of traffic between the Federal-aid project and local roads or streets.
(e) Where a frontage road is not on an approved Federal-aid system title to the right-of-way may be acquired initially in the name of the political subdivision which is to assume control thus eliminating the necessity of a formal transfer later. Such procedure would be subject to prior FHWA approval and would be limited to those facilities which meet the criteria set forth in paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section.
(f) Upon presentation by a State that it intends to relinquish facilities such as described in paragraph (c) (1), (2) or (3) of this section to local authorities, the division engineer of the FHWA shall have appropriate field and office examination made thereof to assure that such relinquishments are in accordance with the provisions of the cited paragraphs. Relinquishments of the types described in paragraph (c) (1), (2) or (3) of this section may be made on an individual basis or on a project or route basis subject to the following conditions and understandings:
(1) Immediately following action by the State in approving a relinquishment, it shall furnish to the Division Administrator for record purposes a
copy of a suitable map or maps identified by the Federal-aid project number, with the facilities to be relinquished and the date of such relinquishment action clearly delineated thereon.
(2) If it is found at any time after relinquishment that a relinquished facility is in fact required for the safe and proper operation of the Federal-aid highway, the State shall take immediate action to restore such facility to its jurisdiction without cost to Federal-aid highway funds.
(3) If it is found at any time that a relinquished frontage road or portion thereof or any part of the right-of-way therefor has been abandoned by local governmental authority and a showing cannot be made that such abandoned facility is no longer required as a public road, it is to be understood that the Federal Highway Administrator may cause to be withheld from Federal-aid highway funds due to the State an amount equal to the Federal-aid participation in the abandoned facility.
(4) In no case shall any relinquishment include any portion of the right-of-way within the access control lines as shown on the plans for a Federal-aid project approved by the FHWA, without the prior approval of the Federal Highway Administrator.
(5) There cannot be additional Federal-aid participation in future construction or reconstruction on any relinquished “off the Federal-aid system” facility unless the underlying reason for such future work is caused by future improvement of the associated Federal-aid highway.
(g) In the event that a State desires to apply for approval by the Federal Highway Administrator for the relinquishment of a facility such as described in paragraph (d) (1) and (2) of this section, the facts pertinent to such proposal are to be presented to the division engineer of the FHWA. The division engineer shall have appropriate review made of such presentation and forward the material presented by the State together with his findings thereon through the Regional Federal Highway Administrator for consideration by the Federal Highway Administrator and determination of action to be taken.
(h) No change may be made in control of access, without the joint determination and approval of the SHA and FHWA. This would not prevent the relinquishment of title, without prior approval of the FHWA, of a segment of the right-of-way provided there is an abandonment of a section of highway inclusive of such segment.
(i) Relinquishments must be justified by the State's finding concurred in by the FHWA, that:
(1) The subject land will not be needed for Federal-aid highway purposes in the foreseeable future;
(2) That the right-of-way being retained is adequate under present day standards for the facility involved;
(3) That the release will not adversely affect the Federal-aid highway facility or the traffic thereon;
(4) That the lands to be relinquished are not suitable for retention in order to restore, preserve, or improve the scenic beauty adjacent to the highway consonant with the intent of 23 U.S.C. 319 and Pub. L. 89-285, Title III, sections 302-305 (Highway Beautification Act of 1965).
(j) If a relinquishment is to a Federal, State, or local government agency for highway purposes, there need not be a charge to the said agency, nor in such event any credit to Federal funds. If for any reason there is a charge, the STD may retain the Federal share of the proceeds if used for projects eligible under title 23 of the United States Code.

§ 624.1
Purpose.
To prescribe requirements and procedures for State requests for, and FHWA consideration of, changes in access to the Interstate System.
§ 624.3
Applicability.
(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section, this part is applicable to all segments designated as part of the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways (Interstate System) for which Federal-aid highway funds or other funds administered under title 23, United States Code, have been used in the past or are used to develop a project.
(b) This part is not applicable to ramps providing access to safety rest areas, information centers, weigh stations, and truck inspection stations located within the Interstate right-of-way when such areas are accessible to vehicles only to and from the Interstate System. Connections from other public facilities to facilities within the Interstate System right-of way, if an exception is granted in accordance with § 624.7(f), are subject to the requirements of this part.
(c) This part is not applicable to connections between managed lanes and general-purpose lanes on the same Interstate highway.
(d) This part is not applicable to State maintenance facilities that are located within the Interstate System right-of-way and not open to the public.
(e) This part is not applicable to access points to non-freeway Interstate System segments located in Alaska or Puerto Rico with average daily traffic volumes less than 400 vehicles per day. In such cases, the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 111 apply and the FHWA Division Administrator shall determine the level of analysis required to secure FHWA approval of the access modification.
§ 624.5
Definitions.
The following terms used in this part are defined as follows:
Access point.
Any permanent connection (including those metered or closed at times) to the through lanes or shoulders, managed lanes, collector-distributor roads, or ramps on the Interstate System, including “locked gate access”.
Area of influence.
The geographic extent to which a proposed change in access will affect traffic operations and safety.
Change in access.
The addition of a new, or modification of an existing, interchange or access point along the Interstate System.
Final approval.
Acceptance for the proposed change in access granted by FHWA upon completion of the appropriate transportation planning, air quality conformity, and environmental review requirements under National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and receiving concurrence on the Safety, Operations, and Engineering (SO
E) determination.
Interchange.
A system of interconnecting roadways in conjunction with one or more grade separations that provides for the movement of traffic between two or more roadways or highways on different levels.

§ 624.7
Interstate System access requirements.
(a) The proposed change in access to the Interstate System shall not result in a significant adverse impact on the Interstate System traffic operations or the safety for all users of the transportation system in the project's area of influence, as demonstrated by operational and safety analyses based on both the current and future traffic projections using traffic data that is no more than 5 years old and at least the most recent 3 years of available safety data.
(b) Interstate System access points shall connect only to a public road. Connections directly to private developments, parking lots, or private roads are prohibited.
(c) Connections from outside of the Interstate System right-of-way to safety rest areas, information centers, weigh stations, and truck inspection stations located within the Interstate System right-of-way are prohibited.
(d) Each interchange shall provide for all traffic movements.
(e) A proposed change in access shall be designed to meet the standards in accordance with 23 CFR part 625 or have approved exceptions and shall comply with 23 CFR part 655.
(f) On a case by case basis, FHWA may grant exceptions to the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section for:
(1) Locked gate access to private property for purposes of public safety;
(2) Locked gate access from an information center, weigh station, and truck inspection station to a local road for the purposes of public safety;
(3) Access from a safety rest area to an adjacent publicly owned conservation and recreation area if access to this area is available only through the safety rest area as allowed under 23 CFR 752.5(d);
(4) Locked gate access from a local public road to the safety rest area for the limited purpose of providing access to safety rest area employees, deliveries, and emergency vehicles; or
(5) A partial interchange where necessary to provide special access, such as to managed lanes or park and ride lots, or where factors such as the social, economic, and environmental impacts of a full interchange justify an exception.
§ 624.9
Approval process.
(a) To propose a change in access to the Interstate System, the State DOT shall submit electronically to FHWA a request letter and an IAJR complying with § 624.11 demonstrating that the proposed change in access meets the requirements of this part. Change in access requests will not be accepted from other parties besides a State DOT.

(a) The purpose of this part is to prescribe the programs, policies and procedures for the integration of value engineering (VE) into the planning and development of all applicable Federal-aid highway projects.
(b) Each State transportation agency (STA) shall establish and sustain a VE program. This program shall establish the policies and procedures under which VE analyses are identified, conducted and approved VE recommendations implemented on applicable projects (as defined in § 627.5 of this part). These policies and procedures should also identify when a VE analysis is encouraged on all other projects where there is a high potential to realize the benefits of a VE analysis.
(c) The STAs shall establish the policies, procedures, functions, and capacity to monitor, assess, and report on the performance of the VE program, along with the VE analyses that are conducted and Value Engineering Change Proposals (VECP) that are accepted. The STAs shall ensure that its sub-recipients conduct VE analyses in compliance with this part.
§ 627.3
Definitions.
The following terms used in this part are defined as follows:
(a)
Bridge project.
A bridge project shall include any project where the primary purpose is to construct, reconstruct, rehabilitate, resurface, or restore a bridge.
(b)
Final design.
Any design activities following preliminary design and expressly includes the preparation of final construction plans and detailed specifications for the performance of construction work.
(c)
Project.
The term “project” means any undertaking eligible for assistance under title 23 of the United States Code. The limits of a project are defined as the logical termini in the environmental document and may consist of several contracts, or phases of a project or contract, which may be implemented over several years.
(d)
Total project costs.
The estimated costs of all work to be conducted on a project including the environment, design, right-of-way, utilities and construction phases.
(e)
Value Engineering (VE) analysis.
The systematic process of reviewing and assessing a project by a multidisciplinary team not directly involved in the planning and development phases of a specific project that follows the VE Job Plan and is conducted to provide recommendations for:
(1) Providing the needed functions, considering community and environmental commitments, safety, reliability, efficiency, and overall life-cycle cost (as defined in 23 U.S.C. 106(f)(2));
(2) Optimizing the value and quality of the project; and
(3) Reducing the time to develop and deliver the project.
(f)
Value Engineering (VE) Job Plan.
A systematic and structured action plan for conducting and documenting the results of the VE analysis. While each VE analysis shall address each phase in the VE Job Plan, the level of analysis conducted and effort expended for each phase may be scaled to meet the needs of each individual project. The VE Job Plan shall include and document the following seven phases:
(1) Information Phase: Gather project information including project commitments and constraints.
(2) Function Analysis Phase: Analyze the project to understand the required functions.
(3) Creative Phase: Generate ideas on ways to accomplish the required functions which improve the project's performance, enhance its quality, and lower project costs.
(4) Evaluation Phase: Evaluate and select feasible ideas for development.
(5) Development Phase: Develop the selected alternatives into fully supported recommendations.
(6) Presentation Phase: Present the VE recommendation to the project stakeholders.
(7) Resolution Phase: Evaluate, resolve, document and implement all approved recommendations.
(g)
Value Engineering Change Proposal (VECP).
A construction contract change proposal submitted by the construction contractor based on a VECP provision in the contract. These proposals may improve the project's performance, value and/or quality, lower construction costs, or shorten the delivery time, while considering their impacts on the project's overall life-cycle cost and other applicable factors.
§ 627.5
Applicable projects.
(a) A VE analysis shall be conducted prior to the completion of final design on each applicable project that utilizes Federal-aid highway funding, and all approved recommendations shall be included in the project's plans, specifications and estimates prior to authorizing the project for construction (as specified in 23 CFR 630.205).
(b) Applicable projects requiring a VE analysis shall include the following:
(1) Each project located on the National Highway System (NHS) (as specified in 23 U.S.C. 103) with an estimated total project cost of $50 million or more that utilizes Federal-aid highway funding;
(2) Each bridge project located on the NHS with an estimated total project cost of $40 million or more that utilizes Federal-aid highway funding;
(3) Any major project (as defined in 23 U.S.C. 106(h)), located on or off of the NHS, that utilizes Federal-aid highway funding in any contract or phase comprising the major project;
(4) Any project where a VE analysis has not been conducted and a change is made to the project's scope or design between the final design and the construction letting which results in an increase in the project's total cost exceeding the thresholds identified in paragraphs (b)(1), (2) or (3) of this section; and
(5) Any other project FHWA determines to be appropriate that utilizes Federal-aid highway program funding.
(c) An additional VE analysis is not required if, after conducting a VE analysis required under this part, the project is subsequently split into smaller projects in the design phase or the project is programmed to be completed by the letting of multiple construction projects. However, the STA may not avoid the requirement to conduct a VE analysis on an applicable project by splitting the project into smaller projects, or programming multiple design or construction projects.
(d) The STA's VE Program's policies and procedures should identify when VE analyses are to be considered or conducted for projects falling below the required thresholds identified in paragraph (b) of this section in the planning and development of transportation projects where there is a high potential for the project to benefit from a VE analysis. While not required, FHWA encourages STAs to consider the following projects that may benefit from a VE analysis:
(1) Complex projects on or off the NHS that have a total project cost of $25 million or more;
(2) Complex Bridge Projects on or off the NHS with an estimated total project cost of $20 million or more;
(3) Design-build projects on or off the NHS with an estimated cost of $25 million or more; and
(4) Any other complex, difficult or high cost project as determined by the STA.
(e) A VE analysis is not required for projects delivered using the design-build method of construction. While not required, FHWA encourages STAs and local public authorities to conduct a VE analysis on design-build projects that meet the requirements identified in paragraph (b) of this section.
(f) A VE analysis is required on projects delivered using the Construction Manager/General Contractor (CM/GC) method of contracting, if the project meets the requirements identified in paragraph (b) of this section.
§ 627.7
VE programs.
(a) The STA shall establish and sustain a VE program under which VE analyses are identified, conducted and approved VE recommendations implemented on all applicable projects (as defined in § 627.5). The STA's VE program shall:
(1) Establish and document VE program policies and procedures that ensure the required VE analysis is conducted on all applicable projects, and encourage conducting VE analyses on other projects that have the potential to benefit from this analysis;
(2) Ensure the VE analysis is conducted and all approved recommendations are implemented and documented in a final VE report prior to the project being authorized to proceed to a construction letting;
(3) Monitor and assess the VE Program, and disseminate an annual report to the FHWA consisting of a summary of all approved recommendations implemented on applicable projects requiring a VE analysis, the accepted VECPs, and VE program functions and activities;
(4) Establish and document policies, procedures, and contract provisions that identify when VECP's may be used; identify the analysis, documentation, basis, and process for evaluating and accepting a VECP; and determine how the net savings of each VECP may be shared between the agency and contractor;
(5) Establish and document policies, procedures, and controls to ensure a VE analysis is conducted and all approved recommendations are implemented for all applicable projects administered by local public agencies; and ensure the results of these analyses are included in the VE program monitoring and reporting; and
(6) Provide for the review of any project where a delay occurs between when the final plans are completed and the project advances to a letting for construction to determine if a change has occurred to the project's scope or design where a VE analysis would be required to be conducted (as specified in § 625.5(b)).
(b) STAs shall ensure the required VE analysis has been performed on each applicable project including those administered by subrecipients, and shall ensure approved recommendations are implemented into the
project's plans, specifications, and estimates prior to the project being authorized for construction (as specified in 23 CFR 630.205).
(c) STAs shall designate a VE Program Coordinator to promote and advance VE program activities and functions. The VE Coordinator's responsibilities should include establishing and maintaining the STA's VE policies and procedures; facilitating VE training; ensuring VE analyses are conducted on applicable projects; monitoring, assessing, and reporting on the VE analyses conducted and VE program; participating in periodic VE program and project reviews; submitting the required annual VE report to the FHWA; and supporting the other elements of the VE program.
§ 627.9
Conducting a VE analysis.
(a) A VE analysis should be conducted as early as practicable in the planning or development of a project, preferably before the completion of the project's preliminary design. At a minimum, the VE analysis shall be conducted prior to completing the project's final design.
(b) The VE analysis should be closely coordinated with other project development activities to minimize the impact approved recommendations might have on previous agency, community, or environmental commitments; the project's scope or schedule; and the use of innovative technologies, materials, methods, plans or construction provisions.
(c) When the STA or local public agency chooses to conduct a VE analysis for a project utilizing the design-build project delivery method, the VE analysis should be performed prior to the release of the final Request for Proposals or other applicable solicitation documents.
(d) For projects delivered using the CM/GC contracting method, a VE analysis is not required prior to the preparation and release of the RFP for the CM/GC contract. The VE analysis is required to be completed and approved recommendations incorporated into the project plans prior to requesting a construction price proposal from the CM/GC contractor.
(e) STAs shall ensure the VE analysis meets the following requirements:
(1) Uses a multidisciplinary team not directly involved in the planning or design of the project, with at least one individual who has training and experience with leading VE analyses;
(2) Develops and implements the VE Job Plan;
(3) Produces a formal written report outlining, at a minimum:
(i) Project information;
(ii) Identification of the VE analysis team;
(iii) Background and supporting documentation, such as information obtained from other analyses conducted on the project (e.g., environmental, safety, traffic operations, constructability);
(iv) Documentation of the stages of the VE Job Plan which would include documentation of the life-cycle costs that were analyzed;
(v) Summarization of the analysis conducted;
(vi) Documentation of the proposed recommendations and approvals received at the time the report is finalized; and
(vii) The formal written report shall be retained for at least 3 years after the completion of the project.
(f) For bridge projects, in addition to the requirements in subsection (e), the VE analyses shall:
(1) Include bridge substructure and superstructure requirements that consider alternative construction materials; and
(2) Be conducted based on:
(i) An engineering and economic assessment, taking into consideration acceptable designs for bridges; and
(ii) An analysis of life-cycle costs and duration of project construction.
(g) STAs and local public agencies may employ qualified consultants (as defined in 23 CFR 172.3) to conduct a VE analysis. The consultant shall possess training and experience with leading VE analyses. A consulting firm or individual shall not be used to conduct or support a VE analysis if they have a conflict of interest (as specified in 23 CFR 1.33).
(h) STAs, and local public agencies are encouraged to use a VECP clause (or other such clauses under a different
name) in an applicable project's contract, allowing the construction contractor to propose changes to the project's plans, specifications, or other contract documents. Whenever such clauses are used, the STA and local authority will consider changes that could improve the project's performance, value and quality, shorten the delivery time, or lower construction costs, while considering impacts on the project's overall life-cycle cost and other applicable factors. The basis for a STA or local authority to consider a VECP is the analysis and documentation supporting the proposed benefits that would result from implementing the proposed change in the project's contract or project plans.
(i) Proposals to accelerate construction after the award of the contract will not be considered a VECP and will not be eligible for Federal-aid highway program funding participation. Where it is necessary to accelerate construction, STAs and local public agencies are encouraged to use the appropriate incentive or disincentive clauses so that all proposers will take this into account when preparing their bids or price proposals.

# Subpart A—Project Authorization and Agreements

# Source:
66 FR 23847, May 10, 2001, unless otherwise noted.
§ 630.102
Purpose.
The purpose of this subpart is to prescribe policies for authorizing Federal-aid projects through execution of the project agreement required by 23 U.S.C. 106(a)(2).
§ 630.104
Applicability.
(a) This subpart is applicable to all Federal-aid projects unless specifically exempted.
(b) Other projects which involve special procedures are to be approved, or authorized as set out in the implementing instructions or regulations for those projects.
§ 630.106
Authorization to proceed.
(a)(1) The State Department of Transportation (State DOT) must obtain an authorization to proceed from the FHWA before beginning work on any Federal-aid project. The State DOT may request an authorization to proceed in writing or by electronic mail for a project or a group of projects.
(2) The FHWA will issue the authorization to proceed either through or after the execution of a formal project agreement with the State. The agreement can be executed only after applicable prerequisite requirements of Federal laws and implementing regulations and directives are satisfied. Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section, the FHWA will obligate Federal funds in the project or group of projects upon execution of the project agreement.
(3) The State's request that Federal funds be obligated shall be supported by a documented cost estimate that is based on the State's best estimate of costs.
(4) The State shall maintain a process to adjust project cost estimates. For example, the process would require a review of the project cost estimate when the bid is approved, a project phase is completed, a design change is approved, etc. Specifically, the State shall revise the Federal funds obligated within 90 days after it has determined that the estimated Federal share of project costs has decreased by $250,000 or more.
(5) The State shall review, on a quarterly basis, inactive projects (for the purposes of this subpart an “inactive project” means a project for which no expenditures have been charged against Federal funds for the past 12 months) with unexpended Federal obligations and shall revise the Federal funds obligated for a project within 90 days to reflect the current cost estimate, based on the following criteria:
(i) Projects inactive for the past 12 months with unexpended balances more than $500,000,
(ii) Projects inactive for the past 24 months with unexpended balances of $50,000 to $500,000, and
(iii) Projects inactive for the past 36 months with unexpended balances less than $50,000.
(6) If the State fails to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a)(3), (4), or (5) of this section, then the FHWA shall revise the obligations or take such other action as authorized by 23 CFR 1.36. The FHWA shall advise the State of its proposed actions and provide the State with the opportunity to respond before actions are taken. The FHWA shall not adjust obligations without a State's consent during the August redistribution process, August 1 to September 30.
(7) For design-build projects, the execution or modification of the project agreement for final design and physical construction, and authorization to proceed, shall not occur until after the completion of the NEPA process. However, preliminary design (as defined in 23 CFR 636.103) and preliminary engineering may be authorized in accordance with this section.
(8) For Construction Manager/General Contractor projects, the execution or modification of the project agreement for preconstruction services associated with final design and for construction services, and authorization to proceed with such services, shall not occur until after the completion of the NEPA process. However, preconstruction services associated with preliminary design may be authorized in accordance with this section.
(9) For Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity projects, the execution or modification of the project agreement for final design or physical construction, and authorization to proceed,
shall not occur until after the completion of the NEPA process.
(b) Federal funds shall not participate in costs incurred prior to the date of a project agreement except as provided by 23 CFR 1.9(b).
(c) The execution of the project agreement shall be deemed a contractual obligation of the Federal government under 23 U.S.C. 106 and shall require that appropriate funds be available at the time of authorization for the agreed Federal share, either pro rata or lump sum, of the cost of eligible work to be incurred by the State except as follows:
(1) Advance construction projects authorized under 23 U.S.C. 115.
(2) Projects for preliminary studies for the portion of the preliminary engineering and right-of-way (ROW) phase(s) through the selection of a location.
(3) Projects for ROW acquisition in hardship and protective buying situations through the selection of a particular location. This includes ROW acquisition within a potential highway corridor under consideration where necessary to preserve the corridor for future highway purposes. Authorization of work under this paragraph shall be in accord with the provisions of 23 CFR part 710.
(4) In special cases where the Federal Highway Administrator determines it to be in the best interest of the Federal-aid highway program.
(d) For projects authorized to proceed under paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section, the executed project agreement shall contain the following statement: “Authorization to proceed is not a commitment or obligation to provide Federal funds for that portion of the undertaking not fully funded herein.”
(e) For projects authorized under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, subsequent authorizations beyond the location stage shall not be given until appropriate available funds have been obligated to cover eligible costs of the work covered by the previous authorization.
(f)(1) The Federal-aid share of eligible project costs shall be established at the time the project agreement is executed in one of the following manners:
(i) Pro rata, with the agreement stating the Federal share as a specified percentage; or
(ii) Lump sum, with the agreement stating that Federal funds are limited to a specified dollar amount not to exceed the legal pro rata.
(2) The pro-rata or lump sum share may be adjusted before or shortly after contract award to reflect any substantive change in the bids received as compared to the State DOT's estimated cost of the project at the time of FHWA authorization, provided that Federal funds are available.
(3) Federal participation is limited to the agreed Federal share of eligible costs actually incurred by the State, not to exceed the maximum permitted by enabling legislation.
(g) The State may contribute more than the normal non-Federal share of title 23, U.S.C. projects. In general, financing proposals that result in only minimal amounts of Federal funds in projects should be avoided unless they are based on sound project management decisions.
(h)(1) Donations of cash, land, material or services may be credited to the State's non-Federal share of the participating project work in accordance with title 23, U.S.C., and implementing regulations.
(2) Contributions may not exceed the total costs incurred by the State on the project. Cash contributions from all sources plus the Federal funds may not exceed the total cost of the project.

# Subpart J—Work Zone Safety and Mobility

# Source:
89 FR 87293, Nov. 1, 2024, unless otherwise noted.
§ 630.1002
Purpose.
Work zones directly impact the safety and mobility of road users and highway workers. These safety and mobility impacts are exacerbated by an aging highway infrastructure and growing congestion in many locations. Addressing these safety and mobility issues requires considerations that start early in project development and continue through project completion. Part 6 of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (MUTCD) (incorporated by reference, see § 630.1018) sets forth basic principles and prescribes standards for the design, application, installation, and maintenance of traffic control devices for highway and street construction, maintenance operation, and utility work. In addition to the provisions in the MUTCD, there are other actions that could be taken to further help mitigate the safety and mobility impacts of work zones. This subpart establishes requirements and provides guidance for systematically addressing the safety and mobility impacts of work zones, and for developing strategies to help manage these impacts on Federal-aid highway projects.
§ 630.1004
Definitions and explanation of terms.
As used in this subpart:
Agency
means a State or local highway agency or authority that receives Federal-aid highway funding.
Highway workers
include, but are not limited to, personnel of the contractor, subcontractor, agency, utilities, and law enforcement, performing work within the right-of-way of a transportation facility.
Mobility
is the ability to move from place to place and is significantly dependent on the availability of transportation facilities and on system operating conditions. With specific reference to work zones, mobility pertains to moving road users efficiently through or around a work zone area with minimum delay compared to baseline travel when no work zone is present, while not compromising the safety of highway workers or road users. The commonly used performance measures for the assessment of mobility include delay, speed, travel time, and queue lengths.
Safety
is a representation of the level of exposure to potential hazards for users of transportation facilities and highway workers. With specific reference to work zones, safety refers to minimizing potential hazards to road users in the vicinity of a work zone and highway workers at the work zone interface with traffic. The commonly used performance measures for highway work zone safety are the number of crashes or the consequences of crashes (fatalities and injuries) at a given location or along a section of highway during a period of time. In terms of highway worker safety performance measures, the number of highway worker fatalities and injuries at a given location or along a section of highway during a period of time are commonly used measures.
State
refers to a State department of transportation.
Transportation management plan (TMP)
consists of strategies to manage the work zone impacts of a project. Its scope, content, and degree of detail may vary based upon the agency's work zone policy and the agency's understanding of the expected work zone impacts of the project. Refer to § 630.1010(d) and § 630.1012(b) for more information on a TMP and its components.
Work zone
is an area of a highway with construction, maintenance, or utility work activities. A work zone is typically marked by one or more of the following: signs, channelizing devices, barriers, pavement markings, or work vehicles. It extends from the first warning sign or high intensity rotating, flashing, oscillating, or strobe lights on a vehicle to the END ROAD WORK sign or the last temporary traffic control (TTC) device. See MUTCD, Part 6, “Temporary Traffic Control” (incorporated elsewhere in this subpart).
Work zone crash
is a crash that occurs in or related to a construction, maintenance, or utility work zone, whether or not workers were actually present at the time of the crash. “Work zone-related” crashes may also include crashes involving motor vehicles slowed or stopped because of the work zone, even if the first harmful event occurred before the first warning sign. See “Model Minimum Uniform Crash Criteria Guideline” (MMUCC), 5thEd. (Electronic), 2017, produced by NHTSA. Available at the following website:
https://www.nhtsa.gov/mmucc-1.
Work zone impacts
refer to work zone-induced deviations from the normal range of transportation system safety and mobility. The extent of the work zone impacts may vary based on factors such as: road classification and geometrics; area type (urban, suburban, and rural); traffic and travel characteristics (volumes, speeds, vehicle mix and classification, etc.); type of work being performed; type of temporary traffic control; distance between workers and traffic; availability of escape paths for workers; time of day/night; and complexity and duration of the project. These impacts may extend beyond the physical location of the work zone itself, including upstream or downstream of the work zone location, other highway corridors, other modes of transportation, and/or the regional transportation network.
Work zone programmatic review
is a data-driven, systematic, and holistic analysis that uses quantitative and qualitative data from different sources to assess the safety and mobility performance of work zones under a State's
jurisdiction in order to identify improvements to that agency's work zone processes and procedures.
§ 630.1006
Work zone safety and mobility policy.
(a) Each State shall implement a policy for the systematic consideration and management of work zone impacts on all Federal-aid highway projects. This policy shall address work zone impacts throughout the various stages of the project development and implementation process. This policy may take the form of processes, procedures, or guidance, and may vary based on the characteristics and expected work zone impacts of individual projects or classes of projects.
(b) At a minimum, the policy shall identify safety and mobility performance measures that will be used to manage work zone performance. Examples of such performance measures include number of fatal and injury crashes occurring in a work zone, percent of projects that exceed a preestablished crash rate in the work zone, number of highway worker fatalities and injuries experienced, highway worker fatality and injury rate per hours worked, percent of projects that experience queues above a predefined threshold, and percent of time when speeds in a work zone drop below a predefined threshold.
(c) The States should institute this policy using a multi-disciplinary team and in cooperation with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The States are encouraged to implement this policy for non-Federal-aid projects as well.
§ 630.1008
State-level processes and procedures.
(a)
General.
This section consists of State-level processes and procedures for States to implement and sustain their respective work zone safety and mobility policies. State-level processes and procedures, data and information resources, training, and periodic evaluation enable a systematic approach for addressing and managing the safety and mobility impacts of work zones.
(b)
Work zone assessment and management procedures.
States shall develop and implement systematic procedures to assess likely work zone impacts to all highway workers and anticipated road users in project development and to manage safety and mobility impacts occurring during project implementation. The scope of these procedures shall be based on the project characteristics.
(c)
Work zone data.
States shall use field observations, available work zone crash data, available safety surrogate data, available operational information, and available exposure data to monitor and manage work zone impacts for specific projects during implementation and to perform its work zone programmatic reviews. Examples of crash data include fatalities, injuries, and crashes; examples of safety surrogate data include speed differentials, hard braking, and other data from connected and autonomous vehicles; examples of available operational information include speeds, travel times, queue length, and duration; and examples of available exposure data include number of projects, number and length of lane closures, and vehicle-miles traveled through work zones.
(d)
Training.
States shall require that personnel involved in the development, design, implementation, operation, inspection, and enforcement of work-zone-related transportation management and traffic control be trained, appropriate to the job decisions each individual is required to make. States shall require periodic training updates that reflect changing industry practices and State processes and procedures.
(e)
Work zone programmatic review.
In order to assess the effectiveness of work zone safety and mobility processes and procedures, States shall perform a work zone programmatic review every 5 years and share that review with FHWA by the end of the 5-year review period.
(1) The work zone programmatic review shall include a data-driven assessment of the safety and mobility performance of the State's work zones. At a minimum, this review shall include a representative sample of the State's significant work zones over the 5-year period being reviewed. The approach used for selecting the representative projects shall be documented and should be based on factors such as land
use (urban and rural locations), roadway type, type of work zone, and extent of the work zone impacts.
(2) Each programmatic review shall include an assessment of the work zone safety and mobility performance occurring since the last review was performed, systematic identification and assessment of the States' work zone management processes and procedures to be improved, action items to be taken to achieve improvement, State divisions or offices responsible for implementing the actions, and estimated timeline for implementation.
(3) States shall use available crash data, available safety surrogate data, available operational data, and the performance measures specified in their work zone policy to conduct the assessment. Section 630.1008(c) provides example performance measures for each data source listed in this section. To ensure assessment of the safety and mobility performance of their work zones on a continuous basis, States shall monitor performance annually.
(4) The work zone programmatic review shall include examination of efforts across State divisions or offices affecting work zone safety and mobility management, including but not limited to: project planning, project design, project implementation, maintenance activities, transportation operations and management, permitting (
e.g.,
utilities, oversize/overweight, lane closures, sidewalk closures), training, and public information and outreach.
(5) Appropriate personnel who represent the project development and implementation stages and the different offices within the State and FHWA should participate in this review. Other non-State stakeholders may also be included in this review, as appropriate.
§ 630.1010
Significant projects.
(a) A significant project is one that, alone or in combination with other concurrent projects nearby, is anticipated to cause sustained work zone impacts (as defined in § 630.1004) that are greater than what is considered tolerable based on State policy and engineering judgment.
(b) The applicability of the provisions in §§ 630.1012(b)(2) and 630.1012(b)(3) is dependent upon whether a project is determined to be significant. The State shall identify upcoming projects that are expected to be significant. This identification of significant projects should be done as early as possible in the project delivery and development process, and in cooperation with FHWA. The State's work zone policy provisions, the project's characteristics, and the magnitude and extent of the anticipated work zone impacts should be considered when determining if a project is significant or not.
(c) All Interstate system projects within the boundaries of a designated Transportation Management Area that require intermittent or continuous lane closures for 3 or more consecutive days shall be considered as significant projects.
(d) For an Interstate system project or categories of Interstate system projects that are classified as significant through the application of the provisions in paragraph (c) of this section but in the judgment of the State do not cause sustained work zone impacts, the State may request from FHWA an exception to §§ 630.1012(b)(2) and 630.1012(b)(3). The FHWA may grant exceptions to these provisions based on the State's ability to show that the specific Interstate system project or categories of Interstate system projects do not have sustained work zone impacts.
(e) Non-interstate system projects with less than 3 consecutive days of intermittent or continuous lane closures do not require the transportation operations (TO) or public information and outreach (PIO) components of a TMP (as described in § 630.1012(b)).
§ 630.1012
Project-level procedures.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides guidance and establishes procedures for States to manage the work zone impacts of individual projects.
(b)
Transportation Management Plan.
For significant projects (as described in § 630.1010), the State shall develop a TMP that consists of a TTC plan and addresses both TO and PIO components. For individual projects or classes of projects that the State determines to have less than significant
work zone impacts, the TMP may consist only of a TTC plan. States are encouraged to consider TO and PIO issues for all projects.
(1) A TTC plan describes TTC measures to be used for facilitating road users through a work zone or an incident area. The TTC plan shall be consistent with the provisions under Part 6 of the MUTCD (incorporated by reference, see § 630.1018). In developing and implementing the TTC plan, pre-existing roadside safety hardware shall be maintained at an equivalent or better level than existed prior to project implementation. The scope of the TTC plan is determined by the project characteristics and the traffic safety and control requirements identified by the State for that project. The TTC plan shall either be a reference to specific TTC elements in the MUTCD, approved standard TTC plans, State transportation department TTC manual, or be designed specifically for the project.
(2) The TO component of the TMP shall include the identification of strategies that the State will use to mitigate impacts of the work zone on the operation and management of the transportation system within the work zone impact area. Typical TO strategies may include, but are not limited to, demand management, corridor/network management, safety management and enforcement, and work zone traffic management. The scope of the TO component should be determined by the project characteristics and the transportation operations and safety strategies identified by the State.
(3) The PIO component of the TMP shall include communications strategies that seek to inform affected road users, the general public, area residences and businesses, and appropriate public entities about the project, the expected work zone impacts, and the changing conditions on the project. This may include traveler information strategies. The scope of the PIO component should be determined by the project characteristics and the public information and outreach strategies identified by the State. Public information and outreach should be provided through methods best suited for the project, and may include, but not be limited to, information on the project characteristics, expected impacts, closure details, and commuter alternatives.
(4) States should develop and implement the TMP in sustained consultation with stakeholders (
e.g.,
other transportation agencies, railroad agencies/operators, transit providers, freight movers, utility suppliers, police, fire, emergency medical services, schools, business communities, and regional transportation management centers).
(c)
Inclusion of TMP in Plans, Specification, and Estimates.
The Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS
E) shall include either a TMP or provisions for contractors to develop a TMP at the most appropriate project phase as applicable to the State's chosen contracting methodology for the project. A contractor-developed TMP shall be subject to the approval of the State and shall not be implemented before it is approved by the State.
(d)
Inclusion of Pay Item Provisions in Plans, Specification, and Estimates.
The PS
Es shall include appropriate pay item provisions for implementing the TMP, either through method- or performance-based specifications.
(e)
Responsible persons.
The State and the contractor shall each designate a trained person, as specified in § 630.1008(d), at the project level who has the primary responsibility and sufficient authority for implementing the TMP and other safety and mobility aspects of the project.
§ 630.1014
Implementation.
Each State shall work in cooperation with FHWA in the implementation of its policies and procedures to improve work zone safety and mobility. At a minimum, this shall involve an FHWA review of conformance of the State's policies and procedures with this regulation and reassessment of the State's implementation of its procedures at appropriate intervals. Each State is encouraged to address implementation of this regulation in its stewardship agreement with FHWA.
§ 630.1016
Compliance date.
States shall comply with all the provisions of this rule no later than December 31, 2026. The next work zone
programmatic review will be due December 31, 2030. For projects that are in the later stages of development at or about the compliance date, and if it is determined that the delivery of those projects would be significantly impacted as a result of this rule's provisions, States may request variances for those projects from FHWA on a project-by-project basis.

are not regulatory, and use of them is voluntary and not required by law.
§ 630.1106
Policy and procedures for work zone safety management.
(a) Each agency's policy and processes, procedures, or guidance for the systematic consideration and management of work zone impacts, to be established in accordance with § 630.1006, shall include the consideration and management of road user and worker safety on Federal-aid highway projects. These processes, procedures, or guidance, to be developed in cooperation with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), shall address the use of Positive Protection Devices to prevent the intrusion of motorized traffic into the work space and other potentially hazardous areas in the work zone; Exposure Control Measures to avoid or minimize worker exposure to motorized traffic and road user exposure to work activities; Other Traffic Control Measures including uniformed law enforcement officers to minimize work zone crashes; and the safe entry/exit of work vehicles onto/from the travel lanes. Each of these strategies should be used to the extent that they are possible, practical, and adequate to manage work zone exposure and reduce the risks of crashes resulting in fatalities or injuries to workers and road users.
(b) Agency processes, procedures, or guidance should be based on consideration of standards or guidance contained in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (MUTCD), as well as project characteristics and factors. The strategies and devices to be used may be determined by a project-specific engineering study or determined from agency guidelines developed from an engineering study that indicate when positive protection devices or other strategies and approaches are to be used based on project and highway characteristics and factors. An engineer, or an individual working under the supervision of an engineer shall perform an engineering study through the application of procedures and criteria established by the engineer. The person conducting the engineering study shall document such study. Benefit-cost analyses, decision matrices, decision tree analysis, or other appropriate engineering decision-making tools may be used in the engineering study. The types of measures and strategies to be used are not mutually exclusive, and should be considered in combination as appropriate based on characteristics and factors such as those listed below:
(1) Project scope and duration;
(2) Anticipated operating conditions including traffic volume, vehicle mix, and speeds through the work zone;
(3) Anticipated traffic safety impacts;
(4) Type of work (as related to worker exposure and crash risks);
(5) Distance between traffic and workers, and extent of worker exposure;
(6) Escape paths available for workers to avoid a vehicle intrusion into the work space;
(7) Time of day (
e.g.,
night work);
(8) Work area restrictions (including impact on worker exposure);
(9) Consequences from/to road users resulting from roadway departure;
(10) Potential hazard to workers and road users presented by device itself and during device placement and removal;
(11) Geometrics that may increase crash risks (
e.g.,
poor sight distance, sharp curves);
(12) Access to/from work space;
(13) Roadway classification; and
(14) Impacts on project cost and duration.
(c) Each agency, in partnership with FHWA, shall develop a policy addressing the use of uniformed law enforcement on Federal-aid highway projects. The policy may consist of processes, procedures, and/or guidance. The processes, procedures, or guidance should address the following:
(1) Basic interagency agreements between the highway agency and appropriate law enforcement agencies to address work zone enforcement needs;
(2) Interaction between highway and law-enforcement agencies during project planning and development;
(3) Conditions where law enforcement involvement in work zone traffic control may be needed or beneficial, and criteria to determine the project-specific need for law enforcement;
(4) General nature of law enforcement services to be provided, and procedures to determine project-specific services;
(5) Appropriate work zone safety and mobility training for the officers, consistent with the training requirements in § 630.1008(d);
(6) Procedures for interagency and project-level communications between highway agency and law enforcement personnel; and
(7) Reimbursement agreements for law enforcement service.
§ 630.1108
Work zone safety management measures and strategies.
(a)
Positive protection devices.
At a minimum, agencies shall use positive protection devices in work zones with high anticipated operating speeds that provide workers no means of escape from motorized traffic intruding into the workspace unless an engineering study determines otherwise. Positive protection devices shall be considered in other situations that place workers at increased risk from motorized traffic, and where positive protection devices offer the highest potential for increased safety for workers and road users such as:
(1) Work zones that provide workers no means of escape from motorized traffic (
e.g.,
tunnels, bridges, etc.);
(2) Long-duration work zones (
e.g.,
two weeks or more) resulting in substantial worker exposure to motorized traffic;
(3) Projects with high anticipated operating speeds (
e.g.,
45 mph or greater), especially when combined with high traffic volumes;
(4) Work operations that place workers close (
e.g.,
within one lane width) to travel lanes open to traffic; and
(5) Roadside hazards, such as drop-offs or unfinished bridge decks, that will remain in place overnight or longer.
(b)
Exposure control measures.
Exposure control measures should be considered where appropriate to avoid or minimize worker exposure to motorized traffic and exposure of road users to work activities, while also providing adequate consideration to the potential impacts on mobility. A wide range of measures may be appropriate for use on individual projects, such as:
(1) Full road closures;
(2) Ramp closures;
(3) Median crossovers;
(4) Full or partial detours or diversions;
(5) Protection of work zone setup and removal operations using rolling road blocks;
(6) Performing work at night or during off-peak periods when traffic volumes are lower; and
(7) Accelerated construction techniques.
(c)
Other traffic control measures.
Other traffic control measures should be given appropriate consideration for use in work zones to reduce work zone crashes and risks and consequences of motorized traffic intrusion into the work space. These measures, which are not mutually exclusive and should be considered in combination as appropriate, include a wide range of other traffic control measures such as:
(1) Effective, credible signing;
(2) Changeable message signs;
(3) Arrow panels;
(4) Warning flags and lights on signs;
(5) Longitudinal and lateral buffer space;
(6) Trained flaggers and spotters;
(7) Enhanced flagger station setups or use of automated flagger assistance devices (AFADs);
(8) Intrusion alarms;
(9) Rumble strips;
(10) Pace or pilot vehicle;
(11) High-quality work zone pavement markings and removal of misleading markings;
(12) Channelizing device spacing reduction;
(13) Longitudinal channelizing barricades;
(14) Work zone speed management (including changes to the regulatory speed or variable speed limits);
(15) Law enforcement;
(16) Speed Safety Cameras (where permitted by State/local laws):
(17) Drone radar;
(18) Worker and work vehicle/equipment visibility;
(19) Worker training;
(20) Public information and traveler information;
(21) Temporary traffic signals.
(22) Protection or shadow vehicles used to protect workers and equipment from impacts by errant vehicles; and
(23) Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and other advanced technology solutions and strategies.
(d)
Uniformed law enforcement officers.
(1) A number of conditions may indicate the need for or benefit of uniformed law enforcement in work zones. The presence of a uniformed law enforcement officer and marked law enforcement vehicle in view of motorized traffic on a highway project can affect driver behavior, helping to maintain appropriate speeds and improve driver alertness through the work zone. However, such law enforcement presence is not a substitute for the temporary traffic control devices required by Part 6 of the MUTCD. In general, the need for law enforcement is greatest on projects with high traffic speeds and volumes, and where the work zone is expected to result in substantial disruption to or changes in normal traffic flow patterns. Specific project conditions should be examined to determine the need for or potential benefit of law enforcement, such as the following:
(i) Frequent worker presence adjacent to high-speed traffic without positive protection devices;
(ii) Traffic control setup or removal that presents significant risks to workers and road users;
(iii) Complex or very short-term changes in traffic patterns with significant potential for road user confusion or worker risk from traffic exposure;
(iv) Night work operations that create substantial traffic safety risks for workers and road users;
(v) Existing traffic conditions and crash histories that indicate a potential for substantial safety and congestion impacts related to the work zone activity, and that may be mitigated by improved driver behavior and awareness of the work zone;
(vi) Work zone operations that require brief stoppage of all traffic in one or both directions;
(vii) High-speed roadways where unexpected or sudden traffic queuing is anticipated, especially if the queue forms a considerable distance in advance of the work zone or immediately adjacent to the work space; and
(viii) Other work site conditions where traffic presents a high risk for workers and road users, such that the risk may be reduced by improving road user behavior and awareness.
(2) Costs associated with the provision of uniformed law enforcement to help protect workers and road users, and to maintain safe and efficient travel through highway work zones, are eligible for Federal-aid participation. Federal-aid eligibility excludes law enforcement activities that would normally be expected in and around highway problem areas requiring routine or ongoing law enforcement traffic control and enforcement activities. Payment for the services of uniformed law enforcement in work zones may be included in the construction contract, or be provided by direct reimbursement from the highway agency to the law enforcement agency. When payment is included through the construction contract, the contractor will be responsible for reimbursing the law enforcement agency, and in turn will recover those costs through contract pay items. Direct interagency reimbursement may be made on a project-specific basis, or on a programwide basis that considers the overall level of services to be provided by the law enforcement agency. Contract pay items for law enforcement service may be either unit price or lump sum items. Unit price items should be utilized when the highway agency can estimate and control the quantity of law enforcement services required on the project. The use of lump sum payment should be limited to situations where the quantity of services is directly affected by the contractor's choice of project scheduling and chosen manner of staging and performing the work. Innovative payment items may also be considered when they offer an advantage to both the highway agency and the contractor. When reimbursement to the law enforcement agency is made by interagency transfer of funds, the highway agency should establish a program-level or project-level budget that is adequate to meet anticipated program or project needs, and include provisions to address unplanned needs and other contingencies.
(e)
Work vehicles and equipment.
In addition to addressing risks to workers and road users from motorized traffic, the agency processes, procedures, and guidance established in accordance with § 630.1006 should also address safe means for work vehicles and equipment to enter and exit traffic lanes and for delivery of construction materials to the workspace, based on individual project characteristics and factors.
(f)
Payment for traffic control.
Consistent with the requirements of § 630.1012, Project-level Procedures, project plans, specifications and estimates (PS
Es) shall include appropriate pay item provisions for implementing the project Transportation Management Plan (TMP), which includes a Temporary Traffic Control (TTC) plan, either through method- or performance-based specifications. Pay item provisions include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) Payment for work zone traffic control features and operations shall not be incidental to the contract, or included in payment for other items of work not related to traffic control and safety;
(2) As a minimum, separate pay items shall be provided for major categories of traffic control devices, safety features, and work zone safety activities, including but not limited to positive protection devices, and uniformed law enforcement activities when funded through the project;
(3) For method-based specifications, the specifications and other PS
E documents should provide sufficient details such that the quantity and types of devices and the overall effort required to implement and maintain the TMP can be determined;
(4) For method-based specifications, unit price pay items, lump sum pay items, or a combination thereof may be used;
(5) Lump sum payment should be limited to items for which an estimate of the actual quantity required is provided in the PS
E or for items where the actual quantity required is dependent upon the contractor's choice of work scheduling and methodology;
(6) For Lump Sum items, a contingency provision should be included such that additional payment is provided if the quantity or nature of the required work changes, either an increase or decrease, due to circumstances beyond the control of the contractor;
(7) Unit price payment should be provided for those items over which the contractor has little or no control over the quantity, and no firm estimate of quantities is provided in the PS
Es, but over which the highway agency has control of the actual quantity to be required during the project;
(8) Specifications should clearly indicate how placement, movement/relocation, and maintenance of traffic control devices and safety features will be compensated; and
(9) The specifications should include provisions to require and enforce contractor compliance with the contract provisions relative to implementation and maintenance of the project TMP and related traffic control items. Enforcement provisions may include remedies such as liquidated damages, work suspensions, or withholding payment for noncompliance.
§ 630.1110
Maintenance of temporary traffic control devices.
To provide for the continued effectiveness of temporary traffic control devices, each agency shall develop and implement quality guidelines to help maintain the quality and adequacy of the temporary traffic control devices for the duration of the project. Agencies may choose to adopt existing quality guidelines such as those developed by the American Traffic Safety Services Association (ATSSA) or other state highway agencies.
1
A level of inspection necessary to provide ongoing compliance with the quality guidelines shall be provided.
1
ATSSA's Quality Guidelines for Temporary Traffic Control Devices and Features uses photos and written descriptions to help judge when a traffic control device has outlived its usefulness. These guidelines are available for purchase from ATSSA through the following URL:
https://www.atssa.com/resource/quality-guidelines/.
Similar guidelines are available from various State highway agencies.
§ 630.1112
Compliance date.
States shall update their policy no later than December 31, 2025, and implement the policy no later than December 31, 2026. For projects that are in the later stages of development at or about the compliance date, and if it is determined that the delivery of those projects would be significantly impacted as a result of this rule's provisions, States may request variances for those projects from FHWA on a project-by-project basis.

b. For the reasonable needs of the contractor to employ supervisory or specially experienced personnel necessary to assure an efficient execution of the contract work.
c. For the obligation of the contractor to offer employment to present or former employees as the result of a lawful collective bargaining contract, provided that the number of nonresident persons employed under this subparagraph 1c shall not exceed 20 percent of the total number of employees employed by the contractor on the contract work, except as provided in subparagraph 4 below.

Such action shall include, but not be limited to the following: Employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoffs or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection of training, including apprenticeship. The contractor agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices to be provided by the State highway department setting forth the provisions of this nondiscrimination clause.

f. In the event of the contractor's noncompliance with the nondiscrimination clauses of this contract or with any of the said rules, regulations or orders, this contract may be canceled, terminated or suspended in whole or in part and the contractor may be declared ineligible for further Government contracts or federally-assisted construction contracts in accordance with procedures authorized in Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and such other sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked as provided in Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, or by rule, regulation or order of the Secretary of Labor, or as otherwise provided by law.
g. The contractor will include the provisions of this section III in every subcontract or purchase order unless exempted by rules, regulations or orders of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to section 204 of Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor. The contractor will take such action with respect to any subcontract or purchase order as the State Highway Department or the Federal Highway Administration may direct as a means of enforcing such provisions including sanctions for noncompliance:
Provided, however,
That in the event a contractor becomes involved in, or is threatened with litigation with a subcontractor or vendor as a result of such direction by the Federal Highway Administration, the contractor may request the United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.

The contractor shall provide all information and reports required by the Regulations, or directives issued pursuant thereto, and shall permit access to its books, records, accounts, other sources of information, and its facilities as may be determined by the State highway department or the Federal Highway Administration to be pertinent to ascertain compliance with such Regulations, orders and instructions. Where any information required of a contractor is in the exclusive possession of another who fails or refuses to furnish this information, the contractor shall so certify to the State highway department, or the Federal Highway Administration, as appropriate, and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information.
5.
Sanctions for noncompliance.
In the event of the contractor's noncompliance with the nondiscrimination provisions of this contract, the State highway department shall impose such contract sanctions as it or the Federal Highway Administration may determine to be appropriate, including, but not limited to:

The contractor shall take such action with respect to any subcontract or procurement, as the State highway department or the Federal Highway Administration may direct as a means of enforcing such provisions including sanctions for noncompliance:
Provided, however,
That, in the event a contractor becomes involved in, or is threatened with, litigation with a subcontractor or supplier, as a result of such direction, the contractor may request the State to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the State, and, in addition, the contractor may request the United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.
V.
Nonsegregated facilities.
(Applicable to Federal-aid construction contracts and related subcontracts exceeding $10,000 which are not exempt from the Equal Opportunity clause.)
By submission of this bid, the execution of this contract or subcontract, or the consummation of this material supply agreement, as appropriate, the bidder, Federal-aid construction contractor, subcontractor, or material supplier, as appropriate, certifies that he does not maintain or provide for his employees any segregated facilities at any of his establishments, and that he does not permit his employees to perform their services at any location, under his control, where segregated facilities are maintained. He certifies further that he will not maintain or provide for his employees any segregated facilities at any of his establishments, and that he will not permit his employees to perform their services at any location, under his control, where segregated facilities are maintained. He agrees that a breach of this certification is a violation of the Equal Opportunity clause in this contract. As used in this certification, the term
segregated facilities
means any waiting rooms, work areas, restrooms and washrooms, restaurants and other eating areas, timeclocks, locker rooms and other storage or dressing areas, parking lots, drinking fountains, recreation or entertainment areas, transportation, and housing facilities provided for employees which are segregated by explicit directive or are in fact segregated on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin, because of habit, local custom, or otherwise. He agrees that (except where he has obtained identical certifications from proposed subcontractors and material suppliers for specific time periods), he will obtain identical certifications from proposed subcontractors or material suppliers prior to the award of subcontracts or the consummation of material supply agreements, exceeding $10,000 which are not exempt from the provisions of the Equal Opportunity clause, and that he will retain such certification in his files.
VI.
Payment of predetermined minimum wages.
1.
General.
All mechanics and laborers employed or working upon the site of the work will be paid unconditionally and not less than once a week, and without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account, except such payroll deductions as are permitted by regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor under the Copeland Act (29 CFR part 3), the full amounts due at time of payment computed at wage rates not less than those contained in the wage determination decision of the Secretary of Labor which is attached hereto and made a part thereof, regardless of any contractual relationship which may be alleged to exist between the contractor and such laborers and mechanics; and the wage determination decision shall be posted by the contractor at the site of the work in a prominent place where it can be easily seen by the workers. For the purpose of this clause, contributions made or costs reasonably anticipated under section 1(b)(2) of the Davis-Bacon Act on behalf of laborers or mechanics are considered wages paid to such laborers or mechanics, subject to the provisions of section VI, paragraph 3b, hereof. Also for the purpose of this clause, regular contributions made or costs incurred for more than a weekly period under plans, funds, or programs, but covering the particular weekly period, are deemed to be constructively made or incurred during such weekly period.
2.
Classifications
—a. The State highway department contracting officer shall require that any class of laborers or mechanics which is not listed in the wage determination and which is to be employed under the contract, shall be classified or reclassified conformably to the wage determination, and a report of the action taken shall be sent by the State highway department contracting officer to the Secretary of Labor.
b. In the event the interested parties cannot agree on the proper classification or reclassification of a particular class of laborers and mechanics to be used, the question accompanied by the recommendation of the State highway department contracting officer shall be referred to the Secretary for final determination.
3.
Payment of fringe benefits
—a. The State highway department contracting officer shall require, whenever the minimum wage rate prescribed in the contract for a class of
laborers or mechanics includes a fringe benefit which is not expressed as an hourly wage rate and the contractor is obligated to pay a cash equivalent of such a fringe benefit, an hourly cash equivalent thereof to be established. In the event the interested parties cannot agree upon a cash equivalent of the fringe benefits, the question, accompanied by the recommendation of the contracting officer, shall be referred to the Secretary of Labor for determination.
b. If the contractor does not make payments to a trustee or other third person, he may consider as part of the wage of any laborer or mechanic the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing benefits under a plan or program of a type expressly listed in the wage determination decision of the Secretary of Labor which is part of this contract:
Provided, however,
The Secretary of Labor has found, upon the written request of the contractor, that the applicable standards of the Davis-Bacon Act have been met. The Secretary of Labor may require the contractor to set aside in a separate account assets for the meeting of obligations under the plan or program.
4.
Payment of excess wages.
While the wage rates shown are the minimum rates required by the contract to be paid during its life, this is not a representation that labor can be obtained at these rates. No increase in the contract price shall be allowed or authorized on account of the payment of wage rates in excess of those listed herein.
5.
Apprentices and trainees (Programs of Department of Labor).
a. Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they performed when they are employed and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with the U.S. Department of Labor, Manpower Administration, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, or with a State Apprenticeship Agency recognized by the Bureau, or if a person is employed in his first 90 days of probationary employment as an apprentice in such an apprenticeship program, who is not individually registered in the program, but who has been certified by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training or a State Apprenticeship Agency (where appropriate) to be eligible for probationary employment as an apprentice. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program. Any employee listed on a payroll at an apprentice wage rate, who is not a trainee as defined in 29 CFR 5.2(c)(2) or is not registered or otherwise employed as stated above, shall be paid the wage rate determined by the Secretary of Labor for the classification of work he actually performed. The contractor or subcontractor will be required to furnish to the State highway department or to a representative of the Wage-Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor written evidence of the registration of his program and apprentices as well as the appropriate ratios and wage rates (expressed in percentages of the journeyman hourly rates), for the area of construction prior to using any apprentices on the contract work. The wage rate paid apprentices shall be not less than the appropriate percentage of the journeyman's rate contained in the applicable wage determination.
b. Trainees, except as provided in 29 CFR 5.15, will not be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work performed unless they are employed pursuant to and individually registered in a program which has received prior approval, evidenced by formal certification, by the U.S. Department of Labor, Manpower Administration, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training. The ratio of trainees to journeymen shall not be greater than permitted under the plan approved by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training. Every trainee must be paid at not less than the rate specified in the approved program for his level of progress. Any employee listed on the payroll at a trainee rate who is not registered and participating in a training plan approved by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training shall be paid not less than the wage rate determined by the Secretary of Labor for the classification of work he actually performed. The contractor or subcontractor will be required to furnish the State highway department or a representative of the Wage-Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor written evidence of the certification of his program, the registration of the trainees, and the ratios and wage rates prescribed in that program. In the event the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training withdraws approval of a training program, the contractor will no longer be permitted to utilize trainees at less than the applicable predetermined rate for the work performed until an acceptable program is approved.
c. The utilization of apprentices, trainees and journeymen shall be in conformity with the equal employment opportunity requirements of Executive Order 11246, as amended, and 29 CFR part 30.
6.
Apprentices and trainees (Programs of Department of Transportation).
Apprentices and trainees working under apprenticeship and skill training programs which have been certified by the Secretary of Transportation as promoting equal opportunity in connection with Federal-aid highway construction programs are not subject to the requirements of section VI, paragraph 5 above. The straight time hourly wage rates for apprentices and trainees under such programs will be established by the particular programs.
7.
Withholding for unpaid wages.
The State highway department contracting officer may
withhold or cause to be withheld from the contractor so much of the accrued payments or advances as may be considered necessary to pay laborers, mechanics, (including apprentices and trainees) watchmen, or guards employed by the contractor or any subcontractor on the work the full amount of wages required by the contract. In the event of failure to pay any laborer, mechanic, (including apprentices and trainees) watchman or guard employed or working on the site of the work, all or part of the wages required by the contract, the State highway department contracting officer may, after written notice to the contractor, take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of any further payment, advance, or guarantee of funds until such violations have ceased.
8.
Overtime requirements.
a. No contractor or subcontractor contracting for any part of the contract work which may require or involve the employment of laborers, mechanics, watchmen or guards (including apprentices and trainees described in paragraphs 5 and 6 above) shall require or permit any laborer, mechanic, watchman or guard in any workweek in which he is employed on such work, to work in excess of eight hours in any calendar day or in excess of forty hours in such workweek unless such laborer, mechanic, watchman or guard receives compensation at a rate not less than one and one-half times his basic rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight hours in any calendar day or in excess of forty hours in such workweek, as the case may be.
